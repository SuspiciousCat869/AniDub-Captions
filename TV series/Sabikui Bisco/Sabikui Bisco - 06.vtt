We went as fast as we could,
but you somehow got ahead.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.662 position:50% align:center
I fixed up one of the choppers

stuck to that
hermit crab temple.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.500 position:50% align:center
Assuming they still
function, that is.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Hey, Milo!

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.424 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Good eye!
This one might be operational.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Which is awesome
since Kousuke's map

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
says it's on the right line.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Let's see. Place lever
in the designated position.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Next, you insert
the 300-yen fare,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
and then press red button?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Don't run cheap, huh?
Guess I got it.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
Hold up! "Yen fare"?

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
Who the hell carries old
coins on them anymore?

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:14.739 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] Ugh! I swear.
Get outta the way.

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
You two are so hard to
watch. It's painful.

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
Ah, okay. Just gotta move
this part right here is all.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.337 position:50% align:center
How'd a peddler come to learn
how old machines work?

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:31.965 position:50% align:center
'Cause I was a mechanic
at my old job.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
Seem like a pro. Did you work
for a big-name company or...?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] They were jerks
who worked me to the bone,

00:10:38.138 --> 00:10:41.349 position:50% align:center
but meh, the pay wasn't bad.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
Then one day, we got put
in charge of repairing

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:46.396 position:50% align:center
an excavated part of Tetsujin.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:50.483 position:50% align:center
By Matoba Manufacturing.
Wanted it fixed for some reason.

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.694 position:50% align:center
Still don't know if
it was the real deal.

00:10:52.777 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a buncha
bull, doesn't it?

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
But, nope, they were serious.

00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
And one by one, the Rust
killed off the workers

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
till I went from being the
lowest grease monkey

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
to running the whole shebang.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
Then I took a plane
and ran for my life.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
That was a long
time ago, though.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
Tch.It's hard for me to tweak
such a shoddy build,

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
so it might take a minute.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.143 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Smells good.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.854 position:50% align:center
Haven't had a relaxing
meal in a while.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
Couldn't be helped. Didn't
exactly have time to spare.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.862 position:50% align:center
The world beyond the city walls
used to be a mystery to me.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
I didn't know anything,
except the first gust of wind

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
could probably knock
me flat on my back.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
No worries, Doc.

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
Once this journey's over,

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
you can go right back
to your city life.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
[MILO] That's not why I
said that! Not even close.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50% align:center
It's been fun. And so pretty!

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Everything from the air
to the shrimp temple

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
has been amazing to experience.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
It's hard to describe, but it's
like I saw the power of life.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
Unlike Imihama, there were
no walls to block my view.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
No one to decide what I
could or couldn't see.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.440 position:50% align:center
While the city did
offer me protection,

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:15.819 position:50% align:center
the ones running it were
making those kids suffer.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
Stupid. You're way overthinking.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:23.743 position:50% align:center
You did all the good you were
capable of as a doctor there.

00:12:23.827 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
So stop focusing
on all the lives

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.996 position:50% align:center
that are out of your hands.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
Just think of the
people you've saved.

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
Even rescuing one old man
is a challenge for me.

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
Jabi, he's your mentor, right?

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Well, yes and no.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
Part mentor, part father.
But really... Jabi is just Jabi.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
He taught me all sorts of stuff.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
How to use a bow.
How to survive.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
He was as harsh as
sandpaper back in the day,

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
and I practically
died once or twice.

00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.570 position:50% align:center
Jabi was that strict?

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
You have no idea, Doc.

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
I've dreamed of getting stronger

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
and beating the complete snot
outta him more than a few times.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
Yep, he's definitely
a crazy old coot,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
but he's my crazy old coot.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
I wanna save him.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
I gotta.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
And we will.

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
We're gonna make it
in time, just watch.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're the Mushroom
Keepers' shining star.

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
And I know my meds.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
Together, you and
I can do anything.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
Ya got that right.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
Damn straight. We'll save 'em.
Jabi and your sis.

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] Sorry to interrupt
such a touching moment.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.746 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Oh. You're done?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Finished a while ago,

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
so I had a front row seat
to that conversation.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Um, thanks for
your help. Eat up.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
So, um, even though
I heard your story,

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
I still don't get why
you're risking your life.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
Simple. Because I love her.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50% align:center
I'm also kind of an idiot.
Or just naive.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Okay, let's be real, Panda Boy.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
You're both idiots.

00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Dryworm. A scorched shrike.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
Giant woodpecker.
Hmm... That's wrong, too.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
This field guide is
weird to the extreme.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
Like, were these drawn by a kid?

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Probably a Mushroom
Keeper's artwork.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
How can you tell?

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.934 position:50% align:center
It has a unique
style to it, right?

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
That's a Keeper's
signature touch.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.397 position:50% align:center
It's how Jabi draws, too.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.107 position:50% align:center
See any names of mushrooms?

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
Should say which
creatures they come from,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.695 position:50% align:center
like cloud ear or shimeji?

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.114 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Yeah. Boom.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
You're right. There's
one on every page!

00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
"Rust Eater."

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:17.375 position:50% align:center
Pipe snakes can produce
them! So it says.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:21.129 position:50% align:center
Common name is "tube worm."
Oh, wow! This thing can fly!

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
And it preys on planes
and helicopters!

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.091 position:50% align:center
Pretty nifty to know

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:27.969 position:50% align:center
since all Jabi said was it's
the biggest beast around.

00:15:28.053 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center
That book was a great find!

00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:30.930 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
Nice work! You really
got it running!

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
This is as far as I go.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:47.822 position:50% align:center
Though your journey sounds fun,
I've decided dying doesn't.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
I would thank you properly,

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
but I still don't
know your name.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
It's not that big a deal.

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you mine.
Milo Nekoyanagi.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
As for the scary one,
his name is Bisco.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:03.296 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for you,

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
this could've been the
end of the line for us.

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
Please, tell us your name.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:10.553 position:50% align:center
J-Jellyfish works fine.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
'Cause here's the thing,
I don't tell people my name.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.684 position:50% align:center
You'd laugh at it
like everyone else.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
I don't see Bisco
or I laughing.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.564 position:50% align:center
As you know, our names
are bizarre, too.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:31.866 position:50% align:center
Um, it's Tirol.
I'm Tirol Oochagama.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
Well, Tirol, thank you.
You seriously came in clutch.

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.832 position:50% align:center
Should've asked for
your name sooner

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
since there's a thread
of fate linking us all.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
See, now we know what to
write on your tombstone.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
"Here lies Jellyfish"
seemed a little informal.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] Oh, shut up!
You two'll die long before me!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
And just so you know,

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
I'm burying you
upside-down if I find you!

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Thank you, Tirol.
I'm truly glad we met.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.861 position:50% align:center
Good-bye! Though I know
we'll meet again!

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:10.864 position:50% align:center
Till then, we'll be talking
and thinking about you.

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
Wondering what our friend,
Tirol, is up to.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.534 position:50% align:center
I'm sure of it!

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
Wait, did he just
call me "friend"?

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
Bye for now! Stay safe!
And thanks again!

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:34.596 position:50% align:center
Uh. Akaboshi! Milo!

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
I--! I should--!

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Thank you, too.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Hmm...

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
Getting the "big prey"
to catch a pipe snake

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
might prove difficult.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.369 position:50% align:center
[MILO screams]

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.371 position:50% align:center
That's an oilsquid!

00:17:59.454 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Huh?!

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] We must've passed
through their nest.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Just aim for
the ones jumpin' at us!

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
Me, too? But I can't use a bow!

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
Bull crap!

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] You can hit them.
I know you can.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:20.350 position:50% align:center
So I'm trusting you to
watch my six, all right?

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
Bisco, I--

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.019 position:50% align:center
I said, "all right?"

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
Ready!

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
Nice shot, Doc.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
There's no end to them.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.248 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Drastic times.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.917 position:50% align:center
Means we can't go
back this way, but--

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
What is this?

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.468 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Silver acid nameko.

00:18:55.552 --> 00:18:58.638 position:50% align:center
Don't inhale too much.
And get down!

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
We did it. They're not
chasing us anymore!

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
[BISCO coughing]

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.315 position:50% align:center
That stench gets me every time.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.651 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
Plan C?

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
Shit! Looks like we
found their boss.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
The exit... It's too far.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Actagawa! Go and rip
the engine out! Hurry!

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.935 position:50% align:center
Cram it down that thing's mouth!

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.576 position:50% align:center
Now if I shoot through that...

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
There're two rules.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
Rule one: Keep the target
in your sights.

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
Rule two: Just believe.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
[BISCO retches]

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco, we made it.

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah. Weeping Child Ravine.

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful.
But it feels lonely.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
Uh! Look! Mushrooms!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
Then, this blue smoke is--

00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:56.798 position:50% align:center
That'd be spores.

00:20:56.881 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
Fifteen years ago, Keepers
came for the rare shroom

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
and left those.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
Uh! Duck!

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
That's not a duck.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:17.777 position:50% align:center
That's it! The pipe snake!

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
The guide was misleading.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:23.825 position:50% align:center
It's too big to be a snake.
It's more like a dragon!

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.830 position:50% align:center
[BISCO yelling]

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
We'll target it from both sides!

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Stop being so reckless!

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
Actagawa!

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
Damn. So what now?

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:51.102 position:50% align:center
[engine roaring]

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
I finally found you!

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.358 position:50% align:center
She couldn't have timed
this worse if she tried to.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
Pawoo?

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:01.946 position:50% align:center
Retribution shall be swift!

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Obtaining the sacred Rust Eater

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:36.708 position:50% align:center
is what every Mushroom
Keeper hopes to do,

00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.376 position:50% align:center
and most are quite capable.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.129 position:50% align:center
But the true enemy
is people, Bisco.

00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:43.423 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"The Stolen Rust Eater."

00:23:43.506 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
So they go through all that
just to have it stolen?
