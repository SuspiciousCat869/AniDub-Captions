[ALL chuckling]

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.263 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:19.931 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Whoa, easy!

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:23.018 position:50% align:center
Don't get up. I just finished
wrapping your bandages.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.894 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Where are you? Uh.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.403 position:50% align:center
Why can't I see?

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:37.282 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Hey, don't worry.
I'm right here.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.496 position:50% align:center
Hey, this isn't somethin'
to get all shaky over.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.416 position:50% align:center
You'll be better once
the medicine kicks in.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center
What medicine? Like a shot?

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:54.215 position:50% align:center
Like a stolen Rust Eater.
I swiped some from Kurokawa.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
You turned it into a cure?

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.470 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Those instructions
you wrote down

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
made it pretty straightforward.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.726 position:50% align:center
Funny, since you usually don't
give my notes a second look.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Careful with the smart
remarks or I'll toss it.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.314 position:50% align:center
Don't move.

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.858 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Wait, what about you?

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
Stop. Treat yourself first.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] I already did.
You worry too much, Doc.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Really?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.796 position:50% align:center
You gonna keep your hand
there till morning?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
Now relax.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Are you mad?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:44.641 position:50% align:center
I played by my own rules
and made you lose like that.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Nah, I'm not mad.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You're not?

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.482 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] If our roles had been
reversed, I'd've done the same.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:55.860 position:50% align:center
Besides, it was more of a
draw since we both lived,

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
so I didn't lose.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I wonder what happened to Jabi.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] That geezer's
got the devil's luck.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he got away.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center
[MILO] He said he managed
to save Pawoo, too.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Yeah. Your big sis is
a force to be reckoned with.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
No one can touch her with a
ten-foot pole if she's got hers.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
That's true.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Speaking of Pawoo,
do you wanna date her?

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure
she likes you, too.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
You've got a real shot,
if you play your cards right.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
What're you, stupid?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
She's been trying to
kill me since we met!

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.570 position:50% align:center
You can't deny she's gorgeous.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
She's smart. And of course,
she's in great shape!

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Bet every ounce of it's muscle.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50% align:center
No warrior princess
for me, thanks.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
[MILO] She's got a sensitive
side, too, you know.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
Maybe if you had more
experience with women,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
you'd be less oblivious
to that kinda stuff.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Ohh, and I suppose girls just
throw themselves at you.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
They do.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
But Pawoo doesn't play
the field that much either.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
Her love can be sort of intense.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
Take her last boyfriend,
for instance.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
He cheated so she killed him?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.312 position:50% align:center
'Course not.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Thanks to my surgery,
he pulled through.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
Man, that's not even funny.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You're the type that
wouldn't cheat, though,

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.446 position:50% align:center
so you'd be fine.

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.656 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see you
have this talk with her.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Your head would roll.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
[MILO chuckles]

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.249 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I had a dream. Just now.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah?

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You, me, Pawoo,
and Jabi were living together

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
on a nice plot of land.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
And when it got old,

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
we saddled Actagawa up
and rode on to the next.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
I'd love a life like that.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
But... you're leaving.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You're going to settle
things with Kurokawa,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.606 position:50% align:center
aren't you?

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah. I am.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I'll get stronger.
Much stronger.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
Strong enough for you to trust

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
I'll have your back
completely covered.

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
You're plenty strong already.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.958 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You and I are partners, right?

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
Together, we can go anywhere.
We can beat anything.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.047 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That's right.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
We'll stay close.
We're bound by fate.

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.884 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That's right.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
Even in death?

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.598 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That's right.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Hey, Bisco. Are you still there?

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.564 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I haven't budged.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
Would you please hold my hand?

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Sure.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Are you still there?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I'm here.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Sleep. Your body's
had all it can handle.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
Rest is what you need right now.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.208 position:50% align:center
Don't leave me, Bisco.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:00.295 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I'm not goin' anywhere.

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
[MILO] So you'll be
the first thing I see...

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
...when I open my eyes?

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.719 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] I think I finally
understand how Jabi must've felt

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
when he was raising me.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Because of you.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
I should've been
dead on the streets,

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.780 position:50% align:center
no different from a stray.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
But like a firework,
you came outta nowhere

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
and lit up the darkness,
gave purpose to my life.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
I watched over you.
Helped you grow.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
Seems simple, yet it was enough
to make me feel accomplished.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:47.967 position:50% align:center
Milo, I won't die in despair
with a mind full of regrets.

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:52.639 position:50% align:center
Because when I meet my end,
I'll be thinking of your future.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.017 position:50% align:center
That's real happiness
right there.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
Probably more than I deserve.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.897 position:50% align:center
Goodbye.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Of all the times
I've put my life on the line,

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
I've never been so at
peace with the world.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
Actagawa, guess what?
I managed to make a friend.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
A real friend.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
Kurokawa's elite forces?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
Driving government
vehicles? Why?

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.614 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh?

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
What is that?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Hey, aren't you
the slightest bit curious?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
Surely you're dying to know
why you're not dead yet.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Is it National Respect
Your Elders Day?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Heh. If it was,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I'd have to wait till
tomorrow to kill you.

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:19.726 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I can
show and tell.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the Rust
treatments we obtained

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
from persecuting Mushroom
Keepers such as you, there are,

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
in fact, fewer patients
with Rusting than before.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Problem is, that
upsets the balance

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
between supply and demand.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:35.742 position:50% align:center
So if there isn't a demand

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.369 position:50% align:center
for all this medicine
we've acquired,

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
we simply need to create
a greater need for it.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.501 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
No. Can't be.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
Oh, it can. It's boiled Rust.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
See, the thing with the
"naturally occurring" Rust Wind,

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:54.302 position:50% align:center
it just isn't as effective
as it used to be.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
So what're the people who rely
on it supposed to do, Jabi?

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.683 position:50% align:center
How's that old saying go?

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
"If the cuckoo doesn't
sing, coax it."

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA laughs]

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
[JABI] You found a way to
manufacture the Rust Wind?

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
How on earth is
that even possible?

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] The panic in your
voice is music to my ears.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
You know the story, right?

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
About the colossal weapon
used to destroy Tokyo

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
and create the worst plague
Japan has ever seen?

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.164 position:50% align:center
Said weapon had a reactor

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
that generated an infinite
supply of Rust.

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.420 position:50% align:center
And there it is.

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
What you see beneath you
is what I like to call

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
our little sleeping beauty.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
That which plunged all
of Japan into a Rusty sea.

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Tetsujin!

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.936 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
There are five total in Japan,

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
though some theories state six.

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:50.025 position:50% align:center
What matters is this Tetsujin
is one of the few

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
that's still functional.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. Quite a lot for an
old-timer to take in, hmm?

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm trying
to get it up and running.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
Hey, moron, this
brew's too strong.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
The reactor is operational,
though, and that's all I need.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:11.421 position:50% align:center
Once I fill up the Ganesha
Cannon with my Rust Bullets,

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
ka-boom!

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
The Rust Wind will blow,
and all the people will die.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.765 position:50% align:center
I think Weeping Child Ravine
should be our first target.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
Seems appropriate since ridding
the world of Pipe Snakes

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
means eliminating its one
sole source of Rust Eaters.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
And none of that horrifies you?
It's just pure evil!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] If I cared about
what others thought,

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
I never would've betrayed
the Mushroom Keepers

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
to begin with.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
Twisted fool.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Join me, Jabi.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50% align:center
According to Doctor Panda,

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
Keeper blood is the
secret ingredient

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:52.212 position:50% align:center
that activates the Rust Eater's
full healing potential.

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
That's why I hoped you'd
be willing to handpick

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
some fresh, young
Mushroom Keepers for me.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
As their leader,

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
you could easily convince
them to help my cause.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
Just give one solid speech about

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
how their noble sacrifices
are for the greater good.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I'd pay you, of course.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
What's most shocking is you
thought I might say yes.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Actually, I know you'll say yes,

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
or weren't you listening?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
I can turn any place in Japan
into a giant Rust bucket,

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
so the reality is,
you have no choice.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
I can wipe your little village
off the map first.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.414 position:50% align:center
Weeping Child Ravine
doesn't have to be

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
at the top of my list.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:36.506 position:50% align:center
So let's try this one more time,
with feeling. Join me.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Kurokawa.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50% align:center
Yes, Jabi?

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[JABI laughs]

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
[JABI] You're so full of it.
Shoot if you're gonna shoot.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
I know better, though.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
Only thing you like to
shoot off's your mouth.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
You have the courage to bully
your elders, not pull a trigger.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
Fine. Wanna see me
pull a trigger?

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
That's enough pointless rage.
Stop before he really dies.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
I need him alive.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
Let's just make it so he
can't draw a bow again.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Jabi, it'd sure be a
shame to lose your bow fingers

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.970 position:50% align:center
since Keepers are famous
for their archery.

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
You've got ten seconds
to agree to my terms

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.600 position:50% align:center
and keep your digits safe.

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Ten. Nine.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
Just cut 'em off already.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll help
you sleep easier

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:37.484 position:50% align:center
knowing you maimed one
beaten old fogie.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Zero.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Huh?

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:47.660 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
Surprise!

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi!

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.177 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA yells]

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Tenacious bastard, isn't he?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Sorry for hitting you. Honest.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
Although kinda felt
like it was payback

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
for all those times you
smacked me as a kid.

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
In that state?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
Bisco, what do you
think you're doing?

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna take Kurokawa down.

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
In the meantime, you go destroy
that Ganesha Cannon thing.

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
That should save both our
village and the Rust Eater.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
What a stupid plan!
I can't leave you here!

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
Did you forget? Who am I?

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
I'm the man you raised.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:44.342 position:50% align:center
The person that you poured
your very heart and soul into.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
I am Bisco.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
Trust me the way I trust you.

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center
Do you resent this
old coot, Bisco?

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
All right. Get movin'.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
Don't you die, okay?

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
Get the thing.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE]
But he's not exactly--

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
Bring that failure to me
before I kill you!

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE, ELITE A]
Yes, sir!

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Come on now!

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
I'm riskin' my life left
and right over here.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna be my
opponent for a boss fight,

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
gimme a good final battle.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.445 position:50% align:center
Then again, you're more
of a buzzkill than a boss.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] I hope you brought
your last will and testament.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
I'll sign it before your
body hits the floor!

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm screwed.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
So how come you're so afraid

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
of a half-dead
excuse for a human?

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
I can see your knees shaking
from all the way over here!

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
I'll tear you limb from limb

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.802 position:50% align:center
so that your death's
extremely slow!

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh? Uh-oh.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:19.396 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.401 position:50% align:center
The hell's that supposed to be?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO yells]

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.205 position:50% align:center
Jeez, learn some manners.
Even apes should have them.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
You, uh, pack quite a punch.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
Thanks for saving me.
Guess we'll call it even.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Akaboshi!

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
Yes! I really did it!
Literal bullseye!

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.767 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA laughing]

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE screaming]

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
He's your meal, so turn him
into mashed potatoes!

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
[growling]

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[MUSHROOM MONSTER A roars]

00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Very good!

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
[MUSHROOM MONSTER A]
Huh?

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
[MUSHROOM MONSTER A yelping]

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Aw, can you not draw your bow

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
'cause your Rusty
fingers shattered?

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
That's just how this
screwed up world works.

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
No matter how strong you are,

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
bad guys like me always
win at the last second.

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
Honestly, we both should've
seen this coming.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
In the end, punks like
you rot away every time.

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:30.777 position:50% align:center
Kinda makes you wonder why
you're even put on this earth.

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
Ballsy of you to assume you win.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.660 position:50% align:center
Who said that I need a bow
'n' arrow to defeat you?

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
I sure didn't.

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and start running.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.916 position:50% align:center
Because as long as
I still have a tooth,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
even a single fingernail,
I'll be able to kill you!

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA whimpers]

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
Get away! Don't come any closer!
You can die right where you are!

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:47.896 position:50% align:center
So long, Kurokawa.
See you in hell!

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:04.913 position:50% align:center
Heh. Even while drowning in your
own blood, you make that face.

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
How do you do it, Akaboshi?

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
Had me convinced...
you were going to end to me.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
Before I put the final
nail in your coffin,

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
please tell me
your last request.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.890 position:50% align:center
Why don't you say
yours instead? Moron.

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
Die in some grimy back alley

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
like the worthless
mutt that you are.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.820 position:50% align:center
Kurokawa!

[MILO]
Bisco!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.753 position:50% align:center
Hey, look. You get a death
worthy of being in a movie.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect time to
say something cool like,

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
"I'll be back!"

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
And, action!

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Be careful what
you wish for, Akaboshi,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
because I will be back!

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
I will kill you along with
all the Mushroom Keepers!

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.438 position:50% align:center
Then I can finally have my rest!

00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
Rest as long as you like in
this sea of Rust you created.

00:21:22.323 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:30.081 position:50% align:center
You said you'd stay!
You said we were partners!

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
You said fate bound us
together forever!

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
Don't go. It'll be
way too lonely.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:39.632 position:50% align:center
Please. Please,
don't leave me behind!

00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Milo!

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
I'm more than my flesh.

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:46.473 position:50% align:center
I've got a soul
somewhere in here, too,

00:21:46.556 --> 00:21:48.600 position:50% align:center
and it will never die.

00:21:48.683 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
I'll crawl out of the
darkest pits of hell

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
if it means protecting you.

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
So you're right.
We are partners.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:58.485 position:50% align:center
And that's something
that lasts forever.

00:21:58.568 --> 00:22:02.155 position:50% align:center
Get it? If so, then smile.

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:07.077 position:50% align:center
When you're scared or hurt,
you have to smile, okay?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.162 position:50% align:center
The way I always did.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:13.541 position:50% align:center
And whenever you smile,
I'll be right there with you.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:25.679 position:50% align:center
Milo, will you take my life?
Before the Rust kills me.

00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
I'd rather you do the honors.

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
Aim true, and just believe.
Can you do it?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.021 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.113 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I'll try.
I'll try to live like you.

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:47.909 position:50% align:center
No matter how much I break...
No matter how often I fall...

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:50.829 position:50% align:center
...I'll stand back up and smile.

00:22:50.912 --> 00:22:54.249 position:50% align:center
And if I give it my all,
then one day,

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:56.668 position:50% align:center
when I'm ripped to pieces,
ground into dust,

00:22:56.751 --> 00:23:02.799 position:50% align:center
and nothing but a soul remains,
will I be able to see you again?

00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:06.011 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You can count on it.

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:23.611 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:29.325 position:50% align:center
Even after you're gone,
that'll never change.

00:23:29.409 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
I'll always love you.

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:35.123 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] One star falls, leaving
an empty void in the sky,

00:23:35.206 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
but is that crimson
light lost forever?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
No!

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
The sun's arrows
pierce our hearts

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.297 position:50% align:center
and continue to burn bright red!

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.716 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Tetsujin Revived."

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.718 position:50% align:center
God of mushrooms, behold!
