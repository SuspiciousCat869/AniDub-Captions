[beeping]

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.835 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
Hm?

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.046 position:50% align:center
Ah, Christ.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
Hey, what gives?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.592 position:50% align:center
I thought you said you
fixed the dang thing, Ota!

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
But it still can't
read these passes!

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.347 position:50% align:center
Huh? I did fix it.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.684 position:50% align:center
Guess it prefers
to stay broken.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
Curious, huh?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.230 position:50% align:center
You 'n' all those gossips
over at the governor's place.

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:47.148 position:50% align:center
Y'know Mount Akagi, right?

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:48.316 position:50% align:center
Well, he turned what was once

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
our main tourist trap
into shroom city.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.113 position:50% align:center
[MONK] Why do they call
him "man-eating"?

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.366 position:50% align:center
He's got a habit of
eating people. Why else?

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE laughs]

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE] Folks just call him
that 'cause he's so bad.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
So you're a monk with
the Flamebound, huh?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
Watari Gani Wataru?
Fake as hell name.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.504 position:50% align:center
[MONK] With the Flamebound,
it's my monastic name.

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
What's your real one?

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.298 position:50% align:center
[MONK]
I cast it off.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:16.469 position:50% align:center
Ah. Must be on a pilgrimage,
and next stop's Imihama, yeah?

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
So you're dying, huh?

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.472 position:50% align:center
You should visit
the Tokyo crater.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.890 position:50% align:center
S'pretty close,

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
and since you're on one of
those "funeral journeys,"

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
you might as well.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
Heard Imihama Prefecture

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
was gonna organize tours
of ground zero a while back.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50% align:center
What a stupid idea!

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:31.860 position:50% align:center
Imagine advertising
the Rust Wind

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.446 position:50% align:center
like it's a breath
of fresh air!

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
Which is why Monks are
all that pass through.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.366 position:50% align:center
Nothing to see out here.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
Just a big, boring
desert of iron

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
that never seems to
end beyond this gate.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.496 position:50% align:center
Even we're bored to death.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.791 position:50% align:center
Shut up, dumbass. Have a
little more pride, will ya?

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
Sure, it may not be the
most glamourous job,

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
but any criminal trying
to get outta Gunma

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.131 position:50% align:center
would have to cross this desert.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.507 position:50% align:center
I'd even go so far as to call us

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
the prefecture's
"last line of defense."

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
[OTA]
Right. Sorry.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
Acting like there's
no excitement here.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
They post those bounties
'cause the people on 'em

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.977 position:50% align:center
could come waltzing
through anytime.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
[MONK]
The Man-eater. Akaboshi.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER C] The world after
death is nothing to fear

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.530 position:50% align:center
if everyone goes together.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
For all your funeral needs,
turn to Banryouji.

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Two's plenty. Thank you.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
[CLERK A]
Welcome!

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
Wanna eat where it's cheap?
Park it right here!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
[BELIEVER A] If your dreams are
shrouded by a blanket of rust,

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
you can still find
salvation in death!

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
[GIRL A]
Look! It's the Watch!

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
They're so cool!

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
You kids haven't seen anyone

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
buying or selling mushrooms
around here, have you?

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
[BOY B]
Not that I remember, no.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50% align:center
[WATCH A] Well, if you do,
you know who to tell. Right?

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
[KIDS]
You can count on us!

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50% align:center
Why, hello. You on your
way home from work?

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:55.318 position:50% align:center
Want me to help
relieve some stress?

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
Aw, you're no fun.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
I up and left the village

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
at the tender age of eight.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
After my father died
from the Rusting,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
my mother caught a
bad case of it, too.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
I blinked, and then all
those heartless villagers

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
ran us out of our own home.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.754 position:50% align:center
[LADY A] That client I had the
other day was just the worst!

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
Said he couldn't pay
after the fact,

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
so this nutcase
hands me a toy doll

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
and tells me to
"keep the change."

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
[LADY B] Like those artifacts
they call "figures"?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
The ones that were popular in
Tokyo before it went boom?

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
Girl, those sell for a ton.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
Uh! You're kidding me!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
I was at my wits' end,

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.356 position:50% align:center
wandering through a field
of floating algae at night,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
when what do I see
standing in the middle

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
of the wetlands
but a black pole.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
It was big enough for me
to wrap my hand around,

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
but also bent like it
had a crooked neck.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
Then I realized what it was.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
Turned out that pole
was none other

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
than the finger of Tetsujin.

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
I mean, talk about foreboding.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.833 position:50% align:center
That was the moment
I cursed my fate.

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
Did she just say Tetsujin?

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
As in the thing that exploded,

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.381 position:50% align:center
ripping Tokyo a new one and
ruining Japan in the process?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
Why're you taking her
stories seriously?

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
When she starts
babbling like that,

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
do what I do and tune her out.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
Who're you tuning out?

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.808 position:50% align:center
[LADY D]
Ahh. That tickles.

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Stop squirming.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
[LADY D] I would, but it's
bigger than I thought.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You won't feel a thing.
Quick in and out.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
[LADY D] Okay. I can
handle a little pain.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.199 position:50% align:center
Your temperature
should go down now.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50% align:center
Just don't forget to take this
medicine after your meals.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
You really are the best, Doc.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.417 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Next patient, please.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
Could you have a look
at my boy before me?

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:40.256 position:50% align:center
Sure. Here, sit down
and we'll start.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.179 position:50% align:center
At least it isn't spreading.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Which tells me you've
been a good kid.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
[BOY C]
Am I getting a shot?

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
[MILO] No, an ointment
will suffice this time.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.854 position:50% align:center
The Rusting stuff you injected
him with the other day

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
really did the trick.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
I wish I had the dough to
pay for such pricey meds.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.
Though this isn't a real cure.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
There's a difference
between eliminating Rust

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
and delaying it.

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
So I still advise staying within
the walls when you can.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
And I'd heed that
advice if I could,

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
but my job leaves me no choice.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
There. All done.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
[BOY C]
Thanks a bunch, Doctor Panda!

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
[MINER A]
Uh, that's Doctor Nekoyanagi.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
Ah, he's okay.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
It's the name people
have come to know me by.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
Now, let's take a look at you.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
[TRADER A] You better not
get caught with this stuff.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
If you do, you and
I never met. Got it?

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
[MANJU SELLER A] Hang on. Isn't
this the same kind as last time?

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.811 position:50% align:center
[TRADER A] I go through the
hassle of smuggling these

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.772 position:50% align:center
into Imihama and you
want more variety?

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
I can always take it elsewhere.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Plenty of people want to get
taste of Heaven before they die.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah. Beggars can't
be choosers, can they?

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
[TRADER A] But if you're
lookin' to change it up,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
a buddy of mine said he'd
be bringing a new type.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
A real choice specimen.
Interested?

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
[MADAM]
So I stared at Tetsujin's finger

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
who knows how long.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
Once I looked closer, I saw a
strange man standing beside it.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
Alone.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
Well, I thought he was
staring, too, at first.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
That's when I noticed he
was scraping the Rust

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
off the surface and
putting it in a little vial.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.808 position:50% align:center
I wonder how much I can
sell that doll for.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
Though it might be helpful

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
if I could remember
where I put it.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.855 position:50% align:center
[LADY B] You need to keep
better track of your finances.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
He was a Mushroom Keeper.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
Sent an icy chill
straight through me.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
Because that meant every
rumor I ever heard

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
about them spreading
the Rust was true.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
[MILO] All right. You're both
good to go. Get home safe.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
[MINER A]
Thanks again, Doctor Nekoyanagi.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.414 position:50% align:center
So never take a Mushroom
Keeper as a client

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
or he'll spread the Rust to you
faster than you can say,
