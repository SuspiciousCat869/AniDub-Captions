00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
Where the hell'd you
even come from, huh?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.737 position:50% align:center
Seems your reflexes
have improved.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.656 position:50% align:center
Or at least from what I recall.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
Surely you've realized this,
but your fate is sealed.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.953 position:50% align:center
Now return my brother to me.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] For the record, Cap'n,
Milo's the one who followed me.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.876 position:50% align:center
He's trying to save your life
and get rid of your Rust!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.294 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Silver-tongued lies.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
You deceived my
brother's pure heart

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.800 position:50% align:center
with your baseless claims
about this fabled Rust Eater.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
Give him a little bit
more credit than that!

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Some point or another,

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:19.556 position:50% align:center
kids gotta grow up
and leave the nest.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.598 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
My bad. You're his sister!

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
Kinda pegged ya as a
helicopter parent type

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.731 position:50% align:center
'cause you look way
older than you are.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.400 position:50% align:center
Die!

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.578 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
What is that thing?

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.793 position:50% align:center
Idiot! Lose the bike
and get down!

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.463 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Damn it.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
S'why you don't pick dumb
fights in dumb places.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.266 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.187 position:50% align:center
I'll get it to drop Pawoo!
Make sure you catch her!

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Ready when you are!

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Jump off!

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
If it flies any higher, you
won't be able to get down!

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.168 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Right!

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:33.922 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
Milo!

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Hurry and get back on your bike!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Don't just stand there!

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Or do you want to watch
your brother die?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.269 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Those numbshroom arrows
didn't loosen its grip one bit.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
So what will?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Actagawa, this is gonna
be scary, but can you trust me?

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:19.175 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Think like Bisco.
He wouldn't give up!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
Not until his last shot!

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.310 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.354 position:50% align:center
Nice! Direct hit!

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.361 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
Milo!

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.435 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Actagawa!

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Are you all right?

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I think so.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
How could you act so recklessly?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
I would've thought
that was obvious.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
If there's a chance to save you,
I'm taking it no matter what.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco, are those?

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.353 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah. Rust Eaters.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
It's hard to believe
we really did it.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
We can cure Pawoo and
Jabi now! Isn't it great?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Uh. What's wrong?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:06.658 position:50% align:center
Not sure, but
something feels off.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.167 position:50% align:center
[BISCO coughs]

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
Every mushroom has the
ability to consume Rust.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
This one just does it a whole
lot better. Supposedly.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
But as far as I can tell,

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.637 position:50% align:center
its power and taste are
no different from, like...

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
...a matsutake.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
No way. Then...
we came for nothing?

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] All I know is
that this one is a dud.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
We've still got time
before the sun sets.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
Let's find our next prey.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I understand how you feel,

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
but what we need to do is rest.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
It's clear you don't
have any blood to lose.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Milo has a point.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
None of us are really fit
to fight at the moment.

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
If you're worn out,
I won't force you to come.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
I can go it alone.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Wait! You're the most
worn out one here, Bisco!

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
You can't face another Pipe
Snake in your condition!

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
There's no way you'll survive!

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Forget your pride
and think of your life!

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
I didn't come all this way
to leave empty-handed!

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
Stop being a dumbass and let go!

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Akaboshi!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
[MILO gasps]

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
Come back!
The Rust Eater! It's--

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
[MILO] It's triggered...
by Bisco's blood.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.334 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Good.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50% align:center
There, ya happy?

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
Now explain the trick
you pulled earlier.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You need blood first.

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[grumbles]

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I just need to
know your blood type.

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.261 position:50% align:center
Okay, Doc, the heck
is a "blood type"?

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
I mean, all blood's
the same, right?

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.848 position:50% align:center
This isn't the time for jokes.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.434 position:50% align:center
You gotta know your
own blood type.

00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
I've never heard of a blood
type. That like my flavor?

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Huh.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
Do Mushroom Keepers really have
no concept of blood types?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
Or it's more like their
blood itself is...

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
So, what? Can you not do it
without knowing my type?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
No, it's fine.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.912 position:50% align:center
I was just remembering the
legend of the Rust Eater

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
and the dying hero
Jabi told me about.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Wh-What? He never told
me about a dying hero!

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Calm down and don't move.
I thought something was odd.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:28.717 position:50% align:center
If the Rust Eater grows on
Pipe Snakes of all things,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
the legend doesn't match.

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
But you found something
that connected them.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
Keeper blood activates
their power,

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
and that's the missing
piece, right?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Right.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Mushroom Keeper blood must
have a special property to it.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, we can experiment
with Bisco's blood.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
After this is done taking.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Why, though? Why'd Jabi
tell you and not me?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
He probably thought you'd
take it at face value,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
and you might go sacrificing
another Mushroom Keeper.

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center
That's just stupid!
I'd never kill a friend!

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.373 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Wouldn't you, though?

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center
Isn't that why they call you
the "Man-Eating Redcap"?

00:09:03.168 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Why don't you come a little
closer and I'll show you?!

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I said don't move!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.715 position:50% align:center
How hard is it to sit still?

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I can't sit still

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
knowing we're wasting
precious time!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.311 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] The production of the
Rust Eater is almost a riddle.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
One Mushroom Keepers
managed to solve

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
with impressive pharmacology.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
Perhaps they aren't the
senseless barbarians

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
the world has come
to know them as,

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
but rather, our innovative,
scientific saviors.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
The only thing not adding up
is that old couple's story.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
Why don'tcha take a picture?

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] I need to go and
take care of my bike.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
It's almost as
beat up as we are.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.555 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA chuckles]

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Who would've ever guessed

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
your mad pursuit of
Akaboshi would lead you

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
to a harvest of legendary Rust
Eaters ripe for the picking?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Kurokawa!

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
They create quite
impressive meds.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.577 position:50% align:center
Good enough to charm any
bigwig in the government.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
So he's Imihama's governor.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.834 position:50% align:center
Our reputations precede us,
eh, Man-Eater?

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.887 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA chuckles]

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:38.930 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Those nearly bloomed

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
even with the
protective coating.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.393 position:50% align:center
Multiple hits could
mean trouble.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
You really are a dangerous
one, aren't you?

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
Got me quakin' from head to toe.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center
All right. Finger off
the trigger, hotshot.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE] But he's wounded!
If we take him out here--

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.907 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] You should regard
Mushroom Keepers

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
with a little more respect.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:04.289 position:50% align:center
[ELITE A sceams]

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:08.251 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Otherwise, what
happens is... you just die.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[BISCO gasps]

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.422 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] I trust this won't
be the last time we meet.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:19.888 position:50% align:center
Consider that bullet
our promise ring.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That bastard used a Rust bullet.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:38.782 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You're sure?

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna take
your dose now?

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
No, not yet.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
I'll wait till I give Jabi
his, then I'll take it.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Why wait?

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
I'm sure Kurokawa is sweating

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
over the Rust Eaters'
lack of effect right now.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
If he or his goons
see I'm fully healed,

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
who knows what methods
they'll resort to

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
in order to learn the secret.

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Save your concern for Akaboshi.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
Besides, you made
Jabi's case sound dire.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:10.563 position:50% align:center
If we want to cure him in time,
my bike's our best shot.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
I'm heading to the Shimobuki
watch base first for intel.

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
No need to worry.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.827 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Hm?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.706 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] As much as I'd like to,
I can't serve as Milo's shield.

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
Only you can, Akiboshi.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Hold on. That's your cure.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.880 position:50% align:center
It was. Now it's yours.

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:37.882 position:50% align:center
You're playing off your
wound well enough,

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
but your Rust will
probably spread quickly.

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.971 position:50% align:center
Use it if you need to, okay?

00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
Pawoo, I can't.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
Finally. You used my name.

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
The sooner you defeat Kurokawa,

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
the sooner you can
give me my own cure.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Fine.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
Just a slight change to
the order, that's all.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:08.538 position:50% align:center
Screw you if ya want a favor.
This doesn't count.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
So suave. It reminds me of
the first time we fought.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
Though I'm marred by Rust,

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:16.880 position:50% align:center
you're the only one
who's seen it

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
and still called me "pretty."

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
You're not so bad yourself.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
Up close, you're,
dare I say, cute.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Wh-What?!

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
What are you two
whispering about?

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
Just threatening
him to make sure

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
that he guards you
with his life.

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.691 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Hm?

00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Huh?

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Hey, what happened
to the rest of the Watch?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
More men should be here.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
[click]

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
That was a god-tier reaction.

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
The way you move while
being so ill is... heh...

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
...straight up terrifying.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Kurokawa,
what did you do to my men?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
My, how brash.

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
It's too cold to be
so hot-blooded.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
We can talk shop after
you've seen this.

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:57.522 position:50% align:center
[PIG squealing]

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
It's fried pig today!
Hope you're hungry...

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Hey, over here! Get this!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
The big guy ran off on his own

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
and discovered a
female swamp crab.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
But without his big pincer,
he got rejected.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.931 position:50% align:center
Aw, chin up, buddy.

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
It's not the size of
the claw that counts.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
[BISCO laughing]

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.319 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Seriously?

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
I've told you countless
times to stay put!

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
Why can't you just do as I say?

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
Did you hear what I said about
Actagawa getting shot down?

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
Ooh. Looks like
I really pissed him off.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
If I don't apologize
with a shitton of food,

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
he'll be sulky all night long.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
No, come back! You're healing!

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.301 position:50% align:center
It's gonna take me
ten minutes tops!

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.303 position:50% align:center
It's fried pig tonight, yeah?

00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:14.391 position:50% align:center
I hate skinnin' pigs,
so that's all you!

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
That idiot!

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
I'm worried sick
about how sick he is.

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
And does he show even a
smidgen of cooperation? No!

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
[static]

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Uh, testing.
One, two. One, two.

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
This is an official broadcast
from Governor Kurokawa

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:35.120 position:50% align:center
of the Imihama Prefecture.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.706 position:50% align:center
I'd like to issue a warning
to the wanted criminal,

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:40.583 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi Bisco,
and his accomplice,

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
Doctor Milo Nekoyanagi.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
You two must still be

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
within the Touhoku
broadcast range, right?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.136 position:50% align:center
Then it's showtime,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:56.891 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] I sincerely hope this
video manages to reach you.

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:58.560 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
[MILO humming]

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.949 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Welcome back, Bisco.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.331 position:50% align:center
Now it's boiled pork?

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Yeah.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
It was pretty fatty, so it
would've turned your stomach

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
if I'd fried it.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
Shaved off as much as I could
and kept the lean meat.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
Aw.w You're kidding! The fat's
the best part of the pig. Uh.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.483 position:50% align:center
Tastes like sleepshrooms.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on? Why the hell
would you drug our dinner?

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Bisco, please.
I need you to listen to m--

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
It's Pawoo.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
She went to the Shimobuki
base. I know that route.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
Get back here! I can't
let you do this!

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] You tellin' me this
is the time you're scared?

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.265 position:50% align:center
When your sister's at stake?

00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I'll go, you'll stay.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
That's what I'm telling you.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.774 position:50% align:center
You forget I'm a doctor?

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
Or did you just think I wouldn't
notice all the pain you're in?

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.238 position:50% align:center
I know your organs are a wreck,

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
and though you cover
up your Rusted side,

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
I can tell your kicks
and jumps don't have

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
half the power they used to.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
I can also tell your
vision's blurry

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
and you're shooting on instinct.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.501 position:50% align:center
I know all of it.
So let this sink in:

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
You're way sicker than
Pawoo or even Jabi!

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.339 position:50% align:center
If you go risking your
life in that state,

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
I guarantee you
won't make it back!

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
If I die, I die!

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
But I'll live how
I want till I do!

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
Besides, why are my choices
any of your business?

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Because you and I
are friends, aren't we?!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
Like it or not, your
choices affect me, too.

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
I'm not here because you owe me.
I'm here because I care!

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
You....

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
You're my most treasured friend,
and I don't want you to die.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
I mean, isn't that obvious?
Why wouldn't it be obvious?

00:19:26.708 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] I could repeat your
words right back to you, Milo.

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
You realize... people need you.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
I'm the one that's
expendable here.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
So if someone's dying, it's me.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
You're staying behind.
I'll be quick as I can.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:49.856 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I won't let you go.
Even if it costs me everything.

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:52.567 position:50% align:center
If any one person in this world

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.279 position:50% align:center
knows all that I'm
capable of, it's you.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:58.990 position:50% align:center
So of course you know
exactly what it means

00:19:59.074 --> 00:20:01.910 position:50% align:center
to raise your bow against me.

00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know. But still...

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:07.457 position:50% align:center
The one thing you never
thought to teach me

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
was how to lose to a dead man.

00:20:20.929 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
You're years behind me!

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
If you understand
it now, go ins--

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
doesn't understand

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
the situation he's in!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
Give it up 'n' settle down!

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I won't let you go!

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
Never!

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:46.830 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Oh, shit.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Milo.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I'm... sorry.

00:20:54.754 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
C'mon, man. Don't apologize.

I made up my mind.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
This time, I won't be your
shadow or student or partner.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
I'll be your shield,
just like I am for Pawoo.

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
Heck, I'll even be your spear.

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
Though I don't have
the strength you do,

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
I'll risk my mind, body,
and spirit--everything...

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
...to protect you from harm.

Milo, don't give me that look.

Hang on, Pawoo and Jabi.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.196 position:50% align:center
I'm coming to save you!

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:35.665 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE] Ever wonder what the men
behind the masks have to say?

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:39.085 position:50% align:center
I'll tell ya! We bunnies
think Kurokawa stinks!

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:41.838 position:50% align:center
Be nice if the Redcap could
hurry up and beat 'im.

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:43.590 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Fiendish Trap."

00:23:43.673 --> 00:23:45.967 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Akaboshi.
