[MILO panting]

00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.569 position:50% align:center
All right. Looks like
no one followed.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.239 position:50% align:center
Stop! Would ya quit
bein' so clingy?

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.950 position:50% align:center
I've got enough layers as it is.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.174 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bisco.
Aren't we off-course?

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.969 position:50% align:center
We'll miss the mark and end
up too far east this way.

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
Um, can you not with the
foreboding comments like,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50% align:center
"We'll miss the mark"?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.641 position:50% align:center
I'm a frickin' archer.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
Think before you
speak, city meat.

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Word choice aside,

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking
we might've taken a wrong turn.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] It'd be a first since
I've never made a mistake.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? A whole prefecture
just up and moved?

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.157 position:50% align:center
Ah! You're pissin'
me off, Panda!

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
Stop talkin' like I'm some noob!

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.579 position:50% align:center
Just shut up and follow,
you sheltered brat!

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:45.206 position:50% align:center
Now, where did that guy go?

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.666 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.806 position:50% align:center
Look! Driftweed! What a find.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center
It absorbs light,
and at night, it glows!

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
Man, I'd love to see
if they're as pretty

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.356 position:50% align:center
as the rumors I heard
in Imi-- Ah!

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Get serious, will ya?!

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.235 position:50% align:center
We're not sightseeing.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
That isn't why I
mentioned it, though.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
When driftweed glows at night,

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
it attracts bugs and beasts.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.620 position:50% align:center
I wanna get through here
before it gets dark.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.247 position:50% align:center
Drop your guard and you die.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
Right. Sorry.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.328 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Here.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
[yelps, screams]

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
So bitter!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
'Cause you chewed.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.424 position:50% align:center
They may be dead, but their
guts come back 'n' bite ya.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
The trick is to swallow it
in one big gulp, head-first.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50% align:center
No way. Swallow it?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Eat, or you'll
just pass out. Again.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bisco? I did the math,
and Pawoo should hold up

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
about three more months
thanks to those mushroom shots,

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.285 position:50% align:center
but Jabi's case is much worse.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
I'd say he only has
about a month at most.

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
The clock is ticking.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
So even if we are able to
find a Rust Eater in Akita,

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:58.298 position:50% align:center
we won't make it
in time on foot.

00:04:58.381 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
We can't get a car.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
Though the highway'd
be much faster,

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
we'd no doubt be
caught by the Watch.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:05.930 position:50% align:center
You think that I'm
just some bonehead

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
who's only good at fighting?

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
Nothing you said is new to me.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
We're not flying by the seat
of our pants, ya know.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
Oh, great!
So we do have a plan!

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] The tip of the Ashio
Bonecoal Mountains

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
extends to just north of here.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
The longest railcar
line in the mines

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
runs all the way to
southern Yamagata.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't take more
than a few days

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.705 position:50% align:center
if we can find a good route.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
You want to use
the mines in Ashio?

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.544 position:50% align:center
That means we're passing through
the Bonecoal Mountains!

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
[MILO] They say the iron mice
living in those mountains

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
are nothing short of horrifying.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
When the swarm attacks,

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
a grown man can be reduced to
bones in a matter of seconds.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
Even with your strength,

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.477 position:50% align:center
we're no match for
something like that.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
Which is why the two of
us won't be going alone.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Huh? Who else is there?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
Our third party member.
Just managed to find 'im.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:09.703 position:50% align:center
[MILO yelps]

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
He's with us. Relax.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You... consider
this thing your friend?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.135 position:50% align:center
My brother.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
Meet Actagawa,
the trusty steelcrab.

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.559 position:50% align:center
I had him go east
around the walls.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
He doesn't like the heat,

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
so I figured he'd
buried himself,

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.647 position:50% align:center
which always makes
finding him fun.

00:06:39.274 --> 00:06:41.443 position:50% align:center
That's why we went east.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.611 position:50% align:center
Mines'll be a breeze with him.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:45.280 position:50% align:center
The creatures there
won't attack anything

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50% align:center
they can't sink
their teeth into.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
He's stronger than
heavy machinery,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
and he can walk
through any terrain.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Whoa!

00:06:55.707 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Amazing!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
My name's Milo Nekoyanagi.
It's very nice to meet you!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:08.136 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
The hell? We don't throw
our new friends, you jerk!

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
[BISCO laughs]

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50% align:center
Put that on. Should keep
him from tossing you.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, he hates doctors.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
Huh. It suits you really well.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Yeah?

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Just how it looks.
That's all I meant.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.929 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
Name's Milo. I'm the latest
addition to the team.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:02.107 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I'd like to find
this fabled Rust Eater--

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.734 position:50% align:center
with you and Bisco.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I did it!

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
Gonna feel that tomorrow.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] So, yeah, he'll whirl
around if you go [grunts]

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
on this here.

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
And if he gets all excited
and goes "Raargh," just say...

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:30.635 position:50% align:center
Why is he using more
sound effects than words?

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] But ultimately,
you won't need logic

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
once you grasp how he feels.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.433 position:50% align:center
Wanna give it another try?

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.893 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Why not?

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
You got it.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.689 position:50% align:center
Panda v. Crab, round three.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's go!

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.452 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
[BISCO chuckles]

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
Guess I forgot to go "fwoom"
when I snapped the reins.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
My bad.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] You put too much
power into your pull.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
Actagawa's got you
outmuscled every time.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
Wait, hang on!
Not that way. No!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.809 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] If you're nice to him,
he'll be nice to you.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:29.194 position:50% align:center
Focus on his feelings,
not control.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.614 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
He hates me.

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:38.745 position:50% align:center
[BISCO chuckles]

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:39.662 position:50% align:center
[MILO grumbles]

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
It's not worth sulking about.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
How would you react
if some stranger

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.086 position:50% align:center
got on your back and
tried to ride you?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Even crabs have
their pride, y'know?

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
Just gotta get used
to each other.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
I can't help but wonder what
will end up breaking first:

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.347 position:50% align:center
His pride or all the
bones in my neck?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Always with the smart
remarks, huh, Doc?

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
Well, Actagawa's our
ace in the hole.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
Making nice with him should
come first and foremost.

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
Which is clearly easier
said than done.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
Want me to make nice?
Give me proper instruction.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
[MILO screams]

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.172 position:50% align:center
[MILO] At this rate,
it'll be impossible

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
to get through the
Bonecoal Mountains.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
I wanna be an asset to Bisco.
Not a detriment!

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Actagawa, please!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Too fast!

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Stop!

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
--[thud]
--[MILO grunts]

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry. We didn't
cause any harm, did we?

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
I'm just fine. Almost
as fine as your crab.

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
Nice. That should do it.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Ah! Stop, crab thief!

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Come on!

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
Give up and just let the
darn thing go, Panda Boy!

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Make it stop!

[BISCO]
What is that idiot doing?

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Huh?

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
You picked the wrong
crab to try 'n' steal.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.953 position:50% align:center
Now I can feed you to him!

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
[TIROL screams]

00:11:56.841 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Dude, I swear. How'd you
even get in that situation?

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
I, um...

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
That girl said she'd show me
the ropes and then took 'em.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
It's fine. We'll train
more tomorrow.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
I pushed you way too hard.

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
But this'll help.
Stay still, okay?

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
Drop the tough-guy act!

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Thank you. Now sit.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.211 position:50% align:center
There. Good boy.

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. You can do all that,
but you still can't ride him?

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Hm? "Do all that"? Wait, what?

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
[BISCO laughs]

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Well, change of plans.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
You hereby graduate from
crab training academy.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
Who knew you'd have
such a natural talent?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.231 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Huh?

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.191 position:50% align:center
You are one of a kind.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
Never seen someone talk to a
crab before he could ride it.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] We're a hop,
skip, and a jump away

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
from the Ashio Mountain range.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
What's that?

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Okay, we'll sleep here tonight.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
Make sure you heal your
own wounds, too, Doc.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:21.384 position:50% align:center
What're the frickin' odds?

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
Guess even crab thieves
are welcome in temples now.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Huh. You're also
that girl from Imihama.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
You been following us, trying--

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco, move!

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:41.112 position:50% align:center
[TIROL coughing]

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.450 position:50% align:center
I can tell there's
something in her stomach.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be rough, but...

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
The hell is this?!

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
A balloonworm.

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
Way back, they were used to
prevent servants from escaping.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
Victims were first fed an egg.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
Next, drugs to stop
it from hatching.

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
So if they left,
their fate was sealed.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
Governor Kurokawa's been
using them on his elites.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
No wonder they're always
taking that weird medicine.

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
Double-crossing dirtbag!

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Here, drink some water.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
This guy.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
Even helps a crook who made
a fool of him in the same day.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
You're a lifesaver!

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
Ah! What the heck
are you doing here?

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
Are you hunting me down?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
Really?!

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't
have let him save you,

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
so thank panda face.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
Ha! Oh, that is just rich!

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
I know what he wants for saving
me, and it's not a "thank you."

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center
Bet you're as lonely
out here as I am.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:53.184 position:50% align:center
You said as much with
that amazing kiss.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
Huh?! That was a
medical necessity!

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
You're so cute
when you're flustered.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.817 position:50% align:center
Oh, Doc! I think
there's another egg.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
I think its medically
necessary for you

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.446 position:50% align:center
to kiss this one outta me, too.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
Back away from the panda.

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.908 position:50% align:center
Hate to break it to you,
but you're not very enticing.

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
Got nothin' to work with.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
Is someone's chastity
belt on too tight?

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
Who knew the Man-eating Redcap

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
is actually a sex-
fearing virgin?

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
Just take a few
deep breaths, okay?

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.591 position:50% align:center
Hey, so, you're
a peddler, right?

00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
We're sorely lacking
in our food supply.

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.846 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind, could
you share some with us?

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
You want food? So neither
of you are after my body?

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.519 position:50% align:center
Even though I'm throwing
myself at you for payment?

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.104 position:50% align:center
Why bother saving me?

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:39.898 position:50% align:center
Like, you could've taken
whatever you wanted

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.232 position:50% align:center
once I was dead.

00:15:41.316 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Now, that's a valid point.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
We'll never let someone
die right in front of us

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
if we can save them.

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
Right, Bisco?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
So I was saved by a man
who's arguably softer

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:52.035 position:50% align:center
than a whole bag
of marshmallows.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:54.454 position:50% align:center
Can't tell if it's
lucky or tragic.

00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:55.830 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll treat this
transaction like any other!

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Charming
Jellyfish, you two.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
Waddaya need?

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
You sell jellyfish?

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.843 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] No, that's just
what my hair looks like.

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
I mainly sell blueprints
for weapons and arms,

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.265 position:50% align:center
but I've got plenty of
food up for grabs, too.

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:17.227 position:50% align:center
Like this 100%
pure scorpion honey!

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.896 position:50% align:center
Mm! Melts in your mouth!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.940 position:50% align:center
We just need to
fill our stomachs.

00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
You got any coal bread
or salt mochi?

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
I don't waste my space
carrying poor people food.

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
Hey! Check it out!
Butter-flavored Bisco cookies!

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.243 position:50% align:center
You probably love
these, don't you?

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.912 position:50% align:center
I've never tried them before.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
We Keepers rarely get a
hold of that kinda stuff.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.875 position:50% align:center
I have to get them now!

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
One pack of these
cookies, please!

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.546 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
That's all you want?

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
Whatevs. Four sols a pop.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
You're cheap enough to charge
the guy who saved your life?

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
You're darn right I am!

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
You cost me a shiny sol since
I couldn't claim your bounty,

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
not to mention my Escargot,

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
so I have every
right to be stingy!

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.313 position:50% align:center
How boring. Might be
my lamest sale ever.

00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna go to sleep,

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
and it's a hundred sols
if you touch me now.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.862 position:50% align:center
Oh. Half that for the
Panda Boy, though.

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
Just shut up! No one cares!

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Bisco, getting mad
only makes you hungrier.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:25.962 position:50% align:center
Like it? Do you think
it suits your namesake?

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
Or not so much?

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I thought it'd
be a lot more tough.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
Because Bisco means "strong."

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
But the flavor's wholesome.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.223 position:50% align:center
I figured it would taste
like a bear's liver.

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:39.476 position:50% align:center
Why would you think
it'd taste like that?

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:43.271 position:50% align:center
Snacks are more indulgent.
You at least think it was good?

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah. Not bad.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Hey! That one was
mine! I was saving it.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
Can't sell gas to
a crab-riding duo.

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
And too old to keep
toting around.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.714 position:50% align:center
Is that an earthquake?

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
Hey, wake up, Milo!

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center
[TIROL screams]

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
That temple. It was for more
than cleansing weapons.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.023 position:50% align:center
The memorial itself is a weapon!

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Ah! Help me!

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.611 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Let go, damn tightwad!

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.321 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna be
left behind, please!

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:36.282 position:50% align:center
What the heck?! Where'd this
freakish strength come from?

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
Any idea what we're up against?

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Milo!

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
This thing is what's known
as a Coal-Eating Shrimp!

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.874 position:50% align:center
It eats bonecoal!

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
The fuel Jellyfish tossed
on it earlier woke it up!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] If it runs into the
Ashio Mines, they'll explode,

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.343 position:50% align:center
and we won't be able
to use the railcar!

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
I'm too young, cute,
and cool to die!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Damn it.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
I can't handle this thing
with her clinging to me.

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
It's up to you to make it stop!

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.106 position:50% align:center
You're kidding! How do
I stop a living island?

00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Crack its skull open!

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:13.570 position:50% align:center
Rattle its brains and even this
oversized prawn will stop!

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.613 position:50% align:center
Actagawa's claw could
do it in one swipe!

00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
Come on, don't ask
the impossible

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
from a novice crab rider!

00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.831 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:30.086 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
My partner put his faith in me

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
to make this monster stop.

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
If he thinks I can
do it... then I can.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:41.473 position:50% align:center
Actagawa, jump up
and hit its brow.

00:19:41.556 --> 00:19:43.391 position:50% align:center
That's its weak point.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:54.277 position:50% align:center
Right there! Do it now!

00:19:58.198 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
Heads up!

00:20:04.287 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:07.499 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell ya?

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
You have a natural talent
for crab handling!

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
[MILO yelps]

00:20:28.645 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
So, um...

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.191 position:50% align:center
...is every opponent
you face super insane?

00:20:33.274 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Nah.

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
Never been head-to-head
with a temple before today.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
That said, I'm sure the
ante will be upped tomorrow.

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
The way of a Keeper.
It's the star we're born under.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
I highly suspect no
other Mushroom Keeper

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
shares this star with you.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.877 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Behold the mine entrance. Heh.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
What a close call.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
If that thing had kept
barreling on through,

00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
it would've blasted the
entire mountainside to--

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.139 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:07.976 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Damn it! How?
How is that possible?

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
Bisco...

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
One closed door doesn't
mean all hope is lost.

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
We just gotta find
an open route.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
And with so many
mushrooms sprouting

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
on this trigger-happy giant,

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:26.369 position:50% align:center
the Rust will soon be
gone in this region.

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:30.498 position:50% align:center
Jabi would enjoy that,
much more than your demise.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
[MILO screams]

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
That weird girl ran off
and she took my money with her.

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna catch her, and then
steam that jellyfish alive.

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.058 position:50% align:center
[MILO sighs]

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:51.978 position:50% align:center
At least I put half of my
sols in your wallet. Uh.

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.271 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Dear Panda,

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
if Akaboshi dies,
come team up with me, okay?

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
Look at that. She left all
kinds of goods for us to use.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
I guess she took
the money as a trade.

00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:08.411 position:50% align:center
So she forced us to buy them.
Which is still crap. Uh.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
Hey, when did
Actagawa let you...?

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:14.793 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Those wounds.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:18.004 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:19.130 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
What?

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:20.965 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Nothing.

00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:41.778 position:50% align:center
[stomach growls]

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:42.904 position:50% align:center
[MILO groans]

00:22:42.987 --> 00:22:46.199 position:50% align:center
I'm so hungry right now.

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:49.994 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:55.959 position:50% align:center
A watermelon!

00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.419 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Where?

00:23:01.756 --> 00:23:03.258 position:50% align:center
[BISCO yells]

00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
Hands off! That's my fruit!

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.849 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Get back here!

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:16.479 position:50% align:center
Dumb brat! Let go!

00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:19.399 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't treat
kids so violently.

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:34.372 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
In this warped world,

00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:37.625 position:50% align:center
kids often attack adults and
rob them blind just to get by.

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:41.129 position:50% align:center
But they should be a little more
selective with their targets.

00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:43.548 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Children's Fortress."

00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.509 position:50% align:center
So, how much do I get
paid for recording this?
