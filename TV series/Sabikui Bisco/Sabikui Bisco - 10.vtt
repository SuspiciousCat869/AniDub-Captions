00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect time to
say something cool like,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
"I'll be back!"

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center

I'd rather you do the honors.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
ground into dust, and nothing
but a soul remains...

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
...will I be able

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You can count on it.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center

[TETSUJIN]
Akaboshi.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
Where in the world is it going?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.177 position:50% align:center
Seems it's heading south.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
We have to act.
We can't just sit here.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
[WATCH B]
I know, but...

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.143 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] There are zero
"buts" in this situation!

00:16:17.227 --> 00:16:19.854 position:50% align:center
Times like these are what
the Watch is for, right?

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.315 position:50% align:center
Hang on, who is this girl?

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
Someone who knows what
will happen if you hide.

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
The city of Imihama
will end up like Tokyo!

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
You're kidding! It can do that?

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
I just realized.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
The captain ordered us not
to move from this base

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
till she gives the okay.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
[WATCH A] You were
saying we can't sit back

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
and watch five seconds ago!

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[WATCH B] Now I'm saying
we'd only die in vain!

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
Without Captain Pawoo's
skill and support,

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
fighting it would be pointless.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
For crying out loud!

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
[speaking foreign language]

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:21.416 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN]
Akaboshi.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Kurokawa!

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN]
Huh?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.467 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You must be pleased
you got a new body,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
and it's only slightly bigger
than your old one.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
What, don't tell me you
thought I was dead.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
Thought you managed to
bring me down with you?

00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
Well, think again
if your brain even lets you!

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
You know my name,
so let's hear you say it.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
You can curse it all
the way back to hell.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
Because I'll drag you there
till you stay dead!

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
Nope, not today. Or tomorrow.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.626 position:50% align:center
I won't Rust. Because I have
the Rust Eater in my veins!

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
What a crybaby.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
Do mushrooms really
hurt you that much?

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.354 position:50% align:center
See, mushrooms are life!

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
They're the very
will to live itself!

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
And since you're
bent on destroying,

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:15.530 position:50% align:center
they'll bloom all
over and devour you!

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.960 position:50% align:center
Look out!
He's aiming right there!

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Actagawa!

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
Let 'em rip! Fire away!

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.227 position:50% align:center
Keep shooting,
m'boy! Don't stop!

00:19:46.311 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
The hyphae are
already digging in!

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
Keep the pressure on
and victory's ours!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.155 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:19:57.238 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Right!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.955 position:50% align:center
[JABI] This way,
tall, dumb, and rusty!

00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
[JABI yells]

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
[MILO] When you're up
against Mushroom Keepers...

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.468 position:50% align:center
...you're point two
seconds too slow!

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:37.070 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:44.244 position:50% align:center
Great. That's as dead
as an end can get.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
Well, shit. How many
arrows will it take?

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Too many.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
His strength's unreal.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:57.465 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
Acting pretty strange.
What's he doing?

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:21.573 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
He's going to fire!

00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
Jabi!

00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
[MILO screams]

00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
[roaring]

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:35.415 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] You know,
as strange as it is to say,

00:23:35.498 --> 00:23:37.167 position:50% align:center
win or lose, live or die,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.419 position:50% align:center
at the end of it all,
I think I had fun.

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:40.628 position:50% align:center
Honest!

00:23:40.712 --> 00:23:42.630 position:50% align:center
Next time: "I'm Bisco."

00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:46.760 position:50% align:center
Actually, I take back what
I said. Go win, Bisco!
