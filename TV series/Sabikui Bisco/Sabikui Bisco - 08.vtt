00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.896 position:50% align:center
I activate Hellfire Hammer

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50% align:center
to attack your Life
Points directly.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.777 position:50% align:center
Well? How will you block?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.737 position:50% align:center
[BLACKSUIT]
I'm afraid I lose.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:57.492 position:50% align:center
What? Come on.
That can't be right.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50% align:center
This Brass Shield card would
be the perfect counter

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:03.581 position:50% align:center
to my attack.

00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
Once you defend with that,
you can use Verdant Tree Sprout.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.920 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I lose.
I'm afraid I lose.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:13.258 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I lose.
I'm afraid I lose....

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.761 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Forget it. You're not listening.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:22.058 position:50% align:center
I swear, can't even play
a simple card game.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:26.354 position:50% align:center
What's the point of living if
you don't know how to have fun?

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:27.272 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:29.065 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:34.362 position:50% align:center
Ah, you finally showed!
I was getting sick of waiting.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Uh, testing. One, two. One, two.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.537 position:50% align:center
This is an official broadcast
from Governor Kurokawa

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.373 position:50% align:center
of the Imihama Prefecture.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
I'd like to issue a warning
to the wanted criminal,

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.795 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi Bisco,
and his accomplice,

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
Doctor Milo Nekoyanagi.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
You two must still be within the
Touhoku broadcast range, right?

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:01.348 position:50% align:center
Then, it's showtime,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Milo, my boy.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
Your sister may be a beauty,
but she's as dumb as a rock.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
So she never guessed
I might have

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.402 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi's old coot
in my custody.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.988 position:50% align:center
The skills she prides herself
on aren't so helpful

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
when a hostage is involved.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
With her inhuman strength,
this woman could easily

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.246 position:50% align:center
reduce me to a nasty
bloodstain on the wall.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.750 position:50% align:center
Yet for some reason I can't
quite grasp, she's come to value

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
a despicable old
Mushroom Keeper's life.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.756 position:50% align:center
Let's allow the offender
to plead her case herself.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Can't think of anything to say?

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
How odd. Maybe this
will inspire you.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO screams]

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Stop!

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:47.727 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA chuckles]

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Milo. Take Akaboshi and run.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
Leave Jabi to me. I'll get him
out of here, so please--

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO screams]

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.906 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Who gave you
permission to ad-lib?

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you to stick to
the script, sweetheart. Okay?

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:09.791 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Do you honestly think
Akaboshi will just curl up

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
and die because that's the way
you wrote it out in your script?

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:17.340 position:50% align:center
Hah. You can't even get one
Rust-eaten woman

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
to do what you want.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Stop improvising!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Akaboshi is strong.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
So unless you're planning
your funeral, brace yourself

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
for disappointment
because he will kill you.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] You crossed one
too many lines! Mouthy bitch!

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.734 position:50% align:center
Die! Die! Die, you hag!

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
What an awful woman.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.911 position:50% align:center
Just can't stop saying shit
that'll give me nightmares.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
Least you can see
how she's doing.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.999 position:50% align:center
She's a feisty one, eh?

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
And she kept tightlipped
about your location

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
and the truth of the Rust Eater.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Although she did provide
me with one injection.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
If you can make this
marvelous medicine, Doctor,

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
surely you know the secret.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
That means you have something
worth bargaining for.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
I will ensure your sister
meets a most brutal

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
and horrifying end exactly
one week from today.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.068 position:50% align:center
You can still save her life
if you exchange, one:

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
The trick to making the
Rust Eater work.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
And two: That red-haired
imbecile you Nekoyanagis

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
are so bent on keeping
out of my hands.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
Plain and simple.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.497 position:50% align:center
Just bring your partner down
to the Shimobuki base

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
and I'll arrange a nice
little date for you both.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Hope to see you sooner
than later. Ciao.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
Where are you hiding Pawoo?

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.133 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] It's quite
amusing to see a monkey

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.678 position:50% align:center
have a physician
so well-trained.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
He's got you looking
as sharp as your arrows.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
Sure, now you're cocky,
but you'll regret taunting me!

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa. Hold your horses.
Let's not be hasty.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
I explained how this
exchange would go down,

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
so quit making it
so complicated.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
I get the things I want,

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
then I'll give you
the thing you want.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
To teach you how to
make Rust Eaters heal,

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.741 position:50% align:center
I'll need some of
the ones you took.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Yes, of course,
and I did take quite a few.

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
You there, bring me
a Rust Eater.

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
He's just one of my pawns,
no need for alarm.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
He should probably get up
off the floor, though.

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
There we go.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
Now, demonstrate how
to make a miracle cure.

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
All right, so, the Rust Eater
is in a dormant state by itself.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
In order to unlock
its true potential,

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
you have to mix it
with other substances.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.656 position:50% align:center
I always knew that you
were a talented doctor,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
but you really have
outdone yourself.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
So, what, pray tell,
did you mix in that vial?

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Uh! He's using
mushroom control! Kill him!

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
What're you doing? Hurry and
kill that bastard right now!

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
Those things were
numbshroom spores.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
How does this brainiac kid

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
have Mushroom Keeper
techniques up his sleeve?

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You shouldn't've
underestimated me.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
That mistake will
cost you your life!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.779 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
After all I've done for you,

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.782 position:50% align:center
this is how you repay
me, you maggot?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'll repay you.
This one is for Pawoo!

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:38.249 position:50% align:center
[screams]

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
This here, this is
for those children!

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:43.129 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
And this one is for Bisco!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
S-Stop it, please! Have mercy!

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
[MILO] I coated the blade
with numbing poison.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
Soon, it'll reach your heart.

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one
who can treat it.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
Let Pawoo and Jabi go or--

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.070 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.283 position:50% align:center
You combined your numbshrooms

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
with the properties
of a bloomshroom

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
to make it erupt like that.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
An idea many a Mushroom Keeper
has dared to dream up.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
Though none were able
to pull it off.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
Since gas masks are ineffective,

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
you'd need knowledge
of medicine.

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
You grow ever more
impressive by the day.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness I thought to make
a numbshroom antidote earlier.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.853 position:50% align:center
I shudder to think about
what would've happened

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
if I didn't have that
in my pocket just now.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
Tell me, how do you
know Keeper tricks?

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
How, you ask? Well...

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time, I, too,
was a Mushroom Keeper.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
Did you poison me?

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.664 position:50% align:center
Not with your everyday poison

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
since you proved to
be fairly formidable.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
You're experiencing the
effects of puppetshroom.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.630 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can surmise
how it earned its name.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
The fungus takes root
in your muscles,

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
and when the microchip
implanted in my brain

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
transmits a signal, boom.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
You move however my mind
wills you to move.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
Just like a puppet.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
A terrifying technique, yes?

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
It's how I control
the men at your feet.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.068 position:50% align:center
Yet despite how
remarkable it is,

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
nobody ever saw it
for its brilliance.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.823 position:50% align:center
The other Keepers called it
heresy and refused to accept it

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:37.494 position:50% align:center
without even considering the
possibilities of mind-control.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.288 position:50% align:center
I respect you. I really do.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm going
to be 100% honest.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.169 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less about
this legendary mushroom's

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
amazing healing power and what
it would mean for humanity

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.632 position:50% align:center
if we found a cure for the Rust.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.426 position:50% align:center
I still need to
monopolize it, though.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
Because guess what revenue

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
the current Japanese
administration relies on

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
to balance its books.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.392 position:50% align:center
Any ideas?

Medicine.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's right.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
Our economy is fueled
by victims of the Rust.

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
People will find
the means to pay

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
as long as they have
the will to live,

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
no matter how high the
prices for meds get.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Now, imagine a Japan in
which this new wonder drug

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
you've developed actually cures

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
all those pitiful
people for good.

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
What would happen
to the villains like me

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
who're making bank off the
Rust Wind and its carnage?

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
That'd be quite the predicament.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Monster.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.586 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA chuckles]

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] If these Rust
Eater injections of yours

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
do in fact work and they
fall under my control,

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
I won't just be a useful pawn to
the central government anymore.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
It will give Imihama the
bargaining chip I need

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.266 position:50% align:center
to negotiate on even terms

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
and upgrade from pawn
status to king.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.313 position:50% align:center
So, be a good boy and
tell me how to awaken

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
the Rust Eater's special
healing abilities.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Do it in the next ten seconds

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.111 position:50% align:center
and I might even
spare your partner.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.572 position:50% align:center
You'll hunt them down and
then get rid of them all!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
This is your very last
warning, Nekoyanagi!

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
Tell me this instant
or die where you stand!

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me?

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
The pigs are hungry,

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
and I'll feed you to
'em alive if I have to.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Giving me the same
damn look your sister did.

00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
You know I can just make
you my puppet, too.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
Here's hoping that you'll
be semi-coherent.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
Even after the fungus burrows
deep into your brain.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Pawoo. Jabi.
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.538 position:50% align:center

Put a sock in it, old man!

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center

of your muttering!

Enbira Keppa...

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE] I know you're
missing some marbles,

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
but this is pathetic.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:05.100 position:50% align:center
And weren't you some Mushroom
Keeper hero in your prime?

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Food. Where's
my food? Give me food.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE]
You truly are hopeless.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
But if you're that hungry,
I guess I could feed you.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.570 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh?

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE]
Poor pitiful man.

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:28.081 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE] Hello? Yeah,
nothin' unusual to report.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
Just bored out of
my freakin' mind

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
guarding this crusty wacko.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
I can't keep this up, man.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
But at least I don't have deal
with the governor's randomness.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE chuckles]

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE]
Yeah. Take care.

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA chuckles]

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] There he is!
Your very own Tuxedo Mask!

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
Looks a few shades paler than
the last time we met, though.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
The Rust is really
eating away at him.

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.027 position:50% align:center
I can tell from here.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.862 position:50% align:center
What're ya trying to say?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
A wounded shark still
has a sardine beat

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
any day of the week.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
That depends on how wounded.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'd wager
I have the advantage.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
Even if my opponent
is the strongest

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Mushroom Keeper in existence.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
What's up with those
bags under your eyes?

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
You losin' sleep
over little ol' me?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
I'm not bothered if I'm livin'
rent-free in your head.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
'Cause come tomorrow morning,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
I'll have forgotten
all about you.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
You'll forget the man
who had Keepers

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.139 position:50% align:center
persecuted the past ten years?

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt that.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.351 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Huh?

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
What if I were to tell you
I'm the one responsible

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
for starting the rumor that
Mushroom Keepers spread Rust

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
and are here to kill us all?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
What then?

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
If I said I sold out
your innocent friends

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.402 position:50% align:center
just so I could
enjoy eating well,

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
would you let it roll off your
back like it was nothing?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
You won't forget me for
the rest of your life,

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
which is just ticking away.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
It was you?

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
I see. Thanks for
spoutin' off like that.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
It's sweeter knowing that
there's a nice helping

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:55.627 position:50% align:center
of revenge on the side.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Akaboshi! Don't move a muscle!

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
I think I'll tolerate you more

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
when your head's
mounted on my wall!

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA yells]

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Come on, is that it?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
Thought you had the
advantage this go around.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
You shot one hell of an arrow.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
If that arm was real,
I'd be dead now.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Bastard.
What did you make Milo shoot?

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
A Rust arrow.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
Much like a Rust bullet,

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
it packs a condensed
dose of Rusty Wind.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
Oooh, your eyes are so scary.

00:14:55.812 --> 00:14:58.690 position:50% align:center
You've got the look
of a cornered animal.

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
I think we should put
another arrow in 'im, Milo.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
No! Please, no! I'm begging you!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
Don't make me shoot him!

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
Throwing tantrums

You're no longer the
panda cub you used to be.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.420 position:50% align:center

someone important for a solid?

Please don't make me--

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
Time's up.

[BISCO grunts]

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
No more. Please don't
hurt him anymore.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:38.188 position:50% align:center
Do whatever you want
with me, but spare Bisco.

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:40.065 position:50% align:center
He's been through enough.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] You have the card in
your deck to make that happen.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.071 position:50% align:center
Just tell me the
Rust Eater's secret.

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
Milo! Don't you dare!

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.657 position:50% align:center
Do it now or Akaboshi dies!

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:52.869 position:50% align:center
The next one I make you fire
will go straight into his brain!

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Milo!

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Mushroom Keeper blood.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
Mix a Rust Eater with the
blood--pure Keeper blood.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
That's all you do.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
That's it. That's how you make
it regain its true properties.

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
It eats any and all Rust
just like the myth says.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:18.186 position:50% align:center
That wasn't so hard,
was it, Milo?

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
Since you were smart
enough to tell me,

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
you're smart enough to know
what comes next, right?

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
I mean, there's no way in hell

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
I can let the two of you
walk out of here alive

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
after everything I've said.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
No, sir, please.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
That'd be a death wish if I did!
Letting you guys go?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Man, I'd be paranoid every
second of every day

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
you'd end me.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.667 position:50% align:center
You two are some
very dangerous fellas.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
Let him live.
Just kill me, okay?

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
Fine. We'll meet in the middle.
This'll be your parting gift.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.717 position:50% align:center
I'll acknowledge your request

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
and refrain from
killing Akaboshi.

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
You are going to do it instead.

This beautifully tragic scene

Those arrows.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Jabi?!

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
Damn shame. Fiendish techniques
are your only strong suit.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
And that's why you'll never
match my mushroom control.

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:58.578 position:50% align:center
[JABI laughs]

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Quick question: Have you
seen my sister anywhere?

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
I looked, but I
couldn't find her.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
Oh. No need to worry, my boy.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
Can't find her if
she's already saved.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
[bang]

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:24.229 position:50% align:center
Room service!

00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Are you Jabi?

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
[JABI] This is an awfully
bleak accommodation

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
for a lovely young lady, no?

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Go on. The sooner you
get outta here, the better.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.370 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
I'll escape, too. After I
mess up some stuff, that is.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
Hurry. If I didn't have it under
control, I would leave with you.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
I swear I'll return your
kindness someday.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Guess that one
must've grazed me.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
[explosion]

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.143 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
[JABI laughs]

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:07.897 position:50% align:center
[JABI] I thought it
couldn't be you two,

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
so I was shocked
when it actually was!

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.527 position:50% align:center
Glad you're okay.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.282 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Who are these guys?

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
Kurokawa's band of bozos.
They sure did find us quick.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:24.748 position:50% align:center
So what? Line 'em up
and I'll knock 'em do--

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Quit acting tough.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
You won't last a minute
in a fight with those legs.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.672 position:50% align:center
Rust is the one thing my shroom
skills can't do anything about.

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.425 position:50% align:center
Listen, Bisco's legs
are his wings.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
Will you heal him and
keep him alive for me?

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.347 position:50% align:center
So we're leaving you again?

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
Really? What's your
plan this time?

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Somebody's gotta
act as your rearguard.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:48.021 position:50% align:center
I'll be right behind ya.

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.857 position:50% align:center
Besides, they made it personal.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
What kind of father
turns a blind eye

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
when someone hurts his own son?

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Go!

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
Jabi!

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Stop them if it's
the last thing you do!

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.877 position:50% align:center
The only target you
guys have is me!

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh?

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.642 position:50% align:center
What're you shroom-heads
waiting for? After them!

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
Bisco!

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
[thudding]

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.380 position:50% align:center
Milo!

00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
Hey, you all right?

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
[MILO] There's an arrow
in your shoulder.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Thanks, but, uh,
you're way worse off than me.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
Try not to talk.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.419 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? The pain?

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
Please, don't die.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.518 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
You dumbass.

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Listen, if there's one
thing I know, it's what I am.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:42.255 position:50% align:center
What about you?

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
Next time: "I Love You."
