Governor Kurokawa. He's

Oh. Thanks. But are you sure?

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center
You were gonna drop your food.

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
[MILO] So, is there not
a single adult here?

All I've seen is armed kids.
Some bandits messing with you?

[PLUM] Schools of flying

[MILO]
Blowfish?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Yes, they eat several
people every year.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
And our weapons are getting old,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center

tougher to get through.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
S'not only me. It's everyone.
It's called "Rusting," right?

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:56.082 position:50% align:center
That's what the Imihama Army
said when they barged through.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
The medicine costs a fortune,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
so all of the grown-ups
left to earn money.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
That Kurokawa guy said he
had work that pays well,

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
but he makes everyone
wear these weird masks.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.387 position:50% align:center
[MILO] How could he do
something like this?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
To children, no less.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
[PLUM]
Huh?

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50% align:center

[ETSUKO]
Drink up, while it's hot.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
Once upon a time,

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
Etsuko and I lived on
that apartment block

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
we nearly died at today.

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
After everyone was gone,
we set up over in this place.

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
So then, what happened here?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:43.296 position:50% align:center
What always happens.
A Rusting outbreak.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
I see. Should've guessed.

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
This is all his fault!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
Whose fault?

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
He was a Mushroom Keeper.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
When he first appeared,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.812 position:50% align:center
he seemed like he
wouldn't hurt a fly,

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
but he ruined everything.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
[ETSUKO] Unfortunately, our town
had to learn the hard way

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
why so many people have come
to fear Mushroom Keepers.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA]
Once he got a place of his own,

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.662 position:50% align:center
he started treating
everyone around

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
with his shroom-based remedies.

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA] Initially,
it looked like his treatments

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center
were doing some real good.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
But then...

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50% align:center
It went from bad to worse.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.848 position:50% align:center
The medicine he used turned
out to be more like poison,

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:38.685 position:50% align:center
'cause all his patients wound up
with Rust from head to toe.

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.313 position:50% align:center
Anyone still alive got
the hell out of here.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
And before we knew it,

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
Etsuko and I were the
only ones who remained.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.487 position:50% align:center
The Keeper left, too.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
And I'll never forget what
he said before he did.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50% align:center
"Much obliged. The experiment
was very worthwhile."

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Bastard.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
More proof the Mushroom Keepers
are spreading the Rust.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA] So rather than
abandoning the town

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
and all our memories here,

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.924 position:50% align:center
we moved into the place that
holds our most special ones.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.885 position:50% align:center
Even though it's a mess,

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
getting it back up and running
is actually our dream, so...

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50% align:center
Silly, I know.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
But people might return
if there was something

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
to lift their spirits here.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA] That's why
we occasionally go out

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
and scavenge for things
we think might be useful.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
D'you see the
playground equipment?

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
We repair 'em and make 'em
better all by ourselves.

They belonged to my dad.

He was our chief and the
best fisherman among us.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Till he stood up to
the Imihama Army

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:16.032 position:50% align:center
and got his head blown off.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
I hate those men.

My dad's mementos remind me

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
That was a nice sob

Etsuko.

She drank her tea?
The whole dang cup?

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:41.368 position:50% align:center
Every last drop. I'm sure.
Her cup was completely empty.

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:43.578 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA] The way she
wielded that pole reminded me

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:47.499 position:50% align:center
of an <i>oni</i> 's club--
more beast than beauty.

Hey, there. Finish repairing

What in the hell is this place?

It's whacha call a shelter.

Here, we're safe from Rust and
prying eyes, so it's perfect.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
It appears it's the two of you

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
who are the ones acting like
bandits in this town.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center

I can't look the other way.

Clean this, bitch!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center

taking effect now.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:27.580 position:50% align:center
Sorry to break it to you, hun,
but we put poison in that tea!

00:12:27.664 --> 00:12:29.791 position:50% align:center
Why aren't you weak?

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
The Rust in my chest was
just aching, that's all.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.963 position:50% align:center
I don't down drinks
I suspect are poisoned.

Looks like my hunch paid off.

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
Figured you were the ones that
set that trap, and I was right.

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
Eat her face!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
[SHIKISHIMA] Well, damn.
This might be it.

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
Dunno 'bout you, but she's
more than I bargained for.

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:08.413 position:50% align:center
I agree. There's only one plan
we can use at this point.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
We did always talk
about how this day

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
would come sooner or later,

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
and apparently,
the answer was sooner.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[ETSUKO] The two of us are
content secluding ourselves

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.923 position:50% align:center

we've made.

Yep.

Won't bother anyone else
or pop anymore tires.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
But in return, we ask
that people like you

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
stop bothering us, too.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center

00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That a railroad map by chance?

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
You can tell from down there?

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda.

[KOUSUKE] Whoa! You got
a shut-down line moving?

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
That's way too cool!

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.335 position:50% align:center
So are you really
a Mushroom Keeper?

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Yeah, but I guess
that doesn't scare you, huh?

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center
No, because I was saved by one.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
I almost died from an
illness when I was little,

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
but Dad said a Mushroom
Keeper cured me.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
So I'm more excited than scared

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
since I've sorta always
wanted to talk to one.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
I mean, I owe you guys my life.

Oh, I know! You're
going north, right?

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.359 position:50% align:center
You should take
this map with you.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:03.611 position:50% align:center
It has all the railway
stations in Touhoku on it,

00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
so it should come in handy!

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but don't give
captives presents?

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
I managed to learn the
whole map by heart,

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
so I don't need it anyway.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
My dad, he...

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.126 position:50% align:center
He used to talk about repaying
the Mushroom Keepers

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.919 position:50% align:center
for what they did.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
And even though he died
before he could,

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
at least I can repay
the favor for him!

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.637 position:50% align:center

make water real bad!

You have my partner.

Could you please free him?
And hand him over to me?

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.821 position:50% align:center
Oh, almost forgot.
You came with the Redcap guy.

Tsurikubisaki! Haebaoka!

[BISCO]
Last one. Gimme a name.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.951 position:50% align:center
Um... Konakidani! That's it!

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:25.707 position:50% align:center
[KEWPIE]
That was awesome!

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.751 position:50% align:center
He got 'em all!

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.756 position:50% align:center
Oh, man! I won't forget
this day as long as I live!

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
That was the most
epic thing ever!

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Don't forget this either, okay?

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.430 position:50% align:center
The next time you see a
Mushroom Keeper in need,

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
give 'em a hand.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.477 position:50% align:center
Might form a bond
that benefits you, too.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.188 position:50% align:center
Or at least, that's
what my mentor says.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.648 position:50% align:center
Right! I can do that!

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.068 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
Actagawa!

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.781 position:50% align:center
Catch ya later!

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
Milo! Let's get back
on track! Come on!

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.459 position:50% align:center
[PLUM gasps]

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.128 position:50% align:center
Please, sir, don't leave us.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
We all think you're great
and we need you to survive.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
This town doesn't need me.
It needs someone like you, Plum.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.681 position:50% align:center
This world may be
cold and cruel,

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
but your heart is warm and kind.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
You sincerely care.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:30.271 position:50% align:center
You're a doctor in the making,
I can already tell.

00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Um, will we meet again?

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
But you'll meet someone way
better in the meantime.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:41.616 position:50% align:center
[grumbling]

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.618 position:50% align:center
[NUTS]
Akaboshi!

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] You decided to
hand it over after all.

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
[NUTS]
Don't get the wrong idea!

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.626 position:50% align:center
I was trying to kill
you and I missed.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
"Thank you for
rescuing our town"

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
should not be hard to say,
but what do I get instead?

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
Dirty looks 'n' death
threats, I swear.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.344 position:50% align:center
[MILO laughs]

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Can't be honest, huh?

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
Yeah. For real.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
Did you mean him or me?

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
So much for "I hit that geezer

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.525 position:50% align:center
dead on with the machine gun."

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
What an utterly
useless jellyfish.

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:20.989 position:50% align:center
I take a look around
since there's no body,

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
and I find this.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
[IMMIE]
Sir.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
We searched every
inch of the tunnels,

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
but were unable to locate
the suspect anywhere.

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] Hmm, I see.
A wasted effort, then.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.804 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:44.888 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] An experienced
hunter doesn't turn tail

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
and run when he's chased.

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
He tries to catch his pursuers
off-guard and outmaneuver them.

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
Clever.

00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
But luckily,

00:21:55.899 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
I know how both hunters and
Mushroom Keepers think.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.655 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:33.913 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
Snowfields are the setting

00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
for many a famous movie.

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.543 position:50% align:center
The extreme cold makes
for extreme drama,

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.253 position:50% align:center
but these guys
will turn anything

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.422 position:50% align:center
into a corny action flick.

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:44.632 position:50% align:center
Next time:
"Companions and Prey."

00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:46.593 position:50% align:center
Try not to get burned.
