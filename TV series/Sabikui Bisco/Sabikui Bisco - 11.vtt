can save your sorry soul.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
But rest easy, Kurokawa.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.531 position:50% align:center
Because I'm here to
settle things with you

00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
once and for all!

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.370 position:50% align:center
Now, let's pick up
where we stopped!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
[NUTS]
I can't believe you're here!

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid. You did great.

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:13.400 position:50% align:center
Made the Calvero
fishermen proud.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
You're true leader.

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
So go take charge
and get everyone

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
as far away from
here as you can!

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center

Uh. Right.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.076 position:50% align:center

[KEWPIE]
Nuts! This is our chance!

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
Let's get to higher ground!

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
[NUTS]
Yeah!

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
Kurokawa!

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
[NUTS] What gives?
Why's the panda alone?

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't Akaboshi be with him?

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.189 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Actagawa!

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO yells]

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
Pawoo?

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
And Jabi.

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.969 position:50% align:center
No way! Is that Tirol?

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.847 position:50% align:center
These ladies happened
to pass me by on the road.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
You'll be happy to know I got

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.184 position:50% align:center
a good, long rest
on the way here.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
Didn't expect to find you alive.
Color me impressed, Panda Boy.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] You can talk later!
The Imihama Watch is en route!

00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
They can take the
children somewhere safe!

[TETSUJIN roars]

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center

Trying to run?

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
I won't let 'im!

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
Follow after my brother!

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.513 position:50% align:center
Copy that!

[LADY C]
Hey, isn't it kinda noisy out?

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
A little birdy told me
the Watch was mobilizing.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
[LADY B] Probably another
exercise, I bet.

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
Come on now, ladies.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
Quit lollygagging and
do something productive.

Madam!

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
This is bad! Here, look!

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
Just a bit more. Nice work!

[MILO]
Wait. What's he doing?

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
Something's off. Give 'im
distance! And step on it!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[PILOT A]
What? This wind--!

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

[JABI]
Hm?

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:34.244 position:50% align:center
Is this as far as we go?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
We were nearly there. Damn it!

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
A red injection? Is that
from a Bishamon shroom?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
Your body won't last
long if you take it.

Would you be trying to
stop me if I were Bisco?

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
My boy.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.475 position:50% align:center

[MILO] Is your brain too
small to remember, or what?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.992 position:50% align:center
I'm your sole opponent
in this fight!

How am I still standing?

Hey, Doc.

I was just about to cross over
when I heard your voice.

00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
You called, right?

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:35.623 position:50% align:center
[MILO] There are two
rules for using a bow.

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
Rule one: Keep the
target in your sights.

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:41.713 position:50% align:center
Rule two: Just believe.

Next time, "Bow and Arrow Duo."
