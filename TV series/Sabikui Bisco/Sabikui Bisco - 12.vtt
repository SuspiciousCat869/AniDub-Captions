[MILO]
Please come back.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Please, Bisco!

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:55.365 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Bisco!

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
[BISCO yells]

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.272 position:50% align:center
Bisco?

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.358 position:50% align:center
Hey, Doc.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.820 position:50% align:center
I was just about to cross over
when I heard your voice.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.036 position:50% align:center
You called, right?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.668 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Ow! You are hot!

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:51.629 position:50% align:center
Like temperature-wise? Am I?

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50% align:center
Your arm, it has
an orange glow.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
Whoa! The hell's
goin' on with me?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Watch out!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Here, catch!

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.403 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
Is that Akaboshi? But how?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN groans]

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.243 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Rust Eaters!

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
No way. They're
all fully awakened.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
But how is this even possible?

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.335 position:50% align:center
Not only did Bisco
come back to us,

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50% align:center
but he came back as a god.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.927 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Unreal.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50% align:center
What happened to me?

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
So weird. All of my arrows
are sprouting Rust Eaters.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
This unstoppable power's
surging through me.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
Feels like I'm on fire.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.038 position:50% align:center
You aren't emitting embers.
Those things are spores.

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
Which means, right now,
you're practically...

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN]
Akaboshi.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Guess I'm not the only
bastard still breathin'.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.395 position:50% align:center
Hey! Hold on!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
I'm coming, too.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Well, of course you
are, you idiot.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Nice catch! Now use it wisely!

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
Milo! C'mon!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
Listen, think I figured it out.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
You're half-Rust Eater,
half-human.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
What're you saying? Now I'm
some hum-shroom monster?

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
Remember when the Pipe Snake
swallowed us whole?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.017 position:50% align:center
Well, I think some
Rust Eater spores

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
must've got inside you and mixed
with your Keeper blood.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
All that went in one ear
and out the other, Doc.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
Explain it once we
beat the big guy.

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.904 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You aren't worried about
what's going on with your body?

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Not even a little bit?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
Why would I worry?

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
As long as you know,
that's good enough for me.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
All right then, let's do this.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] You can stop,
Actagawa. He's in range.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
Don't fire yet!

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN roars]

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.807 position:50% align:center
It's swelling up.
Like it's gonna pop!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.728 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi, wait!
Whatever you do, don't shoot!

00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Tirol?

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.022 position:50% align:center
According to the manual,

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.441 position:50% align:center
that's a sure sign it's on the
verge of self-destructing!

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
Loose a single arrow
and you'll set it off.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
This place'll be a smoking
crater, just like Tokyo!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
It's a time bomb?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Imihama would be caught
in the blast at this distance.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Yeah, I figured that.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50% align:center
But what am I supposed
to do if I can't shoot it?

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
Uh, guys! I think it's revvin'
up its Rust breath again!

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Nice save!

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.972 position:50% align:center
Your new power's amazing, Bisco!

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I can't control it, though.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
Only used a little bit,
but they grew like crazy.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
What's really crazy

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
is the amount of
Rust that's spewing.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Damn it. We're gettin'
nowhere fast like this.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Tirol! Does the manual
say how to stop it?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
Ah! Patience is a virtue,
ya know, so gimme a sec!

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.289 position:50% align:center
I'm doing the best I can here!

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
Tracing back from the heart...

00:06:56.082 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Uh, if the blood vessels
are connected like this...

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
Then where are its
commands coming from?

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
It doesn't have
an independent AI,

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
so how is it self-destructing?

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.639 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:13.058 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
I got it!

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
The detonation trigger is
tied to the pilot's brain!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
And that whole exoskeleton,

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.523 position:50% align:center
it's protecting the connection
to whoever's in control!

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
Looks like the only way to
get the countdown to stop

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
is if you shoot through its
head and kill the operator.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
Which would be... Kurokawa.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
Cool. Brain shish
kebab comin' up.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Let's think this through!

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
The head's huge

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
and we can't pinpoint where
our target is exactly.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
If you miss, the shock
from arrows that powerful

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:45.507 position:50% align:center
will cause the whole
thing to explode.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
It'll explode anyway
if we just sit here!

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
I think we'd regret not acting
a lot more than doing something.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.102 position:50% align:center
So if we split the iron mask,
we'll be good to go?

00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Pawoo. You can't!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
He's right. Not unless
you've got a death wish.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
Let Actagawa and me do it.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:08.655 position:50% align:center
The crab? He's way too
strong, with no control.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:14.494 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] My technique has always
utilized the art of mercy.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
Which is why I know
how to shatter armor

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
without causing shock waves.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
It's as if I've been training
my whole life for this moment.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
"Art of mercy," my butt.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:26.673 position:50% align:center
You're talkin' to a guy

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
who's been on the wrong
end of your stick.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
How can your sister spout such
lies with a straight face?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
That's an awfully rude
and insensitive thing to say

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.601 position:50% align:center
to someone heading
off to her death.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
Truth be told,
I don't ask for much.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
But for a sacrifice like this,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
I would appreciate
a "thank you."

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
Okay. Where'd this come from?

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:54.659 position:50% align:center
[BISCO gasps]

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
If you come back alive,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
how 'bout I give you
whatever you want?

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
So enough with the guilt trip.

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
The captain of the Watch

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.252 position:50% align:center
shouldn't be makin'
that face anyway.

00:09:04.336 --> 00:09:08.923 position:50% align:center
Ah. Whatever I want, you say?

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
Ooo.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[BISCO gasps]

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center
What I'd like most
for my reward is you.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[MILO] She'll make an
excellent wife, Bisco.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.613 position:50% align:center
Passion and manners all
in one sweet package.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
What?! She's a beast!

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You both are, so you're
perfect for each other.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.328 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Oh, shut up.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
Well, it's been real, but I've
done all I can to help you,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.879 position:50% align:center
so I'm outta here.

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.673 position:50% align:center
Wait, before you go.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Tirol. You risked
your life for our sake.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
You, uh, saved me twice before,
so we're square, Panda Boy.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
But that's beside the point.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:01.643 position:50% align:center
E-Even if I didn't owe you,

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
friends in need
are friends indeed.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
Or however that
dumb saying goes.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Akaboshi!

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
If you die, your ghost
better not haunt me!

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
Mister Jabi,
mind giving a girl a lift?

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
How high?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
[roars]

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
[JABI laughs]

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center
Hey, Bisco! Remember where
our journey began?

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
We've come a long way!

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
Better not let your
guard down now!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
If you kick the bucket
right at the finish line,

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.305 position:50% align:center
I'll follow you down to hell and
punch you into your next life!

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
[JABI] I've had my fill of jokes
about death and the afterlife.

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.102 position:50% align:center
We've made it this far,

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
so let's talk like we're gonna
see it through to the end!

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
Though, maybe for luck,
should I say a prayer?

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
No, I'm good. I just kissed
the lips of a living god.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.406 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess you
did, young lady!

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
You're kinda goddess
level yourself!

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.119 position:50% align:center
Fire away, Actagawa!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.459 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
My staff... My life...

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
This is the moment
they were meant for!

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.131 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO yells]

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
Pawoo!

[roars]

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:38.615 position:50% align:center
Hot damn! Pulled it
off without a hitch!

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[MILO gasps]

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
Its forehead! See that?

00:11:44.496 --> 00:11:46.831 position:50% align:center
It really is him.

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
Madam? So, like,
what's going on?

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Hush your mouth and watch, hun!

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN roars]

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
[JABI screaming]

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.664 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Wow. That was
a pretty clean shot.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
You could stand to praise
me like that more often.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
[TETSUJIN roars]

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.423 position:50% align:center
You like to imagine
we're worlds apart,

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
but when it comes
down to it, Akaboshi,

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
you and I are the very same.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:44.973 position:50% align:center
While it's true that you're
the strong and righteous hero

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:50.020 position:50% align:center
and I'm the cold
and cunning bad guy,

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.063 position:50% align:center
I simply won't give up and die

00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
when the credits of
my life start to roll.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:13:00.613 position:50% align:center
So in that respect,
I'm just like you!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:07.037 position:50% align:center
Now disappear and
don't come back!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.793 position:50% align:center
[BISCO chuckles]

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Take the shot, Bisco!

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.597 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
There are two rules
to archery. That's it.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Rule one is...

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Keep the target in your sights.

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
And rule two?

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Just believe.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
I'll act as your eyes, Bisco.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:49.204 position:50% align:center
[MILO] So believe in me
and draw the bowstring back

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
with as much power as you want.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
It'll hit. Dead on.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center

[screams]

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
I think this means
we actually won.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Hm?

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.187 position:50% align:center
Your face! It's clear!

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Seems I owe your son
a "thank you" of my own.

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Hm?

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.616 position:50% align:center
Hey! Speak of the devil!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
They're both okay!

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
Shame on Bisco, though.

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:15.248 position:50% align:center
He made us believe he was
dead twice in one day!

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
Hm? Are they unable to get down?
Should we help 'em?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
No, not yet.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh?

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.760 position:50% align:center
Let's give them time.
Just a little longer.

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
If we interrupt them now,

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
I doubt Milo will ever
talk to me again.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center
Why? Two of you get along great.

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
Exactly right.
That's how I can tell.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:44.569 position:50% align:center
[MILO] We only set out
to save two people.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
Things took one
heck of a turn, huh?

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.574 position:50% align:center
With the amount of Rust
Eaters that we have,

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
we can cure everyone.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
Not only in Imihama--
the whole country!

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I'm more of
a "big picture" guy.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
Nah. I think you're just
not a minor details guy.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
Come on, I can be
detail oriented.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
[MILO] You're like those
easy-to-open packets

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
that still won't open till
someone uses their teeth.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Time out. Yours truly
just saved all of Japan.

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
So watch the smart
remarks! Yeah?

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.563 position:50% align:center
Bisco?

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Uh, Doc?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
Your heart. You really
came back to life.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
Now you can keep your promise.
We can be together when we die.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
Never again, okay?
Don't leave me behind again.

00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
Please, Bisco.

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE groans]

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Their independence, huh?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[OTA] Mister Inoshige,
that machine holding up?

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Or has it been givin' you grief?

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
Might only be for the moment,
but it's workin' just fine.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[OTA]
That's good.

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.807 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
What's your problem?

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
Never seen one of the
Man-Eating Redcap's

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
wanted posters before?

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
No, the other one caught my eye.

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:28.108 position:50% align:center
This "Man-Eating Panda."

00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose you know
his story, do you?

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.406 position:50% align:center
Can't be from Imihama
if you don't know him.

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
Milo Nekoyanagi,
or "Doctor Panda."

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
His cute face makes you think
he wouldn't hurt a scorpion fly.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
But he got the "man-eating" name

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.208 position:50% align:center
from killing his patients
and snacking on 'em.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm gonna go
fertilize the king trumpet.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
[BISCO laughs]

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:51.381 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
That kid's right.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
About him looking
harmless, I mean.

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.886 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE laughs]

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE] Probably shouldn't be
sayin' this as a civil servant,

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.474 position:50% align:center
but apart from gullible
kids like Ota,

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:06.062 position:50% align:center
hardly anybody believes he's as
bad as the posters say he is.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:09.190 position:50% align:center
He's a doctor, remember?
A renowned one.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
They say he opposed
the government

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
'cause he would treat people,
free of charge.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
And his generosity got 'im
plastered on a wall.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
[beeper sounds]

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:20.660 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
There.

00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center
Akaboshi is the
complete opposite.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
He really does look
like the kinda jerk

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
who'd take a bite outta you.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
But, ya know, I got a feeling

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.796 position:50% align:center
underneath it all he's
a decent guy, too.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
Just a little extra in the
way he goes about things.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.613 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE]
Huh?

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
The heck are these?

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Rust Eaters. The shots
people are talking about.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
Enough for you and the boy.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:07.123 position:50% align:center
Really? They cost a ton!

00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
You dumbass! I can't accept
a bribe from a monk!

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
I'm a civil official, ya hear!

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Think of them as your reward.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.840 position:50% align:center
Thanks for dutifully
spreading hippo dung

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
on the king trumpet every
week like I asked you to.

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
Now quit your bitchin'
and take 'em, porkchop!

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.224 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
Agh! It's you!

00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ota! He's back! The Redcap!
Do something useful!

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
"The Man-Eating Panda"?

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
Put a sock in it.
I never once ate a patient.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:52.002 position:50% align:center
Shit! The hell?
Ota, what are you doing?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:56.339 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey, look! I think that
kid's taking our picture.

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
Come on, give 'em a peace sign!

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
[OTA chuckles]

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
[MILO] Hey, Bisco. You sure you
wanna "cure" your new body?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.815 position:50% align:center
'Course I am. I don't recall
asking for eternal life.

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
It really is such a waste.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
You're a super-duper
Rust-Eater man.

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
Well, it's not your
problem, Doc.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:23.116 position:50% align:center
When you have mushrooms growin'
all over you, we'll talk.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.118 position:50% align:center
It's disgusting.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.661 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
'Least I won't have to
grow old without you.

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:33.668 position:50% align:center
But it's some task.
We've got a long road ahead.

00:21:33.752 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Maybe.

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.505 position:50% align:center
Everything'll work itself
out in the end, though.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:38.590 position:50% align:center
Know why?

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.175 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Do tell.

00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:42.969 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Because when the two of
us team up, we're invincible.

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:44.637 position:50% align:center
[MILO chuckles]

00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:46.014 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Right you are.

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Wha--? Ugh!
You baited me into saying that!

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:51.478 position:50% align:center
How many times does that
make just today? No more.

00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:52.520 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Yes, more!

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
You hardly ever give
me compliments,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
so I gotta stock up.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Something's wrong with you.
