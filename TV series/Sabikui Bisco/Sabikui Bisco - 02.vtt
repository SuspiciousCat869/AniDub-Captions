[INOSHIGE] Been a while
since I heard a sutra.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.521 position:50% align:center
I'm no believer, but ya
mind reciting one for me?

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.108 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE] Can't a imagine a
priest who'd pass up the chance

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
to spout off a chant.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.279 position:50% align:center

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
[MONK] Take up your weapon,
boy, and become strong.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.910 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, what?

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:01.871 position:50% align:center
[MONK] Live up to the
powerful name "Bisco."

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
The way that was
intended all along.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.711 position:50% align:center
And don't take crap from
checkpoint scrubs who mock it!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.546 position:50% align:center
[INOSHIGE] Yep! I knew
you weren't a priest!

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
[MONK] Now say, "I'm sorry,
Mister Bisco," and mean it!

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.186 position:50% align:center
[OTA] It's Akaboshi. He's
the Man-eating Redcap!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
Who're you callin' "man-eating"?

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:35.488 position:50% align:center
[OTA] Mister Inoshige!
We have a problem!

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:39.409 position:50% align:center
Look! Mushrooms! Big ones.
And they're getting bigger!

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Captain Obvious. Run!

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
Grinding up shimeji's no good.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:53.006 position:50% align:center
Not for healing, at least.
Best to eat 'em raw.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
Use lurkershrooms.
These have more medicinal value.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.678 position:50% align:center
Here. Try it.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
What? You crazy?

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
I can't make my own
meds! It's a crime!

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50% align:center
You just were.

[grunts]

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.730 position:50% align:center
The three guys I threatened
all gave me your name.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
Said you're the best.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.693 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I'm short on time.

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center
If you waste any more of it with
your whining, you're dead.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
Smells like a Salmo Rot Shot.

[BISCO]
Hm?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.622 position:50% align:center
[MILO] That man.
Was he hit by an Escargot?

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
You can't put bandages
directly on the wound!

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
The rot will only get worse!

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:30.669 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
An injection won't
save his life.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
You're naive to think it would.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.133 position:50% align:center
And you're naive if you think
that I won't really kill you!

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
I'm just telling
you like it is!

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
This wound won't heal if
it's not treated properly.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.891 position:50% align:center
Please let me operate on him.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
Because at this rate,
that old man's going to die!

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
[BISCO sighs]

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
Have it your way, doc.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
But synthesize this first.
How long will it take?

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
Depends on what's in it.
But at least 20 minutes.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
Do it in ten, okay?

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] The hell are
those masked creeps?

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.423 position:50% align:center
There's no way they're

Attention, Akaboshi Bisco!

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.680 position:50% align:center
Due to your 28 prior
counts of terrorism,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
the governor of Imihama has
ordered you to be terminated

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
Surrender now or
be killed on sight!

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Might wanna consider
who my hostage is

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.314 position:50% align:center
before you open fire!

If one more shot grazes this

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center

[MILO yelps]

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] You'd think they'd
at least hesitate.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
Damn, man. They've got
zero love for you.

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:02.093 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Sure seems that way.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
They'll be storming in soon.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.265 position:50% align:center

blow up this hospital.

Right.

Judging from the trail,

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
The Escargot that's escar-gone
was my personal plane.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Of course I will. Along
with his funeral offering.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] You scope out
the downtown area as well.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.822 position:50% align:center
I'll send 20 men with you.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
Seriously? You want
me to fight...

00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:00.243 position:50% align:center
You accepted the
paycheck, didn't you?

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
That sounds better than hanging
for breaking contract, right?

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Gangster governor over here.

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA] You guys need to take
a person's skill into account

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:13.256 position:50% align:center
before hiring them.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.424 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B]
If memory serves,

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.009 position:50% align:center
she got the job because
she said she owned

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
an Escargot in her pitch.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
What's done is done.

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
The alluring lights
of the big city

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
will always draw in worthless
insects like that.

00:11:24.476 --> 00:11:26.728 position:50% align:center
You at least got her to
take the meds, didn't you?

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B]
Yes, I made certain.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
He got the theater, too?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.734 position:50% align:center
So much for hosting
a sci-fi festival

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.529 position:50% align:center
and enjoying back-to-back
masterpieces on the big screen.

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:38.281 position:50% align:center
[ELITE B]
My deepest sympathies, sir.

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
[KUROKAWA]
You moron.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
My thoughts are too complex
for you to understand them.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Tch. What a load of crap.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
Heh. Flourishing right
in our damn way.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Welcome back.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:12.565 position:50% align:center
What's the deal? Has the Watch
decided to come out and play?

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
Didn't see anything
worth mentioning.

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
My posters aren't even up.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.196 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
Since Imihama and
Gunma hate each other,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
I'd expect nothing less.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.369 position:50% align:center
Been years. Dates back
to the governor before.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired of hearing
stories about "the old days."

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's time for your
meds, so get undressed.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.336 position:50% align:center
Hey! How many times
do I gotta say it?

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.131 position:50% align:center
Rust treatments come
before mealtime, old man.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
A tiny taste isn't a full meal.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
Let your mentor enjoy
what little time

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
he has left in this world.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Little time is right.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
It's gonna reach
your lungs soon.

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Stop scowling.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
Busy your mouth
with this instead.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
The fat from the iron mice

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.236 position:50% align:center
really brought out the
flavor of tonight's soup.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
If your stomachs empty,
you won't have the strength

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
to draw your bow when it counts.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.700 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
That's bitter!

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.744 position:50% align:center
Tastes like the guts
are still in there.

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't taste it if
you didn't chew it, you know.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
Just slurp it down
in one big gulp.

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.334 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
If you had teeth to chew with,

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
I doubt you'd be saying that.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
[BISCO laughs]

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] Jabi, we can't use
normal shrooms anymore.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
We need the Rust Eater.

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
I think we should pick
up our pace a bit.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
Soon as we're past Imihama,
there are no more checkpoints,

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.145 position:50% align:center
just straight to Akita.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
[JABI] Bisco, I've taught you
every ounce of knowledge

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
I've learned over the years.

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
Mushroom control.
Crab riding. And archery.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
You're even better
with a bow than I am.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
Though synthesizing medicine

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.994 position:50% align:center
was something you
never really mastered.

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.497 position:50% align:center
On the whole, I've never seen
another Mushroom Keeper

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
that can match your
strength and talent.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
You would think I have
no regrets, but I do.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Bisco, the day
I eventually die--

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.050 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
Listen. One day--

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.887 position:50% align:center
Shut up! No more!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
I didn't battle through
a dozen checkpoints

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
for you to croak on me
at the finish line!

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
Don't act like your life's over
when I'm fighting to save it.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
You honestly wanna
Rust away that much?

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
Never a dull moment
with you, huh, Bisco?

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.780 position:50% align:center
One of my favorites was up
at Shiga. At Mount Hiei.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:26.324 position:50% align:center
You cut the ropeway
with a few quick snips.

00:14:26.408 --> 00:14:28.743 position:50% align:center
Then whoosh! Swung through
like a regular Tarzan.

00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Enough already!

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
This isn't some vacation, Jabi!

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.541 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to keep
you from dying,

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:36.876 position:50% align:center
so quit making light of it!

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.216 position:50% align:center
Next time you go on
another dumb tangent,

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.260 position:50% align:center
I'm punching you.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
[JABI] I've turned a kind
child into a mad fighter.

00:14:51.433 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
I'm probably going to die
and leave you behind, Bisco.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
I only hope someone
comes along afterward.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
Eat up, Actagawa.
You've earned it.

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:06.031 position:50% align:center
I kinda envy you.

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
Always living life at your own
pace, totally stress-free.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center
If only I'd been born
a crab like you.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
Then again, giving people
rides would suck.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Huh?

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.887 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:44.903 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] H-How did he
deflect it like that?

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Huh?

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.032 position:50% align:center
Well, shit.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
What is that thing? A snail?
From Matoba Manufacturing?

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
Why's it here, though?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.459 position:50% align:center
[TIROL]
Let's see you deflect this!

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.587 position:50% align:center
Take cover! That
thing's gonna spew!

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
Hide underneath Actagawa!

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.684 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
That's an Escargot fighter.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
Though it's not flying
the colors of the Watch.

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
So, why's it after us?

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.066 position:50% align:center
Don't waste your arrows
on that heavy armor.

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
Our best bet is to climb the
wall and hide in the city.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
If they aren't part of the
Watch, then what's their deal?

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
They get their kicks
from being annoying?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
[JABI]
Bisco!

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
Run, Bisco. Get out of here.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
[BISCO gasps]

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
[BISCO yells]

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:03.940 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Jabi!

00:17:08.445 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.664 position:50% align:center
[TIROL gasps]

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:31.426 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
I can find a doctor in Imihama.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:35.889 position:50% align:center
I can still save him!
Just hang on, Jabi!

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:42.854 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Well?

00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Six shots.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
Any normal person would've
died twice over from these.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
So why hasn't he?

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:52.906 position:50% align:center
The wounds haven't even affected
his pulse and breathing.

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
Can you save him?

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
It depends on this injection.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.121 position:50% align:center
I'll make an incision and remove
both the rot and bullets.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:03.750 position:50% align:center
As long as his body can make it
through the whole procedure...

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
Wait! Where are you going?

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
We'll only get surrounded again

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
if I stay here and
watch you work.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
So I'll keep our
pursuers confused.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.925 position:50% align:center
Don't die in the meantime.

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You can't go!

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
What the hell are
you doing, Doc?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:16.763 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
You're also badly wounded!

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
Do you have a death wish?

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
Well, tough luck!
I'm treating you, too!

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
[BISCO] I'm fine, Panda Man!
Don't waste time we don't have!

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
Focus on Jabi, not me!

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
You're not fine!

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
And I can't let someone covered
in so much blood just walk away!

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.737 position:50% align:center
At the very least,
can I stitch up your head?

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
Be easier to fight without
blood in your eyes.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:39.160 position:50% align:center
You and I both know you'll
die if you go like this!

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
There. That should work.

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
So, um, does it
still hurt? Or no?

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
Nope. I see why everyone
raved about you.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
The pain subsided?
That's fantastic!

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.514 position:50% align:center
Welp, I'm off.
Take care of Jabi.

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:00.515 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Uh. Um.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
What could you
possibly want now?

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
Oh. Nothing. Just come back
if you get hurt again.

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
I'll be sure to heal you,
Mister Akaboshi!

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Fair enough. What's your name?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm... Milo.
Milo Nekoyanagi.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.074 position:50% align:center
Milo. Huh. Well, um...

00:19:18.158 --> 00:19:18.992 position:50% align:center
[MILO]
Huh?

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the help.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
[WATCH B] Captain!
Akaboshi duped us, ma'am!

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
He wasn't heading to
the governor's office!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:36.634 position:50% align:center
He went west.

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:39.262 position:50% align:center
He's wreaking havoc by
the West Gate as we speak.

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO]
Tell me exactly what you saw.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
[VICE-CAPTAIN A]
Hey! Get the man some water!

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
[WATCH B] Akaboshi's fighting a
bunch of guys in bunny masks.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:49.814 position:50% align:center
The ones suspected of being
the governor's elite task force.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
Yet, despite their numbers,

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.778 position:50% align:center
the governor's men seem to
be no match for the Redcap.

00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.988 position:50% align:center
Tch. He always fights solo.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
Oh, and there's something else.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:01.117 position:50% align:center
Not really sure how
to tell you this.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.118 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.495 position:50% align:center
A short while ago,

00:20:03.578 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
some giant mushrooms decimated
a building downtown.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:11.252 position:50% align:center
It was your brother's clinic.
He's currently MIA.

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.589 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] Lift the barrier
and send Squads Two,

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.341 position:50% align:center
Three, and Four
to the West Gate.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
Then send Squad Nine
to the North Gate.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
Hold on! You aren't planning
to go by yourself, are you?

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
This is a nationally wanted
man we're talkin' about!

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] What part of that's
supposed to scare me?

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
And that, as they say, is that.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
But why'd I get these bozos
instead of the Watch?

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
So strange.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
[TIROL groans]

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] N-Now before you get
all crazy, hear me out,

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
'cause I was against
this from the start!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
My woman's intuition
was screaming

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:56.339 position:50% align:center
you're a kind and just man!

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
I tried to tell the governor,

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
but he still forced
me to do this!

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
Who the hell are you people?

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
What happened to the Watch?

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
[TIROL] It doesn't matter
because I'm quitting

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
all of this life
as of right now!

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
Plus, wouldn't killing
a sweet, innocent girl

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
haunt your dreams
and ruin your life?

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
So, I'll make you a deal.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:15.442 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:17.068 position:50% align:center
[BISCO]
A bike?

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.959 position:50% align:center
Scary. Who taught
you how to drive?

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.298 position:50% align:center
License revoked, lady!

00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:41.009 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Come now, Akaboshi.
Is that all you've got?

00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:34.789 position:50% align:center
[PAWOO] When a red star
meets a blue one,

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:37.959 position:50% align:center
a new constellation is
born in the broken sky.

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:39.878 position:50% align:center
But who would believe
these stars of destiny

00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:42.255 position:50% align:center
would unite amidst such carnage?

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.466 position:50% align:center
Next time: "Tag Team."

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
Divine retribution
shall be swift.
