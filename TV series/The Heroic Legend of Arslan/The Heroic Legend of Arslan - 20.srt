00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,541
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. April.

2
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,166
Crown Prince Arslan issued

3
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,916
the Decree to Pursue
and Destroy Lusitania

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,041
and the Decree to
Abolish Slavery,

5
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,000
prompting numerous lords and
generals from across the kingdom

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,541
to rally to him.

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,750
Thus they found themselves
on the verge of a war

8
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,166
that would prove a turning
point in Parsian history.

9
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,333
[LUCIAN]
Greetings, Your Highness.

10
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,000
I am Lucian, Lord of Ray.

11
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,375
I've come in response
to your decree.

12
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:04,041
I shall be honored to fight
the Lusitanian invaders.

13
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,625
If my prince will have me.

14
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,625
[FARANGIS] The influx of
soldiers has been ceaseless

15
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,458
since His Highness
issued the decree.

16
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,833
The fortress will be
overflowing before long.

17
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,916
This is incredible, though.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,375
To be part of it.

19
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,250
To be so close to something
that will change history.

20
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,000
Incredible indeed.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,416
[DARYUN]
To be perfectly honest,

22
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,375
their number is far greater
than I had expected.

23
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,041
I find it heartening
so many would come

24
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,708
to His Highness' side.

25
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,666
You assumed abolishing slavery
would alienate the lords

26
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,791
and cause resentment among them.

27
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,750
[DARYUN]
Mm.

28
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,708
More than likely the lords
feel it won't be an issue.

29
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,291
Not an issue? How is that?

30
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,625
They'll defeat the
Lusitanians first.

31
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,666
Then, once His Highness
has the throne,

32
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,333
they think his youth will
allow them to prevail upon him

33
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,166
to abandon the Decree.

34
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,208
[DARYUN grunts]

35
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,125
There's another problem.

36
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm sure you've noticed,

37
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
with the increase in
the Fortress's numbers,

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,125
tensions have also increased.

39
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,583
Indeed.

40
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,541
Do you suggest I've come here

41
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,666
intending to cause harm
to His Highness?

42
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,333
[JASWANT]
It is not my habit to trust men

43
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,083
who prowl about His Highness'
room in the dead of night.

44
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,583
I am the Prince's guard.

45
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,708
It is my duty to see that
nothing threatens him. Ever.

46
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,625
You aren't even
from this kingdom,

47
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,958
yet you would claim yourself

48
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,625
as a member of His
Highness's inner circle?

49
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,333
Go back to tending
your water buffaloes,

50
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,833
or whatever it is you do.

51
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,500
Watch what you say
to me, insolent dog.

52
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,333
Don't they call you
the Black Cat?

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,291
Your face is looking
more red to me.

54
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,541
[growls]

55
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,750
By all means.

56
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,041
Stop this foolishness,
both of you.

57
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,083
Or would you do the
Lusitanians' job for them?

58
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,541
Is something wrong?

59
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,166
I heard there was a fight.

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,916
Jaswant and Zaravant
nearly came to blows?

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,125
That has already
reached your ears, then.

62
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,791
[ARSLAN]
Yes.

63
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,000
So, it's true.

64
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,666
There is dissension here
within the fortress.

65
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,000
[NARSUS]
Yes.

66
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,291
I suspect that disgruntlement
and wounded pride

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,666
are at the root of it.

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,875
Some bristle to see those
of lower social standing

69
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,416
in positions of trust
to Your Highness.

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,208
I prefer to treat
everyone equally,

71
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,416
regardless of social standing.

72
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,125
What shall I do?

73
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,750
How can we see this
settled without bloodshed?

74
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,625
Well, Highness, to begin with,

75
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,375
you may consider demoting
me from my current post.

76
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,333
[gasps]

77
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
Surely you're joking!

78
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,250
What're you saying?

79
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,208
At the moment, I'm
His Highness's satruyp.

80
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,708
It is a post equal
to Grand Vizier.

81
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,916
By rights, it should be
given to someone older.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,458
Someone experienced who enjoys
the confidence of the people.

83
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,833
Who would you recommend, then?

84
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,208
Lord Lucian should
fill the post well.

85
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,416
And what of you?

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,458
You aren't bothered by this?

87
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:51,166
So long as I may still command
the army, there is no problem.

88
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,375
This troubles me.
We already have an enemy.

89
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,541
We don't need such conflict
within our own camp.

90
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,958
That is the unavoidable
consequence

91
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,541
of swelling our ranks.

92
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,875
Unpleasant, but not unexpected.

93
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,916
You must be prepared for
such things as commander.

94
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,333
Your Highness.

95
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,375
Enough of this for now.

96
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,375
There is still something
else to speak of.

97
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,708
Let's bring Lord Lucian
into the discussion, as well.

98
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,375
[NARSUS]
One man in the enemy camp

99
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,166
poses a particular threat to us.

100
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,125
The Lusitanians' guest
general, Prince Hilmes.

101
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,125
Hilmes? You mean?

102
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,833
Yes, son of the
late King Osroes.

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:40,333
And, by extension,
Prince Arslan's cousin.

104
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:44,416
He is currently offering his
services to the Lusitanian army.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,208
[LUCIAN] Still alive,
after all this time.

106
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,333
But why side with Lusitania?

107
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,250
[NARSUS] Most likely as
a means to get revenge

108
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,208
and take back the throne.

109
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,875
That is his main objective.

110
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,833
Prince Hilmes claims
he should rule Pars,

111
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,916
by virtue of his parentage.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,875
And, in truth, there is
substance to his claim.

113
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,541
Had circumstances favored him,
he would be Crown Prince.

114
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,666
He's not worthy of the throne.

115
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,958
He's brought harm to the
people of his own kingdom.

116
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,000
Even if he is of royal blood,

117
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,916
I find such actions
to be unforgivable.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,750
I agree with you, Daryun.

119
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,500
A king doesn't harm his own.

120
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,291
Surely the people
deserve better.

121
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,916
[LUCIAN]
Mmm.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,500
I agree, as well.

123
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:33,125
Whatever his reasons,
such conduct is inexcusable.

124
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,541
I have no objection
to continuing to support

125
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,166
Prince Arslan as
the Crown Prince.

126
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,666
Your Highness?

127
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:45,875
[ARSLAN]
It's only...

128
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,833
I heard a rumor after
I was brought to Court.

129
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,791
It was my father who
assassinated the previous king,

130
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:52,541
they said.

131
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,000
[DARYUN]
Uh.

132
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,541
I thought it was a wild tale.

133
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,750
Just something dreamt
up by gossip mongers.

134
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,083
But was it?

135
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:03,125
If my father truly is
guilty of such a thing...

136
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,416
Prince Hilmes's anger
may be justified.

137
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,958
How can I blame him
for wanting revenge?

138
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,166
We cannot know
what truly happened.

139
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,333
But even if the rumor
is true, as you fear,

140
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,416
it does not change what
Your Highness must now do.

141
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,666
Have you the resolve
to defeat Prince Hilmes

142
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,958
and take the throne
for yourself?

143
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,041
We'll drive off the Lusitanians.
That fight must come first.

144
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:45,000
I will see to my cousin later.
For now, we go to war.

145
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,041
Is the burden too great? Or--?

146
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,666
He is still only
14 years old.

147
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
[NARSUS] The uncertainty
regarding his lineage

148
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,208
must trouble him, as well.

149
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,625
[DARYUN]
Hmm.

150
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,583
[GIEVE] So, His Highness
knows he is not of royal blood

151
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,000
and that there is another prince
with a legitimate claim.

152
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,833
Further, his own claim
to the throne

153
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,291
seems to be the result of crimes
committed by his father.

154
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,875
Our prince is sentimental.

155
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,291
He may seek to atone
for his father's crimes.

156
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,500
Perhaps, I don't know,

157
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,208
by yielding the throne
to Prince Hilmes?

158
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,041
Very possible.

159
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,083
You can't think--?

160
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,541
[NARSUS
I'm not alone.

161
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,708
The prince needs to find
his resolve, and swiftly.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,125
He must decide what
the throne means to him.

163
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,291
Is what he hopes
to achieve so paltry

164
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,166
that he can simply give
it up to someone else?

165
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,833
[ARSLAN]
Who is the rightful king? Am I?

166
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,916
[TEMPLE KNIGHT A grunts]

167
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,958
You can live.

168
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,166
All you have to do is renounce
your god and abandon your faith.

169
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,666
Make your choice.

170
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,375
[TEMPLE KNIGHT COMMANDER]
O lord in heaven, be my witness!

171
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,666
[SAM]
It is done, sir.

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,416
There were 140-some Temple
Knights within the castle.

173
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,375
To a man, they have
all chosen death.

174
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,708
Zabul Fortress is ours, my lord.

175
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,458
And what of Bodin?

176
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,916
It seems he fled.
He abandoned his men.

177
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,250
[HILMES] Forsaken by their god
and forsaken by their commander.

178
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,583
Poor, pitiful wretches.

179
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,125
[ÉTOILE'S MAN A]
Lousy assignment.

180
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,458
Scouting Peshawar Fortress?

181
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,541
[ÉTOILE'S MAN B]
A lot of danger

182
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,541
and not even the hope
of good looting.

183
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,916
And you know what I heard?

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,083
Lord Étoile volunteered
for this mission himself.

185
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,125
He sure in a hurry to
make a name for himself.

186
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,625
[ÉTOILE'S MAN A]
Or a tombstone.

187
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,875
[ÉTOILE'S MEN laughing]

00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,458
[ALL gasp]

189
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,625
[ÉTOILE'S MAN B] Lord Étoile!
Uhh, we were just saying--

190
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,958
[ÉTOILE]
At ease.

191
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,208
I'm not going to blame you
for complaining a bit.

192
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,708
[ÉTOILE'S MAN B]
Uh?

193
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,083
You men wait here.

194
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,750
Rest up while I see to
scouting the fortress.

195
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,500
Ah, yessir.

196
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,250
[ÉTOILE] In a hurry to make
a name for myself, eh?

197
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,125
[BARCACION]
I understand how you feel.

198
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:42,541
But I cannot allow you to take
such a dangerous mission.

199
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,875
Your grandfather
placed you in my care.

200
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,875
But that's why I left home
and came all the way here.

201
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,833
I must distinguish myself
in battle as a knight.

202
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,875
Don't you see?
It's worth the risk.

203
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,958
[ÉTOILE]
I must succeed.

204
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,250
I must become a fine knight.

205
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,250
For the sake of my family.

206
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,791
For the sake of
everybody back home.

207
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,958
[ÉTOILE] You have quite a lot
of provisions in your wagon.

208
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,791
[MERCHANT]
Oh.

209
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,791
Haven't you heard?
A whole host of soldiers

210
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,041
have gathered at Peshawar
from all across Pars.

211
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,833
Hey, with so many
soldiers in one place,

212
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,541
they're sure to want some
female companionship.

213
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:50,125
A pretty thing like you would
be more than welcome, I think.

214
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,625
[SOLDIER B]
I can't wait for battle!

215
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,291
I'll kill more of those
savages than anyone!

216
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:14,166
Ha! The men who say that
are always the first to die!

217
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,291
Say that again!

00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,125
Here, let me give
you some more wine.

00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,541
Look at me, girl.

00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,375
You're a bit on
the scrawny side,

221
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,708
but there's nothin' wrong
with that face of yours.

Please, let me fill

[SOLDIER B]
Uhh, sure.

00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,250
[ÉTOILE]
I need to be careful.

229
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,416
[SOLDIER E] I don't know
about freeing the slaves.

230
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,166
That's a pretty drastic proposal
His Highness is making.

231
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,583
And especially before he's even
won the kingdom back, too.

232
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,375
Freeing Pars' slaves?

00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,458
[ZARAVANT]
On May Tenth, we go to war!

234

For the restoration of Pars!

00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,916
And for the Crown Prince!

00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,208
Take back the Royal Capital!

00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
To Ecbatana!

We will triumph!

For Pars and the Prince!

00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,250
These soldiers are unbelievable!

00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,250
You would think
they'd already won.

Save the merrymaking
for after the battle!

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,375
I don't envy you having to
wait on those drunken slobs.

[ALFARID]
Oh.

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Sorry, my name is Alfarid.

254
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,958
I'm a part of
Prince Arslan's army.

255
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:45,291
Since I'm a girl, and not
really a Parsian, either,

256
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,833
soldiers who don't know who I am

257
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,125
tend to look at
me a little funny.

258
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,291
I don't like it,
so I came out here.

259
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,708
[ÉTOILE] Is there discord
among their troops?

260
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,416
Maybe they aren't
solidly united, either.

261
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,333
Well, they can gawk
all they want.

262
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,541
I don't mind so long
as I have my Narsus.

263
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,041
Narsus, huh? Who's he?

264
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,916
[ALFARID] Only one of
the strongest, cleverest,

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,375
and most important people
in the entire army!

266
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,333
Oh, and he just happens
to be my lover, as well.

267
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,500
Your lover?!

268
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,833
[ALFARID]
Mh-hm.

269
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,333
In fact, he's probably
looking for me right now.

270
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,625
Have a nice night.

271
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,666

[ÉTOILE] Using his rank to keep
a young girl as his mistress.

00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,375
Pars is as degenerate
as I had thought!

274
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,708
[SOLDIER B]
Ah! There you are!

275
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,375
I've been looking
everywhere for you, girl.

276
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,958
Why're you out all alone?

277
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,541
Come here.

00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,916
Let go!

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,416
You could do worse for
yourself than me, you know.

280
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,875
I'm a knight, off to
make a name for myself.

281
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,625
I could take care of you.

282
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,625
Truly? A knight?

283
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,458
A knight of Pars!
Shall we go?

284
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,916
[ÉTOILE]
Not a chance.

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,958
Huh?

286
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,500
Unhand me.

287
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,916
A knight is a proud
and honorable warrior

288
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,666
who will fight for the people!

289
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,041
Not a drunken braggart like you!

290
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,333
[growls]

291
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,458
[SOLDIER B]
You can't speak that way to me!

292
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,291
I'll show you, girl!

293
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,291
[ÉTOILE]
That was too far.

294
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,416
What now? Should I run?

295
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,916
No. I might be better
off just killing him.

296
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,125
[ARSLAN]
Pardon me.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,375
Wait, are you...?

298
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,500
[ÉTOILE]
It's the spoiled rich boy again.

299
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,000
I can't believe
he's still alive.

300
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,916
He must be a great deal
smarter than he looks.

301
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
[ARSLAN]
Uh...

302
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,583
Well, I saw you
with that man earlier.

303
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,291
His attentions were unwanted?

304
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,458
[ÉTOILE]
Huh?

305
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,666
Yes. Very.

306
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,833
[ÉTOILE]
He doesn't realize it's me.

307
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,458
He's only unconscious.

308
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,791
Someone passing by
will find him, surely.

309
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,541
Thank you. I--

310
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,583
Best if you're not
found here, though.

311
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,750
I can sneak you out
of here. It'll be easy.

312
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,291
[ÉTOILE]
Uh... Oh!

313
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,125
[GIEVE]
Hm?

314
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,791
What have we here?

315
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,375
What do you find so
fascinating out there?

316
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,291
I was praying that the Goddess
Asashi may guide His Highness.

317
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,791
I can say one for
you if you like.

318
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,291
[GUARD A]
Hm?

319
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,958
The Fortress seems
rather a rough place

320
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,125
for a young lady of
your age to be employed.

321
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,416
What brought you here?
Some type of misfortune?

322
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,375
[ÉTOILE]
Oh.

323
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,916
A-A misfortune, yes!

324
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
My mother is ill,

325
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,125
my father has terrible
lower-back pain,

326
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,375
and all of my siblings are lame!

327
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,166
That sounds awful.

328
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,333
A whole family so afflicted.

329
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,750
Perhaps if you let me
find you a good doctor.

330
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,208
Don't trouble yourself.

331
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,750
No, please. I'd like to help.

332
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,458
I need no help from a heathen!

333
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,708
Did you say heathen?

334
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,750
[ÉTOILE]
Oh.

335
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,375
Heavens, no!

336
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,916
So, anyhow,

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,208
an awful lot of soldiers
seem to have gathered here.

338
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,583
[ARSLAN]
Yes.

339
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:11,708
We are all anxious to
take back the Royal Capital.

340
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,708
You ride to war as well?

341
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,041
Absolutely.

342
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
[ÉTOILE]
Truly?

343
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,625
Perhaps you shouldn't.

344
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,250
You do not look like you
would be much of a fighter.

345
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,416
Are you always this brutally
honest with strangers?

346
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,541
Could you help the war
effort in a different way?

347
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,041
There must be others
better suited to fighting.

348
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,166
Yes, there must be. Far better.

349
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Why go at all, then?

350
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,625
What makes you
want to go to war?

351
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,250
I met someone.

352
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,833
A Lusitanian, actually.

353
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,375
A boy who'd been
brought here as a slave.

354
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,583
[gasps]

355
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,125
[ARSLAN] It was from him
that I first learned

356
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,875
about a country other than Pars.

357
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,083
It had never occurred to me

358
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,750
that ours was not
the only way of living.

359
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,958
He showed me that there
are many types of people

360
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,958
in the world and many ways
a kingdom can be run.

361
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,833
And after that, Narsus,

362
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,458
oh, he's one of
my close companions,

363
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,750
Narsus told me a great
many things about Pars.

364
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:20,041
And I came to see both the good
and the bad of our kingdom.

365
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,416
And there you are.
That is why I go to war.

366
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,458
To make Pars into a better
kingdom. If only a little.

367
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,500
You surprise me.

368
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,708
Surely deciding how Pars
is run isn't your job.

369
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,666
That's what the
king is there for.

370
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,083
But, helping your
country and her people,

371
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,791
well, you don't need
royal blood to do that.

372
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,125
[ÉTOILE] That's a noble
thing for anyone to do.

373
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,666
What is it?

374
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,833
[ARSLAN] Nothing.
I agree with you completely.

375
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,375
I've enjoyed our conversation.

376
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,541
It has been illuminating for me.

377
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,708
In fact, you remind me of that
Lusitanian boy I mentioned.

378
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,916
[ÉTOILE grunts]

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,583
Oh.

380
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,708
[ÉTOILE giggling]

381
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,875
Is that so?

382
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,375
[ARSLAN]
Eh. Uhh...

383
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,000
There're no soldiers here.

384
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,166
Hide in this wagon
for the night.

385
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,625
You can ride out with the
merchants when they depart.

386
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,416
It should be quite safe.

387
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,250
Thank you very much.

388
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,208
Well, then. Take care.

389
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,250
[ÉTOILE]
Uh.

390
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,708
Good luck if you do ride
into battle. I hope you live.

391
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,250
As do I.

392
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,125
[ÉTOILE] I thought he was
just a soft, spoiled boy.

393
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,000
I suppose even Pars
has her decent folk.

394
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,875
[ÉTOILE]
I never did ask his name.

395
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,833
I'll have to pray I don't
meet him on the battlefield.

396
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,625
[ARSLAN]
For Pars.

397
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,375
For Pars and for her people.

398
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,458
[ARSLAN] Daryun. Narsus.
Kishward. Lucian.

399
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,375
Is there something on
your mind Your Highness?

400
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,625
We're going to take
back our kingdom.

401
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,791
All of Pars will be ours again.

402
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,833
Of course. It will
be as you say.

403
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,041
[ARSLAN]
And once we have taken it back,

404
00:21:56,125 --> 00:22:00,041
I will not yield the
throne to my cousin.

405
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,708
Based on bloodline alone,

406
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,333
he is likely better
suited to be king.

407
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,375
But I am the one who dreams of
making Pars a better country.

408
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,458
And I will see it done.

409
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,166
Whether or not
my blood is royal.

410
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,750
Your Highness.

411
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,541
Such conviction.
I am glad to hear it.

412
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,333
I will not waver.

413
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,250
I will need you all.

414
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,458
Can I count on your support?

415
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,333
You need not even ask.

416
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,333
I am at your side.

417
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,875
Indeed. That is true
of everyone at Peshawar.

418
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:41,833
We will fight to see that
your dream becomes reality.

419
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
Thank you all.

420
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:49,083
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. May.

421
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,333
Crown Prince Arslan
gathered his troops

422
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,750
and faced the prospect of
battle with renewed resolve.

423
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,083
The time for war
was almost upon him.

424
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,291
[NARRATOR]
In times of war,

425
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:33,791
friends may become enemies,
allies may turn on each other,

426
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:37,208
and sacrifices may
have to be made.

427
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,750
Next time: "A Song of Farewell."

428
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,875
And thus would the
boy become a king.
