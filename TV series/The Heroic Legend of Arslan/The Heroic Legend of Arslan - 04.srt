00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,291
[DARYUN]
Hello, Narsus!

2
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,791
It is I, it's Daryun!

3
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,125
[NARSUS]
Hush, you raucous bastard.

4
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,500
You'll wake the whole mountain.

5
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,000
Honestly, old friend.

6
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:57,625
A deaf man could hear your bark
from a whole farsang away.

7
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,750
[DARYUN]
Hm.

8
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,208
[NARSUS] My brush just began
to flow across the canvas.

9
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,583
And you chose now to make an
appearance? Dreadful timing.

10
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,458
Ah! Seems as if I've
done a good deed.

11
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,583
I've prevented an atrocious
painting from coming into being.

12
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,833
I deserve a medal.

13
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,083
[NARSUS]
Come again?

14
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:27,583
May I present--

15
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,791
I am Arslan, son of
King Andragoras.

16
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,750
It's a pleasure to meet you.

17
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,791
I have already heard much
about you from Daryun.

18
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,916
Whatever he might've said,
I'm but a simple hermit now.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nothing more, Your Highness.

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,541
[NARSUS]
Elam, our guests must be hungry.

21
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,416
See to a meal for
them, if you would.

22
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,958
Of course.

23
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,541
[NARSUS] Though I'm afraid I've
little hospitality to offer.

24
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,041
Please, do come in,
Prince Arslan.

25
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,541
Thank you very much.

26
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,083
[ARSLAN]
Uhh.

27
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,875
It's best if you don't look.

28
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,916
This is... art?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,333
Is something amiss, Highness?

30
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,916
[ARSLAN] Oh, no! I was
simply stunned by the--

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,791
[ARSLAN yelps]

32
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,000
Your Highness!

33
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,375
[NARSUS]
Ah. Thank you, Elam.

34
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,583
Please help yourselves. It is
best while it's still warm.

35
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,458
Thank you. It looks excellent.

36
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,333
Delicious!

37
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,375
We're coming up on three years

38
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,708
since you hastily
left Court, eh?

39
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,916
Has it been so long already?

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,041
Did you hold an
official post?

41
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,958
Yes. I served as a secretary
prior to my departure.

42
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,500
And quite a service it was.

43
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,291
A cunning scheme of his once
saved Pars from a bloody battle.

44
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,458
Ah. I should love
to hear more of it.

45
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,833
Gladly. You were
still but a child.

46
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,541
[NARSUS] Five years ago,
this all took place.

47
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,833
Turan. Sindhura. Türk.

48
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,375
These three kingdoms formed
an alliance and invaded Pars.

49
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,958
[FEUDAL LORD A] I hear the
enemy numbers 500 thousand.

50
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,000
[FEUDAL LORD B]
Against such a force

51
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,041
our losses will be considerable.

52
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,708
[NARSUS]
My father's passing was sudden.

53
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,125
I present myself in his stead.

54
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
[ANDRAGORAS]
Your name is Narsus.

55
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,875
What is the meaning of this?
Your father said he would hasten

56
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,666
to the capital with five
thousand cavalrymen.

57
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,791
You've arrived with less
than half that number.

58
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,375
I have to wonder why
you even bothered

59
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:05,166
to show your face at all.

60
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,416
My numbers have diminished

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,791
because I freed all the
slaves in my household.

62
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,125
[ANDRAGORAS]
You did what?

63
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,416
As a result, I have no infantry.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
And your cavalry? What of them?

65
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,000
They were appalled
by what I had done

66
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,958
and chose to leave my service.

67
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,750
[LORDS chuckle]

68
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,291
[ANDRAGORAS]
One can hardly blame them.

69
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,708
Your Majesty, if you
give me the chance,

70
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,500
I shall employ a
stratagem that will turn

71
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,416
the Alliance of Three Kingdoms
away from Parsian soil.

72
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,208
That's quite a lofty claim.

73
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:35,166
And I suppose you would require
a hundred thousand soldiers?

74
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,291
I will not need even one.

75
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,250
[ANDRAGORAS]
Then, by all means.

76
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:48,500
So be it.

77
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,541
[LORDS gasping]

78
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,666
[NARSUS]
I thank you for your trust.

79
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,708
[AIDE]
Majesty!

80
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,875
[ANDRAGORAS]
Quiet.

81
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,125
My trust? You have
no such thing, Narsus.

82
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,791
I merely wish to be amused
by the look on your face

83
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,375
when this grand endeavor fails.

84
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,791
[DARYUN]
That night,

85
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,458
Narsus and his men disappeared
from court without a word.

86
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,458
He returned three days later.

87
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,166
And to the great shock and
consternation of many,

88
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,208
he freed two thousand
prisoners of war.

89
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,666
[GENERAL A] Have you taken
leave of your senses?

90
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,791
Do you know how many men
and resources it took

91
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,333
to capture them
in the first place?

92
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,083
Explain yourself!

93
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,583
[growls]

94
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,500
Very well!

95
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,708
[GENERALS yelling]

96
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
We have no time
for such quarrelling!

97
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,375
The Alliance of Three Kingdoms
will fall within the day.

98
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,083
[GUARDS gasping]

99
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,333
Take heed!

100
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,458
We must be prepared to strike.

101
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,750
[DARYUN] That night, just
as Narsus had predicted,

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,750
the armies of the Alliance
of Three Kingdoms

103
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,375
turned on one another.

104
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:04,875
Taking advantage of the chaos,
we put the enemy to rout.

105
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,083
[DARYUN]
And thus, the cavalry of Pars

106
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,166
became renowned across the
continent for its strength.

107
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,666
But how did you
accomplish such a thing?

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,458
Not everyone realizes this,

109
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,041
but one rumor is stronger
than a thousand men.

110
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,750
So I simply sowed one
within each camp.

111
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,250
[NARSUS]
Among the Türkish Army,

112
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,291
the rumor that Sindhura
had betrayed them

113
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,083
and was colluding with Pars;

114
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,291
which was then proven

115
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,458
by the freeing of the
Sindhuran prisoners.

116
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,125
[NARSUS]
As for the Turanian Army,

117
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,416
they were told that the Türkish
army was in league with Pars.

118
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,833
And when I released the
Sindhuran prisoners,

119
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,583
I leaked the information that
Turan and Turk had gotten wind

120
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,708
of the peace talks and
would attack Sindhura.

121
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,416
Thus, beset with suspicion
and rife with mistrust,

122
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,583
the Alliance of Three Kingdoms
fell neatly apart from within.

123
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,750
[ARSLAN] Ah. You are
quite the strategist.

124
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,083
I feel much better
with a full belly.

125
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,500
You have my thanks.

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,000
Please, Your Highness,
there is no need to thank me.

127
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,375
Your father has already
paid me quite handsomely.

128
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,458
In fact, he gave me
ten thousand gold pieces

129
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,500
for the scheme I just related.

130
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,166
What I served you tonight
would not amount

131
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,000
to a single piece of silver.

132
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,458
[NARSUS] Now then, I have the
broad strokes of what happened,

133
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,458
but I would hear the details.

134
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:31,750
The Parsian Army suffered a
crushing blow at Atropatene.

135
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,958
Thanks to the bastard
Kharlan. He betrayed us.

136
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,083
Trenches and stockades.
Fire and fog.

137
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,625
And now a traitor as well.

138
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,041
The Lusitanians must have
a resourceful man indeed

139
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
directing their forces.

140
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,541
My thought, too.
And that's why I came.

141
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,291
His Highness could use
a man of your cunning.

142
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,916
Sorry, old friend.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,291
It's a kind offer,

144
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,416
but I have no interest left
in such worldly matters.

145
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,375
Because you're much too
busy hiding in the mountains

146
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,583
like a hermit and making
bad paintings, huh?

147
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,166
[NARSUS grunts]

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,208
Heed my warning, Your Highness.
This man is not to be trusted.

149
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,250
He may be a Mardan fu Mardan.

150
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,541
He may even be
passably intelligent.

151
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,083
But he lacks the soul
to appreciate art!

152
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,791
I appreciate art! You
simply don't make any!

153
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,500
Trials of men are fleeting.

154
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,791
A work of art is eternal!

155
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,541
The trial we face is
a rather important one.

156
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,791
Even if it's
fleeting, as you say.

157
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,625
If you won't come with us,

158
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,166
I would at least have your
thoughts on the situation.

159
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,666
Your Highness, you may
not like what I have to say.

160
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,375
To be honest,

161
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,166
I hardly know what purpose it
serves in telling you this now.

162
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,500
But had your lord father
abolished slavery,

163
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,416
this may have been avoided.

164
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,125
That is my uncensored opinion.

165
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,666
Though it is due
to such opinions

166
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,541
that His Majesty
loathes me so.

167
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,791
Ah. In that case,

168
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:11,000
my lord father has reason to
loathe myself and Daryun, too.

169
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,458
If one must be hated, one might
as well be in good company.

170
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,166
I cannot lightly refuse
the crown prince,

171
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,250
nor make any promises.

172
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,916
Save this, while you are here,

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,625
I shall do everything in my
power to see to your needs.

174
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,666
Thank you. I'm sorry
for pressing the issue.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,958
[DARYUN] I'm gone for a
moment guarding an envoy,

176
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,458
and what happens?

177
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,750
I return to find you've somehow
gotten yourself banished.

178
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,500
What did you do?

179
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,375
How was it? I've heard
the women in Serica pretty.

180
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,166
Enough, Narsus.

181
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,500
The king has far too
little respect for politics.

182
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:17,916
Skill at war only goes so far.
Atropatene was proof of it.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,208
He overestimated
his own strength

184
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,083
and greatly underestimated
the value of strategy.

185
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,125
I agree. And I certainly hope

186
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,333
Prince Arslan doesn't emulate
his father in that respect.

187
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,125
What do you make of the prince?

188
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,291
In particular, I'm curious
to know what you think

189
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,416
of his character.

190
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,833
He's a good boy.

191
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,791
It weighed heavily on him
having to leave men behind

192
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,125
at Atropatene, and
after Kharlan's betrayal,

193
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,958
he seemed to feel more
sorrow than anger.

194
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,291
He is sensitive and kind.

195
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,125
And that is exactly what
worries me the most.

196
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,666
I believe it's possible my
lord uncle shared my concerns.

197
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,000
You see, he asked me to swear
my loyalty to His Highness.

198
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,291
To him personally, you mean.

199
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,333
[DARYUN] Yes, and other
things he said trouble me.

200
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,916
When it comes to
Queen Tahamenay,

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,583
the King can be indulgent,

202
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
but he seems oddly
cold toward the prince.

203
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,666
The queen's behavior
is odd, as well.

204
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,625
He's her son, but she
keeps him at arm's length.

205
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,833
None of it makes
any sense to me.

206
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,500
Good morning, Elam.

207
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,000
[ELAM] Your Highness,
I hope you slept well.

208
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,083
Thanks.

209
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,458
Please, let me know
how I can help.

210
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,000
Shall I set the, uh--

211
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:12,916
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,791
Please, Your Highness,
do not concern yourself.

213
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,750
I'll manage without your help.

214
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,500
Yes, of course.

215
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,708
[ARSLAN]
You're quite good at that.

216
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,541
I'd be at a complete loss.

217
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,666
[ELAM]
I've had practice

218
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,791
serving Lord Narsus
for all this time.

219
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,458
I have a question,
if you don't mind.

220
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,000
Forgive me for asking,

221
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,416
but weren't your parents
freed from slavery?

222
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,916
[ELAM]
They were.

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,208
It was when the previous lord,
Lord Teos, passed away.

224
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,291
Lord Narsus rose to the position
upon his father's death.

225
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,458
He freed all those in the
household who had been enslaved.

226
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,625
That makes you a
free man doesn't it?

227
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,416
So why do you continue
to serve Lord Narsus?

228
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,791
The choice is mine.
I choose to stay.

229
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,166
Hear me, heathen.
All men are equal!

230
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,166
You know, Elam.

231
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,875
I'm beginning to wonder if
all slaves should be freed.

232
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,125
[ELAM] It is a question worthy
of your consideration.

233
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,875
I recognize those men.
They're Kharlan's creatures.

234
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh? They came all the way
up here to search for you?

235
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,666
How exceedingly diligent.

236
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,500
Kharlan must've
trained his men well.

237
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,083
Uh.

238
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,458
I hadn't thought to ask until
now, but I'm curious, Daryun.

239
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,541
Which route did you
take to get here?

240
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,500
[DARYUN]
Hm.

241
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,083
You fool!

242
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,708
You took the road that passes
Kharlan's castle, didn't you?

243
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,125
You chose that route on purpose

244
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,958
so they would notice
and follow you here.

245
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,833
Your whole plan was to
drag me into this mess!

246
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,208
Take it as a compliment.

247
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,041
This just shows
my earnest respect

248
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,125
for your cunning and
resourcefulness.

249
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,666
You are in a bind now, though.

250
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,166
It's probably best for you
to give up on your "art"

251
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,208
and come serve His Highness.

252
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,583
[DARYUN chuckles]

253
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,125
[NARSUS growls]

254
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,958
We're looking for someone.

255
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,000
Narsus, he who was formerly
the Lord of Daylam.

256
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,250
Am I correct to
assume you are he?

257
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,916
I am a simple mountain
hermit, nothing more.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,125
Are you Lord Narsus or not?

259
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,916
Yes, I am. Seems your
search is at its end.

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,291
Though I'm afraid you
have the advantage of me.

261
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,541
While I've given you my name,

262
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,750
you have yet to reveal
your own identities.

263
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,958
Please, my apologies.
We have behaved rudely.

264
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:05,083
We are here under orders
from Lord Eran Kharlan.

265
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,541
[ARSLAN]
What is he saying?

266
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,333
Since my father
ascended to the throne,

267
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,958
there has been no
Eran but Vahriz.

268
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,916
[NARSUS]
Lord Eran Kharlan.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,875
It almost has the ring
of poetry, does it not?

270
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,000
However, the title can't
have been his for very long.

271
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,333
When I withdrew from Court,

272
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,541
Elder Vahriz held the post
of Supreme General Eran.

273
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,958
Perhaps he has
retired since then?

274
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,208
Permanently retired.
Vahriz is dead.

275

[KHARLAN'S MAN A]
As we speak,

277
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,708
I imagine his wrinkled
old head sits mounted

278
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,500
before the gates of
Ecbatana for all to see,

279
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,458
his gaping mouth urging
those within to surrender.

[KHARLAN'S MEN]
Hm?

00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,916
What was that creaking?

283
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,041
Likely just a field mouse.

284
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
So tell me,

285
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:58,041
to what do I owe the pleasure
of this most unexpected visit?

286
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,625
We seek two of Pars' defeated
commanders, Arslan and Daryun.

287
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,875
They were observed yesterday
fleeing into these mountains.

288

What do you know of this?

Nothing. I'm sorry I can't help.

290
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
You call Daryun a
defeated commander,

291
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,291
but the man I knew would
never lose in battle.

292
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,833
Unless he had been betrayed
by some cowardly dog.

Bastard!

I don't know about that.

295

He was so busy protecting
that deadweight prince of his,

296
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,416
he may have misread
the state of the war.

You should know,

298
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,833
there is one additional
matter that brings us here.

299
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,333
[NARSUS]
And what is that?

300
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,458
Lord Eran Kharlan sends us
with his sincere compliments.

301
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,666
It would greatly please him
if you would come and serve

302
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,333
under his august command.
He recognizes your razor wit.

303
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,458
He also appreciates
your skill with a sword

304
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,958
and would like to have
both at his disposal.

305
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,333
I see.

306
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,541
And if I were to accept

Lord Kharlan's most
considerate invitation,

what reward might I expect
to receive in return?

309

All the privileges that come

310
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,625
with being a member of
the Yaldabaoth Faith.

00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,250
Additionally, the lordship of
Daylam, which you surrendered,

312
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,416
will be restored to you.

What say you, Narsus?

if it means I can stay
well away from your art.

Your Highness, you would truly
appoint Narsus Court Painter?

Doing that would
leave an indelible stain

I would choose

painting my death portrait.

to have his portrait
painted by me.

But do consider.

King Andragoras finds the
very mention of my name

cause him great displeasure.

and what wisdom I may have.

I am at your command,

[NARRATOR] The throngs
of travelers have vanished.

King Andragoras no
longer sits on the throne,

416
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,916
and a cloud of uncertainty
shrouds the Royal Capital.
