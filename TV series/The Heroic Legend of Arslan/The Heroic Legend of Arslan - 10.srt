1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,208
[NARRATOR] Having completed
their infiltration of Ecbatana

2
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,708
and gauged the
likely survival

3
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,291
of King Andragoras
and Queen Tahamenay,

4
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,375
Narsus and Daryun returned
to Prince Arslan's side

5
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,041
to guide and protect
their future king.

6
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,916
[ARSLAN] The six of us can
only accomplish so much.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,833
How can we find more allies?

8
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,958
You must start
by making changes.

9
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,083
You must alter certain policies.

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,333
Ones that have been
long supported in Pars,

11
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,166
but have become
increasingly untenable.

12
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,083
Your royal blood can
only take you so far.

13
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,333
Securing the throne requires the
skilled use of statecraft, too.

14
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,875
I understand that,

15
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,166
but perhaps there is a
more direct stratagem.

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,791
Your Highness, please.

17
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,333
Your place is giving orders,

18
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,583
but you need not be concerned
with every plan we make.

19
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,791
You may leave the minutiae
for us to see to.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,250
[NARSUS]
As a monarch,

21
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,458
you simply make clear what
you wish to accomplish.

22
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,500
[gasps]

23
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,166
[NARSUS] Tell us
your aims, Highness,

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,500
and it will be our pleasure
to see them achieved.

25
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,833
Then I'm counting on you.

26
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,208
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yell]

27
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,875
[GIEVE]
How many in pursuit?

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,458
[NARSUS]
Five hundred cavalrymen?

29
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,291
[GIEVE]
A few too many, then.

30
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,708
Four hundred I could manage,

31
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,791
but five could be stretching
it, even for me.

32
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,333
[FARANGIS]
Pay him no mind.

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,416
He's an unabashed braggart and
an idiot of the worst sort.

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,541
Lord Daryun will return soon.

35
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,875
Apologies, Your Highness,
please bear with us.

36
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,416
I shall.

37

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER B groans]

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,166

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER F grunts]

41
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,791
[FARANGIS] I've received
good word from the Djinn.

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,208
According to them, we've
made the wind our ally.

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,833
[DARYUN]
Your Highness!

44
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,375
[ARSLAN]
Daryun!

45
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,250
[DARYUN]
This way!

46
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,791
[ARSLAN]
Right!

47
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,666
[DARYUN]
Over there!

48
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,958
[horn blows]

49
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,416
What was that?

50
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,458
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER I]
Sounds like a horn.

51

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS groaning]

52
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,583
There are too many. Retreat!

00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,958
Retrea-- Ah!

54
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,458
[KASHAN SOLDIERS cheering]

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,750
[ARSLAN]
They have a lot of slaves.

56
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,750
[HODIR]
Prince Arslan,

57
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,625
how good of you to remember
a humble man such as myself.

58
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,750
I feel such gratitude that
I am nearly speechless.

59
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,125
Not at all.

60
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,583
On the contrary, it is I
who should be thanking you.

61
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,500
I am grateful for
the reinforcements.

62
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,000
[HODIR] Please, Your Highness,
think nothing of it.

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,166
Upon learning of Pars's
tragic defeat at Atropatene,

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,375
I was deeply concerned
for your safety

65
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,583
and that of your lord father.
How could I do anything less?

66
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,000
I only regret I could
not act sooner!

67
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,208
I had not the resources to
launch a retaliatory attack

68
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,375
against the entire
Lusitanian army.

69
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,291
I was forced to remain here,
waiting and worrying.

70
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,666
And then today,

71
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,208
Lord Daryun presented himself
at my humble castle,

72
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,250
and granted me the
opportunity to prove

73
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,833
my enduring loyalty
to Your Highness.

74
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,625
Words cannot express
the joy in my heart.

75
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,958
Now that you have arrived
at Kashan Fortress,

76
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,625
rest assured that
time of worry is over.

77
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,291
Please don't hesitate
to make yourself at home.

78
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,000
If there's anything in
particular you desire to eat,

79
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,791
you have but to ask.

80
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,625
[HODIR]
We pride ourselves on dishes

81
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:21,041
made with ingredients
imported from all over.

82
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,541
[ARSLAN] You seem to have a
large slave population here.

83
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,958
[HODIR]
Indeed.

84
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,750
We have more slaves per master
here than even Ecbatana.

85
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,583
[chuckles] A number rivaled...

86
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,416
I'm curious to know. What do
you make of our jolly host?

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,291
Clearly a man of many words,

88
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,125
his slick tongue must
require frequent oiling.

89
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,416
He proves the saying,
"the more you speak,

90
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,708
the more of yourself
you reveal."

91
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,958
Like someone else I know.

92
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,458
...made me happy man
today, Your Highness.

93
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,416
Incidentally, did you know
I have a young daughter?

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,416
She is thirteen years old.
I may be her father,

95
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,875
but I believe I speak truly when
I say that she is a lovely girl,

96
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,708
and most sensible, as well.

97
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,458
If you were to allow her
to serve at your side,

98
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,791
Your Highness, well,

99
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,250
nothing could bring greater
joy to her or to me.

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,458
Wha... Huh?

101
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,000
Ah.

102
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,208
May I ask, what will you do to
strike back at the Lusitanians?

103
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,958
How do you intend
to proceed from here?

104
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,250
As I see it, we must first
save the people of Ecbatana,

105
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,375
who are suffering the most.

106
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,375
I shall declare myself,
and make my intentions known.

107
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:30,500
Then gather as many
reinforcements as I am able.

108
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,625
To that end, I will soon
be making some changes.

109
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,750
Altering policies that
have become untenable.

110
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,500
Firstly, I intend to
free all the slaves.

111
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,000
What an interesting plan.

112
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,666
I'm glad to see Your Highness
has prepared for the future.

113
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,291
Though I expected no less!

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,791
And? Is my plan one
you can support?

115
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,750
You've my full
support, of course!

116
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,500
Truly impressive,
Your Highness.

117
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,708
Such revolutionary
ideas you have! [laughs]

118
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,708
[VASSAL A] Here we are. This
will be Your Highness's room.

119
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,583
And yours is there, Mistress.

120
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,458
The rest of you
shall be over here.

121
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,375
[DARYUN] I'm sorry.
That's unacceptable.

122
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,291
I won't leave
His Highness's side.

123
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,083
Surely it'll do for the night.

124
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,750
I'm afraid the room
has only been made up

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,916
for a single person.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,666
Then I will happily
sleep on the floor.

127
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,541
But, sir...

128
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,416
Daryun, let it be.

129
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,083
Uh... Very well, then.

130
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,375
Your Highness, should
you need anything,

131
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,541
please find me at once.

132
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,083
Certainly.

133
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,833
Uh!

134
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,875
[knocking]

135
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,166
Your Highness. You and I
have something to discuss.

136
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,000
Uh...

137
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,791
[DARYUN] I know that man is
plotting something, but what?

138
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,083
[NARSUS] Clearly, he would like
to see the daughter he mentioned

139
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
married to the new king of Pars,

140
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,375
thereby gaining influence
as the king's father-in-law.

141
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,250
Well, knowing the motives
for his hospitality,

142
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,083
should we not be taking
action of some sort?

143
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,875
[NARSUS] He has purposefully
separated us from His Highness.

144
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,958
Uh! You might have
mentioned that sooner!

145
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,458
I had even considered sleeping
in front of His Highness's door!

146
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:32,333
It was my intention to go
along with Lord Hodir's scheme.

147
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,208
[HODIR]
Well, then, Your Highness.

148
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
I will leave you for now.

149
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,458
I'm sure you will give careful
thought to what I've said.

150
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,750
Yes. I certainly will.

151
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,208
[DARYUN] The fortress has
a large number of troops.

152
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,250
I'd greatly prefer not to
make an enemy of its master.

153
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,625
[NARSUS] But if he wants
to make enemies of us,

154
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,208
what choice have we?

155
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,375

00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,958
It's only me.

160
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,333
[GIEVE]
Your Highness?

161
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,500
Hi...

162
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,666
[DARYUN] Traversing
across the balconies?!

163
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,541
[laughs]

164
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,041
Of all the reckless,
foolish things to do!

165
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,166
There were guards at
the door, so I improvised.

166
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,750
And if your foot had slipped?

167
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,041
You would have fallen
to your death,

168
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,625
and I wouldn't have
been there to help you!

169
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,666
What are you,
his nursemaid?

170
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,041
[NARSUS]
Let's have it, then.

171
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,750
What did Hodir
have to say to you?

172
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,333
[ARSLAN]
There were two "suggestions"

173
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,166
that he wished to offer me.

174
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,666
The first was that I marry his
daughter and make her my queen.

175
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,916
As for the other,

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,708
he counseled me against
making extreme reforms

177
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,708
that would go against
Parsian tradition.

178
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,458
Such as freeing the slaves.

179
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,166
[ELAM grunts]

180
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,000
What grand suggestions!

181
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
And how did Your
Highness respond?

182
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,208
I said that I could
not answer immediately,

183
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,666
but that I would give him my
response sometime tomorrow.

184
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,583
Was that all right?

185
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,750
That should be fine.

186
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
[ARSLAN sighs]
Honestly, though.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,958
What can he possibly
be thinking?

188
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,666
I've never even met his
daughter. How could I marry her?

189
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,750
[ELAM, NARSUS, GIEVE, DARYUN]
Mm?

190
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,166
I doubt we have much time.

191
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,375
Hodir is likely to act
before the night is out.

192
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,125
Your Highness, make ready to
leave at a moment's notice.

193
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,541
As for the rest, you
can leave it to us.

194
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,125
I understand.

195
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,375
[NARSUS] Gieve, will you escort
His Highness back to his room

196
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,041
and deliver a message
to Farangis?

197
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,666
[GIEVE]
Mm. I shall be happy to.

198
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,791
And, Elam. I've a task
for you, as well.

199
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,333
Sure!

200
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,625
The Djinn appear
agitated tonight.

201
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,583
[GIEVE chuckles]

202
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,083
--[GIEVE groaning]
--For some reason,

203
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,708
the Djinn believe I should
stick my foot out the window.

204
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,625
Please but give me a
chance. I can explain!

205
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
[FARANGIS]
What do you want?

206
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
[GIEVE] I've a message
from the Lord Tactician.

207
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,250
[FARANGIS] And you couldn't
deliver this message

208
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,791
using the door?

209
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,708
[GIEVE] I could, but it makes
for a far more poetic story

210
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,875
to enter from the window.

211
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,166
Interesting. It would
seem that your message

212
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,291
has something to do with
the Djinn's agitation.

213
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,541
Here and now,

214
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,791
will you swear your
loyalty to Prince Arslan?

215
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,500
[KHARLAN] The rightful heir
will ascend the throne.

216
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,791
[DARYUN] What are you saying?
The rightful heir is--

217
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,833
[DARYUN gasps]

218
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,791
[NARSUS] What is it?
What troubles you?

219
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,916
[DARYUN] There is something...
I would like your opinion on.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Do you suppose... is there
any chance Prince Arslan

221
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,375
is the son of the late
King Osroes the Fifth?

222
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,916
[NARSUS] That thought had
crossed my mind, as well.

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,208
However, considering when
His Highness was born

224
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,541
it would not have
been possible.

225
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,875
[ELAM] It's finished.
I did as you instructed, sir.

226
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,250
[NARSUS]
Good work, thank you.

227
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,666
I found this. It was in the
space above the ceiling.

228
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,250
[NARSUS] Just the sort of low
trick I would expect from Hodir.

229
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,416
I presume he intended
to put us to sleep

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,375
so he could have time to win
His Highness to his side.

231
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,083
Surely there can be no further
need for us to hold back.

232
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,416
There appears to be some sort
of commotion brewing outside.

233
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,666
In that case,

234
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,250
it's time for us to
make our move, as well.

235
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,125
[HODIR] Your Highness?
Do pardon the intrusion.

236
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,791
[ARSLAN]
One moment.

237
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,250
I'm loathe to
disturb your-- Uh!

238
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,166
What is it?

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,833
[ARSLAN gasps]
Soldiers?

240
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,416
Your Highness.

241
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,708
The companions you have
gathered to your side

242
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,458
during your travels are likely
to do you more harm than good.

243
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,666
It would be best if they
were done away with.

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,583
I had hoped I might
have your permission

245
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,000
to dispose of them now.

246
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,000
I can see no reason for
them to be "done away with."

247
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,625
They have served me
loyally in all respects.

248
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,208
They have misguided
you to a degree

249
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,458
that borders on treachery.
If they remain,

250
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,375
they will certainly bring
disaster to the kingdom.

251
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,000
What a ridiculous notion!

252
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,000
[HODIR] Can you not see that
I am acting for your sake?

253
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,083
Consider the
"strategist," Narsus.

254
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,208
Your lord father had him
banished from the Court.

255
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,416
Do you know why he
would do such a thing?

256
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,041
Because Narsus spoke
of abolishing slavery,

257
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,166
of redistributing the wealth of
the temples among the people,

258
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,458
of treating commoners
the same as nobles!

259
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,791
In short, it was because
he had extreme ideas.

260
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,333
I am sure his ideas
were well thought out.

261
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,666
Well thought out?

262
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,666
I don't care how much
thinking he may have done!

263
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,375
If men such as him are going
to be governing this kingdom,

264
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,000
I say we would be better off

265
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,166
surrendering to Lusitania
here and now!

266
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,750
To be entirely clear,

267
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,291
you are telling me to forsake
my current companions.

268
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,166
[HODIR]
Indeed I am, Highness.

269
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,000
[ARSLAN] Let me ask this.
Assuming I do forsake those

270
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,416
who have served me
loyally and choose you,

271
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,208
can you be sure there won't come
a day when I forsake you, too?

272
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,583
[HODIR gasps]

273
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,291
[ARSLAN] You've made unkind
assertions about Narsus.

274
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,333
But unlike you, Lord Hodir,
he offered me shelter

275
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,125
without seeking to ambush
me during the night!

276
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,333
[HODIR grunts]

277
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,208
[ARSLAN] Daryun! Narsus!
Gieve! Farangis! Elam!

278
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,833
We leave immediately!

279
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,333
[KASHAN SOLDIERS murmur]

280
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,500
We've been awaiting
your order, Prince Arslan.

281
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:16,250
[HODIR]
What is this? Impossible!

282
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,083
My thanks for your aid.

283
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,333
[NARSUS]
Hmph.

284
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,666
[DARYUN]
You're right, Your Highness.

285
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,000
I can see no need for us
to remain in such a place.

286
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,833
[GIEVE] Agreed, they're woefully
short of beautiful women.

287
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,791
[HODIR growling]

288
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:37,583
[HODIR] Your Highness!
Please, wait but a moment!

289
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,500
I have invited your suspicion,

290
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,416
and I have only
myself to blame.

291
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,541
I will not seek to stop you now.

292
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,666
But if you will at
least do me the honor

293
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,000
of allowing my men to
provide you an escort.

294
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,916
[KASHAN SOLDIERS yelp]

295
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,291
You would allow your men
to approach His Highness

296
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,208
carrying concealed daggers?
Not a very wise idea.

297
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,250
I see, so this
is where it ends!

298
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,791
[KASHAN SOLDIERS yell]

299
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,375
Go no further!

300
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,666
Let us leave in peace,

301
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,958
or I promise it will
go badly for you.

302
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,541
[KASHAN SOLDIER C]
It's... Lord Daryun!

303
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,875
[HODIR]
Archers, fire!

304
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,291
[KASHAN SOLDIER D]
Wha..?

305
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,291
[KASHAN SOLDIERS gasping]

306
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,291
[KASHAN SOLDIER F]
What's going on here?!

307
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,875
Well done, Elam.

308
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,333
I should have known you would
have some trick up your sleeve.

309
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,250
[NARSUS]
Yes. You really should have.

310
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,125
While we may be few in number,
we do have working bowstrings.

311
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,041
[HODIR growls]

312
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,458
[NARSUS]
Wise man that you are,

313
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,000
I imagine you'll be more than
happy to open the gates

314
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:47,833
and see us on our way without
further interference.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,041
[HODIR] If I let you leave here,
I'll be known as a traitor!

316
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,875
And I won't have
that! Now, men!

317
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,541
[KASHAN SOLDIERS chuckle]

318
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,500
Capture the prince
and kill the rest!

319
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,708
[KASHAN SOLDIERS yelling]

320
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,625
[DARYUN yells]

321
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,583
[KASHAN SOLDIERS groaning]

322
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,208
[KASHAN SOLDIERS yell]

323
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:14,916
[NARSUS grunts]

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,083
[KASHAN SOLDIERS groan]

325
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,833
[KASHAN SOLDIER Q]
You-- Ah!

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,875
[KASHAN SOLDIER T]
Hey!

327
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:23,875
[KASHAN SOLDIER U]
What's that?

328
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,833
[KASHAN SOLDIER V]
It's too dark!

329
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,166
[KASHAN SOLDIERS groan]

330
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,541
[KASHAN SOLDIER AA]
Damn you! [groans]

331
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,166
[DARYUN grunts]
Hodir!

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,625
You belong to the
Angel of Judgment.

333
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:46,500
Now is the time to
confess your sins.

334
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,625
Confess your crimes
against the prince.

335
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,500
--Confess your betrayal!
--[HODIR] No! [yells]

336
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:57,166
[HODIR groaning]

337
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,333
[KASHAN SOLDIERS murmuring]

338
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,791
The lord of Kashan
Fortress is dead.

339
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,791
Will you fight for him, or
will you lay down your swords?

340
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,500
[ELAM] Your Highness, shouldn't
we be getting on our way?

341
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,708
[SLAVES mumble, yawn]

342
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,208
I bring good news!

343
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,166
From this day forward,
you are all free!

344
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,375
Maybe I'm not being clear.
You're not slaves anymore.

345
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,958
Who said we're not slaves?
Was it Lord Hodir?

346
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,375
Well, no. Lord Hodir
is dead. That's why.

347
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,916
[MALE SLAVES murmur]
What?!

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,458
[MALE SLAVE B] Were you
the one who killed him?

349
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,125
[ARSLAN] It was one
of my companions.

350
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,250
[MALE SLAVE C]
You bastard!

351
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,666
[MALE SLAVE D]
Murderer! Let's get him!

352
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,000
Wait, I don't under-- Ah!

353
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,500
[DARYUN]
Back away! Your Highness!

354
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,291
[MALE SLAVES shouting]
Stop!

355
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,375
[NARSUS]
You're quiet tonight, Highness.

356
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,125
Thinking about the
slaves from the fortress?

357
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
[ARSLAN]
Yes. Why were they so angry?

358
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
I don't understand.

359
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,125
[NARSUS]
Loyalty to Hodir.

360
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,250
As bad of a man as
he seemed to us,

361
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,666
he must have been
a good master.

362
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,166
You knew.

363
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,416
You expected something like
this to happen, didn't you?

364
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,125
Yes.

365
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,416
[ARSLAN]
Then why didn't you tell me?

366
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,625
[NARSUS] Even if I had
given you warning,

367
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,250
I sincerely doubt you
would have believed me.

368
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,750
There are some
things in this world

369
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,583
that have to be experienced
to be understood.

370
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,666
And now? Are you speaking
from experience?

371
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,541
I am.

372
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,125
Five years ago,

373
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,416
when my father died
and I took the title,

374
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,916
I freed all the slaves
on our holdings.

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,958
After doing so,
I left for the capital.

376
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,750
I returned after some time,

377
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,333
only to find that the
slaves had returned.

378
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,750
They came back?!

379
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,500
[NARSUS]
In a society like ours,

380
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,458
being a slave with
a generous master

381
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,958
can be easier than
being free but poor.

382
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,625
[ARSLAN]
But, you did what was right!

383
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,250
Surely they must have realized
that and thanked you for it.

384
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,791
And what is "right"?
Is it like the sun?

385
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,458
Or is it, perhaps,
more like the stars?

386
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,458
Only one sun casts
its light upon us,

387
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,250
but infinite stars
guide our way at night.

388
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,875
[NARSUS] Regardless,
I hope you won't be deterred

389
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,250
by my experience,
or by yours earlier.

390
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,750
You're attempting to do right

391
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,125
according to your
own convictions.

392
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,166
And I would hate to see you
swayed from such a path.

393
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,875
[ARSLAN] How much longer will
five capable, honorable people

394
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:08,083
such as these be content
to follow me?

395
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,458
I have to become a ruler
worthy of their loyalty,

396
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,583
or soon enough,
they will despair of me.

397
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,958
Your Highness, we must
decide which direction

398
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,416
we will be traveling
come morning.

399
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,958
[ARSLAN]
East. We ride for Peshawar.

400
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,833
[BAHMAN]
Lord Vahriz. I am lost.

401
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,666
The parting gift you left
is a weighty one indeed.

402
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,875
Why would you give such a thing
into clumsy hands like mine?

403
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,708
[BAHMAN] The Royal House
can trace its line

404
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,416
back to the Hero
King Kaykhusraw,

405
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,458
but if things go awry, I could
see its end during my lifetime.

406
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,541
If only I had died
two kings back

407
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,916
during King Gotarzes's reign.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,291
That would've been
a peaceful end.

409
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,458
[NARRATOR] If Arslan's
company must split apart,

410
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,333
Gieve would greatly
prefer Fairangis

411
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,875
as his traveling companion.

412
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,500
But he is doomed
to disappointment.

413
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,791
Next time,
"The Road to Peshawar."

414
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,583
And thus would the
boy become a king.
