1
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,708
[RAJENDRA]
Lord Daryun.

2
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,375
I wish to entrust you
with not only my own fate,

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,125
but with that of the whole
kingdom of Sindhura.

4
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,375
Are you willing to accept
this task on my behalf?

5
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,416
I don't relish the thought.

6
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,750
Surely your nerve
doesn't fail you.

7
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,916
Or are you suggesting
you are not confident

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,625
that you would
triumph in the duel?

9
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,041
Interpret my words
however you wish.

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,375
I serve Prince Arslan
and no other.

11
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,250
I will accept no
request to fight,

12
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,666
save that it come
directly from him.

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,750
I love my kingdom

14
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,166
and cannot allow it to be ruled
by a man such as Gadhevi.

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,833
I realize the gravity
of my request,

16
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:20,375
but, Prince Arslan,

17
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,791
will you not lend me
your aid in this?

18
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,833
I-- That is...

19
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,916
You ask a great deal.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,750
But if this can avert a war and
resolve the succession, then--

21
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,625
[sighs]

22
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,541
[ARSLAN]
Daryun.

23
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,791
Might I ask you to do this.

24
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,208
A duel to determine the throne.

25
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,291
It strikes me as a last resort.

26
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,833
King Karikala must be desperate.

27
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,166
I beg your help.

28
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,458
[DARYUN]
Your Highness.

29
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,416
What answer can
I give you but this?

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,708
I fight at your command.

31
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,000
Dueling before the gods.

32
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,250
It is a grave responsibility.

33
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,083
To be honest, I'm
not very worried.

34
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,250
I feel fairly confident
I can defeat any warrior

35
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,208
they send against me.

36
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:05,208
[NARSUS]
Oh, I do not doubt your skill.

37
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:09,083
Nor though, do I doubt our
opponent's willingness to cheat.

38
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,958
Remain vigilant.

39
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,875
[DARYUN] We have a
great task ahead of us.

40
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,000
I find this detour irritating.

41
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,458
[NARSUS] I know you'd rather
continue our true mission,

42
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,833
but there is another
way to think of it.

43
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,583
When this matter is resolved,

44
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,250
word will spread of Prince
Arslan's wisdom and honor.

45
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,625
Such renown can only be
to our future advantage.

46
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,083
Support will likely increase

47
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,791
for our uprising against
the Lusitanians.

48
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,041
Well, in that case,

49
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,041
I truly cannot afford to
lose this duel, can I?

50
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,666
The day Lord Bahman
saved His Highness,

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,250
I thought upon my uncle's words,

52
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,875
and upon the oath
I readily gave him.

53
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,625
No matter what his parentage is,

54
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,791
Prince Arslan will always
command my loyalty.

55
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,791
[GADHEVI]
What?

56
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:10,041
Rajendra has that knight in
black acting as his champion?

57
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,208
This bout will determine
the fate of all Sindhura

58
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,291
and he's chosen a Parsian?

59
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,416
Has he no shame at all?

60
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,541
Whichever kingdom
he may be from,

61
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,666
no one denies this particular
knight's strength and ability.

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,875
Is there any man among our
own forces who can best him?

63
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,208
[GADHEVI]
There may, in fact, be someone.

64
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,291
[MAHENDRA]
Sir?

65
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,500
We've no choice but
to unchain Bahadur.

66
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,625
You cannot mean that, Highness.
He's too dangerous to--

67
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,166
Then name me
another of our men

68
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,541
who can defeat
the Parsian knight!

69
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,750
Forced to entrust my
fate to a wild animal.

70
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,250
It is a wretched thing.

71
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,750
However, I will do what I must.

72
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,458
[BAHADUR growling]

73
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,875
This isn't an especially
welcoming crowd, is it?

74
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,208
What do you expect?

75
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,791
Their king is dying and
their princes are at war.

76
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:45,875
[SPECTATORS chattering]

77
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,666
It's like some kinda
grand tournament.

78
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,583
We're not here to
enjoy ourselves.

79
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,375
I know that, thank you.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,291
Ah! Good!

81
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,958
I have been waiting for you.
Welcome, Prince Arslan.

82
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,250
Naming an heir is
a momentous event.

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,708
I wanted to be here
to see you chosen.

84
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,916
I am deeply grateful
you have come.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,625
This is my father,
King Karikala.

86
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,166
[SPECTATORS cheering]

87
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,750
Your Highness, this will be
a test of your statecraft.

88
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,458
Whatever happens,
you must remain calm.

89
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,250
[ARSLAN]
I am aware.

90
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,208
What is it?

91
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,500
This duel.

92
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,791
Today determines which
of those ambitious men

93
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,916
the gods of Sindhura favor.

94
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,666
It will be interesting.

95
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,875
[SPECTATORS gasping]

96
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,541
[SPECTATOR A] That's him.
The knight from Pars.

A Parsian warrior.

103
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,833
I hope there's
some fight in you.

104
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:04,375
If you die too fast,
it won't be fun.

105
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,583
Is that even a man?

106
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,166
[ARSLAN] Prince Rajendra,
what is going on?

Who is this Bahadur?

108
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,208
Nothing to be
concerned about.

109
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,000
He will be no match for
Lord Daryun, I'm sure.

110
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,041
[GADHEVI]
Hm.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
It will be all right,
Your Highness.

112
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,083
Whoever he faces,
Lord Daryun won't lose.

113
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,875
We all know that
a greater warrior

114
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,625
has never walked this earth.

[SPECTATORS yelling]

116

[MAHENDRA] We have gathered to
witness a duel before the gods.

117
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,083
At stake is the
throne of Sindhura.

118
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,291
The outcome of this
duel shall be considered

119
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,416
sacred and inviolable.

120
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Neither party may
contest the results

[GIEVE] That thing cannot
possibly be human.

Animals who wear human flesh
can be found in many places.

But that is truly
a savage beast.

131

Lord Daryun would never lose
to a man, but this creature...

that to kill my champion!

You've toyed with
him enough, Bahadur.

[RAJENDRA]
I have heard of this.

As you thought,
he's no ordinary man.

he is also insensible to pain.

You coward!

157

You knew about this and chose
Daryun to be your champion

00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,625
and hang them from
your castle gates!

164
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:40,208
[KARIKALA] Calm yourself,
my young guest. I can explain.

165
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,166
Rajendra chose first.

166
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,875
Only then did Gadhevi
select Bahadur.

167
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,208
We know your knight
is a hero without equal.

168
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,750
Certain he had no better
option, Gadhevi freed Bahadur.

169
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,083
That he would do such a thing

170
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,166
shows how feared your
man is by his enemies.

171
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,833
Perhaps you should
do him the honor

172
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,750
of putting your faith in him.

173
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,791
It seems likely to me
that he has earned it.

174
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,916
[GADHEVI]
Rajendra,

175
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,583
I hope you are preparing
yourself to concede defeat.

176
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,833
Disgraceful.

177
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,916
No crown prince should
ever lose his composure

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,541
over such a trifling thing.

179
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,250
These Parsians are
truly a weak people.

180
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,375
Are you so blind, Gadhevi?

181
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,875
If you cared for your subjects
as the prince of Pars does,

182
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,083
if you cared even
half so much so he,

183
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,750
there would be no need for this
duel we are now witnessing.

184
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,833
I would've named you
my heir long ago

185
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,750
had you any compassion
in your heart.

186
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,750
There are more important
qualities than compassion.

187
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:43,875
[KARIKALA sighs]

188
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,541
I am not surprised
to hear you say so.

189
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,833
I grow impatient!
Settle this now, Bahadur!

190
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,708
[roaring]

191
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,916
I've never seen such strength.

192
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,333
Bring the monster down!

193
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,458
One way or another,
it will soon end.

194
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:18,125
[roaring]

195
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,250
Do it!

196
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,791
[yelling]

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,333
What're you waiting for,
you tupid brute?

198
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,875
I should've left you
in that prison cell!

199
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,583
One last blow.

200
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,583
[yelling]

201
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,750
[SPECTATORS gasping]

202
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,875
He carries a short sword?

203
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,291
He bided his time,

204
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,500
as though the broken long
sword was his only weapon,

205
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,250
and sure enough, his
enemy let his guard down.

206
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,208
Daryun's not a bad
tactician himself.

207
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,000
Astounding!

208
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,791
[KARIKALA]
Thus it ends.

209
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,708
Daryun has won the duel;

210
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,833
which means, Rajendra
is heir to the throne.

211
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:29,250
[SPECTATORS cheering]

212
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,333
Prince Rajendra!

213
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,250
[SPECTATOR C]
Hail, our future king!

214
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,708
[SPECTATOR D]
Prince Rajendra!

215
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,333
I can't believe it!

216
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,416
Why not? It's Lord Daryun!

217
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,291
Thank the gods.

218
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,458
Your Highness!

219
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,583
I'm relieved is all.

220
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,416
[GADHEVI]
I don't accept!

221
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,583
No! It must be wrong!

222
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,375
This verdict is unjust!
Any fool can see that!

223
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,041
Think about what you're saying.

224
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,791
You would challenge a judgment
made by the gods themselves?

225
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,666
[GADHEVI]
Cursed brother! Cursed gods!

226
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,958
Don't you see? Obviously
the gods are wrong!

227
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,500
He's only now
realizing something

228
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,083
I've known a long while.

229
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,666
The gods are constantly
making mistakes.

230
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,375
Yet it's always we humans who
live with the consequences.

231
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,625
Stop this madness, son.

232
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,000
They are wrong.

233
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,458
Correct their mistake
and yield me the throne.

234
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,208
Do not make me harm you.

235
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,166
[RAJENDRA]
You've truly gone mad!

236
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,416
[GADHEVI] If you'd only been
content to stay in your place,

237
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,666
none of this would
have happened.

238
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,500
Royal Guardsmen! Kill Rajendra!

239
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,291
He and his allies
are frauds and liars!

240
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,583
Men! The king is threatened!

241
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,416
Take the traitor Gadhevi!

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,458
[RAJENDRA'S SOLDIERS yelling]

243
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,750
Rajendra must die!

244
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:55,791
[GADHEVI'S SOLDIERS yelling]

245
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,958
[NARSUS] The interested parties
can resolve any further dispute.

246
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,250
Let's go. We don't wish
to be caught up in this.

247
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,375
[ALL gasp]

248
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,291
[ELAM]
Lord Narsus!

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,583
We were invited here! Louts!

250
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,541
Go! See His Highness to safety!

251
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,291
Quick, Highness, this way.

252
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,166
[GIEVE] Can we never leave
anywhere peacefully?

253
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,000
[GADHEVI SOLDIER D]
Don't let them get away!

254
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,791
[GADHEVI SOLDIER C] The Parsians
must be here as spies!

255
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,958
Capture them!

256
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,916
An outrageous accusation!

257
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,750
We came to help them
settle a dispute.

258
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,833
Not much for
gratitude, are they?

259
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,000
[GIEVE] Obviously, the
First Prince never thought

260
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,208
he and his monster
friend would be defeated.

261
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,958
He's quite the sore loser.

262
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,125
Come on!

263
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,208
[DARYUN]
Your Highness!

264
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,958
[GADHEVI SOLDIER G yelling]

265
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,458
[JASWANT]
This way!

266
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,458
That's the second time
you've saved me.

267
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,416
This is a quarrel
between Sindhurans.

268
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,166
If a royal guest
were to come to harm

269
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,208
upon the day of the
duel before the gods,

270
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,541
it would bring shame
to our kingdom.

271
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:14,208
[ARSLAN] You would help me,
Rajendra's ally?

272
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,041
That's the best you can do?

273
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,625
Kill my fool brother
and take the king!

274
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,958
I beg you, Prince Gadhevi.

275
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,708
We've been defeated.
It's time to accept that.

276
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you a traitor?

277
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,000
Why else would you
defy me in this?

278
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,750
There was a duel
before the gods.

279
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,000
To deny its outcome
is unthinkable.

280
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,666
Please don't ask me to do so.

281
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,916
I ask again.

282
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,583
Find it within yourself
to accept this verdict.

283
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,708
It's true then. You have turned!

284
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,666
You're his creature!

285
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,875
Tell me, what deal did you
make with that dog Rajendra?

286
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,083
Your Highness, there
has been no deal!

287
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,833
This was decided by
the gods themselves!

288
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,666
You betrayed me!
You're liars, all of you!

289
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,916
Please stop.

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,708
See reason and bow your
head to your brother.

291
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,583
Silence, traitor!

292
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,458
He struck down Lord Mahendra.

293
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,000
Lord Grand Vizier.

294
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,750
You are nothing but a coward.

295
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,375
What are you doing, guards?

296
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,333
Kill the traitors!
I am your king now!

297
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,791
Why are you just
standing there? Attack!

298
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,166
Put away your weapons!

299
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,791
Hear me, Sindhurans!

300
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,583
I came to fight a sacred battle

301
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,000
that would determine
the fate of your kingdom!

302
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,833
If you object to the outcome,

303
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,958
step forward and
I will duel you next!

304
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,583
A Sher Senani is among us.

305
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,250
Hail the Sher Senani!

306
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,291
[SINDHURAN SOLDIERS]
Hail the Sher Senani!

307
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:57,416
Hail the Sher Senani!

308
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,416
Hear me, all of you!

309
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,333
Hear and be still!

310
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,041
[RAJENDRA] Gadhevi has
defied both a royal mandate

311
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,166
and the will of the gods.

312
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,041
Any who follow him will be
found guilty of high treason

313
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,083
and punished accordingly!

314
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,750
No, he's the traitor!

315
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,750
Why aren't you listening to me?

316
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,250
Kill them all!

317
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,541
That is enough.

318
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,708
Please, before you
shame yourself further.

319
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,958
Seize him!

320
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,333
[GADHEVI]
No! Let me go! Obey me!

321
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,541

Lord Mahendra!

Jaswant, is that you, boy?

324
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,500
Yes, it's me. I'm here.

325
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,500
Do not grieve so.
Death comes to all.

326
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,500
There is no need to
lament my passing.

327
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:17,041
I knew the darkness in GADHEVI's
heart, yet still I followed him.

328
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,625
I was a fool and thus
I received a fool's end.

329
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,875
I cannot believe such a thing.

330
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:34,125
My only regret is that I never
said how proud I am of you.

331
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:38,458
Jaswant, my son, heed me well.

332
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,958
Don't choose the
wrong path as I...

333
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:51,708
[JASWANT wailing]

334
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,708
[NARRATOR] Narsus had fully
perceived the peculiarity

335
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:33,708
of Rajendra's character.

336
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:35,750
The Sindhuran was
such a performer,

337
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,583
he even fooled himself.

338
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,125
[NARRATOR] Next time:
"Once Again Across the River."

339
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,000
And thus would the
boy become a king.
