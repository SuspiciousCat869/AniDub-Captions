00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:49,625
[PRIESTS]
Resurrexit, sicut dixit.

2
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,541
[SILVER MASK]
Yes.

3
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:55,375
Let calamity befall
the Kingdom of Pars.

4
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,083
[VAHRIZ]
Daryun.

5
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,166
[DARYUN]
Uh?

6
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,083
What are your orders, sir?

7
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,458
I must remain here
to protect His Majesty.

8
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,166
That means I'll need you to
go in search of the prince.

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,250
He's gone missing?

10
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,416
He was lost during the battle.

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,041
It seems he was at
the front of the charge.

12
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,041
No doubt he wished
to distinguish himself

13
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,416
and earn His Majesty's approval.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,333
I fear what may have happened.

15
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,916
If he lives, find him
and protect him.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,833
I'll inform the king
and suffer his wrath.

17
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,166
[DARYUN]
I'll find him.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,375
Fear not, Uncle. We'll meet
again on the walls of Ecbatana.

19
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,916
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 320. Autumn.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,125
The battle upon the
Fields of Atropatene

21
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,708
seemed weighted in
the Parsian's favor.

22
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,416
However, the Lusitanians'
cunning tactics

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,583
left the battlefield
heaped with Parsian dead.

24
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,583
Prince Arslan's maiden battle
was to be a glorious event

25
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,833
in his young life.

26
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:04,250
Instead, it became
a hell on earth.

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,708
Your Highness!

28
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,041
Daryun!

29
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,250
I will keep you safe.

30
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,583
Always.

31
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,625
Thank goodness!

32
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,666
Prince!

33
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,791
Such a rude welcome,
Lord Kharlan.

34
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,458
What is the meaning of this?

35
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,208
Have you turned your cloak?

36
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,708
How could you?

37
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,958
It's the Knight in Black.

38
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,166
The Mardan fu Mardan.

39
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,833
This bodes ill.

40
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,416
[DARYUN]
Well, you cur?

41
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,333
Why has a man of your
station turned traitor?

42
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,833
[KHARLAN]
This is not treachery.

43
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,833
I act out of true concern
for the Kingdom of Pars.

44
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,833
It is for Pars that
I support this plot

45
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,666
to dethrone King Andragoras.

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,458
Oust my father? Why would you?

47
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,541
So that was it, then?
Now it's much clearer.

48
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,291
Before the battle began,
I thought to advise His Majesty

49
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,500
that retreat would be
the most prudent option.

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,250
You supported me.

51
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,791
My suggestion angered the king,

52
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,333
and he dismissed me
from my post as Marzban,

53
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,708
which was exactly
what you were after.

54
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,583
You have the right of it.
That was my plan.

55
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,500
You're as strong as an ox,
but you're no man's fool.

56
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,916
That is precisely the reason I--

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,458
[DARYUN yelling]

58
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,833
Precisely why I couldn't
have a man of your talents

59
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,208
commanding ten
thousand cavalrymen.

60
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,791
No matter how smart you are,

61
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,916
even you cannot alter the course
of a battle as a lone horseman.

62
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,250
Your Highness. I beg
of you to remain there.

63
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,083
Let me deal with this
filthy traitor in your name.

64
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,500
Deal with him as you
see fit. I trust you.

65
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,291
[KHARLAN]
Hold a moment! Listen to me!

66
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,166
Now, why would I do that?
You betrayed the king.

67
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,208
You were about to
murder the crown prince.

68
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,666
Just hear me!

69
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,791
Once you know the details,
even you will agree that I--

70
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,958
We retreat for now. Move!

71
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,125
Bastard!

72
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,375
I'm coming, Highness!

73
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,291
You're injured.

74
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,333
No, the blood isn't mine.

75
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,541
How could he?

76
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,333
He betrayed us!

77
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,625
Kharlan.

78
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,625
[VAHRIZ] Your Majesty,
we have received word

79
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,750
that Marzbans Manuchurh
and Khayr were killed.

80
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,875
The rest are little better off.

81
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,750
There is no victory to be
had from this battle.

82
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,250
The day is lost.
We must withdraw.

83
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,083
You urge retreat as well?

84
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,208
You would have me shame
myself as a warrior of Pars?

85
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,500
Your Majesty, please
bear the shame of today

86
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,458
in order to win tomorrow.

87
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,208
[ANDRAGORAS] The security
of the Continental Highway

88
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,583
depends on the strength and
steadfastness of Pars's Army.

89
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,833
Consider this.

90
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,833
Your Lady Queen is in
the Royal Capital.

91
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,208
Would you have it fall into
the savage hands of the enemy?

92
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,250
[ANDRAGORAS grunts]

93
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,125
[ANDRAGORAS]
We will retreat.

94
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,875
Relay the message
for every unit!

95
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,291
We're retreating!

96
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,666
Messengers! Quick!

97
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,083
[PARSIAN SOLDIER C]
Will they us see in this fog?

98
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,791
[PARSIAN SOLDIER B]
Use the horns!

99
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,375
[PARSIAN SOLDIER BETA]
Message!

100
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,416
[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
Yes?

101
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,208
[PARSIAN SOLDIER ALPHA]
Did you get him?

102
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,708
Yeah. Just as Lord
Kharlan instructed us.

103
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,708
[PARSIAN SOLDIER ALPHA]
All right, then.

104
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,833
Let's make it loud.

105
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,250
[PARSIAN SOLDIER BETA]
The King ran away!

106
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,125
[PARSIAN SOLDIER ALPHA]
The King abandoned us!

107
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:44,916
[PARSIAN SOLDIER GAMMA]
He's running!

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,250
The king is running!

109
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,208
[NARRATOR] And so,
the Lusitanian plot unfolded.

110
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,208
Kharlan's men distorted
the order to retreat,

111
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,416
painting the king
as a fleeing coward.

112
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,708
[PARSIAN SOLDIER I]
The King has run away!

113
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,958
[NARRATOR] Amidst the
confusion and bloodshed,

114
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,375
only the wild rumor
of the King's flight

115
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,583
raced across the battlefield.

116
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,500
Can it be true?
The king has fled?

117
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,833
Has he abandoned us?

118
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,125
Our King? Andragoras
wouldn't, surely!

119
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,916
The Invincible King? A coward?

120
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,791
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER F]
Lusitania is victorious!

121
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,375
Battle is over?

122
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,458
What cowardice!

123
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,791
We're risking our lives,
and the king runs away?

124
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,791
For a leader to abandon
his men in battle

125
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,791
is the ultimate betrayal.

126
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,166
The standard of Pars
has been sullied.

127
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,541
There can be no victory now.

128
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,833
[KUBARD]
This is ridiculous. Let's go.

129
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,250
Who am I supposed to fight for
after a disgrace like this?

130
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,541
I'm not giving my life for
a king who would turn tail

131
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,833
and run from battle.

132
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,041
If the king can't be
bothered to stick around,

133
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,208
I say we leave, too.

134
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,458
Stop! Surely you
can't be serious!

135
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,875
You are a Marzban of Pars,

136
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,291
and you would urge your
men to abandon the field?

137
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,833
The king's actions do not
relieve us of our responsibi--

138
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,708
[KUBARD] The king's duty,
first and foremost,

139
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,250
is to protect the kingdom.

140
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,750
That's what gives him power.

141
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,083
It's sort of like a bargain
between him and his people.

142
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,166
If King Andragoras
doesn't hold up his end,

143
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,166
then he has no
right to the title.

144
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,333
You said it yourself, Shapur.
This is the ultimate betrayal.

145
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,666
[SHAPUR] No, that was
thoughtlessly done on my part.

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,625
Hear me, men! The king
did not run away!

147
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,333
He returns to Ecbatana

148
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,291
where our forces will
repel the Lusitanians!

149
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,458
[KUBARD]
Hm?

150
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,041
Listen well.

151
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,166
You are a subject of Pars, and
Andragoras is our rightful king.

152
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,666
Say else and I'll
punish you, friend or no.

153
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,416
Oh, punish me, eh?

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,416
And how do you plan
to do that, exactly?

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,166
[BOTH growl]

156
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,500
[PARSIAN SOLDIER P]
The enemy!

157
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,708
[BOTH]
Huh?

158
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,083
[PARSIAN SOLDIER P]
We're under attack!

159
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,458
[LUSITANIAN ARMY yelling]

160
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,541
[KUBARD]
Time to go.

161
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,083
You would truly run away?

162
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,666
Where would I run? We don't
take care of that enemy force,

163
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,708
there will be no
retreat to be had.

164
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,250
We'll deal with
that rabble first,

165
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,250
and then we can discuss
the responsibilities

166
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,375
of a Parsian subject
at our leisure.

167
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,166
What say you, Shapur?

168
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,208
You'd better not pretend to
have forgotten about it later.

169
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,250
[KUBARD]
I assure you, I will not.

170
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,833
Assuming, of course,
that "later" comes.

171
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,666
[NARRATOR] And thus,
as dusk fell on the same day,

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,291
so too fell the previously
undefeated Pars Army,

173
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,541
beaten and bloody.
Vanquished by Lusitania.

174
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,500
Those damn barbarians!

175
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,750
[VAHRIZ] I never imagined that
Prince Arslan's maiden battle

176
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,291
would be such a catastrophe.

177
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,250
Daryun. Find His Highness
and keep him safe.

178
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,375
There should be little
danger of pursuit now.

179
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,791
[PARS SOLDIERS yelping]

180
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,958

Kharlan, that scoundrel.

00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,666
Fine job he did back there.

188
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,750
So, Andragoras, you fled,

189
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,250
abandoning your men to
their fate. How shameful.

190
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,583
Why am I not surprised?

191
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,333
[VAHRIZ]
You were laying in wait for us?

192
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,083
Yes, General. This path
has long been known to me

193
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,625
as the route you would likely
take in the event of a retreat.

[VAHRIZ growls]

[VAHRIZ]
There are fewest in front.

I don't know how skilled he is,

Your Majesty, be ready to run.

198
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,291
I'll do what I can to clear
a path through the enemy.

Guard the king!
Long live Andragoras!

00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,541
We have to help the general!

for you, you old fool!

[SILVER MASK yells]

No man should call this
wretch before me a king.

Who are you?
What do you want?

I have hated you for so long.

And yet you do not
even know who I am.

209
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,916
So many are those
you have wronged.

210

[ANDRAGORAS]
Huh?

00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,833
[SILVER MASK]
Sixteen years.

212
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:28,583

this day for 16 long years.

Please get on.

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,125
The saddle's been spattered with
blood and grime, I'm afraid,

218
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,458
but better than going afoot.

219
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,541
He's your horse.

220
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,333
I can't possibly ride him.

221
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,250
You're a warrior, and
he's a warrior's mount.

222
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,833
One of these will do.

223
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,625
I can fight well enough
on lesser stock.

224
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,250
I'd rather know that
you're in good hands.

225
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,166
[DARYUN]
In the unlikely event

226
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,666
that something should
happen to me,

227
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,041
give Shabrang a good nudge

228
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,833
and get across this
battlefield quickly.

229
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,375
No other horse will catch you.

230
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,666
I've never met his
match for speed.

231
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,958
Do unlikely events
even exist for you?

232
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,500
Generally, no.

233
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,875
When it comes to
protecting the Prince,

234
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,916
the chances are even lower.

235
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,541
[DARYUN] Ride fast, and stay
as close behind me as you can.

236
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,666
[ARSLAN]
That should be easy.

237
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,791
Shabrang already
knows what to do.

238
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,000
[DARYUN] That's it. A little
further. Stay strong.

239
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,041
[DARYUN]
I remember your face.

240
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,666
You served under Lord
Shapur, didn't you?

241
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,708
Yes. Lord Shapur has already...

242
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,541
Easy, now. Try to stay calm.

243
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:11,458
Of the Marzban... Lord Manuchurh
and Lord Khayr have already...

244
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,291
...have already,
fallen in the field.

245
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,458
Lord Shapur has...

246
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,208
[DARYUN]
What is he trying to say?

247
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,833
That Lord Shapur has fallen?

248
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:26,416
K-King Andragoras is no longer,
no longer leading the battle.

249
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
It seems he fled the field.

250
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,166
[ARSLAN]
What?

251
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,250
[MAN] The morale of
the whole army-- [coughs]

252
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,083
He retreated? My father
retreated? To the capital?

253
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,208
[DARYUN]
You fought well, soldier.

254
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,125
[ARSLAN] Do you think
my father is still alive?

255
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,833
My uncle was the one
protecting him, so yes.

256
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,458
I imagine he left
the field unscathed.

257
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,958
Before I rode out, he expressed
his concern for you.

258
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,541
He was concerned? For me?

259
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,375
[ARSLAN] We must hurry.
I need to get to the capital.

260
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,625
[DARYUN]
Unfortunately,

261
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,625
to do that we must cut
across the battlefield.

262

If that many Marzbans
have been killed,

263
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,166
the path to the Royal
Capital is likely awash

Oh, I see.

may be of assistance.

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER Z] But to
win such a victory over Pars,

strange silver mask or no,
that general knows his business.

271
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,125
Bit terrifying, though. Give
me any death other than burning.

Will nothing
kill those bastards?

The strength of the Pars
Army is truly impressive.

276
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,000
The trickery was
necessary, then.

277

To fight them head-on
would've been suicide.

On this day in the battle upon
the Fields of Atropatene,

281
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,833
the Kingdom of Pars lost

A bloody death to
all nonbelievers? Ugh.

288
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,041
Led by a king who trusts all
to god and a bloodthirsty devil

289
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,458
who enjoys killing despite
being a man of the cloth.

290

No wonder so many of our

[BAUDOUIN] What does
it matter, Montferrat?

Our fallen brothers receive
their glory in heaven.

As for our reward,

we get to rule the
bountiful Kingdom of Pars.

With its Continental Highway,
its silver mines,

and its fruitful
fields of grain.

[MONTFERRAT]
Hm. Our rewards.

299

You ever think of the conquest
of Maryam, Baudouin?

300

[BAUDOUIN]
Huh?

301
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,000
[MONTFERRAT] We showed no mercy,
whether military or civilian.

302
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,750
We burned children and babes
still in their mothers' arms.

303
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:50,791
[BAUDOUIN]
Indeed.

For they were the
enemies of god.

[MONTFERRAT]
I can still hear those screams.

306

They will not be silenced.

307
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,250
They were the
heathens, and yet,

308

how can god bestow
his blessing on us

309
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,708
when our hands are stained
with the blood of children?

[DARYUN] Yes. He was once
the Lord of Daylam, actually.

316
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,083
[ARSLAN]
I've heard of him.

317
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,000
My father banished him
from court, didn't he?

318
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,708
[DARYUN]
Do you remember a few years ago,

319
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,708
when the Alliance of Three
Kingdoms invaded Pars?

320
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,250
Narsus defeated the alliance

321
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,083
without sending a single
soldier into battle.

322
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,083
But... will he meet with me?
When my father had him banished?

323
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,625
You see, my Prince,

324
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,666
there are certain benefits to
being friends with an exile.

325
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,041
He is unlikely to turn his
back on such wretched,

326
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,916
vanquished men as us.

327
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,125
Wretched and vanquished.
I suppose we are that.

328
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,541
Put it out of your mind.
Nothing can be done today.

329
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,500
We'll rejoin the king and
rid Pars of her enemies.

330
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,416
We will have vengeance.

331
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,250
[DARYUN] But to do that,
we must stay alive.

332
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,416
[DARYUN] I'm sorry,
I know you must be tired.

333
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's push on a little
further, though. If we can.

334
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,125
I'm told that Narsus
lives up this way somewhere.

335
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,583
Apparently, he's withdrawn
to a mountain retreat,

336
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,333
where he spends his time
painting and reading books.

337
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,958
Narsus likes to paint?
I hadn't heard that.

338
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,666
Yes. Well, I suppose everyone
has their flaws, don't they?

339
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,916
He knows the movements
of celestial bodies

340
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,666
and the finer points of
the most arcane history.

341
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,333
He possesses the
keenest of intellects.

342
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,958
But when it comes to painting,

343
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
perhaps the best way
to describe his skill,

344
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,208
is enthusiastic ineptitude.

345
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,583
[ARSLAN gasps]

346
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,083
[MAN]
Do not advance further.

347
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,916
If you do, the next arrow
will strike your face.

348
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,583
[MAN] You are now entering the
domain of Lord Narsus of Daylam.

349
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,833
What's happening?

350
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,791
Leave now and no harm
will come to you.

351
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,958
Listen! Elam, it's Daryun!

352
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,166
I have come to
see your master.

353
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,208
Will you not let us pass?

354
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:07,333
[ELAM]
Why, Lord Daryun. It is you!

355
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,375
It's been such a long time.

356
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,250
I hope you'll forgive
me about the arrow.

357
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,166
I did not know it was you.

358
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,125
[DARYUN]
You've gotten taller, Elam.

359
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,750
How's your master?
In good health?

360
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,458
Yes. He is in fine
fettle as always, sir.

361
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,875
[DARYUN]
And his painting?

362
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,708
Does he still produce one
poor piece after another,

363
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,291
only to toss them all away?

364
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,000
I cannot claim to know
good art from a bad.

365
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,333
I just look after Lord
Narsus the best I can,

366
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,500
as my parents wished.

367
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,458
They were both slaves until
my master freed them, you see.

368
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,375
So it's the least I can do.

369
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,791
Hello, Narsus!
It is I, it's Daryun!

370
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,958
[NARSUS]
Hush, you raucous bastard.

371
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,000
You'll wake the whole mountain.

372
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,083
[NARSUS]
Honestly, old friend.

373
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,750
A deaf man could hear your bark
from a whole farsang away.

374
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,583
[NARRATOR] The master
of the mountain retreat

375
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,583
lacks the powerful build
of the Knight in Black,

376
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,250
but he has his own talents.

377
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,166
And they are no less impressive.

378
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,958
Next time:
"The World-Weary Strategist."

379
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,875
And thus would the
boy become a king.
