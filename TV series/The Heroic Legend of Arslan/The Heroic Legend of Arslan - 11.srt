00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,208
[LUSITANIAN OFFICER B]
Pardon, Your Highness.

2
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,333
But it appears the priests
have been hunting heathens

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,208
despite being ordered not to.

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,125
Not again. Stop the
zealots however you can.

5
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,208
With force if you must.

6
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,875
[LUSITANIAN OFFICER B]
Lord Bodin will object.

7
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,375
We're a small kingdom to
have become conquerors.

8
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,041
Was it the "might of God" that
led us to take Maryam and Pars?

9
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,250
No, sir.

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,125
I-I know we owe our
victory wholly to you.

11
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,458
Then trust me when
I give orders.

12
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,958
[BODIN] The decision should
be an easy one to make.

13
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,083
The lives of ten thousand
of these heathens

14
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,583
would make a suitable offering!

15
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,208
Oh. I don't know.

16
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,458
[BODIN]
There can be no question!

17
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,083
What possible reason can
you have to hesitate?

18
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,500
You must heed me!

19
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,125
[GUISCARD] I think it
better not to stir up

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,333
the people's hostility
for mere sport.

21
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,625
[BODIN grunts]

22
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,041
If we're not careful,

23
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,625
Pars's neighbors may join
her in outright rebellion.

24
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,208
We likely could not withstand
such an alliance.

25
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,500
[BODIN growls]

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,625
[BODIN]
If the heathens wish

27
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,333
to rise up in rebellion,
then I say let them.

28
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,625
My army of three hundred
thousand believers

29
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,416
will happily crush them,
down to the last man.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,250
War is a problem dealt with
by those on this earth.

31
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,583
Strategies are made by men,
not granted by heaven.

32
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,583
Thus, this is not a matter
that requires your attention.

33
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,083
You dare!

34
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,583
You wouldn't want to act outside
the bounds of your duties.

35
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,333
Such prideful presumption
on your part might anger God.

36
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:01,666
Never! This is a holy war!

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,541
It cannot be won by
secular forces alone.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,000
To that end,

39
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,375
I have determined the best
course of action is to

40
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:13,333
add to our fighting strength
with the loyal forces of God.

41
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,833
More soldiers! Who are they?

42
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,083
They're supposedly
holy warriors.

43
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,958
They serve their god
rather than man.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
[NARRATOR] Pars Era.
The year 320, December.

45
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,791
The Temple Knights,
a fighting force

46
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,583
answering directly to the
Archpriest, entered Ecbatana.

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,708
Their presence could
not mean anything good

48
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,833
for the Royal Capital.

49
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,916
[SAM]
Who... are... you?

50
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,125
[SAM] I'm alive. What I
don't understand is why.

51
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,458
[gasps]

52
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,125
Why've I been spared?

53
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,000
You ought to climb out of
that bed and kneel at my feet.

54
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,250
Captive or not, I am
still a knight of Pars.

55
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,666
There is only one man I will
kneel to, and that is my king!

56
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,333
Heh. If that is the case,

57
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,291
then I am happy to lay claim
to your obedience, knight.

58
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,833
[SAM]
Huh?

59
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,666
Impossible!

60
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:24,125
[HILMES] Not impossible at all.
I am Osroes's heir.

61
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,000
I am the rightful king of Pars.

62
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,666
[SAM gasping]

63
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,791
You were supposed to have died
in the fire 16 years ago!

64
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,208
[groans, panting]

65
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,791
[HILMES] Think upon
your earlier statement.

66
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,458
No doubt you'll realize who
your true lord and master is.

67
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,125
[NARRATOR]
As various factions

68
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,333
fought for control
of the capital,

69
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,291
Arslan and his company
sought to avoid ambush,

70
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,750
as they made their
way east to Peshawar,

71
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,000
and the largest remaining
Parsian force.

72
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,125
And what is "right"?
Is it like the sun?

73
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,916
Or is it, perhaps,
more like the stars?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,541
Only one sun casts
its light upon us,

75
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,000
but infinite stars
guide our way at night.

76
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,458
Regardless.

77
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,916
You're attempting to do right

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,333
according to your
own convictions.

79
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,125
And I would hate to see you
swayed from such a path.

80
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,416
[ARSLAN] How do I know which
path to choose?

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,916
Or what it is to
be a good ruler?

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,250
A poorly planned revolution
is doomed to fail.

[ELAM]
Your Highness.

00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,500
If we continue at this speed,
the horses will tire quickly.

[ARSLAN gasps]

Right. Elam?

00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,791
[ELAM]

00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,375
[ARSLAN]
What is your path?

What do you think the future
has in store for you?

91
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,750
[ELAM]
Uh...

92
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,208
Perhaps you wish to
become an advisor,

93
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,208
helping steer the
kingdom's policies?

94
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,375
Or a fearless commander,
leading warriors into battle?

95
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,208
[ELAM]
I don't know my future.

96
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,041
That's something Lord Narsus
will decide for me.

97
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,708
Until he does, I'll just have
to do my best serving him,

98
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,458
and learn as much
as he'll teach me.

99
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,208
A worthy goal.

100
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,666
If I want to rule well,
I should study, too.

101
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,000
I have a lot to learn.

102
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,958
You're going to be a good
king, I'm sure of it.

103
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,166
[ARSLAN]
Huh?

104
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,125
With Lords Narsus and
Daryun guiding you,

105
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,208
you're definitely
off to a good start.

106
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,500
You're right.

107
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,833
With all of you helping me,
I can't go wrong.

108
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,041
And I have you to thank
as much as the others.

109
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,625
I'm grateful, Elam.

110
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,125
Uh. My actions are only those
of any other proper attendant.

111
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,041
They are certainly nothing
worthy of your notice.

112
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,500
I disagree.

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,250
Rather an odd prince, isn't he?

114
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,708
How so?

115
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,791
You're the prince's vassal,
and Elam is your servant.

116
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,875
He doesn't serve
His Highness directly.

117
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,375
Why would he ever
pay him any mind?

[NARSUS] Hmph. The prince
doesn't behave

like most royalty.
I'll grant you.

known any of the royalty

much less their servants.

It isn't in their nature,
as far as I can tell.

00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,458
Who is it?

160
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,458
[ZANDEH] My name is Zandeh,
Your Highness.

161
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,458
I am Lord Kharlan's son.

162
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,958
I have come to serve you
in my late father's place.

163
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,166
I hope you will accept my
fealty just as you did his.

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,250
Sorry for your father's
death. He served me well,

165
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,291
and I'm certain you shall,
too. You have my faith.

166
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,500
I shall strive to do justice
to that faith, Highness.

167
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,791
[HILMES]
I know you will.

168
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,708
[ZANDEH]
Sir! I pledge you this.

169
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,375
I will find Arslan and Daryun,

170
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,000
and I will kill them as
they killed my father.

171
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,083
And once I've done so, I will
bring you their rotting heads.

172
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,833
You believe you would
prevail against Daryun?

173
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,083
Yes.

174
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,208
[HILMES]
Hmph.

175
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,000
Then you have
my leave, Zandeh.

176
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,625
I shall grant you
the opportunity

177
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,083
to take your revenge.

178
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,375
[ZANDEH]
Thank you!

179
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,916
[HILMES] My men are
nipping at Arslan's heels.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,541
We shall have him
before much longer.

181
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:16,375
[FARANGIS] Hear me, Djinn.
Be still! Hadeed! Hadeed!

182
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,750
[gasps] Is something wrong?

183
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,083
[FARANGIS]
It's the Djinn.

184
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,041
I'm afraid they're in a
rather foul mood tonight.

185
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,500
It seems there are
bloodthirsty folk nearby.

186
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,375
[gasps]

187
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:36,625
Our pursuers?

188
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,208
They've caught up to us.
Not surprising, really.

189
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,500
We took many detours
to avoid ambush.

190
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,583
[gasps]

191
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:44,458
[GIEVE]
This certainly isn't the most

192
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:45,750
pleasant
journey I've taken.

193
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,166
[ARSLAN]
Huh?

194
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,083
[GIEVE] The one consolation
is that I travel with you,

195
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,208
beautiful mistress of my heart!

196
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,666
[FARANGIS]
Ironic. For me,

197
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,583
the one stroke of misfortune
is that I travel with you.

198
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,125
Come, Mistress Farangis!

199
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,166
Are you not a true servant
of the divine Mithra?

200
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,416
A priestess should never
be false to her own heart.

201
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Now is not the time for
your games, musician.

202
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,666
[CAVALRYMAN A] Find them!
They should be in this area!

203
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,916
[DARYUN] Your Highness, please
take the others and go ahead.

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,916
[ARSLAN gasps]

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,291
[DARYUN]
I'll handle matters here.

206
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,375
[ARSLAN]
No!

207
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,541
[ARSLAN]
Daryun!

208
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,375
[NARSUS]
Highness!

209
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:35,916
[ARSLAN]
Uh!

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,666
You need to trust Daryun in
this. Let's go on, as he says.

211
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,250
[sighs]

212
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,708
Very well.

213
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,291
Into the forest, as
fast as we're able!

214
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,458
Protect the prince at all costs!

215
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,333
Yes, sir!

216
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,375
Off we go.

217
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,541
[ARSLAN grunts]

218
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,916
[ARSLAN]
Where are Narsus and Farangis?

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,708
[GIEVE] We must have
lost them along the way.

220
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,833
We ought to go on
without them.

221
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,166
We'll meet again at Peshawar.
It's what they would want.

222
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,708
Yes, you're right.

223
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,375
[ELAM]
Let's go.

224
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,291
[ARSLAN]
Please, you three. Stay safe.

225
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,833
[CAVALRYMAN B yelps]

226
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,541
[DARYUN] I'll rejoin
you soon, Your Highness.

227
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,666
Stay safe just a while longer.

228
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,708
[DARYUN]
Uh?!

229
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,291
[CAVALRYMAN BETA]
I've got you now!

230
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,708
[CAVALRYMAN BETA groans]

231
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,833
[DARYUN]
What are you doing here?!

232
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,375
That's a lot of men to
fight off, even for you.

233
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,875
I thought I would help.

234
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,916
[CAVALRYMEN yelling]

235
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,166
[CAVALRYMEN whimper]

236
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,125
Target the woman first!
She'll be the weaker one--

237
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,958
[CAVALRYMEN groaning]

238
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,416
Weaker, is it?

239
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,458
We can't win this fight.

240
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,208
[CAVALRYMEN scream]

241
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,958
[CAVALRYMAN K yelps]

242
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,208
[CAVALRYMAN L groans]

243

[DARYUN, FARANGIS gasp]

244
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,416
[ZANDEH]
What a disgrace!

245
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,000
[ZANDEH]
Spineless maggots, all of you!

246
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,041
Move!

247
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,500
[CAVALRYMEN groan]

248
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,625
Daryun! I know it was you
who killed my father Kharlan.

249
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,416
I'm here to make you pay!

250
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,250
Kharlan's son?

251
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,750
[ZANDEH]
Ha!

252
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,541
You should stay out
of my way, woman!

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,375
[ZANDEH yells]

254
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,250
What?

255
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,375
[ZANDEH groans]

256
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,250
[DARYUN]
Whoa.

257
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,166
His strength is incredible.

258
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,333
[DARYUN grunts]

259
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,166
[ZANDEH yells]

260
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,291
Die!

261
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,583
Many thanks for earlier.

262
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,125
[DARYUN yells]

263
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,291
[ZANDEH]
Uh!

264
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,708
[FARANGIS]
Shall we go?

265
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,166
[DARYUN]
Let's!

266
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,833
[CAVALRYMAN M]
Stop them!

267
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,416
[ZANDEH]
Dammit!

268
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,750
[FARANGIS] You hesitated.
You had the chance to kill him,

269
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,166
and you didn't take it. I
doubt he'd have done the same.

270
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,500
[DARYUN]
As do I.

271
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,583
But I make it a point
never to kill an opponent

272
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,250
who is already unhorsed.

273
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,833
[FARANGIS]
You're softer than you look.

274
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,833
[DARYUN]
Regrettably so.

275
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,000
[GIEVE] Honestly!
I came on this mad journey

276
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,625
for Mistress Farangis, not
to defend some royal brat.

277
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,125
[SOLDIER B groans]

278
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,500
[SOLDIER B groans]

279
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,833
Watch what you say. You need
to show him more respect.

280
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,041
Alas, lying has never
been a talent of mine.

281
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,541
[ARSLAN grunting]

282

[SOLDIER C groans]

283
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,625
[ELAM] Your Highness, most
of the enemy is on foot!

284
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,166
We can shake them!

285
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,375
[ARSLAN]
Good idea.

286
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,208
I'll protect from the rear.

287
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,083
[ENEMY CAPTAIN A]
Archers! Fire!

288
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,125
[ELAM screams, groaning]

289
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,625
[ARSLAN]
Uh! Elam!

290
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,416
Please, you have to keep
going, Your Highness!

291
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,791
Go!

292
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,916
[ARSLAN gasps]

293
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,166
Uh. Wha...?

294
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,166
A prince rescuing a servant?

295
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,458
What in the world is he doing?

296
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,458
[ELAM grunts]

297
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
Die!

298
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,291
[ELAM]
Uh?

299
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,500
Huh?

300
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,916
Highness. Why'd you come back?

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,250
It was the right thing to do.

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,291
[ELAM]
Uh. But I...

303
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,291
--[ELAM, ARSLAN gasp]
--[SOLDIERS grumble]

304
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,125
So it's come to this.

305
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,000
[GIEVE]
Hup!

306
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,250
Those... are gold pieces!

307
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,833
That isn't all, boys!

308
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,000
[GIEVE]
Time to get going.

309
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,708
[CAPTAIN A] What are you
idiots doing?! Charge!

310
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,208
[GIEVE grunts]

311
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,291
Too far down.

312
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,375
[ARSLAN gasps]
It's a dead end.

313
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,666
We have no choice
but to fight here.

314
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,125
[ELAM]
So it seems.

315
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,791
[sighs]

316
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,291
[CAPTAIN A] Well, they
didn't just vanish. Find them!

317
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,375
[splash]

318
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,500
[CAPTAIN A]
Uh? Huh?

319
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,583
[CAPTAIN A] Do they mean
to follow the river?

320
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,333
Head downstream and
look for them. Quickly!

321
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,750
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

322
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,125
How could they hope to
survive from such a height?

323
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,333
The idiot really thought
we made the jump?

324
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,416
[ARSLAN, ELAM sigh]

325
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:48,083
Apologies for earlier, Highness.
My weakness shames me.

326
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,666
It is my job to protect
you from harm.

327
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,583
Yet you saved me.
That's just wrong.

328
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,583
Stop, Elam. I acted
to save a friend.

329
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,000
What's wrong in that?

330
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,375
You call me friend?

331
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,708
But I am the child
of two freed slaves!

332
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,791
Our ranks are much too
far apart for friendship.

333
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,083
Must we always
observe rank, though?

334
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,875
If we do, I'll never
have any friends at all.

335
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,333
Or is it maybe that
you dislike me, Elam?

336
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,666
Of course I don't dislike you.

337
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,041
That settles it. We're friends.

338
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,625
Consider it a royal decree.

339
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,875
[ELAM]
Uh!

340
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, whatever
the case may be,

341
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:35,916
you saved my life,
Your Highness,

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,750
and I shall do my best
to repay the debt I owe.

343
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,083
[ARSLAN]
Gieve.

344
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,041
[GIEVE]
Yes?

345
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,041
I am very sorry
about earlier.

346
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,166
[GIEVE]
Hmm?

347
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,000
I know gold means
a great deal to you,

348
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,875
and you threw yours
away to save me.

349
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,916
[GIEVE]
Uh... Uh.

350
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,291
[ARSLAN]
I promise, I'll repay y--

351
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,791
Oh, no! It's enough to hear
royalty just apologize!

352
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:08,666
Er, I, uh. Out of curiosity,
what was your childhood like?

353
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,208
Did you spend your younger
years outside the palace?

354
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,041
Uh. How could you tell?

355
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,541
Let's just call
it a... hunch.

356
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,125
Yes, until my nursemaid
and her husband passed away,

357
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,166
I lived with them,
outside the palace.

358
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,250
My childhood was
simple and normal,

359
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,541
uncomplicated by
any royal lineage.

360
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,250
I played with other children.

361
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,708
I was friends with them, even
went to school with them.

362
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,750
[GIEVE]
Hm. I see.

363
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,791
That likely explains
why you're so different

364
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,833
from the other royalty
I've encountered.

365
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,958
[ARSLAN]
Different?

366
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,833
Yes.

367
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,708
I hadn't realized.

368
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:48,250
I can see why Narsus has taken
such a keen interest in you.

369
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,791
I think the kingdom you build
when you sit the throne

370
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:54,208
will be one I shall be proud
to be a part of. Eh?

371
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,708
[ELAM]
Uh!

372
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,791
[ARSLAN]
Thank you, Gieve.

373
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:05,208
Now, let's go. On! To Peshawar!

374
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,125
[NARRATOR] Daryun and
Farangis find themselves

375
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,708
encircled by an
overwhelming enemy force.

376
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,083
To make matters worse,

377
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,250
they must also face a man
still bent on revenge.

378
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,625
Next time,
"A Knight's Loyalty."

379
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,666
And thus would the
boy become a king.
