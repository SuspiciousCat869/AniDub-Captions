1
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,666
[ARSLAN] The foot soldiers will
be led by Rukham and Shagad,

2
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,833
the cavalry by Daryun, and
the flying column by Kishward.

3
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,333
To make this a decisive battle,

4
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,791
the cavalry must gain
entrance to the castle.

5
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:50,625
That cannot happen unless
we breach the castle walls.

6
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,916
And to do that, we must make
sure the enemy is occupied.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,750
[NARSUS]
We'll have several options.

8
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,916
I have developed plans to
address a variety of situations.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
The trickiest of those would be

10
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,958
if the enemy is able to make the
most of their superior numbers.

11
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,458
But my plans are
most thorough. Daryun?

12
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,791
Yes. I know what to do.

13
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:14,791
I'm counting on you.

14
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,250
Thank you, Highness.

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,666
The victory will be ours.
On that I give you my word.

16
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,083
I feel so frustratingly useless.

17
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:36,291
Once the battle begins,
there's nothing I can do.

18
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,875
At that point, it's in
everybody else's hands.

19
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,458
[NARSUS] Awaiting results
is a commander's duty.

20
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,958
You are the banner
around which we rally.

21
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,208
Standing tall at the rear.

22
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,750
Brave and valiant warriors
of Lusitania, hear me!

23
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,333
By decree of Emperor Innocentis,

24
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,666
I have been tasked with the
command of this coalition force.

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,291
Heed me well.

26
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:23,583
Today's battle takes place here,
at the Keep of Saint Emmanuelle.

27
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,500
Fight with all your strength.

28
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,333
Do that and victory
will be ours!

29
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,083
[HILMES] This earth is
the rightful inheritance

30
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,583
of those who follow
the Faith of Yaldabaoth.

31
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,458
The ignorant Parsians
do not understand that.

32
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,666
They have no right to this land.

33
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,125
Ours is the righteous cause!

34
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,416
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

35
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,458
[HILMES]
The Parsian devils would despoil

36
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,916
that which belongs to god's
faithful! Will we let them?

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,250
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS]
No, sir!

38
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,083
[HILMES] No! We will
destroy the heathens!

39
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,250
We are a hundred
thousand strong.

40
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,500
We outnumber the enemy.

41
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,083
I command you.

42
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,833
The man who thwarted Andragoras
and defeated Pars at Atropatene.

43
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,875
Follow me and I promise you,

44
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,875
we will triumph again today!

45
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:52,333
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

46
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:12,625
Battering rams.
Siege towers. Forward!

47
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,000
[SHAGAD]
Uh.

48
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,750
Is that? It is! Lord Sam!

49
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,250
How could he?

50
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,458
He turned traitor?

51
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,166
He was a man of
honor, a Marzban.

52
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,750
How could he have become
a pawn of the Lusitanians?

53
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
A report for you, sir.

54
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,916
The walls of the keep
still stand firm.

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,083
We have yet to find
any weakness.

56
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,583
Additionally, some of the men
seem to be apprehensive.

57
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,708
Because Lord Sam
sides with our foe?

58
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,583
[ELAM]
Yes.

59
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,666
He was a well-respected Marzban,

60
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,583
and it is said that no one knows
how to defend a fortress better

61
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,791
than he.

62
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,208
I cannot blame them
for their apprehension.

63
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,333
What shall we do?

64
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,958
We continue fighting.

65
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:29,750
We were already aware that Sam
is among my cousin's commanders.

66
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,000
This doesn't change
what we must do.

67
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:35,041
I chose this path and
I shall remain on it.

68
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,791
Sir, may I have a word?

69
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,791
Yes, Étoile, what is it?

70
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,166
My lord count,

71
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,250
considering the significance
of this great battle,

72
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,708
I would like to request a
position on the front lines.

73
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,583
I can't allow it. The risk
to you would be far too great.

74
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,291
War is full of risk!

75
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:11,250
We are fighting to spread the
teachings of the true faith.

76
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,000
As knights of Lusitania, it is
our duty to oppose the heathens.

77
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,500
I don't care what happens to me!

78
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,250
No danger is too great!

79
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,625
[BARCACION]
Mmm.

80
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,375
Spoken with the passion
and ignorance of youth.

81
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,708
I feel I should tell you

82
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,541
that whether or not you
grant me your permission,

83
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,875
I will go to join the battle.

84
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,000
I realize that this
is presumptuous,

85
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,416
and I do apologize.

86
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,791
But that is how strongly I feel
about fighting the heathens.

87
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,708
I hope you know that.

88
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,375
[ÉTOILE]
Why can he not understand?

89
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,250
I have the chance
to kill their prince,

90
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,250
and I must take it, though
it may mean dying myself.

91
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,708
This is so dull.

92
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,458
I wanted to fight in
the thick of the battle.

93
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,625
[FARANGIS chuckles]

94
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,208
I'm curious, Alfarid.

95
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,291
What is it?

96
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
You are of the Zot Clan,
is that correct?

97
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,916
Yes, I am.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,583
Why, does that bother you?

99
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,125
No, of course it doesn't.

100
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,416
But as a nomadic people,

101
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,083
you don't recognize
the Parsian throne.

102
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,833
And yet, you have continued
to fight alongside us.

103
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,166
What of it?

104
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,000
Silver Mask killed
my father, you know.

105
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,958
And besides, I don't
mind helping the prince.

106
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,166
[FARANGIS] Because it's
what Lord Narsus wants?

107
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,041
[ALFARID]
Mh-hm.

108
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,750
That's just part of it, though.

109
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,541
I have a feeling about him.

110
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,041
I think Prince Arslan may
do something incredible.

111
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,166
[ALFARID] Narsus wouldn't
care about him so much

112
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,625
if he wasn't someone special.

113
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,250
You see it in him,
too, don't you?

114
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,500
I suppose so.

115
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,625
He would retake
the capital, restore it,

116
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,666
and reform the country.

117
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,833
Who could hope to accomplish
that at 14 years of age?

118
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,458
Maybe His Highness can.

119
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,166
When you're with him,
it's easy to believe it.

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,541
[FARANGIS]
He is fundamentally good.

121
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,458
If anyone can shape Pars into
a kingdom of worthy ideals,

122
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,291
it will be him.

123
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,791
[NARRATOR] The siege had been
in place for some hours.

124
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,291
The Parsians were beginning
to show signs of fatigue.

125
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,166
And then something
unexpected happened.

126
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,750
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E]
It's opening.

127
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,166
[PARSIAN SOLDIER F]
The gate is opening.

128
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,125
[PARSIAN SOLDIER G]
Don't ask, just charge it!

[ALL yelling]

130
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,208
Enough of your tedious siege.

131

Watch, Prince Hilmes!
I ride in your name.

132
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,083
When I return, it will
be with Arslan's head!

133
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,416
[JASWANT] Lord Daryun, the enemy
cavalry has sallied forth.

134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,958
[DARYUN]
Yes.

135
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,166
For Prince Arslan and Pars!

136
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,708
Onward!

[PARSIAN CAVALRY yelling]

No cavalry can
best that of Pars!

[yelling]

142
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,458
You are only useful to the men
you lead if you are still alive.

143
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,708
Be careful.

144
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,208
Heh. As if I need
advice from a foreigner.

145
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,208
The numbers are not on our side.

146
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,375
In a simple clash,
we're at a disadvantage.

147
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,000
I hope all proceeds as planned
with Kishward and his men.

148
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,125
I knew he would send someone.

149
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,291
Damn you, Sam.

150
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,791
Other Parsians?

151
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,791
[SAM] Use the aqueduct
to enter the Keep,

152
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,875
then open the gates from within.

153
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,666
That was the general
plan, was it not?

154
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,208
You send two simple
foot soldiers to take me?

155
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,708
If you want me dead,
you'll have to do better!

156
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,875
[SAM'S SOLDIER C]

Lower your sword!

You were once a proud

Prince Hilmes has done as a man?

Out of loyalty to
