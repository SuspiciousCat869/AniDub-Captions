1
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:39,666
[NARRATOR] Pars Era.
The year 321. February.

2
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,541
Daryun emerged victorious

3
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:44,583
from the duel before
the gods in Sindhura.

4
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:47,250
The people of that kingdom
lauded his valor,

5
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:51,708
hailing him as Sher Senani,
the Fierce Tiger General.

6
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,833
Driven out of his
mind with jealousy,

7
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:58,083
Gadhevi turned his sword against
his own father, King Karikala,

8
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,458
and was imprisoned.

9
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:02,416
The Sindhuran throne
passed to Rajendra.

10
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:50,708
I know you have much to do.
I'll try to be brief.

11
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:53,291
Please, Father.
I am never too busy.

12
01:02:53,375 --> 01:02:54,583
Summon me at any time,

13
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:58,000
and I'll come to your side
as swiftly as I can.

14
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,375
I would ask something
of you. A final request.

15
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,125
Yes, anything.

16
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:05,375
Your brother's
actions were wrong,

17
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:09,333
but for my sake, can you find
it in your heart to forgive him?

18
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,750
I do not have much
time remaining now.

19
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,125
I would die in peace,

20
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,791
but I cannot bear the idea
of leaving this life

21
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,500
knowing that one of my sons
will kill the other.

22
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,333
Then rest easy.

23
01:03:22,416 --> 01:03:24,125
Gadhevi is my brother.

24
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,041
I could not bring myself
to take his life.

25
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:30,000
I shall have him placed
in the care of a temple.

26
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:33,041
Thank the gods,
and you, as well.

27
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,208
Thank you for your
mercy, Rajendra.

28
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,750
[RAJENDRA] It is not
my place to seek revenge.

29
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,166
Rather, I must work
to reunify Sindhura

30
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,291
in the wake of this conflict.

31
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:46,125
[RAJENDRA]
Now, try not to speak any more.

32
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,958
You must be careful
not to exert yourself.

33
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:53,875
You have grown from a
brave boy into a fine man.

34
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:57,333
I know now that I was not wrong
to yield the throne to you.

35
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,750
My mistake was in not
turning it over sooner.

36
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,541
[DARYUN]
I hope he's found peace.

37
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:45,250
Although his decisions were
not always the most wise,

38
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:48,041
it seems he was still a
good king to his people.

39
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:49,208
Yes.

40
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:51,000
That's plain from
the number of subjects

41
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,416
who have come to mourn him.

42
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,875
Indeed.

43
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:58,083
And I believe he was as good
a father as he was a king.

44
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,916
That is quite a display.

45
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,458
But if he hopes
to be convincing,

46
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,083
he may be overdoing it.

47
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:16,333
I suspect those tears are real.

48
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,166
I don't think it's an act.

49
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,500
Oh?

50
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,458
Then you think his love
for his father is greater

51
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,666
than his thirst for power. Huh.

52
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,500
Well, I wouldn't
go quite that far.

53
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,333
All you need to
know about Rajendra

54
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,750
is that the man is
a born performer.

55
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:34,541
Such a performer, in fact,
that he can even fool himself.

56
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,250
[DUNGEON GUARD]
Get up.

57
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,666
[JASWANT]
Prince Arslan. It was you, then?

58
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,666
You're the one who had me freed.

59
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,125
[ARSLAN]
Yes.

60
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:12,333
To be more specific, I had
you placed in my custody.

61
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,208
If that is the case,

62
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,458
I suppose I owe you my thanks.

63
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,458
[ARSLAN]
Now that you're free,

64
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,458
what does the future
hold for you?

65
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:23,791
[JASWANT] That is something
I cannot answer yet.

66
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:26,791
All I know for certain is there
is no longer a place for me

67
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,083
in this kingdom.

68
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,041
As different as we may be,

69
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:34,916
you and I have
something in common.

70
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,333
And what is that?

71
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:39,041
We both have uncertain origins.

72
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:42,291
My parentage is a mystery, also.

73
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,666
I am called the Crown
Prince of Pars,

74
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,708
but my true station
may not be so lofty.

75
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:49,583
And yet, they
remain loyal to me.

76
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,500
Daryun, Narsus, all of them.

77
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:56,166
In turn, I strive to be worthy
of the faith they place in me.

78
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:02,541
If you wish, there is room
for you in my company.

79
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,541
You would take me in?

80
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:07,958
I'd be honored to.

81
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,333
You say you have no
place in Sindhura?

82
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,250
Well, you have one with me.

83
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:20,875
Prince Arslan, there you are.

84
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,333
I have been looking for you.

85
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,916
Good day, King Rajendra.

86
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,875
How may I be of help?

87
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,458
We are going to be holding
a banquet this evening.

88
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:31,416
I apologize for the
lateness of the invitation,

89
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,416
but I wonder if I might
I ask you to attend

90
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,708
as a guest of state?

91
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:36,125
That is quite sudden.

92
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:37,666
A banquet for whom?

93
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,041
[DARYUN]
I don't understand this.

94
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:56,250
Gadhevi may be royalty,
but he committed treason.

95
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,333
And they're holding a
banquet in his honor?

96
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,041
[NARSUS]
Seems odd, I know.

97
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,750
It is tradition in Sindhura
to offer a royal prisoner

98
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,916
good food and wine
before he is executed.

99
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,916
Well, that's kind of them.

100
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,333
The process is likely less
painful for the condemned

101
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:13,375
if he's in a drunken stupor.

102
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,166
[FARANGIS]
Knowing that,

103
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:19,166
Gadhevi must suspect he's eating
the last meal of his life.

104
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,791
Does something
trouble you, Brother?

105
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:27,083
You don't seem to have much
of an appetite this evening.

106
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,208
[GADHEVI]
It has been difficult for me,

107
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:33,000
but I am ready to admit it.

108
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:36,250
The gods have spoken.
The throne is rightfully yours.

109
01:08:36,333 --> 01:08:37,666
Oh?

110
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,250
[GADHEVI]
I will swear my loyalty to you

111
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:45,208
and place myself
in your service.

112
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,166
If I do, then surely you'll
allow me to live, won't you?

113
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,583
Please stop.

114
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,208
It hurts me to see you beg
for your life so pitifully.

115
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:55,291
Are we not brothers?

116
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,625
Do we not share the same blood?

117
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:00,000
So... then you'll...?

118
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,083
[SUBJECT A]
It's the Crown Prince of Pars!

119
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,666
[SUBJECT B] I didn't know
he was attending tonight!

120
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,875
[SUBJECT C]
Ah! Prince Arslan!

121
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,125
[GADHEVI]
The young Parsian prince.

122
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:20,041
Ever since he came to Sindhura,
things have gone badly for me.

123
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,625
If only he had never
set foot in our land.

124
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:25,916
If only he stayed in his own
kingdom, where he belongs.

125
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,041
Restrain yourself, Gadhevi!

126
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,000
[GADHEVI]
You!

127
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,666
[yells]

128
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,916
[GADHEVI yelling]

129
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:40,458
This is all your fault!
I'll make you pay!

130
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,041
[GADHEVI screaming]

131
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:59,708
I don't know why I
expected better of you.

132
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,500
Perhaps father will
know what to do with you

133
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:03,666
in the world beyond this one.

134
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:08,291
Unhand me! Insolent fools!

135
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,708
[RAJENDRA]
Do it.

136
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,375
[GADHEVI]
No! No, stop!

137
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:43,375
How are you faring?

138
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,791
We were always
ill-suited as brothers.

139
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,875
Perhaps if we'd been unrelated.

140
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:50,875
Well, no sense in wondering now.

141
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:54,333
The rivalry between us
has truly come to an end.

142
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,333
I'm sorry. I feel at fault.

143
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:59,625
No. You mustn't, please.

144
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,791
After all you've done
for me, I am grateful.

145
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,416
But that's enough of
such unpleasantness.

146
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,666
You'll soon be returning
to Pars, will you not?

147
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:10,750
I will.

148
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,750
We plan on leaving
tomorrow, in fact.

149
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,750
Going home to drive
out the Lusitanians

150
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,333
once and for all, eh?

151
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:17,250
[ARSLAN]
Yes.

152
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,708
[RAJENDRA]
Hmm.

153
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,250
You know, if I were making
the strategy for Lusitania,

154
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:23,541
I would try to rile up
Pars's neighbors.

155
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:25,625
Which kingdoms did
you have in mind?

156
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:29,125
You have Turk to the east
and Turan to the northeast.

157
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,041
I would send envoys to both.

158
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,708
Incite them to violate
Pars's borders.

159
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,125
Which would leave
Lusitania perfectly poised

160
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,000
to attack us from behind.

161
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,916
Then you think I've
read the situation?

162
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,208
Yes. Narsus has spoken of
that possibility, as well.

163
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,791
Has he? In that case,
maybe you would like my help

164
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,916
devising your strategies, too.

165
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,125
But, fortunately,

166
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,625
Narsus also listed off
seven possible ways

167
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,000
we could foil such a plot.

168
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:54,833
Sorry. Seven, you say?

169
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,541
Yes. Impressive, eh?

170
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,791
[RAJENDRA]
Quite.

171
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:00,291
I would be interested
to hear more about them.

172
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:03,750
He refused to provide any
further details, even to me.

173
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,416
Seems they're confidential.

174
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,875
[RAJENDRA]
Oh.

175
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:07,916
[ARSLAN]
Hm.

176
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:10,750
[RAJENDRA]
Well, enough about that for now.

177
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,083
I'd like to discuss
the promise I made you.

178
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,583
That in exchange for your
help against my brother,

179
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:19,291
I would offer you my help
against the Lusitanian invaders.

180
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:20,375
Right.

181
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,958
It is time I fulfilled
that promise.

182
01:12:22,041 --> 01:12:23,750
I know how great
a debt I owe you,

183
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,583
and as long as it
is within my power,

184
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:27,500
I will assist you in any way.

185
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:30,125
Land, I'm afraid,
I cannot offer you.

186
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:32,125
But perhaps provisions or funds.

187
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:33,958
Or lovely ladies for company?

188
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:36,125
Let me think.

189
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:40,458
Very well. If you would lend me
five hundred or so soldiers.

190
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,833
Is that all?

191
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,833
A mere five hundred soldiers?

192
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:45,208
You would think
we were strangers

193
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:47,250
for you to ask so
little. Come now.

194
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,041
I will lend you three
thousand cavalry.

195
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:51,166
Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

196
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,125
It's done! Three thousand!

197
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:56,541
Any fewer, and people will
think I don't repay my debts.

198
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,083
Well, I certainly wouldn't
want to embarrass you.

199
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,958
Three thousand cavalry it is.

200
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,541
Good!.

201
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,583
As your brother-of-the-heart,
it's the very least I can do.

202
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,083
[RAJENDRA chuckles]

203
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,458
Your Majesty, what
are you thinking?

204
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:15,583
We cannot spare so many
men at a time like this!

205
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:17,708
We have not yet even
fully restored peace

206
01:13:17,791 --> 01:13:19,333
within our own borders!

207
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,708
To loan out troops
now is foolhardy!

208
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:23,708
[RAJENDRA]
You don't see it, do you?

209
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,000
Those three thousand
men are the kindling.

210
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:28,791
They'll start a fire that
reduces the Parsians to ash.

211
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,291
I don't understand.

212
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:33,166
Daryun and his men
may be mighty fighters,

213
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,041
but surely even they will fall
if undermined from within.

214
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,083
To turn on them like that.

215
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:40,291
They held up their end of
the bargain, didn't they,

216
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,458
Your Majesty?

217
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,791
And that is why I am
going to help them.

218
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:45,291
Prince Arslan.

219
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:48,541
I actually grew to like
the sentimental little fool.

220
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,000
By playing this trick on him,

221
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,125
I will help him to
mature as a ruler.

222
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:56,041
I imagine it will be a rather
educational experience for him.

223
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,958
So whatever happened
to that bastard, anyway?

224
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:26,125
Which one?

225
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,541
You know. Jaswant.

226
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:30,083
He didn't end up
coming with us, did he?

227
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,750
No, I don't believe so.

228
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,500
That suits me just fine.

229
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:34,625
After all that has happened,

230
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,666
I don't know how
we could trust him.

231
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,583
So, Daryun,

232
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:42,250
how do our borrowed
soldiers fare?

233
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,875
Do they seem to
be adjusting well?

234
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,625
[DARYUN] You mean General
Kunthavai's company?

235
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,541
They are well officered.

236
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:52,541
And they respond readily
to orders from our men.

237
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,458
I expect they would already
be useful in a fight.

238
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:58,583
[NARSUS] I see.
That's good to be aware of.

239
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,833
Your Highness, the sun
will be setting soon.

240
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,958
Shall we find somewhere
to make camp?

241
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,666
[RAJENDRA'S ADJUTANT]
It has begun.

242
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:02,166
Sly old Kunthavai.

243
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,000
I knew he was the right
person for this task.

244
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:09,000
Let's go! They're
ripe for the picking!

[RAJENDRA'S ARMY yelling]

246

Prince Arslan is
not to be killed.

247

and brought to me!

plotting against Pars!

further this evening.

Rein in your horse
and drop your weapon.

267

It looks as though
I must admit defeat.

268
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,250
I'm afraid I don't
have it in my heart

269
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,708
to harm such a beautiful woman.

Don't look at me
like a hurt pup.

It's not my fault.
This is the nature of war.

Although,

how did you see through my plot?

it rather well.

It's as I suspected, then.

Hello, Jaswant.

You do not show much
respect for your new king.

No.

concocted this time?

01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,166
If they learned of my absence...

318
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,000
They would be
shocked, I'm sure.

319
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,875
For a ruler so freshly
acknowledged

320
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:48,000
to abandon his
kingdom so suddenly.

321
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,375
I beg you, don't!

322
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:51,125
If you go through
with this scheme,

323
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:54,375
there won't be a Sindhura for me
to return to in two years' time!

324
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,625
[ARSLAN]
Very well.

325
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,916
I have an alternative
option you may prefer.

326
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,500
Sign a nonaggression treaty.

327
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:02,791
Engage in no conflict
with Pars for three years.

328
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:04,625
[RAJENDRA]
Three years.

329
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:11,208
Fine! I'll sign the thing!

330
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:13,541
That's what you want,
are you happy?

331
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:32,625
[ALFARID] Hey, Narsus.
Can I ask you something?

332
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:33,708
[NARSUS]
Of course.

333
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:35,375
[ALFARID]
You had him cornered.

334
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,083
Why not go for more
than three years?

335
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,166
Ten, fifty, even a hundred?

336
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,083
Rajendra is not a patient man.

337
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:44,875
For someone like him, even ten
years would be as an eternity.

338
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:47,791
He would never be able
to hold back for so long.

339
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,458
[GIEVE]
I see your logic.

340
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:50,875
With a term of three years,

341
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:53,875
he's more likely to wait
rather than violate the treaty.

342
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,041
However,

343
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,750
three years will leave
him plenty of time

344
01:20:56,833 --> 01:20:58,416
to restore harmony to Sindhura.

345
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,125
And then, he's likely
to invade Pars again.

346
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,583
[NARSUS]
Quite.

347
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:04,458
Which is all the more reason
we must help His Highness

348
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,291
to drive off the Lusitanians

349
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,083
and retake the capital
as soon as we can.

350
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,208
[DARYUN]
Your Highness.

351
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,333
Daryun.

352
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,000
I still can't bring
myself to hate him.

353
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:23,875
Surely after all that Rajendra's
done, I should despise him.

354
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:30,791
Does that way of thinking
make me overly indulgent?

355
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,541
If King Andragoras found
himself in your position,

356
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:38,833
I cannot believe he would
forgive Rajendra's actions.

357
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:41,000
I imagine you're right.

358
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,958
But you are you.

359
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:45,333
You are not your father.

360
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:47,250
And there's nothing
to say you must emulate

361
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,791
his way of thinking.

362
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,541
Nor will I.

363
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,791
The treaty should buy
us the time we need.

364
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,708
It oughtta keep Rajendra
quiet for a while, at least.

365
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,041
I hope so.

366
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,208
[ARSLAN]
Jaswant.

367
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,458
I am a Sindhuran subject.

368
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:13,958
If Pars and Sindhura should
find themselves at war again,

369
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:17,250
I will side with my kingdom
and fight against Pars.

370
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,708
Will you?

371
01:22:18,791 --> 01:22:21,208
[JASWANT] However,
you have now saved my life

372
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:23,750
on three separate
occasions, Your Highness.

373
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:26,958
It's a debt of honor,
and I mean to repay it.

374
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,666
Until I do, I am your man.

375
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,166
If you will have me,

376
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:35,708
then I will swear to serve you
to the best of my ability.

377
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:38,250
Yes. I'll be honored.

378
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:45,416
[NARRATOR] And so, with the
addition of a new companion,

379
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,666
Arslan's first foreign military
campaign came to an end.

380
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:55,250
[NARRATOR] Pars Era.
The year 321. Mid-February.

381
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:59,291
The theatre of war shifts
back to Pars once again.

382
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,625
[NARRATOR]
The time has come for Hilmes

383
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,333
to carefully consider his
ultimate aspirations

384
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:40,958
and decide which course of
action will serve them best.

385
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,416
Next time: "The End of Winter."

386
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,375
And thus would the
boy become a king.
