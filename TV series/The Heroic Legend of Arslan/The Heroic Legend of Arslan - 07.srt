1
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,666
[SOLDIER A]
You want a clean death?

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,791
Tell us where the queen is!

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,291
[ATTENDANT A]
Mercy.

4
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:41,958
Sorry. What?

5
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,791
I can't quite make out
what you're saying.

6
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,166
Restore order! Clear
a path through here.

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,625
Make yourselves
presentable. His Majesty,

8
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,416
Innocentis the Seventh,
King of Lusitania has arrived!

9
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,333
[yawns]

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,416
[INNOCENTIS]
The stench!

11
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,125
[SOLDIER B] Kill everyone!
Grant no quarter!

12
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,916
[PRIEST A screams]

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,625
[SOLDIER A] The Queen has yet
to be found! Keep looking!

14
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,250
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

15
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:07,875
[SOLDIER C]
Any luck?

16
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,375
[SOLDIER D]
No sign of her yet.

17
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,916
[ARZHANG] Thus far, all
has gone according to plan.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Indeed. Pigs are
simple creatures.

19
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,458
Keep them fed and
they remain happy.

20
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,875
This victory will go
straight to their heads.

21
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,500
Damn Lusitanian savages.

22
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,708
[MONTFERRAT] I hear the
Man in the Silver Mask

23
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,583
captured Queen Tahamenay.

24
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,000
[BAUDOUIN] Oh? Well,
that's a point in his favor.

25
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,666
But what of his true motives?

26
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,333
Does he serve out of a genuine
interest in Lusitania's future?

27
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,291
Difficult to say. All I know

28
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,416
is that there's something
uncanny about his eyes.

29
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,041
I don't much care for that.

30
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,458
[door squeaks]

31
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,750
[BAUDOUIN]
Uh?

32
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,500
[MONTFERRAT]
Here she comes.

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,958
They didn't
exaggerate her beauty.

34
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,625
I hear her first betrothal
was to the Grand Vizier

35
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,708
of the Principality
of Badakhshan.

36
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,625
But his lord, Prince Keyumars,
reportedly stole her away.

37
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,208
[BAUDOUIN]
A lord taking the betrothed

38
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,625
of one of his advisors? But that
sort of thing just isn't done.

39
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,416
The Grand Vizier
took his own life.

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,708
Prince Keyumars fared
little better, however.

41
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,666
He leapt to his
death when Osroes,

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,458
the previous king
of Pars, invaded.

43
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,291
The story doesn't end there.

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,125
Osroes and his younger
brother Andragoras

45
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,000
fought over Tahamenay
and had a falling out.

46
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,041
Officially, Osroes
fell ill and died,

47
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,666
but it is whispered that
Andragoras actually had him

48
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,625
assassinated so he could take
both Tahamenay and the throne.

49
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,666
[BAUDOUIN] It sounds like
that woman brings misfortune

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,583
to every man who seeks to
possess her. What is she?

51
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,333
Some unearthly creature?

52
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,083
[MONTFERRAT] If so,
her sorcery will end today.

53
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,958
[yawns]

54
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,541
His Majesty will make no
allowances for a heathen,

55
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,000
however pretty.

56
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,666
The only question is what
sort of death she will face.

57
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,250
[INNOCENTIS]
Hm...

58
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,166
[MONTFERRAT]
Huh?

59
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,541
Oh, my!

60
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,750
[OFFICIALS gasping]

61
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,333
[OFFICER B] Prince Guiscard!
Has anybody seen the prince?

62
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,291
He is needed!

63
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,833
Prince Guiscard!

64
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,000
[GUISCARD] Such a racket.
What is the matter?

65
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:42,125
His Majesty. [groans] He's
demanding the impossible.

66
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,958
We don't know what
to do, Your Highness.

67
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,500
Take a breath, man.
What does he want?

68
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,875
Something ridiculous,
I have no doubt.

69
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,958
[OFFICER B] Will you not
prevail upon him to see sense?

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,333
[GUISCARD] I've many things
to see to at present.

71
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,791
All companies, check your
weapons and equipment.

72
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,916
There's no telling when
the Parsians will rally.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,208
Well, what is it?

74
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,583
It's madness!

75
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,458
His Majesty insists that
Tahamenay become his queen!

76
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,416
[GUISCARD]
Huh?!

77
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,083
[OFFICER C]
Ah! The wealth of Pars

78
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,333
is even greater
than I had heard!

79
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,500
Yes, this is a most
impressive collection.

80
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,291
[GUISCARD]
Wait, Brother!

81
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,250
[INNOCENTIS] Oh? What
do you want now, Guiscard?

82
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,041
What's this... about
you marrying Tahamenay?

83
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,333
Yes, everyone seems
to be against it, though.

84
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,875
Find some way to persuade
them all, won't you?

85
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,875
[GUISCARD sighs]
Think it through.

86
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,041
Have you not heard about the
miserable fates met by other men

87
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,583
who were involved with her?
Would you be her next victim?

88
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,208
Of course I know
the stories.

89
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,625
But those other men were
all heathens. That's right.

90
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,166
They were unworthy of her.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,208
And in His wisdom, perhaps
God was testing her, as well.

92
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,750
Wha...?

93
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,125
She will not know happiness
until she marries a practitioner

94
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:02,291
of the Faith of Yaldabaoth.
Such must be her true destiny!

95
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,708
[GUISCARD]
That's absurd.

96
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,583
[OFFICER D sighs]

97
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,125
[INNOCENTIS]
You men there!

98
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:10,125
It is God's divine insight that
has granted us this victory.

99
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,291
This treasure will be
offered up to Him.

100
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,500
It is not for the
likes of you to touch.

101
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,375
[OFFICER D]
Yes, Your Majesty!

102
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,708
This treasury and its
contents shall be placed

103
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,833
under Archpriest
Bodin's supervision.

104
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,333
What are you saying?!

105
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,791
It's our duty as faithful
followers of God

106
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:30,291
to show our devotion. [yawns]
I am so very tired. I must rest.

107
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,166
[GUISCARD]
Lord Brother!

108
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,875
[INNOCENTIS]
And bring me some sugar water.

109
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,541
[ATTENDANT A]
Yes, sire! Right away!

110
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,916
All of this will go to Bodin?

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,125
[OFFICER E grunts]

112
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,375
[GUISCARD]
Just the thought of my brother

113
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,375
siring a child
upon that heathen!

114
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,666
It turns my stomach!

115
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,708
[SILVER MASK] Don't concern
yourself. It won't happen.

116
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,458
Ah. You.

117
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,000
It is you who has led
Lusitania's army.

118
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,583
It is you who has
given the people

119
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,708
this sweet taste of victory.
You, and not your fool brother,

120
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,541
have the makings
of true greatness.

121
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,750
So worry not.

122
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,375
All of your subjects
know your true worth.

123
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,791
[GUISCARD exhales]

124
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,000
[SILVER MASK] However, the
time to act is not yet upon us.

125
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,458
For now, Your Highness,
you must endure.

126
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,791
[GUISCARD]
I understand.

127
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,833
I meant to tell you. Your
strategies were helpful indeed.

128
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,791
They certainly
aided our victory.

129
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,166
You honor me, Highness.

130
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,791
[GUISCARD]
However, that fog...

131
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,666
There are some
calling it uncanny.

132
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,166
Perhaps even the
work of a sorcerer.

133
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,583
Not sorcery, I assure you.
It was the grace of God.

134
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,166
[SOLDIER E]
Outta the way.

135
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,750
[MERCHANT A whimpering]

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,416
[SOLDIER F]
I'll take this.

137
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,916
Yes, sir. Of course!

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,083
[SOLDIERS laughing]

139
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,583
[ANIMAL KEEPER A]
Damn Lusitanian soldiers.

140
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,458
They have no respect
for anybody.

141
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,000
From what I hear,

142
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,083
they'll kill a man for so much
as lookin' at 'em sideways.

143
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,666
Hmph. Who can do
business like this?

144
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,958
Parsian soldiers? Impossible.

145
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,333
[ANIMAL KEEPER B] Oh. That
must be the traitor Kharlan

146
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,750
and his company.

147
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,916
The sneaky bastard who turned
his cloak at Atropatene.

148
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,250
[ÉTOILE]
Thank you.

149
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,125
Uh. Is that...?

150
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:40,833
Hey.

151
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,625
Sir!

152
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,833
How can we help you?

153
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,041
We don't have any
supplies to offer.

154
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,541
We run a show tent, you see.

155
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,250
[ÉTOILE]
No, that's not it.

156
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,666
You've been in the city for
a long time, haven't you?

157
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,958
[ÉTOILE] What do you
know of Lusitanian slaves?

159
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,833
Huh? Uh...

160
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,458
It was three years ago.
Some men were brought here

161
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:03,000
to become slaves. They were
soldiers from Lusitania.

162
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,916
[KHARLAN] How many times
did I warn you to be careful?

163
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,333
Useless bunch of fools!

164
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,833
We're sorry we failed you!

165
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,125
[KHARLAN grunts]
You're dismissed.

166
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,666
[MEN]
Yes, sir.

167
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,708
[SILVER MASK] Seems this
Narsus fellow led them around

168
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,833
by the noses. And yet
you go easy on them.

169
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,875
[KHARLAN] I blame myself
for their clumsiness.

170
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,625
You're a capable commander.

171
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,208
No oversights on
your part, I'm sure.

172
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,250
I shall continue to expect much
of you. Is that understood?

173
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,791
Yes, sir. I will go
to Prince Guiscard

174
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,791
and ask his permission
to muster my men.

175
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,250
He seems to think much of
himself for a dirty traitor.

176
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,083
He would've been defeated along
with the rest of his countrymen.

177
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
I have no idea what he's doing
in such a prominent post,

178
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,750
he hasn't even converted.

179
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,750
So much for bravery and loyalty.

180
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,458
Seems betraying your
friends is the way

181
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,750
to move up in this world.

[GENERALS laugh]

183
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,916
[ÉTOILE] Do you know
of any Lusitanian slaves?

184
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
They were in the city.

185
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,958
It would've been
about three years ago.

Mm-mm.

[ÉTOILE ]
I'm looking for my friends.

188
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,500
Perhaps you know
something of them?

189
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,416
I failed.

190
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,291
I vowed to come back,
but I failed all of them.

191

[ÉTOILE] That boy I
took as my hostage.

192
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,791
He seemed like the son
of a prominent family.

193
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,875
I wonder if they
have many slaves.

194
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,333
[ÉTOILE gasps]
If I find him, he may know!

No. Such an idiot isn't likely
to have survived until now.

Is there another battle?

199
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,916
[TOWNSPERSON B]
That's Lord Kharlan!

He's no "lord" anymore!

You there! Girl!

Do you find soldiers
so fascinating?

204
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,833
Sorry, it's such a
grand procession.

205
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,583
I was wondering what it's for.

206
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,166
This?

207
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,958
They're heading out to look for
that prince who's on the run.

208
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,583
Oh, really? Have they found
out his location, then?

209
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:30,500
I don't know, but I bet they're
gonna do their best to find him.

210
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,750
They betrayed the prince and
his family after serving them

211
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:37,125
for years. Probably in their
interest for him to die.

212
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,541
You know much!
So, what about the rumors

of how King Andragoras
has gone missing?

214

They're true, as far
as we can tell.

215
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,208
Anyway, why don't you
just come with me?

216

We can talk in more
detail over here.

What are you doing,
sir? Let me go!

00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,416
All the more reason for us to
get to know each other better.

He's leading a column

of soldiers to capture

266

I counted well over a

a little excessive?

A thousand men
just to capture me?

269
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,458
He doesn't know our number,

270
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,916
so it's in his interest
to be cautious.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,666
Lest you forget, you're
a walking, talking cause.

272
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,333
If we announced that you would
be at the head of an army.

273
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,000
we could rally together a force

274
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,208
that would stand
against Lusitania.

275

[ELAM]
And as you can imagine,

276
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,208
that would be pretty
inconvenient for them.

277
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,333
Yes, but how do you think
they intend to find me

00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,583
when they haven't
managed it so far?

279
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,791
If I were in Kharlan's shoes,

280
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:26,166
and I wished to capture you
as quickly as possible, well,

281
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,958
I would find a village full of
your loyal subjects and burn it.

An entire village?

00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,083
[NARSUS] That is one
tactic he could employ.

284
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,375
Burn the village, killing
all within, of course,

285
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,375
and announce his
deed to the world,

286
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,500
using it as a means to draw
Your Highness out of hiding.

287
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,250
He could then continue
in that vein,

burning village after village

If so, then why aren't
you stopping him?

313
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,000
[NARSUS] Am I to stop him from
proving himself a man of honor

314
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,916
and compassion, who
cares for his subjects?

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Besides, Kharlan has
information we need.

316
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,041
Without it, we only
know half the story.

317
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,541
We're hoping to catch a
lion cub. Like it or not,

318
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,750
that may require us to
venture into the lion's den.

319
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,750
[DARYUN]
Ha. I see.

320
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,375
This was a little test you
designed for His Highness.

321
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,000
And what if he hadn't set
out to save the village?

322
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,416
Would you have deemed him
unfit to rule and left?

323
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,166
Why are you two chatting?
We must be off!

324
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,083
A village may be under
attack, even as we speak!

325
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,583
[GIEVE] Whoa, there!
Those are Lusitanian soldiers.

326
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,541
[GIEVE] It's always better to
avoid any unnecessary trouble.

327
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,583
[GIEVE]
Uh!

328
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,625
[GIEVE] Looks like they've been
raiding the local villages,

329
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,708
as I'd heard.

330
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:58,083
Ah, well. That's not
any concern of mine.

331
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,166
[GIEVE] What a woman! You
don't see many like that!

332
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,958
She's even more beautiful
than the queen,

333
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,625
and that's saying something.

334
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, no!

335
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
She's headed in the same
direction as those soldiers!

336
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,916
The brutes will
undoubtedly attack her.

337
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,208
Fortunately, I shall be
there to rescue her.

338
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
And naturally, she
will be most grateful

339
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,041
for my timely intervention.
She will want to find

340
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,958
some suitable way of
rewarding my heroism.

341
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,875
At least, I hope so.
Yes, surely she will!

342
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,875
It's decided, then!
I'm going after her!

343
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,125
[SOLDIER I]
Stop there.

344
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,375
Why's a woman traveling
this road alone?

345
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,000
[SOLDIER J] Answer his question,
wench, and be quick about it.

346
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,208
We're busy men.

347
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,583
[GIEVE] Oh, great Ashi,
Goddess of Fortune!

348
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,750
I must thank you for bestowing
upon me this most marvelous

349
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,541
of opportunities. I have ever
been your truest follower!

350
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,083
Come back here, you!

351
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,958
[SOLDIER I]
Uh...

352
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:15,833
[SOLDIER I groans]

353
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,625
[SOLDIER M]
She-- [grunts]

354
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,083
[SOLDIER O]
Quick, stop her-- Ah!

355
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,000
[GIEVE]
Hey, this isn't right.

356
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,750
How am I going to
put her in my debt

357
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,000
if she kills all the bastards?

358
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,708
Uh?!

359
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,208
Another...?

360
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,833
[GIEVE] So, they flee.
A wise choice.

361
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,458
Well, it seems that today
is your lucky day, madam.

362
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,375
If I, Gieve, had not just
happened to pass you by, you...

363
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,833
Hey, hold on.
What about my reward?

364
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,333
Madam, you're
forgetting something!

365
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,416
Wait, my lovely!

366
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,750
[GIEVE]
Uh...

367
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,083
[GIEVE]
Pardon, most exquisite beauty!

368
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,833
Are you addressing me, boy?

369
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,291
Not just a beauty,
but an exquisite one?

370
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,000
One doesn't find many women
who can be described as such.

371
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,125
[GIEVE] Your physical
beauty is enhanced

372
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,791
by your skill in
the arts of war.

373
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,750
I confess myself struck
dumb with admiration!

374
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,500
I am Gieve, my lady.

375
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,250
A humble traveling musician
with little to his name.

376
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,833
Yet I flatter myself that I
have a greater appreciation

377
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,000
for beauty than
any nobleman does.

378
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,666
I also happen to possess
some talent for verse

379
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,083
which I have employed to
compose a poem in your honor.

380
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,916
Her magnificent form, svelte
and straight as a cypress tree.

381
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,750
Her black hair. A piece
carved from the night sky.

382
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,583
Her bright eyes, which put
even emeralds to shame--

383
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,375
The night sky? Emeralds?

384
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,291
Your verse is sadly
lacking in originality.

385
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,791
Well, it is true that poetry
is not my greatest strength.

386
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,375
But I maintain that my
love for beauty and justice

387
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,666
is equal to that of
the great poets of old.

388
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,250
For that reason,

389
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,958
I was unable to stop myself from
rushing bravely to your rescue!

390
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,375
[FARANGIS]
My rescue? Bravely?

391
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,833
If it please you,

392
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,375
perhaps you would consider
favoring me with your name?

393
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,958
[FARANGIS]
My name is Farangis, minstrel.

394
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,791
I serve at the Temple of Mithra
in the Khuzestan region.

395
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,500
I am an emissary. I travel to
Ecbatana in that capacity.

396
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,541
Ah. Mithra! Yes.

397
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,583
My first loyalty is
to the Goddess Ashi.

398
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,958
But after her, it is to the
Divine Mithra that I turn next.

399
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,666
We share no ordinary
connection, lady Farangis!

400
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,041
We are fated to be--

401
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,250
I understand that the
capital has already fallen.

402
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,500
[GIEVE]
Uh.

403
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,500
I had not yet decided
where to journey next.

404
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,416
I was hesitant
to return home

405
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,541
and thought to
look for lodgings.

406
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,750
That was when I ran into
those Lusitanian dogs.

407
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,625
Their savagery is inhuman.

408
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,666
I don't know how much
more of it I can stomach.

409
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,583
[GIEVE] Yes. I've seen
that for myself.

410
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,333
They claim to serve their
god, but their hearts

411
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,458
seem to be empty of anything
like love or compassion.

412
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,500
Parsians are not blameless.

413
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,000
I hear some are reveling in the
chaos wrought by the invasion.

414
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,791
Even looting temples
of their riches.

415
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:15,708
Such acts disgust me. In fact I
find it particularly loathsome

416
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,500
to steal from
one's own people.

417
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:24,750
So, what's an emissary from
the temple doing way out here?

418
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,125
My sworn duty. I was sent as
both priestess and warrior

419
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,291
to find His Highness,
Prince Arslan.

420
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:42,791
[MALE VILLAGER A]
Please, have mercy!

421
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,041
[MALE VILLAGER B]
We know nothing!

422
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,833
I swear that's the truth!

423
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,125
[FEMALE VILLAGER A]
Why are soldiers of Pars

424
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,750
attacking their own people?

425
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,750
How can you do this?

426
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:56,333
[KHARLAN] Let them burn. You
heard me. The men only, for now.

427
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,208
If we knew anything,
we would tell you!

428
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,416
Please, you have to stop this!

429
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,958
You live only to
spread the word.

430
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,458
Any community that
gives shelter to Arslan

431
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:09,375
and his company will be
torched to the ground!

432
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,208
[MALE VILLAGERS scream]

433
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:48,375
[NARRATOR] In Kharlan's voice
there lies something too dark

434
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,750
and ruthless to be described
as simple derision.

435
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,625
Next time,
"The Treasonous Hero."

436
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,875
And thus would the
boy become a king.
