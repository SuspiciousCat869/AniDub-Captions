[yells]

3
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,291
Disarmed again.

4
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,541
I continue to make
little progress.

5
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,958
You judge yourself
too harshly, Highness.

6
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,583
Your sword-work has most
definitely improved.

7
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,541
You mustn't be discouraged.

8
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,916
So you always tell me,

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,125
but frankly I find it
difficult to believe.

10
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,833
I suppose battle is the
only real test, though.

11
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,708
Huh. You have the
right of it there.

12
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,791
But, given the state of things,
I can't say I expect any attack

13
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,791
on our fair kingdom
in the near future.

14
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,375
If it's battle
you're looking for,

15
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,666
you may yet have a
long wait ahead of you.

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,958
[VAHRIZ chuckles]

17
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,625
[CIVIL SERVANT]
Pardon me, Lord Er Vahriz.

18
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

19
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,208
[VAHRIZ]
What is it?

20
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,916
[CIVIL SERVANT] A message
from King Andragoras, sir.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,791
[VAHRIZ]
What does His Majesty write?

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
[VAHRIZ]
It can't be!

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,583
What message does
my father send?

24
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,625
It would seem I spoke too soon.

25
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,208
It's war.

26
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,750
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 320. Autumn.

27
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,958
The Lusitanian Army invaded and
conquered the Kingdom of Maryam.

28
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,458
It then set its sights
on Maryam's ally,

29
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,000
the Kingdom of Pars.

30
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,166
In response, Andragoras the
Third gathered his army

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,333
and led them himself to
the Fields of Atropatene,

32
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,791
where he intended to intercept
the invading Lusitanians.

33
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,125
Crown Prince Arslan is about
to embark on his maiden battle.

34
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,458
He is 14 years old.

35
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,583
[KHARLAN]
Are you terribly nervous

36
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,750
about the coming battle,
Your Highness?

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,375
Nervous?

38
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,583
This is your maiden
battle, after all.

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,458
No one would blame you.

40
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,625
Right.

41
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,666
Take heart. We're
sure to triumph.

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,541
The king has taken
to the field himself,

43
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,666
and everyone knows
his martial prowess.

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,291
Supreme General Vahriz
is here, as well.

45
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,333
And consider the
other captains,

46
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:24,208
Shapur, Kubard, Mankchurh,

47
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:29,041
Khayr, Khurp, Khshaeta,

48
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,416
and Daryun.

49
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,583
We eight Marzbs each
command ten thousand horse,

50
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,416
add to that the king's
personal guard,

51
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,291
and our army totals
85 thousand cavalrymen

52
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,958
and 138 thousand infantry.

53
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,875
We also have the
advantage of terrain,

54
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,833
knowing the Fields of
Atropatene as we do.

55
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,916
By day's end, the
Lusitanians will find

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,625
they have marched all this way
only to dig their own graves.

57
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,666
Yes, quite.

58
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,458
But do you not find it strange

59
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,541
that they took Maryam
and so easily

60
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,583
when three years ago
they failed so utterly?

61
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,666
As for that.

62
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,500
[AZRAEL cawing]

63
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,541

Welcome back. Did you
have a good flight?

00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,333
[ARSLAN] Kharlan.
Azrael's feathers are damp.

68
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,208
What did you say?

69
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,333
The skies are
mostly clear ahead.

70
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,958
Does it not seem odd?

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,250
[KHARLAN] Perhaps I should
scout the area once more.

72
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,166
[ARSLAN]
Yes, please do.

73
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,333
Who cares about a little rain?

74
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,833
The Crown Prince sure seems
to worry a lot though.

75
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,458
First battle and all.
Bet he's just nervous.

76
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,666
Too bad he didn't inherit
King Andragoras's courage.

00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,333
Go, Azrael. Back to Kishward
with you. Fly true.

at the Peshawar Citadel!

00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,791
I'll be all right.

[BOY C] It turned out as you
feared it would, Your Highness.

through fog this dense.

[ARSLAN]
Not a thing.

to lay down my life for you.

00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:29,958
As am I, sir.

89
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,333
That makes three of us!

90
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,041
Three years back, you
saved our fool necks.

91
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,625
We've waited to
repay you ever since.

92
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,750
I shall rely on you.

93
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,708
[BOYS]
Always!

94
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,958
Even should it cost our lives!

95
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,166
Please, do not say such things.

96
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,666
Focus on staying alive.

97
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,708
It would sadden me to lose you.
We return to Ecbatana together.

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,708
[BOYS]
Yes, sir!

00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,750
[hooves clattering]

100
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,250
[VAHRIZ]
Your Highness!

101
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,625
You shouldn't stray so far
from the encampment.

102
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,375
[ARSLAN]
Oh, sorry.

103
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,666
[VAHRIZ] It would be most
dire were you to lose sight

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,083
of the road in this fog.

105
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,375
[ARSLAN]
Are you concerned that this fog

106
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,000
will be to our disadvantage?

107
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,500
I am not concerned
in the slightest.

108
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,375
Led by King Andragoras
the Third,

109
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,375
the army of Pars has never
been defeated in the field.

110
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,791
As I'm sure Your
Highness is aware.

111
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,583
Perhaps some physical exertion

112
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,416
will keep your mind off
such unnecessary concerns.

113
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,583
Whaddya say? Care for
a practice bout?

114
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,041
I don't know that
my ego could take it.

115
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:37,041
[MESSENGER]
Lord Er! Please hurry!

116
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,708
You're needed, my lord.

117
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,000
What's the trouble?

118
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,333
Lord Daryun has incurred
His Majesty's wrath.

119
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,291
It's looking bleak.

120
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,958
He what? Oh, foolish nephew.

121
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,458
Such conflict before a battle

122
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,791
will affect the morale
of the entire army.

123
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,875
I'll be right there.

124
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,666
[ARSLAN]
Uh. I will come as well.

125
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,958
[thud]

126
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,083
[ANDRAGORAS] I thought
better of you, Daryun.

127
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,541
When did the ghost of a coward
come to possess your body?

128
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,250
I never thought to hear the word
"retreat" come from your lips.

129
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,458
It makes me sick to my stomach.

130
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,625
[DARYUN]
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,083
I can assure you,

132
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,000
what I have said does not
have its root in cowardice.

133
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,875
[ANDRAGORAS] A warrior
seeking to avoid battle?

134
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,875
If that's not the very
essence of cowardice,

135
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,125
I don't know what is.

136
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,541
[DARYUN] Your Majesty,
please consider this.

137
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:26,291
The Parsian cavalry is known
to be virtually undefeatable.

138
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,541
That reputation has
been justly earned.

139
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,166
So I wonder.

140
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,958
Why would the enemy choose to
await our forces upon a plain?

141
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,166
Such terrain is clearly
to our advantage.

142
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,375
I think it very likely they
have laid a trap for us.

143
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,250
There is also the fog.

144
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,625
We can hardly even see
our own troops' movements.

145
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,625
I believe we should
withdraw for the time being

146
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,750
and reposition our forces
outside the walls of Ecbatana.

147
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,916
[ANDRAGORAS]
I wonder when it was

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,916
that you became more
skilled with words

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,875
than with the bow or the sword.

150
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,750
The terrain here is unfamiliar
to those filthy savages.

151
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,166
How could they surprise
us on our own soil?

152
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,083
That, I do not yet know.

153
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,583
However,

154
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,541
there is always the chance
they have the help of a guide.

155
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,208
Then the terrain would
not be so unfamiliar.

156
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,791
You suggest one of my
subjects has turned traitor

157
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,708
and is aiding the enemy?

158
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,958
Impossible!

159
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,833
All due respect, sire,
it is possible!

160
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,166
The desire for revenge

161
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,125
could motivate an escaped
slave to aid Lusitania.

162
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,208
[gasps]

163
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,708
You would speak
to me of slavery?

164
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,750
I see now the words spilling
from your lips are not yours,

165
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,375
but those of an exile.

166
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,458
What ideas has that
worthless Narsus

167
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,041
filled your fool head with?

168
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,541
[DARYUN] While I do not deny
that Narsus is my friend,

169
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,166
I have not seen him once
these last few years.

170
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,333
[ANDRAGORAS]
You claim him as your friend?

171
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,375
Fine words, coward!

172
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,291
I hereby dismiss you
from your post as Marzb.

173
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,958
Consider it a mercy I do not
strip you of your Mard

174
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,375
and Shirghir titles, as well.

175
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,875
Remove yourself!

176
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,083
You are no longer welcome
in the royal presence!

177
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,291
Huh?

178
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,500
Lord Father, I--

179
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,000
[ANDRAGORAS]
I did not summon you, Arslan.

180
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,000
What're you doing here?

181
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,458
Your sole focus right now

182
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,083
should be distinguishing
yourself in battle!

183
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,250
Hm?

184
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,458
Lord Unc-- Uh!

00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,500
[gasps]

186
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,541
You are an insolent child!

187
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,500
You would speak thus
to His Majesty?

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,750
You know what we owe him!

189
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,000
Please, Lord Uncle.

[DARYUN]
I forgot my place, Majesty.

193
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,375
I spoke out of turn. Forgive me.

194
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,708
[VAHRIZ]
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,666
I know that my nephew
has behaved inexcusably.

196
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,041
I hope you can pardon an
old man his sentimentality.

197
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,708
But I beg mercy of you.

198
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,666
Forgive Daryun his most
egregious transgressions.

199
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,333
All right, Vahriz.
That's enough.

200
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,833
Daryun, I grant you a
chance to redeem yourself.

201
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,625
You will take part in
this battle as a knight

202
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,583
assigned to
the main army.

203
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,375
Distinguish yourself and I will
consider reinstating you.

204
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,625
[DARYUN] I have no words
to express my thanks

205
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,083
for your kindness.

206
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,833
Arslan! Why're you still here?

207
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,250
I shall withdraw immediately.

208
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,708
My apologies.

209
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,250
[DARYUN] I am sorry for
having inconvenienced you,

210
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,666
Your Highness.

211
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,291
Think nothing of it.

212
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,583
You spoke the truth as
you saw it, did you not?

213
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:32,916
Yes, I did.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,666
Lord Kharlan is of the
same mind as I am on this.

215
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,208
[ARSLAN]
Uh.

216
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,458
He supported my plan to bring
our concerns to His Majesty.

217
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,916
That's good to hear.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,041
He must've taken my
worries earlier seriously.

219
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,375
[BOY A]
Your Highness!

220
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,458
[ARSLAN] I'm sorry.
I should return to the ranks.

221
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,291
You know, Daryun,
when this battle is over,

222
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,083
you and I should
have a long talk.

223
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,041
Yes. I would like that.

224
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
[DARYUN] I would think
His Majesty might show

225
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,625
a bit more consideration
for the Crown Prince.

226
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,458
Or fatherly concern.

227
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,333
He treats Prince
Arslan like dirt.

228
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,791
Enough now, nephew.

229
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,583
Or do you want your head
separated from your shoulders?

230
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,041
Honestly, boy.

231
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,416
When something gets
under your skin,

232
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,791
there's just
no stopping you.

233
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,916
You lose all sense of caution.

234
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,125
[VAHRIZ]
By the by.

235
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:29,041
How would you describe Prince
Arslan's physical appearance?

236
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,125
Sir? That seems an odd question.

237
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,750
Looking at the king
and the queen,

238
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,041
who do you suppose
the prince more favors?

239
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,083
[DARYUN]
Uh.

240
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,125
If I had to say, then,

241
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,625
it would be Her
Majesty, I suppose.

242
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,458
[VAHRIZ]
Mmm.

243
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,125
My thoughts, too.

244
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:49,125
Interesting that he does
not resemble the king.

245
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,416
[VAHRIZ]
Daryun.

246
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
[DARYUN]
Sir.

247
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,791
[VAHRIZ]
Here and now,

248
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,625
will you swear your
loyalty to Prince Arslan?

249
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,583
Is that necessary?

250
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,083
You know I remain ever
steadfast in my devotion

251
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,125
to the Royal House of Pars.

252
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,708
I mean to His Highness
personally, Daryun.

253
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,458
[DARYUN]
Uh.

254
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:17,708
I understand. If that's your
wish, I'll be honored to.

255
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,541
[VAHRIZ]
Do you swear it upon your sword?

256
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,375
Yes, sir. On my sword, I swear.

257
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,166
If you'd like, I can present
you a written oath, as well.

258
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,666
[VAHRIZ]
No, nephew.

259
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,291
You have given your word.
That is more than enough for me.

260
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,916
If he can count on no one else,

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,125
I wish for His Highness
to have an ally in you.

262
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,791
Only a handful are granted
the title of Mard fu Mard.

263
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,333
You are truly a warrior
among warriors, nephew.

264
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,041
My thanks, Uncle.

Hm?

00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,416
That's the signal to march!

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,125
We fight to avenge Maryam!

269
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,708
And to teach these
savages about justice!

[KUBARD] We may not have seen
battle in quite some time, boys,

271
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,208
but that is no excuse
for laggin' behind!

272
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,916
Well. I guess it's time, huh?

273
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,041
If I do well today,

274
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,625
will I finally be accepted
as Crown Prince?

275
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,833
Sir?

276
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,875
[ARSLAN]
Nothing.

277
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,916
[ANDRAGORAS] Kharlan,
how many do the enemy number?

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,583
An estimated 25 to 30
thousand cavalry, sir,

279
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,291
and roughly 80 to 90
thousand infantry, as well.

280
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,083
They've been campaigning
for some time.

281
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,875
Their numbers
must've diminished.

282
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,958
It's possible that
reinforcements from home

283
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,875
have swelled their
numbers instead.

284
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,916
[ANDRAGORAS]
Hm.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,166
[ANDRAGORAS]
With this fog,

286
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,208
we cannot hope to see
the enemy's position.

287
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,458
[KHARLAN] That sword cuts
both ways, Your Majesty.

288
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,583
It's true that we cannot
see the Lusitanians,

289
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,375
but nor can they see us.

290
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,375
Provided we begin the
fight on equal footing,

291
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,625
I believe our victory to
be a foregone conclusion.

292
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,125
[MESSENGER]
Enemy ahead!

293
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,833
The enemy vanguard has
been spotted, Your Majesty!

294
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,750
They're about eight amaj away!

295
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,208
It's time to act.

296
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,250
I trust that our people
have conducted a survey

297
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,250
of the land ahead of us?

298
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,458
A thorough one, sir.

299
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,583
Before us lies
a vast, flat plain.

300
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,041
There are no dips
or rises to speak of.

301
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,875
Despite the
thickness of the fog,

302
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,958
we can trust the horses
to carry us straight forward.

Army is charging.

Halt the charge!

Hey! Watch it!

Trophy? You just found it.

And besides, I think it
looks much better on me.

See, that's where you're wrong.

Pretty sure that big,
bald head of yours

is round and shiny enough

I'll ask only once.

Where'd you find the helmet?

Sir!

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,458
Lord Kharlan disappeared
some time ago!

You men go as well.

again until you've found him!

[ARSLAN]
Why, Kharlan? Please tell me!

398
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,041
There were
circumstances, Highness.

399
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,083
Poor, pitiable prince.

400
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,458
Truth of it is, you've
done nothing wrong.

401
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,416
No, you've done nothing wrong,

402
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,458
and yet, you must
die here today.

403
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,375
[ARSLAN]
Why?

404
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,083
Why have you betrayed us?

Attack!

What's their number?

Always.

[NARRATOR] Before his cries
ceased to echo through the air.

417
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,416
Daryun's black armor
was mottled red

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,125
with the blood of
Lusitanian soldiers.

419
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,000
Next time:
"The Knight in Black."

420
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,041
And thus would the
boy become a king.
