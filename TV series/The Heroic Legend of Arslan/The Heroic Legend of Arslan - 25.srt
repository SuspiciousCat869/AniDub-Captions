1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,791
It's you.

2
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,500
No, it... it can't be.

3
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,458
Count Barcacion is dead,
and you killed him!

4
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,875
I know how it appeared, but
the count took his own life.

5
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:53,875
You lie!

6
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,375
[ÉTOILE yelling]

7
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:59,750
[ÉTOILE]
First, you duped me.

8
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,791
Then, as if that wasn't enough,

9
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,500
you killed somebody
precious to me!

10
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:09,416
And for doing that...
I'll kill you!

11
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,000
[yelling]

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,333
Your Highness!

13
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,375
I didn't know
their women fought.

14
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,958
Capture. Don't kill.

15
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,083
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

16
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,291
[ÉTOILE]
Let me go! Get off of me!

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,791
Filthy heathens!

18
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,333
[NARRATOR] The battle for
the Keep of Saint Emmanuel

19
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,666
came to an end.

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,250
Its lord, Count Barcacion,
took his own life.

21
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,416
As did many of
the devout followers

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,458
of the God of Yaldabaoth.

23
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,166
The few remaining sick and
wounded were not slain,

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,291
but cared for by the Parsians.

25
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,125
By order of Crown Prince Arslan,

26
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,083
do not kill any unarmed person.
Spare all who surrender.

27
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,416
Daryun!

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,375
[ARSLAN]
Daryun!

29
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,416
I am here.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,791
[ARSLAN]
Thank the gods!

31
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,083
Are you hurt?

32
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,416
Your Highness.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It shames me to report...
Hilmes yet lives.

34
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,041
I was unable to finish him.

35
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,416
I don't care.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,875
You're alive.
That's what matters.

37
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,958
And you're unharmed?

38
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,583
Yes.

39
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,250
It's over.

40
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,708
We have taken Saint Emmanuel.

41
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,708
[DARYUN] You led us
to victory, Your Highness.

42
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,791
That must be gratifying.

43
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,916
[ARSLAN]
It is. Thank you, Daryun.

44
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,458
[PARSIAN SOLDIER C]
Stay vigilant!

45
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,458
We'll need to search
every last room.

46
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,000
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

47
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,208
Victory is ours, at
least for the moment.

48
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,833
[PARSIAN MESSENGER A]
There are enemy survivors.

49
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,875
Not many, but we
have taken some.

50
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,708
See that cots are
set up in the prison.

51
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,583
We can tend to
their wounded there.

52
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,916
[PARSIAN MESSENGER A]
Yes, sir.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,791
Wait.

54
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,208
[PARSIAN MESSENGER A]
Sir?

55
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,583
What of the company
that stormed the gate?

56
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,708
I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,958
None have been found.

58
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,833
[NARSUS]
I see. Thank you.

59
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,125
[ALFARID screaming]

60
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,583
Alfarid!

61
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,500
Narsus? What are you doing here?

62
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,875
Where are we? This is
an odd afterlife.

63
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,791
Wait, hold on! Am I still alive?

64
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:54,875
[NARSUS chuckling]

65
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,625
What's so funny?

66
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,875
Nothing. I'm just relieved.

67
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,416
[ALFARID] So, you were
a little worried about me.

68
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,875
Nonsense!

69
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,208
What woman of the Zot Clan

70
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,750
would ever allow herself
to be killed so easily?

71
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,000
[ALFARID]
True.

72
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,291
Especially when she has
a husband to look after.

73
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,666
I feel like I would remember
acknowledging that union.

74
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,416
[ALFARID]
What is this place?

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,791
[NARSUS]
A food storage room.

76
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,250
You must've lost consciousness

77
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,458
and fallen into the chute
they use to send food down.

78
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,875
That makes sense.

79
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,333
Doesn't explain what
you're doin' here though.

80
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,208
My first concern
after a victory

81
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,708
is always the seizure
of enemy provisions.

82
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,333
Why're you so
worried about food?

83
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,416
You've never gone
hungry, have you?

84
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,708
Without weapons,

85
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,250
a soldier can still fight
with an empty hand.

86
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,708
But left with an empty
stomach, all could be lost.

87
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,250
[ALFARID]
Hmm.

88
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,250
And I thought a strategist's
only duty was to plan battles.

89
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,166
[DARYUN]
I'm grateful for the assistance.

90
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,958
[JASWANT]
It is no trouble.

91
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,125
It was quite a battle.

92
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,625
I'm relieved that
you are all right.

93
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,541
I'm sure His Highness
must be, as well.

94
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,875
His Highness does not rely
upon me as he once did.

95
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,458
He has grown into
a strong commander.

96
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,916
I don't dispute that,

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,625
but to have injured a fighter
like yourself so gravely.

98
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,500
He must be formidable indeed.

99
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,208
This Lord Silver Mask.

100
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,791
He is a strange
and terrifying man.

101
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,375
His is a dark soul.

102
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,208
[KISHWARD] He must be
frightening indeed

103
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,291
to make the Knight
in Black speak so.

104
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,541
He most certainly sounds it.

105
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,083
[DARYUN]
Were it not for his caprice,

106
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,958
I would already be dead.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
He had that chance?

108
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,750
Then why did he not act upon it?

109
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,791
From what he said, he thinks
he's toying with us.

110
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:49,000
If he defeats us, he wants
his victory to be absolute.

111
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,208
Insolent bastard.

112
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,416
Be careful!

113
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,958
The wound is bound.
I will be fine.

114
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,833
My place is at His
Highness' side right now.

115
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,250
Ah!

116
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,083
There's nothing
like a jug of khukar

117
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,208
after a hard day of killing.

118
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,625
Is it true? That you
were one of the Marzban?

119
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,250
That's what they called me.

120
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,708
Most interesting.

121
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,791
To be honest, I cannot
say I would've guessed it

122
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,250
from looking at you.

123
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,583
[KUBARD chuckles]

124
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,708
[KUBARD]
Well? Another?

125
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,208
[FARANGIS]
Yes, thank you.

126
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,208
[ARSLAN]
I will be fine.

127
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,250
[PARSIAN GUARD A]
Yessir.

128
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,875
You again!

129
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,000
My apologies for
isolating you like this.

130
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,375
Your behavior made it necessary.

131
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,208
It was true about
the count, then.

132
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,041
He took his own life.

133
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,416
Just as his attendants told you.

134
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,583
He was a fine man, you
know. True and faithful.

135
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,791
Yes.

136
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,250
Even in a short time,
I could see that.

137
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,250
In truth, he was
too kindhearted.

138
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,541
Not a man meant for fighting.

139
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,416
So, when we met in Peshawar,
that was you as you truly are.

140
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,625
It was not!

141
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,166
I am a knight in Count
Barcacion's service!

142
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,000
I am Étoile!

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,875
You must be quite hungry.

144
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,000
I brought you some stew.

145
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,333
No!

146
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,541
I will not accept charity
from a heathen prince!

147
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,708
This food was already here.
It belonged to your army.

148
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,958
I'm not hungry!

149
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,625
[stomach growling]

150
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,000
Think of it another way, then.

151
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,583
You believe that this food
belongs to your enemy.

152
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,958
So, if you eat it, you will
reduce your enemy's provisions.

153
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,708
And doing that can
only weaken him.

154
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,583
Isn't that the entire
goal of battle?

155
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,958
You're manipulating me.
Telling me what I wish to hear.

156
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,916
Yes, but just because it
is what you wish to hear

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
does not mean
that it isn't true.

158
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,208
At the very least, it's not
as if this will help you.

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Care for some bread?

160
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,250
I'd like to know more about you.

161
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,083
What's your real name? Why
did you wish to be a knight?

162
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,583
[ÉTOILE] If you must know,
my real name is Estelle,

163
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,916
but I've abandoned it.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,916
[ARSLAN]
Why?

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,458
It's a girl's name, obviously!

166
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,166
Anyhow, I was adopted
into a knight's household,

167
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,208
and that particular
house had no male heir.

168
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,583
That's it. That's why I
decided to become a knight.

169
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,375
But first, you
needed to be a man.

170
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,625
[ÉTOILE]
Exactly!

171
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,125
How many female knights
have you met recently?

172
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,458
I know what you're thinking!

173
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,625
Pretend that night never
happened! Forget it!

174
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,125
[ARSLAN]
Uh. Must I? That's a shame.

175
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,333
What did you say?

176
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,875
Oh, nothing.

177
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,208
I believe I would like to reduce
your provisions some more.

178
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,583
Ah, that can be arranged.

179
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,208
I have plenty here.

180
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,708
You're not how I heard
Prince Arslan described.

181
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,416
They said you had two twisted
horns and a long, black tail.

182
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,625
No one said anything about
a scrawny, pampered boy.

183
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,916
I'm only 14. Maybe
the horns will grow in.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,166
[BOTH chuckle]

185
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,958
You are an odd one, aren't you?

186
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,166
I have been told that before.

187
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,583
I don't really see
it myself, though.

188
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,458
You don't act
like a king at all.

189
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,875
Maybe that's why
Pars lost her capital.

190
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,166
Like a king.

191
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,708
Say,

192
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,833
do you think war between our
countries could be avoidable?

193
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,000
What?

194
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,958
No. Absolutely not.

195
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,916
As long as you continue to
revere idols and false gods

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,083
and refuse to follow
the true faith,

197
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,500
we will continue to fight you.

198
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,083
"True faith"?

199
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,625
One that calls for the massacre
of heathens, correct?

200
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,041
Of course.

201
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,958
[ARSLAN] That is what
I cannot understand.

202
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,083
It's simple!

203
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,875
We worship different gods,

204
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,375
but that shouldn't mean we have
to keep on killing one another.

205
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,791
It means we have to kill you!

206
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,750
Is that?

207
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,666
Yes, it's the book you gave me.

208
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,416
I have read it many times.

209
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,333
I think it is full of fine
teachings and moral messages,

210
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:44,208
however, such teachings
are easily manipulated.

211
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,833
And I wonder if that's just
what your leaders are doing.

212
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,708
[ÉTOILE]
Uh.

213
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,250
What are you--?

214
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,500
To satisfy their own greed,
they invoke the name of your god

215
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,500
and induce your people
to slaughter others.

216
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,500
Does it truly seem right?
Such mindless killing?

217
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,125
[ÉTOILE]
Be quiet!

218
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,666
How could you say that?

219
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,166
You don't understand anything.
Just leave me alone.

220
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,458
I'm finished talking to you.

221
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,500
[ARSLAN] I am sorry.
I got carried away.

222
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,833
I did not mean to upset you.

223
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,958
[ARSLAN]
Étoile,

224
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,666
I assume you are familiar enough
with the prayers of your faith

225
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,958
to recite them.

226
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,541
[ÉTOILE]
Of course I can.

227
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,083
Well then, tomorrow,

228
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,416
perhaps you'd offer
a prayer for the dead.

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,125
The Lusitanian dead will
need a Lusitanian prayer.

230
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,541
[ÉTOILE]
Hey! Come back here!

231
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,000
[ÉTOILE]
Was that on purpose?

232
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,750
Stupid heathen.

233
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,958
[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
What?

234
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,000
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E]
Is that a Lusitanian soldier?

235
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,958
So, you didn't die.

236
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,541
O, my brothers in arms.
My fallen comrades.

237
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:06,333
Sacred believers,
followers of the true faith.

238
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:11,416
By god's hand, may you
be blessed and sheltered.

239
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,416
O departed souls,
may you rest in peace.

240
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,916
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A] The Keep
of Saint Emmanuel has fallen.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,250
Count Barcacion and most
of those who served there

242
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,500
fell during the battle.

243
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,208
The Parsian army led by
Arslan is yet at the Keep,

244
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,458
but they will likely leave
for Ecbatana any day now.

245
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,083
How were we so
soundly defeated?

246
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,708
Departed souls, may
you rest in peace.

247
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,375
And what of Lord Silver Mask.

248
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,208
He claimed to have
everything well in hand.

249
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:47,958
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
As to that.

250
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,583
[HILMES]
I am here!

251
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,166
How bold of you to return here
after suffering such a defeat.

252
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,583
Sadly,

253
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,625
the Keep of Saint Emmanuel
must not have been blessed

254
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,583
with the divine protection of
the God of Yaldabaoth.

255
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,500
Do not dare speak of god
in such an offhand manner!

256
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:11,500
This is a disaster! How will
you pay for your failure?

257
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,500
My failure?

258
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,125
[chuckling]

259
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,166
What do you find so amusing?

260
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,333
[laughing]

261
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,458
Men, seize this lunatic!

262
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Have you lost your mind?

263
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,083
[HILMES] I wished to speak
with you more privately.

264
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,458
My real name is Hilmes.

265
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,125
And my father was called Osroes.

266
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,333
As was the former
King of Pars. Can it be?

267
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:51,000
Andragoras, the bloody-handed
usurper, killed my father.

268
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,541
He and his pathetic son,
Arslan, must be made to pay.

269
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,750
I will see to it
that they suffer.

270
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:02,166
And, that they know the throne
is lost to them forever.

271
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,166
[GUISCARD]
So that's it.

272
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,500
From the beginning, your
intention was to use my country.

273
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:11,041
Why have you decided to
reveal your identity now?

274
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,583
[HILMES] Tell me, what is
it you are truly after?

275
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,083
It isn't the throne of Pars.

276
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,291
I suspect our interests may
still be closely aligned.

277
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,208
I understand, and I
believe you are correct.

278
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,875
You can have it, then.

279
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,958
I shall relinquish the
throne of Pars to you.

280
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:39,375
In exchange, will you see that
I become king of Lusitania?

281
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,250
As you ask, so shall
it be, Your Majesty.

282
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,166
[PARSIAN SOLDIER F]
We've finished with this load.

283
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,875
Must we do this?
It seems such a waste.

284
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,250
Unfortunately,

285
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,833
we do not have the troop
strength to leave men here.

286
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,333
An empty castle makes a good den

287
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,708
for bandits we'd only
have to root out later.

288
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,958
Right.

289
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,916
[ALFARID] So, what's gonna
happen to the Lusitanians?

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,791
Surely we won't
simply abandon them.

291
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,083
[NARSUS] Mmm. You've hit upon
a troublesome situation.

292
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:20,125
While I hate to further
stretch our provisions...

293
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,541
It seems His Highness has
already made up his mind.

294
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,000
[ÉTOILE]
Are you all right?

295
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,625
I'm fine. Thank you.

296
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,666
[ÉTOILE] No thanks needed.
Rest if you can.

297
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,083
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
That hurts!

298
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,708
[ÉTOILE] Sorry! Try to
stay still. I'll be gentler.

299
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,125
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D groaning]

300
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,833
[ÉTOILE] I said stay still!
Your wound will re-open!

301
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,750
I'll try to be quick.

302
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,750
See, that's not so bad, eh?

303
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,583
It will be all right.
I will get us all home.

304
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,791
We'll see Lusitania
again too before long.

305
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,000
There!

306
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,125
[ELAM]
You're not much of a nursemaid.

307
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,875
Don't you have any
experience with first aid?

308
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,083
I have plenty!

309
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,833
[ELAM] Here, give it
to me. I'll teach you.

310
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,041
You asked His Highness that
you be allowed to come along

311
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,416
and tend to the wounded.

312
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,166
If that's what you wish
to do, fine, but do it well.

313
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,583
And don't let pride
get in the way.

314
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,208
There you are.

315
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,583
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
Ahh.

316
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,041
[ÉTOILE] Are you all right?
You must be weary.

317
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,708
It is nice to lay
back for a bit.

318

[ÉTOILE]
I'll go fetch some water.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,208
A kind enough girl.
For a Lusitanian, anyway.

320
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,958
You're sure she's a girl?

321
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,750
She has the gallantry
of a knight.

322
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,333
That she does.

323
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,125
[FARANGIS]
You, Lusitanian girl.

324
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,458
Are you keeping
yourself occupied?

325
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,000
[ÉTOILE]
Stop referring to me as a girl.

326
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,625
It feels strange.

327
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,750
You serve him because you
want to? Of your own free will?

328
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,958
Yes.

329
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,375
I don't understand.
He's young and inept.

330
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,791
Why do you all follow
him so loyally?

331
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,750
The throne is only as good or as
bad as the one who sits on it.

332
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,208
If it helps, this is
how I think of it.

333
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,416
Depending upon who
occupies the throne,

334
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,833
it can be a seat of fairness
and justice or one of cruelty.

335
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,833
As long as it is a man
who governs, and not a god,

336
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,458
he can never do so perfectly.

337
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,375
But if he makes no attempt
to reach for perfection,

338
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,875
he will slide instead
into complacency.

339
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,958
Perhaps even into evil
if left unchecked.

340
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,750
Crown Prince Arslan
is always striving

341
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,958
to become a better ruler.

342
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,458
A better man.

343
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,125
Those of us who serve him
see it in everything he does.

344
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,541
It is what makes him
unique among men,

345
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,916
and the reason we are
happy to serve him.

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,375
And why are you here?

347
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,791
Ha!

348
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,916
I came to keep an eye on enemy
movements, nothing more.

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,208
You just watch yourselves!

350
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,875
[ALFARID]
Ugh, she's horrid!

351
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,916
I mean what was that even about?

352
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,583
She didn't have to come along.

353
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,375
If she hates us so much,
why is she here?

354
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,666
[ÉTOILE]
It'll be ready soon.

355
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:43,916
[ARSLAN]
Uh.

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,708
What is it? Why are you here?

357
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,875
[ARSLAN] I thought I would
return your sacred text to you.

358
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,958
Come here!

359
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,875
You're the Crown Prince.
This is imprudent!

360
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,791
Is it truly? I do this
sort of thing a lot.

361
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,500
What is wrong with this army?

362
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,833
Well, thank you for
lending me your book.

363
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,041
There's no need for
you to return it.

364
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,000
You'll want it when I convert
you to the Faith of Yaldabaoth.

365
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,041
Ha. I don't know
how likely that is.

366
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
Was that all you
came here to do?

367
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,000
Why?

368
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,250
Do you need my help
with something?

369
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,791
You are next in line for
the throne, aren't you?

370
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,916
You should learn to act like it!

371
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,583
[ÉTOILE grunts]

372
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,833
[ARSLAN]
Uh...

373
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:36,708
[BABY crying]

374
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,791
Ah! You have a
healthy little boy.

375
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,791
Lord Étoile, will you?

376
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,666
What is it? What's wrong?
Are you in pain?

377
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,291
Will you hold him for me?

378
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,416
Oh. I suppose so.

379
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,458
[crying]

380
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,208
[ALFARID] Are you trying
to make the poor thing cry?

381
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,041
Here, this is how
you hold a baby.

382
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,208
There, there, little one.
You're all right now.

383
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,708
Oh, I see.

384
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,541
Now you try.

385
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,666
Okay.

386
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,291
[ALFARID]
You're a strong boy.

387
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,958
You'll make a good
little bandit someday.

388
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,125
[ÉTOILE]
Don't say that!

389
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,958
He's to become a
knight of Lusitania!

390
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,375
[FARANGIS] May this child's
path be lit brightly

391
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,750
by the love and
compassion of others,

392
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,750
no matter what gods
they might believe in.

393
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,250
[laughing]

394
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,833
This feels as if it's been
a terribly long journey.

395
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,500
Yes. We started a war
that day, you and I.

396
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,041
Come, Daryun.

397
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,208
It's far too soon to begin
indulging in reminiscence.

398
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,958
You might lower your guard.

399
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,583
That's just ludicrous.

400
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,541
I don't even lower my guard
when I sleep at night.

401
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,791
Truly, Highness.

402
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,000
This knight of yours
can claim no other skill

403
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,541
than wielding a blade.

404
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,166
And what of you?

405
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,958
Besides devising your
"clever military stratagems,"

406
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,958
have you a single
talent to your name?

407
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,083
But of course I do!

408
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,083
Have you forgotten
that I am an artist?

409
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,583
Would that I could forget it!

410
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,250
[laughing]

411
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:41,708
[GIEVE] If ye have ears
to hear, I say, pay heed,

412
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,958
to the tale of the
fair Kingdom of Pars.

413
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,375
[GIEVE]
Ye of good conscience,

414
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,750
recall the reign of
the king known to history

415
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,083
as Arslan the Liberator.

416
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:01,750
For His Highness, I shall
find it. If it can be found.

417
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,291
The supposed proof of
his right to the throne.

418
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,583
Onward! To Ecbatana!

419
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:17,291
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321. May.

420
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,666
Crown Prince Arslan, age 15.

421
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,916
And thus would the
boy become king.
