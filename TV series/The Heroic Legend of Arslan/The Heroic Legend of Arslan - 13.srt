1
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,958
Have we come so near
only to fall now?

2
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,000
[GIEVE] The closer we
are to our destination,

3
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,833
the easier it is for
them to lay in wait.

4
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,833
We just have to keep fighting
them off a while longer.

5
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,583
[LUSITANIAN CAVALRY A screams]

6
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,666
[FARANGIS gasps]
It's an ambush.

7
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,958
They're ours now! We'll
be well rewarded for this!

8
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,000
[LUSITANIAN CAVALRY yell]

9
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,833
Azrael!

10
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,666
See your prince, men?
We ride for him!

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,375
Yashasuiin!

00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,041
PARSIAN SOLDIERS yell]

13
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,083
[LUSITANIAN CAVALRY gasp]

14
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,166
Kishward's here!

15
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,625
[KISHWARD]
Welcome, Prince!

16
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,541
Greetings from Peshawar!

17
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,666
[gasps, screams]

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,166
[KISHWARD] It was foolish
of you to enter my domain.

19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,916
Even more so to
threaten my prince!

20
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:40,000
Go! Retreat!

21
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,458
[NARSUS]
No need to chase them.

22
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,041
Letting them go will only
enhance your reputation.

23
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:51,375
They are sure to spread tales
of your daring and bravado.

24
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:55,166
[KISHWARD] Mm. Those are
tales I'd like to hear.

25
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,708
[ARSLAN]
Narsus!

26
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,833
[DARYUN] I'm glad to find you
ahead of us and not behind.

27
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,000
Your arrival was most
timely, Kishward.

28
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,541
[KISHWARD]
Sir.

29
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:07,166
I am happy to see you in my
far-away corner of the world.

30
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,541
Your Highness, welcome
to Peshawar Citadel.

31
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:11,958
Stronghold of the East.

32
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,458
Thank you. Uh...

33
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,166
You're not alone.
Who rides with you?

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,291
Ah, about that...

35
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,125
Hi, my name is Alfarid...

36
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,875
And I'm Narsus's wife.

37
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,875
[ARSLAN, DARYUN]
Wha..?

38
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,083
[ELAM]
Huh?!

39
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,041
[NARRATOR]
Peshawar Citadel.

40
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,166
The stalwart fortress that
guards Pars's eastern border.

41
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,375
The citadel sent no troops
to the battle at Atropatini,

42
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,916
as its forces were needed
to defend the border.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,833
A decision that proved
most fortunate.

44
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,583
Peshawar is now Pars's
last stronghold

45
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,958
and houses the kingdom's
greatest fighting force.

46
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,250
Look! They've returned
with the prince.

47
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,416
Long live Prince Arslan!

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,250
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS cheer]

49
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,250
Might you allow me
room to breathe?

50
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,500
You've been busy.

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,541
You always seem to get
yourself into trouble

52
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,333
when I'm not around.
Exiled, married.

53
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,583
I...

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,375
Oh, Lord Narsus.

55
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,000
Life on the road is lonely.

56
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,458
Even a superb strategist may
fall victim to temptation.

57
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,708
This girl may be
somewhat rustic,

58
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,541
but any flower is lovely when
encountered in parched land.

59
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,416
Your wife?

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,625
[NARSUS sighs]
No.

61
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,541
Will you please tell
them the truth of it?

62
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,666
Actually, we're not
officially married.

63
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,833
For now, I'm merely his lover.

64
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,541
She's your lover?!

65
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,041
Oh, Lord Narsus!

66
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,750
[NARSUS]
No! That is absolutely untrue!

67
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:24,041
I saved her from an attack,
and that's the whole story!

68
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,708
Now, if we can
move past this...

69
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,625
What sort of an attack?

70
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,750
It was the Man in the
Silver Mask again.

71
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,125
He was the one ensuring
that our journey here

72
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,791
was a difficult one.

73
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,416
[DARYUN exhales]

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,541
[BAHMAN]
Welcome, Your Highness!

75
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,000
Bahman!

76
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,791
It is good to see
you safe and well.

77
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,041
[ARSLAN]
And you.

78
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,208
I hope you and your men
are prepared for battle.

79
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,250
Pars will be launching
her counterattack

80
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,750
from here at Peshawar. I shall
depend on your counsel.

81
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,875
Quite. And if you will
excuse my saying so Highness,

82
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,250
you have grown considerably

83
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:02,083
in the short time
since I saw you last.

84
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:06,541
Now, sir! We have 20
thousand cavalrymen here,

85
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,166
and 60 thousand foot.

86
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,041
All will be honored to
swear you their loyalty.

87
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,833
[SORCERER A] The traps we
set were carefully laid out.

88
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,291
Yet all of them were able
to slip through our fingers.

89
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,333
[HILMES] That simply means
we must keep trying.

90
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,750
[sighs] Well, that's
a few weeks wasted.

91
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,541
All that trouble, and
nothing to show for it.

92
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,083
No, I got to fret over a
child like some nursemaid.

93
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,583
Narsus, on the other hand,

94
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,500
managed to snare himself a
charming, if rustic, beauty...

95
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,916
I don't begrudge him.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,375
What does sit ill
with me, though,

97
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,416
is that since our company split,

98
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,166
it was not I who traveled
with Mistress Farangis.

99
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,208
But the glory-drenched Daryun!

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,041
It seems I owe you
an apology, Gieve.

101
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,666
Highness!

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,083
[ARSLAN]
I asked too much.

103
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,083
I should've been more
sympathetic to your feelings.

104
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,541
Oh, not at all.

105
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,291
May I ask what's kept
you awake so late?

106
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,916
I've been looking for you.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,583
To thank you
for all you've done.

108
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,291
[GIEVE]
Uh.

109
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,500
Truly. I am in your debt.

110
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,916
It's nothing. Please.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,333
I don't care for the Lusitanians
and their brutal cult, either.

112
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,083
If there's something I can
do to frustrate their plans.

113
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,250
Well, that's so much
the better, I say.

114
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,125
You're quite an
interesting man.

115
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,500
Well, thank you. I think.

116
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,291
And, as for what I said earlier.

117
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,458
I hope you won't think
me faint-hearted.

118
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,916
Huh?

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,541
In the pursuit of beauty,
obstacles must be overcome.

120
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,583
Yes, it is ever thus!
I know that much.

121
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,166
I'm not a stranger to
hardship, Your Highness.

122
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,916
I'm no soft, pampered
court minstrel.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,791
[ARSLAN]
All right...

124
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,041
[ALFARID]
Narsus!

125
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,291
[ELAM]
Mm?!

126
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,416
What do you want?

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,125
Narsus. Have you seen him?

128
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,375
Sorry, Lord Narsus
is in a war council

129
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,916
with the citadel's generals.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,625
Oh. Important men
are busy, I s'pose.

131
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, that's all right.
I'll talk to you.

132
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,833
Tell me about Narsus.

133
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,166
Lord Narsus.

134
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,666
[ALFARID]
Hm?

135
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,666
It's unseemly how familiar you
are when you speak of him.

136
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,666
How long since you two met?
You don't even know him.

137
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,791
The length of a relationship
has no bearing on its depth.

138
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,916
I do know that much.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,875
[ELAM grunts]
Do you know his favorite foods

140
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,208
or how he likes them cooked?

141
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,250
He ate all my meals
without complaint

142
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,416
while we were travelling.

143
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,875
That is probably because
he is a kind man.

144
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,750
Food cooked by someone like
you wouldn't be to his taste.

145
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,291
Someone like me, is it?!

146
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,958
You should show me more respect.

147
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,791
I'll have you know,
I'm older than you!

148
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
[ELAM]
What do I care about that?

149
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,791
I'll have you know,

150
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,833
if you get in my lord's way,
you'll answer to me!

151
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,708
Is that so?

152
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,166
[BOTH growling]

153
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,916
[growls] Please!

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,291
What gives him the
right to scold me?!

155
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:32,500
Who is he to Narsus,
anyhow? Ug!

156
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,375
[FARANGIS] Who do you wish
to be to Lord Narsus?

157
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,791
Do you have feelings for him?

158
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,875
Uh!

159
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,750
Is there something
wrong with that?

160
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,875
As I see it, if you
care for a person,

161
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,375
you should share his goals,

162
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,541
and do nothing that will hinder
his achievement of them.

163
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,250
At present, Lord Narsus

164
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,291
is far more concerned
with building a kingdom

165
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,666
than with the joys
of love and romance.

166
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,958
Support him in that now, and
he may thank you for it later.

167
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,708
Why bother building
a new kingdom?

168
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,208
Things won't change.

169
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,083
There will only be new
nobles and new slaves.

170
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,375
Surely anyone who is as good
of a strategist as Narsus

171
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,000
must realize that.

172
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,875
The road is rough.

173
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,000
However, if you know
Lord Narsus at all,

174
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,333
then you know his ability
to overcome obstacles

175
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,166
that may be in his path.

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,958
Resourcefulness, fairness.

177
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,125
Are these not the qualities
that led you to care for him?

178
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,791
Oh, very well!

179
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,291
[laughs]

180
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,000
Glad you like it.
It's the least I can do

181
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,916
after your help
today. Thank you.

182
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,166
Ah! To be fed by the
Crown Prince Arslan himself.

183
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,125
What more could a bird ask?

184
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,166
I've been wondering
since we arrived.

185
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,916
What has become of Soroush?

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500
He and Azrael would
always travel together.

187
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,500
I wish I had an answer for you.

188
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,625
I sent him with one
of my most trusted men

189
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,208
to infiltrate Ecbatana.

190
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:12,583
However, I have not had word
of them these last few days.

191
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,125
You believe they were killed?

192
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,125
I fear they were.

193
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,583
[ARSLAN]
I see.

194
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,375
I swear to you.

195
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,500
We shall raise an army here in
Peshawar and retake the capital!

196
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:27,916
Yessir.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,833
Furthermore, when we begin
rebuilding our kingdom...

198
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,958
I intend to make changes.

199
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,333
Chief among them is
abolishing slavery.

200
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,958
Huh?!

201
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,541
You're telling me you intend
to free all the slaves?

202
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:55,166
The journey here was long. I've
had time to think it through.

203
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,166
It cannot be done without
a solid plan in place.

204
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,416
I am aware of that.

205
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,041
Very. We'll need
to take our time.

206
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,833
But if we are prepared
for all the repercussions.

207
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:13,333
If we go forward as a kingdom
united. It may just be possible.

208
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,375
I can see your resolve.
I admire it.

209
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,958
And, personally, I would
have no objections.

210
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,083
But if you take that path,
I fear you'll find it lonely.

211
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,833
Abolishing slavery
simply is not a change

212
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,791
many of your lords
are likely to support.

213
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,833
Yes, I've heard
the same from Narsus.

214
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,791
But Pars needs it. Once we're
rid of the Lusitanians,

215
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,875
we can't return to exactly
what we were. Ever.

216
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,541
If we don't emerge from this
better than we were before,

217
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,750
I see no purpose in fighting.

218
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,083
Of course, I have no idea
what my lord father

219
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,916
will think of all this,
but if I'm able to rescue him,

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,500
perhaps he will hear
what I have to say.

221
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,541
Surely he'll at least be
willing to listen to my ideas.

222
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,916
If we both live through this.

223
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,875
[ARSLAN] Are you saying that
we cannot raise an army?

224
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,125
What is this, Lord Bahman?
Explain yourself!

225
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,416
There is nothing to be
gained by rushing into this.

226
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,791
We do not yet even know what
has become of His Majesty.

227
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,250
We need some more time.

228
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm opposed to sending
troops anywhere

229
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,291
before the year
is out, at least.

230
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,625
How will the kingdom's
lords react to this?

231
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,416
We should wait until
we know that much.

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,791
[DARYUN] We must restore
the sovereignty of Pars.

233
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,166
And to do so, we need an
army led by Prince Arslan.

234
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,416
Will not our actions
determine how the lords react?

235
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,583
They will only
follow if we lead!

236
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,541
Why do you now hesitate
to do so, Lord Bahman?

237
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,666
I would not call this caution.

238
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,916
I can only think you--

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,791
Stop, Daryun. There's
no point in quarrelling.

240
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,791
His mind is made up. We
all know that Lord Bahman

241
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,666
has never once been bested
upon the field of battle,

242
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,666
but old age can be cruel.

243
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,166
Can we blame him for wishing

244
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,583
to spend his remaining
years in comfort?

245
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:10,208
Still your tongue! You know
nothing, you arrogant puppy!

246
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,875
I suggest we cool our heads.
We can speak more later.

247
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Bahman...

248
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,708
All I did was make him angry.

249
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,958
No, he's far more cunning.
You don't give him credit.

250
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,500
He pretended to grow angry
and left the room

251
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,333
in order to avoid
further questions.

252
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,458
[KISHWARD]
A moment, Lord Daryun.

253
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,625
[DARYUN]
Hm?

254
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,708
There is something
that you ought to know.

255
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,250
It happened shortly before
the battle at Atropatene.

256
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,708
A letter was delivered to
Lord Bahman from Lord Vahriz.

257
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,625
What did my uncle write to him?

258
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,000
I know nothing more than
what I have told you.

259
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,500
I cannot guess at the
letter's contents,

260
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,041
but ever since it arrived,

261
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,666
Lord Bahman's been
different, as you saw.

262
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,250
[DARYUN] And it came
just before the battle?

263
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,125
[VAHRIZ]
Daryun.

264
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,416
[DARYUN]
Sir.

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,708
[VAHRIZ]
Here and now,

266
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,000
will you swear your
loyalty to Prince Arslan?

267
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,666
[DARYUN] Uncle, what did
you put in that letter?

268
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,291
Lord Narsus, would you
care to hazard a guess?

269
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,291
[NARSUS] Life would be ever
so much simpler if I could.

270
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,500
Regrettably, I'm
no clairvoyant.

271
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,833
[FARANGIS exhales]

272
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,500
[BAHMAN] I did not ask
for this knowledge.

273
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,458
It was not mine to have.
If only I remained ignorant!

274
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,583
If I did, I could happily
swear myself to this prince,

275
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,125
who promises to become
a wise and fair ruler.

276
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,875
And once you learned,
did nothing change for you?

277
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,333
Vahriz, my friend. How could
you know this terrible truth

278
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:45,333
and do your duty as if
nothing had changed?

279
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,625
[ARSLAN] What a strange life
I have led to wind up here.

280
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,083
When I was a young child.

281
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,666
I did not even know
that I was a prince.

282
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,833
[ARSLAN] Then one day I was
summoned to live at Court,

283
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,291
and my life changed irrevocably.

284
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
[ARSLAN] And now here I am,
only a few years later,

285
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,041
far from Court again and
struggling to raise an army.

286
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,000
Many struggles lie ahead.

287
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,791
If there is a plan that will
help us retake the capital,

288
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,958
I haven't heard it yet.
And what of our neighbors?

289
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:34,000
They must surely hope
to exploit our situation.

290
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,750
I must rescue my parents,

291
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,541
and reestablish peace
and order in the kingdom.

292
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,458
Am I capable of such things?

293
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,416
Who's there? Show yourself!

294
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,416
[HILMES] Coming up here without
guards. How careless of you.

295
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,916
[ARSLAN gasping]

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,291
[HILMES]
I could not have asked

297
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,541
for a more perfect opportunity
if I had planned it.

298
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,041
[ARSLAN] I see you
wear a silver mask.

299
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,916
You're the one in league with
the Lusitanians, aren't you?

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,875
How did you get up here?

301
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,916
[HILMES] I know this fortress
like the back of my hand.

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,666
Gaining access presented
no difficulties.

303
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,291
Leave now, or I'll make you.

304
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,375
[HILMES chuckles]

305
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,916
I am Arslan,
the son of Andragoras,

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,166
and the Crown Prince of Pars!

307
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,041
[HILMES] Hmph. You lay claim to
much that is not yours, Prince.

308
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,166
Despite your lofty title,
you are in truth nothing more

309
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,625
than a miserable pup born
to a wretched usurper.

310
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,416
I... I would know who
you are, as well!

311
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,541
[HILMES laughs]

312
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,291
[ARSLAN]
Why are you laughing?

313
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,416
[HILMES] Because life
is a funny thing.

314
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,166
I've sought you
desperately for weeks,

315
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,208
sent untold numbers
of men to catch you,

316
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,083
and now here you are! All alone.

317
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,791
The rage I feel can no
longer be contained!

318
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,208
[ARSLAN growls]

319
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,875
But I won't kill
you all at once.

320
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,583
That could never satisfy me.

321
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,458
Sixteen years of suffering
merits so much more.

322
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,125
Today I shall content myself

323
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,291
with cutting off
your right hand.

324
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,083
Then, when next we meet,
I shall take the left.

325
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,750
If you still live after that,

326
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,458
I suppose the next logical step

327
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,458
would be to remove
your right foot.

328
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,625
[ARSLAN growls, yells]

329
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,291
[ARSLAN yells]

330
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,625
[HILMES]
Your crime

331
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,208
was being born the son of
that bastard Andragoras.

332
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,666
Blame your sire!

333
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,208
[ARSLAN grunting]

334
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,125
[HILMES] You're making
this almost too easy.

335
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,333
[ARSLAN groaning]

336
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,750
[HILMES] Defeated already?
Then I have a promise to keep.

337
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,333
Say goodbye to your hand!

338
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,875
[ARSLAN gasps]

339
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:45,958
[HILMES whimpers]

340
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,291
Put it down!

341
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,916
I'm warning you...

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,791
The fire. You're scared of fire.

343
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,791
[ARSLAN]
Uh...

344
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,916
[FARANGIS]
Prince Arslan!

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,250
[ARSLAN]
Farangis!

346
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,250
[PARSIAN SOLDIER C]
An intruder!

347
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,291
[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
Who is that man?

348
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,333
[HILMES grunting]

349
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,791
[FARANGIS yelps]

350
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,916
[HILMES]
Damn! You are a nuisance!

351
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,541
As I've said before, I don't
care for you much, either.

352
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,208
[DARYUN] Your Highness,
please step aside!

353
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,791
[KISHWARD]
Halt!

354
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,916
I am Kishward, the Twin-Blade
General. This is my fortress.

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,166
Your life is forfeit. Those who
trespass here die by my hands!

356
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,583
[HILMES]
You bastard!

357
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,333
[KISHWARD roars]

358
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:45,041
[HILMES] You will die!
Traitors, all of you!

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,541
I ask you again! Will you
tell us who you are?

360
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:03,250
Who am I? The son of Osroes,
the previous king.

361
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,625
I am Hilmes!

362
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,500
[ARSLAN gasps]

363
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,875
[DARYUN, NARSUS]
Uh!

364
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,125
Your Highness!

365
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,208
[HILMES]
You would fight

366
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,666
for such a soft,
foolish, pitiful boy?

367
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,875
[BAHMAN groaning]

368
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,916
[HILMES gasps]

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,083
[ARSLAN gasps]

370
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,916
[BAHMAN gasping]

371
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,041
Bahman, what have you done?

372
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:35,083
[coughs] To meet like
this, after so long.

373
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,666
I'm sorry, Prince Hilmes.

374
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:44,041
[HILMES grunting]
Once more!

375
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,416
Why did you get in my way?

376
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,791
[BAHMAN] I did as
my friend asked me.

377
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:57,583
Before his death, he asked
that I protect Prince Arslan.

378
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:04,750
If you would, please
withdraw your sword.

379
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,291
[ARSLAN]
Someone, help!

380
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:13,958
[DARYUN]
Your Highness!

381
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,083
[HILMES gasps]

382
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,583
[DARYUN yells]

383
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,666
[BAHMAN]
You mustn't kill him!

384
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,375
Come back here!

385
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,875
If you kill him, Daryun,

386
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,416
the true bloodline of Pars's
royal family dies, too.

387
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,666
Uh! What was that?

388
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,916
[gasps]

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
[BAHMAN groans]

390
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:46,708
[ARSLAN]
Bahman! Bahman!

391
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,708
Your Highness. I want you
to know how sorry I am.

392
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:06,083
I was afraid. I should have
trusted my friend's decision.

393
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,875
I was a fool not to.

394
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,750
[ARSLAN whimpers]

395
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,416
[BAHMAN]
Prince Arslan, I beg you.

396
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,416
Can you forgive an old fool?

397
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,916
[ARSLAN]
Why? I don't understand!

398
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
What is there to forgive?

399
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:25,916
[BAHMAN pants] I hope that you
will become a fine king someday.

400
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,541
[ARSLAN gasps]

401
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,208
[ARSLAN]
Bahman, stay!

402
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,041
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E]
A report, sir!

403
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,416
[KISHWARD]
Out with it, then.

404
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,250
We've received word
that a Sindhuran force

405
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,541
is breaching the border.
Their numbers are estimated

406
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,875
to be at least
20 or 30 thousand!

407
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,625
That's impossible!

408
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,625
[RAJENDRA] I will not be
outshone by First Prince Gadevi.

409
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,916
His will not be the name
celebrated throughout

410
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,416
all of Sindhura.

411
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,458
[RAJENDRA]
That honor will be mine.

412
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:47,375
[NARRATOR] Sindhura Prince
Rajendra was 24 years old,

413
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,958
exactly 10 years
older than Arslan,

414
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,833
the Crown Prince of Pars.

415
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,333
Next time, "The Foreign Prince"

416
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:57,625
And thus would the
boy become a king.
