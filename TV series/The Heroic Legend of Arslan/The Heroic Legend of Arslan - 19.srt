1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,916
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,041
Arslan made his way
toward Peshawar,

3
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:42,916
the northern fortress that had
become Pars' main stronghold.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,166
Joining him was a new
companion, Jaswant,

5
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,708
a Sindhuran soldier
lately sworn to Arslan.

6
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,166
[HILMES] You are asking me
to take Zabul Fortress?

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,416
[GUISCARD]
Yes.

8
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,166
Our scheme worked well
enough to rid the city

9
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,083
of Bodin and his Temple Knights,

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,625
but now they've taken
refuge at Zabul.

11
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,291
They're using their position
to disrupt communications

12
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,500
with the homeland.

13
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,000
In addition,

14
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:48,458
the damn zealot's begun issuing
rather pointed demands.

15
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,375
What sort of demands?

16
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,916
First, the execution of
Andragoras and Tahamenay.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,583
And then, from my lord brother,

18
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,375
he demands repentance
to god for his infatuation

19
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,083
with a heathen woman
as well as a solemn vow

20
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,500
to never again violate
a religious precept.

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,083
I know what his game is.

22
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,041
He's using the name of god in
an effort to increase the power

23
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,500
of the church.

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,500
He's gathered 30 thousand
fanatics to him.

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,875
Bodin has complete
control of them.

26
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:19,500
If he ordered it, every last one
would walk through fire.

27
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,500
[SAM] You should accept
this mission, Your Highness.

28
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,083
[HILMES]
Why do you say that?

29
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,083
Guiscard's true intentions
are as plain as day.

30
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,375
Pitting me against
Bodin and his knights,

31
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,166
he's hoping we'll
destroy one another.

32
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,375
[SAM]
That may be true,

33
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,458
but in the course of
completing this mission,

34
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:39,500
you will have to raise an army
and outfit and equip them.

35
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,500
And best of all,
you will be able to use

36
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,625
the Lusitanian coffers
in order to do so.

37
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,291
[HILMES] Yes, I see it.
You make a good point.

38
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,458
Furthermore, the men we will be
facing are religious fanatics.

39
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,000
Among the most violent and
detested of the Lusitanians.

40
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,750
The people of Pars would
rejoice to see them brought down

41
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,833
and would be grateful
to whomever accomplished

42
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,083
such a thing.

43
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,083
As the future ruler of Pars,

44
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
it would not hurt if
that person were you.

45
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,708
It's never too soon to win
your subjects' loyalty.

46
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,916
I understand the
arguments you're making.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,708
However, what if
we are defeated?

48
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,875
Due respect, but I'm surprised

49
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,333
to hear a descendant of
the Hero King Kakhusra

50
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,000
speak so easily
of being defeated.

51
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,583
We must rebuild Pars.

52
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,958
To do that we must defeat Bodin.

53
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,125
And this is the perfect
opportunity to do so.

54
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,583
You are correct, of course.

55
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,166
I can see the wisdom
of your counsel.

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,833
You are kind to say so.

57
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,375
[HILMES] This is further proof
I was right to welcome you

58
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,250
into my service.

59
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,791
[GARSHASPH]
We must act.

60
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,541
I still believe we should open
the gates and launch an attack.

61
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,666
What else is our
cavalry good for?

62
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,208
Patience, friend.

63
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,916
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS] Listen
to our words, Parsian slaves!

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,625
Seize your freedom! All men
are equal in god's eyes.

65
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,041
The time has come to rise
up against your masters!

66
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,291
[SAM]
Stop this!

67
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,708
Does killing unarmed
slaves make you proud?

68
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,458
[GARSHASPH] I don't see any
slaves here. I see rebels!

69
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,375
[SAM] Who have nothing
but sticks to fight with?

70
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,958
[GARSHASPH] In their hearts,
they are holding swords.

71
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,375
[PARSIAN SOLDIER G] Where did
these bastards come from?

72
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,125
[SOLDIERS yelling]

73
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,916
Damn!

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,833
They must've come through the
aqueducts! But how did they--?

75
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,875
[gasps]

76
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:36,833
[SAM]
Kharlan!

77
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,000
[SAM]
So, it is true.

78
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,250
You deserted Pars for Lusitania.

79
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,958
Why did you do it?

80
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,875
[KHARLAN] I have good reason!
You wouldn't understand.

81
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,333
[SAM] You're right. I could
never understand betrayal!

82
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,000
[SAM]
Who... are... you?

83
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,875
[SAM] The throne of Pars
should have fallen to you.

84
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,208
[HILMES] It's for you to decide
whether or not to follow me.

85
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,875
But consider this.

86
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,666
I threw my spear that night
intending to kill you.

87
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,166
And yet here you are
now, alive still.

88
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,625
Perhaps fate spared your life

89
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,541
because you were meant
to entrust to me.

90
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,125
I'll leave you to think.

91
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,416
[SAM]
I need proof of my own

92
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,000
before I can decide
what to believe.

93
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,500
No one is allowed to
pass beyond this point!

94
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,416
[ANDRAGORAS]
Is that you, Sam?

95
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,000
Forgive me, Your
Majesty. It is I.

96
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,166
[ANDRAGORAS]
Why have you come here?

97
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,791
[I thought you might help
me confirm the veracity

98
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,166
of a story I was told.

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,250
[ANDRAGORAS]
And what story would be?

100
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,458
It is about the events
of 17 years ago.

101
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,083
Your Majesty, I hate to ask
it, but, if I may be so bold,

102
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,750
were you the person responsible

103
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,291
for the assassination
of King Osroes?

104
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,625
Did you kill your brother

105
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,083
so you could take the
throne for yourself?

106
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,041
And what about
young Prince Hilmes?

107
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,708
Did you attempt to
burn him to death?

108
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,666
[ANDRAGORAS] What's the point
of asking such questions now?

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,375
Beyond my abilities
as a fighter,

110
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,291
I can claim few talents.

111
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,750
However, I was lucky enough to
find favor with the royal family

112
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,625
and was thus granted the
honorable position of Marzban.

113
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,541
I owe much to
the royal family,

114
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,125
and my love for the Kingdom
of Pars is deep and unwavering.

115
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,791
I came here because I had hoped

116
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,625
that you would be able
to deny these accusations,

117
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,291
and wake me from this nightmare.

118
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,875
Hah.

119
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,916
I thought as much.

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,916
You come down here,
claiming to seek the truth,

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,166
but you're not ready to stare
into the abyss of Hell.

122
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,500
Majesty.

123
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,791
I was merely abiding by
what had been prophesied.

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,166
Drenched in blood.
Steeped in a thousand lies.

125
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,500
Such is the history
of Pars's royal family.

126
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,875
[ANDRAGORAS]
What purpose can it serve

127
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,958
for a man such as you
to know the truth?

128
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:52,833
[ANDRAGORAS laughing]

129
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,250
Your time's up.

130
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,916
[GUISCARD] I'm glad you've
agreed to take this on.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,583
[HILMES] Of course,
I will expect weapons

132
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,291
and supplies to be
made readily available.

133
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,958
Additionally, I imagine
you can ill afford

134
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,708
to spare sufficient men from
among your regular troops.

135
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,250
Therefore, I think it best if
I assemble an army of Parsians.

136
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,000
Very well. I shall
leave it to you, then.

137
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,333
Excellent.

138
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,166
Forgive me, Your Highness,

139
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,666
but is it wise to use
the heathens like this?

140
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,416
Won't an army of such
men be just as likely

141
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,541
to turn its spears on us?

142
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,333
Yes, of course. There
is no doubt in my mind

143
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,458
"General Silver Mask"
is plotting something

144
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,166
to undermine us.

145
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,250
For now, at least, his
willingness to fight those fools

146
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,708
at Zabul Fortress
makes him useful.

147
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:52,458
And he's sure to
suffer losses, too.

148
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,125
[SAM] The fortress may
appear to be impregnable,

149
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,958
but in truth, it has
several weaknesses.

150
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,708
I have visited there
several times,

151
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,958
and believe I am fairly
familiar with its interior.

152
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,333
Indeed?

153
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,958
Anyhow, I can see no reason
to overexert ourselves

154
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,875
on the Lusitanians' behalf.

155
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,416
We should take all
the time we need

156
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,041
to make preparations
for our attack.

157
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,250
[HILMES] Yes. I cannot
afford to lose this battle.

158
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,625
It is an important step on my
path to driving the Lusitanians

159
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:23,625
from our kingdom and ascending
the throne as I am destined to.

160
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,750
[SAM]
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,291
And once I am king,

162
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,541
I will kill Andragoras
and his whelp Arslan,

163
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,458
and adorn the city gates
with their heads.

164
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,500
[NARRATOR]
March First.

165
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,291
A force was sent
against Zabul Fortress,

166
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,125
led by Hilmes, and comprised
entirely of Parsians.

167
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,041
[LUSITANIAN OFFICER B]
We didn't expect this.

168
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:58,041
That army must number
more than 30 thousand.

169
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,666
For now, perhaps,

170
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,375
but we'll see how many
return from battle.

171
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,416
So, you have been
having some trouble

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,750
with bandits in the area,

173
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,083
and you believe they are
men who formerly belonged

174
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,708
to the Temple Knights?

175
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,875
[FARMER A]
Yes, sir.

176
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,916
They were wreaking
havoc in these parts.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,458
But this traveler you mentioned,

178
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,250
you say he was able to fight
off the bandits singlehandedly?

179
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,583
Yes.

180
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,541
He was a soldier, I guess,
and to hear him tell it,

181
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,750
he was ranked
awfully highly, too.

182
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Used to lead tens of thousands
of men to battle, he said.

183
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,125
So, in your estimation,
he was a fairly strong man?

184
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,166
[FARMER A] Well, he easily
took down 15 men by himself,

185
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,958
so I would say
he was very strong.

186
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
How would you describe him?

187
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, let me think.

188
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,833
A one-eyed giant who
seems to love his women

189
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,000
as much as he loves his wine?

190
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,458
Many thanks.

191
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,666
You have been most helpful.

192
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
[FARMERS]
Sir.

193
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,458
[SAM]
Your Highness.

194
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,125
I have an idea of who the
man they spoke of may be.

195
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,125
I would like to seek him out
to confirm my suspicions.

196
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,166
If he's indeed the
man I have in mind,

197
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,625
he'll make quite
a formidable ally.

198
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,250
[KUBARD]
I'll be leaving shortly.

199
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,500
There's no need to
thank me any further.

200
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,166
You haven't changed, Kubard.

201
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,291
[KUBARD]
Huh?

202
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,250
Long time, Sam.

203
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,500
[SAM] It's been half a year.
You seem well, though.

204
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,708
Cheers!

205
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,166
You know, it honestly
never occurred to me

206
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,250
you might still live.

207
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,750
Are there any other surviving
commanders in Ecbatana?

208
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,500
It shames me to say so,
but I am the only one.

209
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,500
I suppose you'll just
have to be ashamed enough

210
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,041
for both of us, then.

211
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,500
I don't seem to find this
existence as distasteful

212
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,083
as you do.

213
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,750
As long as I can drink a jug of
wine and bed a beautiful woman,

214
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,875
I'm more than
content with my lot.

215
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,958
And I don't mind the
occasional opportunity

216
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,458
to hack a Lusitanian
savage to pieces, either.

217
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,208
[SAM]
You said you're about to leave?

218
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,416
Hah. Yeah.

219
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
While I enjoyed the
villagers' gratitude,

220
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,625
I draw the line when
womenfolk start arguing

221
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,541
over who will become my bride.

222
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,500
Sounds like a good
problem to have.

223
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,750
Sure, to you.

224
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,750
But I've no desire to be
tied to only one place

225
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,166
or to only one woman,
for that matter.

226
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,833
A fact I took great pains to
make clear from the beginning.

227
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll be brief.

228
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,750
I am going with
the man I now serve

229
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,000
to eliminate the Lusitanian
Temple Knights,

230
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,416
who have established a base for
themselves in Zabul Fortress.

231
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,458
I had hoped you might
consider accompanying us.

232
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,375
We would be lucky to have
a man of your strength.

233
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,166
I'm listening.

234
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,541
Who is this man you now serve?

235
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,833
[NARRATOR]
Zabul Fortress,

236
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,333
where Bodin's Temple
Knights were entrenched,

237
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,833
was perched atop
a craggy mountain.

238
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,083
Its cliffs rose straight from
the plains, offering no cover

239
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,375
and no opportunity
for a surprise attack.

240
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:19,541
However, Hilmes had no intention
of fighting a protracted battle.

241
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,041
Rather, he devised a plan
to lure the enemy

242
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,500
from behind the fortress walls.

243
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,625
Those vile heathens!

244
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,125
They dare to burn the sacred
banner right under my nose?

245
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,625
I want them torn limb from limb!

246
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,291
Give those animals
what they deserve!

247
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,541
Send them to the
fiery pits of Hell!

248
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,791
[TEMPLE KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

249
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,958
[HILMES] Excellent.
Bodin doesn't disappoint.

250
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,541
He's as hot-tempered as ever.

251
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,416
Your Highness predicted
his reaction well.

252
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,666
[SAM]
Kubard.

253
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,125
Well? What're our orders?

254
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,041
My men will attack
from the left flank,

255
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,625
Zandeh will lead our
forces in the center,

256
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,666
and the right flank will be
under His Highness's command.

257
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,750
[KUBARD]
Where do I come in?

258
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,875
If you don't mind,

259
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,708
play spectator for
just awhile longer.

260
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,625
As long as there's khukar
I don't mind at all.

261
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,458
I find I have a mighty
appetite for battle today.

262
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,333
Run down the savages!
Do not falter!

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,958
[TEMPLE KNIGHT H] In the name
of the God of Yaldabaoth!

264
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,416
Attack on our flank!

265
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,083
[TEMPLE KNIGHT N] Your day
of judgment has come, heathen!

266
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,625
In the name of god,
I condemn you!

267
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,458
You think I give a
damn about your god?

268
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,625
[TEMPLE KNIGHT N]
This, too, is His will!

269
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,000
No, fool. You die today
because of my will.

270
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,750
[TEMPLE KNIGHT O]
Evade them!

271
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,000
Now, Kubard!

272
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,000
[TEMPLE KNIGHT Q] Glory to
the Faith of Yaldabaoth!

273
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,791
You're a bunch of savages
in sore need of killin'!

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,875
Your Highness.

275
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,125
Be more careful.

276
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,041
I would have you there
to witness my triumph

277
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:49,250
when I am crowned king and
ascend the throne of Pars.

278
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,666
Till then, you are to
keep yourself alive.

279
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,708
Yes?

280
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,166
Sir!

281
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,875
[NARRATOR]
The Lusitanian force

282
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,208
was bested by Hilmes
and his Parsian troops.

283
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,416
With more than two thousand
Temple Knights dead

284
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,666
on the battlefield,

285
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,500
the remainder took refuge
in Zabul Fortress.

286
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,791
They closed the gates,

287
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,333
believing themselves secure

288
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,416
within their impregnable
mountain stronghold.

289
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,541
My thanks. You did
well for us out there.

290
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,958
[KUBARD] Yes. The fortress
hasn't fallen yet, though.

291
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,125
They're likely hunkering
down for a siege.

292
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,000
Fortunately, we have
a plan to avoid that.

293
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,333
Yo.

294
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,000
Watch your casual tone!

295
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,458
This is Prince Hilmes,
the rightful king of Pars.

296
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,916
Show him the proper respect!

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,166
[KUBARD]
Hm.

298
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,625
My humblest apologies,
Your Highness.

299
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,083
Sam told me you were
a truly fierce fighter.

300
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,208
I'm glad to see
he didn't exaggerate.

301
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,125
Bringing down Bodin
and his fanatics

302
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,000
will not be an easy task.

303
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,458
I'll be glad of that
giant sword of yours.

304
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,833
A moment, Highness.

305
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,333
Might you permit me
to ask a question?

306
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
What drives you
to seek the throne

307
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,458
with such single-minded purpose?

308
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,000
Kubard.

309
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,916
I would be grateful
for an answer.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,166
That's enough of your insolence!

311
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,375
It is simple.

312
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,916
I would reclaim the throne
that was stolen from me,

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,458
so that I can restore peace to
the kingdom and to its people.

314
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,041
Was it Lusitania that stole
the throne from you, though?

315
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:30,833
Or was it--?

316
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,250
I said that's enough!

317
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,083
No! But he's right.
That is enough.

318
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,583
[KUBARD sighs]

319
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,625
I mean you no ill will,
but it's time I go.

320
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:43,000
The defeat at Atropatene
freed me to do as I please

321
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,625
whenever I please, and I find
I like that way of life.

322
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,958
Are you sure?

323
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,791
You may do as you wish.

324
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,708
Reward this man
for his service today.

325
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,000
[SAM]
Yes, sir.

326
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,125
You know what it means

327
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,500
if Prince Hilmes truly is of the
royal bloodline as you insist?

328
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,000
[SAM]
Huh?

329
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,250
[KUBARD] It means taking our
kingdom back from Lusitania

330
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,875
is only the beginning.

331
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,875
After that, there will
still be a bloody feud

332
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,250
for the throne of Pars
to be settled.

333
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,875
[SAM]
I suppose.

334
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,333
[KUBARD] Only a stupid man would
get caught up in such a dispute.

335
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,291
Sorry, Sam.
You best forget me.

336
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,166
So, Prince Hilmes
is fortunate enough

337
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,541
to have you playing advisor.

338
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958
And what about Prince Arslan?

339
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,500
Who's acting as his
adivsors these days?

340
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,416
He has Daryun and Narsus.

341
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh!

342
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,125
That court-hating recluse
came out of hiding

343
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,250
to ally himself with
Prince Arslan, eh?

344
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,583
Interesting.

345
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,291
[chuckles]

346
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,625
[KUBARD]
So, then. What're your plans?

347
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,458
Will you stay on as a
supporter of Prince Hilmes?

348
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,166
As I've sworn him my loyalty,

349
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,666
I can see no other
honorable course to take.

350
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,666
And I must admit
I don't like the idea

351
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,875
of him being without any
staunch Parsian ally.

352
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,916
Though, of course,

353
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,958
I know I haven't much to offer.

354
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,208
You have a tough road ahead.

355
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,125
I'll pray that you find
luck in battle, at least.

356
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,833
Mind you, though,
I'm an unbeliever,

357
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,958
so it's entirely possible
a prayer from me

358
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,916
will actually have the
opposite effect with the gods.

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,166
Farewell.

360
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,875
[NARRATOR]
March of that year,

361
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,750
from his seat at Peshawar,

362
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,291
Arslan used his authority
as Crown Prince

363
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,666
to issue two momentous
proclamations.

364
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,000
[NARSUS] The Decree to Pursue
and Destroy Lusitania.

365
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,041
It is an appeal to
all Parsian fighters

366
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,208
to come together at Peshawar
Fortress and form an army.

367
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,166
The army will be
commanded by you

368
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,583
and will be used to drive
the Lusitanian invaders

369
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,166
from our borders.

370
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,291
Good.

371
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,958
[NARSUS]
And then there is this.

372
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,291
The Decree to Abolish Slavery.

373
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,125
It states that once Your
Highness has become king,

374
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,875
you will free all slaves
living within Pars,

375
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,208
and that you will prohibit
the buying and selling

376
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,750
of human beings.

377
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,916
Yes.

378
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,833
[NARRATOR] It was for
this historic proclamation

379
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,875
that the young prince
would later be hailed

380
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,416
as Arslan the Liberator.

381
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:39,333
[NARRATOR]
Arslan.

382
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,375
Fourteen years,
six months of age.

383
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,083
He walked a dangerous
path, one yet rife

384
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,791
with unknown obstacles
and unforeseen hardships.

385
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,166
However,

386
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,041
it was only by treading
this long and perilous road

387
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,250
that he could assume
his place in history.

388
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,708
[NARRATOR] Arslan must
defeat the Lusitanian horde

389
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,791
that has overrun
the Kingdom of Pars.

390
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:35,416
To do so, he will need
not only strength and wit,

391
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,375
but also a firm resolve.

392
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,000
Next time: "The True
Face of a Knight."

393
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,958
And thus would the
boy become a king.
