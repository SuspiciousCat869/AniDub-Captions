1
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,375
[ÉTOILE]
Why are you here?

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,250
You're not the one
I came to find.

3
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,583
Well, killing you would
be a waste of my time.

4
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,958
Where is the coward?
Where's Prince Arslan? Tell me!

5
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,083
You have found me.

6
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,750
I am Arslan.

7
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,166
Damn.

8
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,208
You made a fool of me!

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,791
Well, for that
I'll make you pay!

10
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,208
[ARSLAN]
Elam!

11
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,958
Your Highness, please
step back from him.

12
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,583
[NARSUS]
Elam.

13
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,250
I am impressed you were
able to find us here,

14
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,791
but it's over.

15
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,166
What's happening?

16
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Your assassination
attempt has failed.

17
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,125
You need not die.

18
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,625
You can surrender yourself.

19
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,500
[growls]

20
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,041
You filthy heathens!

21
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,875
Commander, we can't
hold them off!

22
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,291
Please, withdraw, sir!

23
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,166
I stay!

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,625
But think of the count!

25
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,375
Who will watch his back if
you are not there to, sir?

26
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,041
[ALFARID]
You bastards!

27
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,791
You're not getting away!

28
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:55,958
[NARSUS]
Alfarid!

29
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,958
We have the castle
completely surrounded.

30
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,375
To have gotten past our men,

31
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,625
they must've used
a hidden passage.

32
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,333
Understood!

33
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,666
[ARSLAN]
Elam!

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,875
Hold on. Someone
come tend to him!

35
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,875
[NARSUS]
It looks grave.

36
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,500
[ELAM] I'm sorry, my Lord.
Of all times to be injured.

37
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,458
No need to speak.

38
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:27,708
Although, I know I did not train
you to be so rash or reckless.

39
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,083
I made the right
decision, though.

40
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,750
Indeed.

41
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,333
You must rest.

42
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,041
Your Highness, try not to
look so frightened and sad.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,833
You're in the midst of trying
to win a war and claim a throne.

44
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,375
You must remain
strong at all times.

45
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,041
You're right. Thank you, Elam.

46
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,833
[ÉTOILE]
Curse him. Curse him!

47
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:58,583
That sneaky coward's been
playing me for a fool all along.

48
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:03,208
How many opportunities
did I have to kill him?

49
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,333
I let him get away!

50
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,791
[ALFARID] A secret passage
tucked in among the cliffs.

51
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,041
How handy.

52
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,333
Now, time to turn
the enemy on his head.

53
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,583
Like a true Zot fighter.

54
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,625
[DARYUN]
Your Highness!

55
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,791
I've returned.

56
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it true the camp
came under attack?

57
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,833
[ARSLAN]
It did.

58
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,750
But as you see, I'm unharmed.

59
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,416
However, Elam took a nasty
sword cut that was meant for me.

60
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,125
Gods. Poor Elam.

61
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,291
[NARSUS] A hasty incursion
made in pursuit of glory.

62
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,708
Common enough among
boy commanders.

63
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,625
Boy commander?

64
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,333
[ARSLAN]
You might remember him.

65
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,375
It was the Lusitanian
who took me hostage.

66
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,291
The one we let escape.

67
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,916
[DARYUN]
Him.

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,083
[ARSLAN]
His gaze was so intense.

69
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:06,083
Challenging. Even more
so now than before.

70
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,291
[DARYUN]
Your Highness.

71
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,583
That's it. I've decided.

72
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,541
I'm going to ride out.

73
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,083
[DARYUN]
You mean to ride into battle?

74
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,000
[ARSLAN] If we are evenly
matched in this fight,

75
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,500
perhaps I can tip the
scales in our favor.

76
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,750
It's what a king would do
to help inspire his men.

77
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,583
I know I'm not
my father's equal,

78
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,541
but those who have given
themselves to my cause

79
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,666
deserve to see me fight.

80
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,500
[PARSIAN MESSENGER A]
Lord Narsus!

81
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,541
A report from Mistress Alfarid!

82
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,083
Let's have it.

83
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,500
She says she'll open the gate
with the coming of the dawn.

84
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,333
Good, thank you.

85
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,166
Victory today hinges upon us.

86
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,958
We must not falter.

87
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,458
Not long ago, I fought
my first battle,

88
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,041
and I fled that day in defeat.

89
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,375
I despaired of ever
seeing Pars whole again.

90
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,333
But thanks to my loyal advisors
and stalwart friends,

91
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,208
here I stand today.

92
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,291
And now I have hope.

93
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,791
I believe that, together,
we can retake Ecbatana.

94
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,375
The country will be ours,
and I will become your king!

95
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,833
[PARSIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

96
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,333
[ARSLAN] The castle's
defenses are strong,

97
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,416
but even as I speak,
a company of our troops

98
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,833
is entering through
a hidden passage.

99
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,666
With the dawn, they
will breach the gate!

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,708
[ARSLAN] Hear me, gods of Pars,
and spirits of our fallen!

101
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,416
Lend us your aid!

102
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,625
Fight beside us in
the coming battle!

[PARSIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

105
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,166
Here they come.

106
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,083
Let's go!

107
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,208
Charge!

108
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,500
Move quickly!

109
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,458
I want that gate open
before sunrise's, got it?

110
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,958
Where did they all come from?

111
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,916
There aren't many. Stay calm!
Call men from below, and--

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
Support our men! Keep firing!

113
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,166
[SAM]
A surprise attack on the gate?

114
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,291
Get men up there quickly!
The gate must hold!

115
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,375
Yes, sir!

116
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,791
[SAM]
If they can get the gate open,

117
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,708
the Keep is as good as theirs.

118
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,666
[PARSIAN SOLDIER A]
Lord Zaravant, look!

119
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,875
[PARSIAN MESSENGER B]
The gate has begun to open!

120
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,375
Wait, something's wrong,
the gate shouldn't be opening.

121
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,125
Get some more men down here!

122
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,500
We'll form a wall just insi--

123
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,875
For Pars and the Crown Prince!

124
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,541
[ALL]
Yeah!

125
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,291
Just a little longer!
We almost have it!

126
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,041
Push them back!

127
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,625
If we let them in any further--

128
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,750
Deploy companies to
the left and right.

129
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,041
Storm the fortress gate and
subdue enemy opposition!

130
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,375
Everyone else, continue forward.

131
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,083
Push through and
bring down the castle!

00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,500
[BARCACION]
The enemy has come.

134
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,333
Shields up! Don't let
them in any further!

135

[NARSUS]
Daryun! Kishward! Into the fray!

136
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,625
[DARYUN, KISHWARD]

[yelling]

142
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,166
That looks like...

[ARSLAN]
Kubard!

144
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,708
Greetings, Prince Arslan.

145
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,166
You've grown into
a gallant fighter.

146
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm doubly glad I
rushed to join you.

147
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,083
Now, off with you.

148
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,291
You claim the throne of
Pars as rightfully yours?

149
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,333
I, for one, am eager
to see you prove it.

150
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,208
[DARYUN]
We are through!

151
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,125
Your Highness,
we must push forward.

152
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,541
Jaswant, you're up.

153
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,750
Yes, sir!

154
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:16,333
When this is over you owe me
a jug of wine. Fight well.

155
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,833
Almost there.

156
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,208
Sam's leading them!

157
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,666
Now, charge!

158
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,750
Shall we press forward?

159
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,791
Yes!

[NARSUS]
Keep going!

162
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,541
Stop for long and the enemy
soldiers will surround you!

163
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,208
Very well, friend. Fight well!

164
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,791
My fate depends
on the rest of you.

165
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,833
[WOMEN screaming]

166
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,166
God of Yaldabaoth have mercy.

167
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,000
[HILMES] In the end, these men
are on loan from Guiscard.

168
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,208
I care not how greatly
their numbers are reduced.

169
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,125
Indeed, this will likely be
a heavy loss for Lusitania.

170
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,708
Come, spawn of Andragoras.

171
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,250
It will be so sweet
to see you humiliated

172
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,291
before your troops
and loyal servants.

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,791
Stay here. I'll push on.

174
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,375
I can't. I've come too far.

175
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,583
Beyond these men,
my lord cousin awaits.

176
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,833
What're you doing?!

177
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,625
I am under the protection
of Divine Mithra.

178
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,875
I have no fear of being struck.

179
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,375
Not by the arrows of heretics.

180
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,958
[FARANGIS]
Your Highness,

181
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,583
that divine protection
falls upon you as well.

182
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:30,125
The barbaric Lusitanians must
be made to change their ways.

183
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:32,083
You are the one who can do that.

184
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,958
You are the only one.

185
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,500
[FARANGIS]
Please go,

186
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,791
but know that wherever
Your Highness may be,

187
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,791
whatever enemy you fight,

188
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,750
you will have my bow.

189
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,416
Now's our chance, Highness.

190
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
[ARSLAN]
Right.

191
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,333
[BARCACION]
Are you Prince Arslan?

192
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,625
But you are still little
more than a child.

193
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,708
[BOTH yelling]

194
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,916
I expected to see the Knight
in Black at your side.

195
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,291
[ARSLAN] We've not met since
that night at Peshawar.

196
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,000
How fare you, cousin?

197
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,125
I find it repugnant to hear
myself named your cousin,

198
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,208
but I'm glad you came.

199
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,208
Tell me, cousin.

200
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,541
Have you suffered terribly
on your journey here?

201
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:46,125
Has it been difficult
for you? Well, has it?

202
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,750
Rantings of a madman.
Pay him no heed.

203
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:53,458
Actually, I wish to hear
what he has to say.

204
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,833
Your Highness?

205
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,750
Do you think whatever
hardships you've faced

206
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,875
can hold a candle to my own?

207
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,583
Don't make me laugh!

208
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,083
I will see you slain
here in battle today.

209
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,375
Your very memory
will be disgraced!

210
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,833
But that's not enough!

211
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,208
You still won't know the
depths of the humiliation

212
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,416
I have suffered.

213
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,791
Nothing can appease
the rage I feel for you!

214
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,458
Is that why you bear him
this senseless grudge?

215
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,000
Because he hasn't "suffered"
as much as you have?

216
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,541
[HILMES]
Senseless grudge?

217
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,291
You don't understand the pain
of wounds that never heal!

218
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,916
[ARSLAN]
Yes, I do.

219
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,208
But you are not the only
one who has been injured.

220
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:35,458
All of Pars has... gravely.

221
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,833
Lord cousin,

222
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,208
you claim you're of the
royal blood of this kingdom.

223
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,458
What say you?

224
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,375
Will you lend me your
aid in protecting her?

225
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:49,458
And if I did that, would
you yield me the throne?

226
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,291
I have a responsibility
to my people.

227
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,916
Their goals are mine.

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,833
I must fight for them.

I'm sorry, Your Highness.

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER Q]
Retreat!

My love for Pars
is strong and true.

234
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,125
I care deeply for her people.

235
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,625
I will be her king!

236
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,375
You will never rule!

Your Highness.

238

I will carry your words
engraved upon my heart forever.

proud to serve you.

How can you worship him so?

242

His blood is impure.

Yet you serve him
like a loyal dog.

244
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
You disgrace the
knights of Pars.

If I am a dog, let me
show you my fangs!

I am.

Many men in my service
have died today.

I agree.

It would be best for us
to end this quickly.

[BARCACION]
Mm.

255
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:19,791
I think perhaps you would
be a kind and just king.

256
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,500
The Faith of Yaldabaoth
denies all others.

257
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,958
So it has been for centuries.

00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,041
Is it possible there could
be some other way?

259

I don't know.

[HILMES]
It is a shame, Mardan fu Mardan!

If only you'd given your
strength to serve me.

262
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,833
You could be on
the side of right!

263
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,083
Impossible!

264
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,875
I can serve none
but Prince Arslan!

265
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,208
Your gaze infuriates me.

266
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,708
Such unwavering conviction!

00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,750
How can I prove it to you?

268
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,625
That mine is the side of right.

269
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,916
I will not kill you yet.

270
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,500
Not until you know
in your heart of hearts

00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,708
that you have been
well and truly beaten.

Otherwise, it will
be meaningless.

I must destroy you utterly.

274
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:32,333
Nothing short of that
will appease my rage!

Damn you--!

And there will be no pillaging,
do you understand?

No! Stop this!

This is not something
that can be stopped.

[BARCACION] This is the
only power left to me.

292
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,708
To choose to join
my people and my god.

[ARSLAN] Why? I've given
you the chance to live!

Why must you choose death?!

You killed him.

[NARRATOR] Tears spilled
unchecked from Estelle's eyes.

After tragedy,

302
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:37,125
after countless deaths,
there came a birth.

303

Next time, "The Highway
of Blood and Sweat."

And thus would the
boy become a king.
