[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 317.

6
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,000
When their ally, Maryam, was
invaded by the Lusitanian Army,

7
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,208
Pars responded decisively.

8
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,375
Their king,
Andragoras the Third,

9
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,500
met the invaders with a
force 300 thousand strong

10
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,916
and crushed them.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,375
They left a mountain of
Lusitanian corpses behind.

12
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
Now, come at me again!

13
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,541

Upper block!

17
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,291
[ARSLAN] You beat me
quite handily, Vahriz.

18
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,083
You must show me that maneuver.

19
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,458
[VAHRIZ laughs]

20
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,875
Swinging a sword to and
fro is hardly a "maneuver."

21
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,000
Those were simply
fundamental sword strokes.

22
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,833
Although, without a sound
knowledge of the basics,

23
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,333
you cannot hope to master the
more complicated techniques.

24
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,791
Fundamental strokes
are important.

25
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,791
Hone them, Prince Arslan.

26
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,083
[ARSLAN]
You're a harsh teacher.

27
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,916
Why did you not
accompany my Lord Father

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,625
on his campaign against
the Lusitanians?

29
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,708
Because my duty is here
at this moment, my Prince.

30
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,916
Safeguarding this, the Royal
Capital of Ecbatana.

31
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,166
Lusitania is not
the only threat.

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,750
Kingdoms to the east
have set their eyes

33
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,666
upon our beloved city, as well.

34
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,833
We mustn't let our guard down.

35
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,250
It sounds as if you're
terribly busy, General.

36
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,583
Perhaps forgoing my daily sword
lessons would free you up a bit.

37
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,791
[VAHRIZ] How can you hope
to become a proper king

38
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,500
with such little ambition?

39
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,083
You must take your
training seriously.

40
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,458
[VAHRIZ] Even simply mastering
the fundamentals of the sword

41
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,250
will show in your
bearing and presentation.

42
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,208
You have yet to fight your
maiden battle, my Prince.

43
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,583
If you hope to survive it,

44
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,791
you must train with the
sword often in preparation.

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,875
Everything you say is true.

46
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,625
I know that, but even so.

47
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,958
[VAHRIZ]
If you know,

48
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,583
then try to carry yourself
as a swordsman would.

49
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,458
The soldiers expect it.

50
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,166
[TAHAMENAY]
Loyal soldiers.

51
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,125
Your allegiance to the Kingdom
of Pars does you credit.

52

You have our thanks.

Nothing, really.

60

I only wanted to apologize
for my tardiness.

61
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,875
[TAHAMENAY]
Not at all.

00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,750
I understand that you are busy
with daily sword practice.

63
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,375
Yes! I hope to be a fine
king like my lord father,

64
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,291
but I know that
will take hard work.

And I'm not making
the swiftest progress.

to be a fine king?

I fear I don't know.

It's Azrael! And Sorush!

Ah! If they've returned,
it can mean only one thing.

[KISHWARD]
Your Highness.

00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,416
And Lord Vahriz. I trust
I find you both well?

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,250
[ARSLAN] You're back!
Greetings, Kishward.

79
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,041
[KISHWARD] So, they
greet Your Highness first

80
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,583
instead of their master,
do they? The cheeky bastards.

[VAHRIZ chuckles]

82
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,541
You must teach them
some respect.

83
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,958
On the contrary, my lord, it's
not that they don't respect me.

84
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,666
Rather, it is a sign of the deep
affection that they harbor

85
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,666
for His Highness here.

86
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,208
Birds and beasts are far
better judges of character

than we humans
can ever hope to be.

88

They've read what dwells
within His Highness's heart,

and know that it
is pure and good.

You've returned
from the campaign.

All went as expected?

[KISHWARD]
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,333
Our losses in the field
were negligible.

94
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,166
The Lusitanians are sorry they
ever thought of invading Maryam.

95
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,958
We defeated them soundly
and at little cost.

Marzban Kubard and his wine jug.

[RESIDENT D]
An inseparable pair.

[RESIDENT F] Honestly,
is that man ever sober?

You see that scar? The one
over his left eye there?

104
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,250
That's from when Lord
Kubard fought a dragon.

the cavalry when I grow up.

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,625
I'll protect the king
like the Lords Marzban.

110
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,000
That's stupid! The king
killed a lion when he was 13.

111
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,541
He doesn't need the likes
of you to look after him.

112
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,375
Yeah. You're probably right.

[RESIDENT G]
Who're the prisoners?

114
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,791
[RESIDENT E]
They're Lusitanian soldiers.

115
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,750
They go to war in the name
of that god of theirs, right?

116
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,375
The Cult of Yaldabaoth,
I think it is.

117

[RESIDENT G]
I hear they kill babes in arms

118

it sends children into war?

Oh, the poor little dear.

Eh. He doesn't seem very brave.

protect him instead of the king.

A little on the young side.

can do a man's work.

00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,500
Forgive me, my Prince, but such

Hm. Why ever not?

It's a perfect opportunity
to speak with Lusitanians.

00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,583
If you require a slave,
we can easily send a messenger.

142

That's not it. I wish
to learn from them myself.

Of their culture, their homes.

[BOY SOLDIER]
Back off!

315
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,583
You wanna keep him
in one piece, don't you?

316
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,375
Looks like we're
done running, rich boy.

317
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,750
Just surrender yourself.
There's no need for you to die.

318
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
[ARSLAN]
What?

[ARSLAN screams]

322
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,916
Something fall?

[ARSLAN]
Daryun!

324
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,041
[TRAVELER B]
That was a long fall.

325
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,333
[TRAVELER B]
There's another.

326
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,625
[TRAVELER C]
Are you all right, young man?

327
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,333
[TRAVELER A]
Come now, up we go. There.

328
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,166
Hey! He's stealing that horse!

329
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,375
[TRAVELER A]
Get back here, horse thief!

330
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,625
Stop him!

Wait, lad!

00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,541
Don't shoot him! Wait!

334
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,583
[DARYUN] I'm here, Prince
Arslan. Are you injured?

335
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,250
[ARSLAN]
Daryun.

336
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,333
I'm unharmed.

337
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,875
I don't understand
why you stopped me

338
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,791
from shooting the little rat.

339
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,583
Me neither.

340
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,291
Heh.

341
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,833
[DARYUN]
Uh.

342
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,208
Very well, Your Highness.

343
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,083
Should anyone ask, we'll
say the sun was in my eyes.

344
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,625
What an adventure. Thank
goodness he's all right.

345
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,708
Captured by an escaped slave
and dragged throughout the city?

346
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,416
[MAN E]
It's a wonder he survived.

347
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,708
[MAN D] What was he doing
down there in the first place?

348
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,416
You must be more careful
with that royal neck of yours.

349
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,666
Had things gone differently, you
might've had it broken today.

350
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,958
You make it sound
worse than it was.

[PARS SOLDIER M]
Your Royal Highness!

352
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,083
We have captured the miscreants

whose actions led to
the prisoner's escape.

They didn't mean
anything by it, I swear!

Fools! His Highness's
life was threatened

because of what those three did.

You think they'll
be shown mercy--?

Yes. Release them now, please.

[ARSLAN]
Some of what that boy said

381
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,250
was quite different from
what I've been taught.

382

I wonder what else the
palace tutors have left out.

383

other captive Lusitanians say.

Forgive me, Highness. This is
no sight for royal eyes.

You killed all the captives?

[SLAVER A]
They...

394
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,333
...were unmanageable and
needed to be put down.

395
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,208
Lusitanians are no different
than wild animals, Prince.

396
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
You either tame them,
or kill them. That simple.

Hurry. Load them up.

[ARSLAN]
They didn't have to die.

399
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,041
If they'd simply accepted
their lot as slaves,

400
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,333
no harm would've come to them.

Someday, the Kingdom of Pars
will be yours to rule.

When that happens,

there's a friend of mine
you might appoint.

406
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,916
You have a great many questions,

407

one to answer some of them.

[ARSLAN]
Oh? Who is this man?

[DARYUN]
Uh.

00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,791
Sorry, Highness.

411
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,625
Simply thinking aloud.

412
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,041
Please, forget I said anything.
He'd never be a proper advisor.

413
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,666
Well. Now you have
piqued my interest.

414
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,458
No matter, I suppose.

415
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,875
My Lord Father's reign is likely
to continue for decades still.

416
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:32,166
I cannot yet even begin to
imagine ascending to the throne.

417
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,875
As long as my father is king,
Pars will remain strong.

418
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,500
So it seems it will be a while

419
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,541
before I meet this
friend of yours.

420
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,416
[DARYUN]
Indeed.

422

[NARRATOR]
However, in three short years,

423
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,208
the Royal Capital of Ecbatana

424
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,458
would be shrouded
in fire and blood.

425
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,791
Despite their attempts
to stem the tide,

426
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,000
Maryam would fall to
the Lusitanian invaders,

427
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:03,375
and that onslaught would finally
reach the Parsian border.

Pars Era, the year 320.

Autumn.

430
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,125
Crown Prince Arslan is about
to embark on his maiden battle.

431
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,375
He is 14 years old.

432
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,916
[NARRATOR]
The wind changes course.

433
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,708
The fog rolls in.

434
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:51,291
To Arslan, it seems
an inauspicious omen.

435
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,916
Next time:
"Age Fourteen, Maiden Battle."

436
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,833
And thus would
the boy become a king.
