After leaving Kashan Fortress,

2
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,625
Arslan's company
found themselves

3
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,333
relentlessly harried
by the Lusitanians.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,958
Forced apart, they continued
separately toward Peshawar.

[DARYUN] How many men
have they sent after us?

8
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,208
It appears the enemy
is rather determined

9
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,500
to prevent us from
reaching Peshawar.

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,708
[DARYUN]
Hm.

11
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,958
[DARYUN]
We should hurry.

12
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,833
I dislike being away from
the prince for long.

13
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,625
[NARSUS]
Several dozen horses.

14
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,875
The Zot Clan, I expect.

15
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,166
They may not appreciate my
presence in their territory,

16
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,625
but this is the shortest
route to Peshawar.

17
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,791
That's the one we're
looking for, Chief.

18

The one in the strange
silver mask.

A silver mask?

21
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,541
It's the Zot Clan!

00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,541

We'll be taking your
gold and weapons.

Heh.

I won't ask again.

28

You're a savage.

29
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,125
More of a monkey than a
man from what I can see.

30

would I listen to you?

You should consider it an honor

35
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,541
that your petty chieftain
died by my hand.

[HILMES] A big sword for a

I'm Alfarid, daughter
of the Zot Clan Chief.

You... you killed my father!

[HILMES]
Alfarid, is it?

49
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,333
That's a name better
suited for a lady of noble

50
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:13,000
or even royal lineage, not
a painted savage like you.

51
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
I ought to punish you
for such presumption.

Go ahead and try!

Ah, the inept painter!
We meet again.

68
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,416
Have you come all
this way in search

69
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,666
of somebody who likes your work?

70
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,458
I wish you would
stop following me.

71

You may not realize this,

72
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,625
but I don't much care
for your company.

73

Where have you
hidden Arslan away?

74
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:41,000
I will be happy to whisper that
to your corpse in just a moment.

75
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,666
Think you can do it?

76
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,125
Possibly. There is only one
way to know for certain.

77
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,833
This is not your fight!

78
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,750
It was my father and my
friends that he killed.

79
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,583
That makes him mine!

80
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,750
But you're unarmed.

81
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,333
You'll never defeat
him without a sword.

82
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,291
Then lend me yours.
It looks good enough.

83
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,458
[NARSUS] Do you have any
collateral for such a loan?

84
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,333
[ALFARID] I'm trying
to avenge my dead father

85
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,333
and you're asking
me for collateral?

86
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,458
Can you blame a man
for being prudent?

87
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,333
I don't know anything
about you, after all.

88
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,208
You're quite a charmer, huh?

89
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,041
I bet all the ladies want you.

90
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,291
Ha. You may not see it,
but I'm doing you a favor.

91
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,041
You won't win a fight
against that man.

92
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,000
You'd only be throwing
your life away.

93
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,875
You don't know that!

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,125
Please, just stay back.

95
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,208
It's past time to
put an end to this.

96
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,291
[NARSUS]
He is very good.

97
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,250
[NARSUS]
Any moment now...

98
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,750
[HILMES] Well, painter.
No, I'm sorry. Narsus.

99
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,583
Oh? Kind of you
to remember me.

100
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,875
[HILMES] You are a man
of great ingenuity.

101
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
It would be a shame to kill you.

102
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,916
Bend the knee now, and
I shall let you serve me.

103
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,375
[NARSUS]
Heh.

104
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,500
[HILMES]
You find something amusing?

105
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,708
I've never met a fighter

106
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,750
who could match your
skill with a sword,

107
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,500
but you lack a quality that all
truly great rulers must have.

108
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,875
[HILMES]
What is that?

109
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,416
Humility.

110
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
Prince Arslan is far better
suited to the throne than you.

111
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,333
He would never order
a man to serve him.

112
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,125
[HILMES]
You dare!

I'm glad you kept your head.

If you had attacked
him back there,

you would likely now be buried

I had to live.

I couldn't avenge my
father and clan if I died.

I'm glad you see that.

They're gone. All gone.

134

I don't know what you're
thanking me for.

135
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,125
[ALFARID] Yes, you do.
You saved my life back there.

136
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,458
So... so, thank you.

137
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,166
[ALFARID] You know,
you're nicer than I thought.

138
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,041
That's worth something, yes?

139
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,750
[ALFARID] I just realized
I owe you my life,

140
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,666
and I don't even know
your name. What is it?

141
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,250
My name is Narsus.

142
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,083
[ALFARID]
Given what happened,

143
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,708
I can't say it's nice to
meet you, but I'm Alfarid.

144
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,291
[NARSUS]
Well met.

145
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,333
[ALFARID] It's a lucky
thing that rockslide

146
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,875
earlier happened when it did.

147
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,708
If not for that, I don't know
how we would've gotten away.

148
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,250
[NARSUS]
That wasn't luck.

149
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,541
It happened because
I made it happen.

150
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,333
[ALFARID] What? But how
could you cause a rockslide?

151
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,458
With magic or something?

152
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,750
[NARSUS] Making a few
rocks fall down a hill?

153
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,416
That doesn't require magic.

154
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,791
Just a leather thong,
a piece of wood,

155
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,083
and a little knowledge
about levers.

156
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,125
[ALFARID]
Levers?

157
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,375
[NARSUS]
Yes. It's simple, really.

158
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,666
The force created by
the thong applies torque

159
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,916
to the piece of wood,
then that force--

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,583
[ALFARID] I have no idea
what you're saying.

161
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,166
You're a pretty smart
man, aren't you?

162
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,250
Not bad with a sword, either.

163
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,416
What else would you expect?

164
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,375
This is what happens
when bandits

165
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,666
pit themselves against a king.

166
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,250
[ALFARID]
I've been wondering...

167
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,958
Tell me. How old are you?

168
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,125
[NARSUS]
Twenty-six, why?

169
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,000
[ALFARID] Really? Looking at
you, I wouldn't've guessed it.

170
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,750
I thought you were at
least a little younger.

171
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,458
[NARSUS] Terribly sorry
if I've disappointed you.

172
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,625
[ALFARID]
No, it's all right.

173
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,166
There are exactly ten
years between us.

174
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,000
Maybe that's lucky or something.

175
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,000
Plus, someone older is
probably more dependable.

176
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,000
[NARSUS]
Uh!

177
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,125
[ALFARID]
All right! It's settled.

178
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,958
I've decided that
I'm coming with you.

179
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,750
There are other members of
the Zot Clan who still live.

180
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,750
Don't you need to go back?

181
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,375
[ALFARID]
No, I don't.

182
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,666
[NARRATOR] One month
after the fall of Ecbatana.

183
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,333
There were three powerful
Lusitanians vying for control.

184
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:56,916
Archpriest Bodin, who
commanded the Temple Knights.

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,625
The king's brother, Guiscard,

186
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,750
who had the full support of
the military and the ministers.

187
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,625
And the king himself,
Innocentis the Seventh,

188
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,708
who had lost the
trust of his subjects

189
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,208
due to his affection
for the heathen queen.

190
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,375
As tensions between these
factions continued to rise,

191
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,958
something occurred
that tipped the scales.

192
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,750
Hildigo, Commander
of the Temple Knights,

193
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,458
was assassinated.

194
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,500
[BODIN]
I've misjudged you!

195
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,333
You are an apostate,
and no true king!

196
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,916
God will punish you
for what you have done!

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,375
What? Archpriest!

198
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,416
I don't know what
you're speaking of!

199
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,791
I opposed your marriage
to the heathen temptress,

200
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,791
and you retaliated
by killing Hildigo!

201
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,708
No, never! I--

202
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,291
[BODIN]
I won't hear your lies!

203
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,125
Your depravity is a curse
upon this kingdom!

204
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,916
God will surely smite you!

205
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,750
But, Guiscard, please!

206
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,958
Bodin is obviously under
some sort of misapprehension.

207
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,083
You can help clear
this up, can't you?

208
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,500
You may not be aware
of this, Archpriest,

209
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,333
but the ever-virtuous Commander
of the Temple Knights

210
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,583
was not alone
when he was killed.

211
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,583
[BODIN]
What's this?

212
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,166
In fact, when he was found,

213
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,208
he was sharing his bed
with a heathen woman.

214
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,750
What? Such slander is bold
even for you, Guiscard.

215
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,958
That's nothing short
of blasphemy!

216
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,291
[GUISCARD]
What of Hildigo?

217
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,083
Is bedding with a heathen
not blasphemy, as well?

218
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,333
To imagine the Commander
of the Temple Knights

219
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,833
would commit such a sin!

220
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:27,875
Do you think the men below
him will follow his example?

221
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,875
No doubt his death
was divine retribution.

222
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,750
And for such a thing to have
happened right under your nose.

223
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,250
Who will listen to your
zealotry now, I wonder?

224
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,875
[BODIN growls]
You were responsible for this!

225
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,625
[BODIN growls]

226
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,250
One other thing.

227
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,375
Given the circumstances,
we saw fit

228
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,375
to lower the banner of the
Faith of Yaldabaoath for now.

229
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,750
[BODIN]
You had no right to--

230
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,916
[GUISCARD] So sorry for not
informing you until now.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
[BODIN]
How dare you!

232
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
They've lost their commander,

233
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,916
they have lost their
virtuous reputation,

234
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,083
and they have even
lost the sacred banner

235
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,250
that is the symbol of
the church's authority.

236
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,500
[BODIN growls]

237
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,708
[GUISCARD] What are
the Temple Knights now

238
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,500
but a motley crew
of common soldiers?

239
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,083
[BODIN] You will go to Hell
for this, I swear it!

240
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,083
[SUBORDINATE B]
Prince Guiscard.

241
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,000
Bodin has departed Ecbatana,

242
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,583
and he's taken the
Temple Knights with him.

243
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,375
[GUISCARD] Well, that rids
us of one inconvenience.

244
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,541
[SUBORDINATE B] Reports have
them heading for Maryam, sir.

245
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,791
[ELAM] We should arrive at
Peshawar soon, Your Highness.

246
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:50,333
You must be tired. But we
won't be riding too much longer.

247
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,166
[ARSLAN]
Please. I'm bearing up.

248
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,208
This is the farthest
I've traveled in my life.

249
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:59,166
It's been quite an experience.
There must be so many more lands

250
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,458
that I've never
seen or heard of.

251
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,833
[ELAM]
That may be true.

252
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,708
The legendary cities to
the southwest, for example.

253
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,875
Do you know of them?

254
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,625
No, I can't say I do.

255
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
[ELAM]
Far to the southwest of Pars,

256
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,416
there is a vast, empty desert.

257
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,041
But beyond that wasteland lie

258
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,333
the City of Bronze and
the City of Pillars,

259
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,541
two places only spoken
of in legends.

260
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,500
[ARSLAN]
They sound fascinating!

261
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,000
[ELAM]
When I'm old enough,

262
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,375
I hope to journey to such places
and make a study of them,

263
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,875
learning all the lost
histories and legends.

264
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,041
[ARSLAN] So, that's
your life dream, then?

265
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,166
[ELAM]
Yes.

266
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,583
[ARSLAN]
Well, someday

267
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,333
when you've learned all
these histories and legends,

268
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,000
I hope you'll
share them with me.

269
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,125
Uh?

270
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,708
You'll have such
stories to tell.

271
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,166
I'm excited even now,
just thinking about it.

272
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,375
If that is Your
Highness's wish.

273
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,750
It most certainly is!

274
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,083
Ah! Then I'll be glad to.

275
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,500
[GIEVE]
So much chatter.

276
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,333
You've grown awfully friendly
with the prince, Elam.

277
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,875
I... I meant no disrespect.

278
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,291
[GIEVE] Your Highness,
we can see it now.

279
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,250
That's Peshawar,
there in the distance.

280
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:02,916
[ARSLAN gasps]

281

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
If you beg for mercy, I might--

[grunts]

283
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,000
I've never cared for
men who talk too much.

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS groan]

00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,625
[ZANDEH]
The rest of you stay back.

287
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,791
I intend to kill
this one myself.

288
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,291
So, he did come after me.

289
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,458
And I don't think
he's likely to stop.

290
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,916
Today I'll take the head
from your shoulders,

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,291
and see my father avenged.

292
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,750
Your father is to blame
for his own death.

293
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,125
It was his decision
to betray his kingdom

294
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,041
and become a pawn
in Lusitania's game.

295
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,583
He was no traitor!

296
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,333
Andragoras stole the throne

297
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,458
and had no right to
be called Pars's king!

[ZANDEH grunts]

00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,375
We serve the man worthy of the
crown, not the man who stole it!

300
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,583
It is we who serve the
rightful king of Pars.

301
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,875
Who is this "rightful king"?

302
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,958
[DARYUN gasps]

than I gave you credit for.

00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,375
[DARYUN]
What?

305
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,250
[FARANGIS]
Earth-travel magic?

306
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,375
[ZANDEH]
Hm? And who are you?

307
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,458
We serve the same
master, Lord Zandeh.

308

I'm here to provide help,
should you require it.

309
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,666
[ZANDEH]
Do as you like.

310
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,125
This makes things harder.

--What are these tricks?
--He's using sorcery.

312

[FARANGIS grunts]

318
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,666
[ZANDEH] You serve the son of
a usurper! You are traitors!

319
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,750
We are the true and
loyal subjects of Pars.

320
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,750
[DARYUN] The son of
a usurper, you say?

321
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,875
[ZANDEH grunts]

322
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,125
[DARYUN] It doesn't matter
who this master you serve is.

323
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,208
Nor does it matter to me
what Prince Arslan's

324
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,208
origins might be. I intend
to protect him and--

[DARYUN groaning]

328
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,375
[ZANDEH]
I have you!

329
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,291
[DARYUN grunts]

00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,333

00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,166
[ARSLAN]
Daryun!

334
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,125
How else can I help?!

335
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,583
At your feet! Watch the ground!

336
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,375
[ARSLAN groaning]

337
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,083
[ELAM]
Your Highness!

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,541
[ARSLAN]
Thank you, Elam!

339
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,625
[ARSLAN, ELAM groan]

340
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,416
Unwise to look away!

341
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,458
[DARYUN yells]

342
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,375
[ZANDEH screams]

343
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,833
[DARYUN]
Uh!

344
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,083
[DARYUN]
That is my prince!

345
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,041
And you will not harm him!

346
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,166
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS groan]

347
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,166
[GIEVE]
Hmph.

348
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,791
[ZANDEH]
Daryun!

349
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,833

[ZANDEH groaning]

352
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,833
--[ZANDEH panting]
--[FARANGIS] Disgraceful.

353
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,083
[DARYUN] Forgive me!
I can't apologize enough.

354
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,458
I am ashamed to have
placed you in such danger!

355
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,833
[ARSLAN] It's quite
all right. I am unhurt.

356
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,541
Due to Elam's speed,
so thank you.

357
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,375
Oh, it was nothing.

358
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,166
How many times have
you saved me, Daryun?

359
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,583
Is it so terrible if I return
the favor once in a while?

360
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:17,750
[ARSLAN]
Where has Gieve gone?

361
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,833
[ELAM]
Uh?!

362
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,958
[GIEVE]
Dearest mistress of my heart!

363
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,041
I've been sleepless
with worry for you

364
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,166
every night since
we parted ways.

365
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,125
And I have no doubt
that you were suffering

366
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,583
in a similar fashion.

367
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,833
[FARANGIS] On the contrary,
my nights were untroubled.

368
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,958
You are the sort of man
who will always survive,

369
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,166
even if it means cheating
the gods themselves.

370
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,333
[GIEVE]
You know me well!

371
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,291
You must also know
if it meant seeing you,

372
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,208
I would happily cheat
the gods five times over.

373
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,291
[sighs]

374
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,125
I'm glad we were able
to meet up again.

375
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,458
It wasn't the same without
you. I need you by my side.

376
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,041
It's kind of you
to say so. My thanks.

377
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,750
[ARSLAN]
Heh.

378
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,291
[DARYUN]
The throne doesn't matter.

379
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,750
[DARYUN] It is for the sake
of this young man himself

380
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,875
that I will continue
to wield my sword.

381
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,416
[NARRATOR] Silver Mask's heart
brims with loathing for Arslan.

382
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,291
If hatred alone could kill,

383
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,125
the prince would be in
grave danger, indeed.

384
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,208
Next time, "Two Princes."

385
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,250
And thus would the
boy become a king.
