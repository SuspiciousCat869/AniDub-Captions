[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 320. Winter.

2
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,583
Led by Narsus, the Parsian
army defeated Rajendra,

3
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,250
the Second Prince of Sindhura,

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:48,083
who had crossed the border into
Pars with an army at his back.

5
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,041
Rajendra was marched into
Peshawar as a captive,

6
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,000
but Arslan welcomed
him as a guest

7
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:56,833
and the two men entered
into an alliance.

8
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,166
Thus it was that the two armies
departed for Sindhura,

9
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,041
launching a campaign to
challenge Rajendra's brother,

10
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,875
the kingdom's First
Prince, Gadhevi.

11
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,458
[ALFARID]
Nice try! Don't think so!

[SOLDIERS yelling]

13
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,041
[RAJENDRA]
Ah.

14
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,250
[PARS SOLDIERS cheering]

15
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,250
[RAJENDRA]
Prince Arslan.

16
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,833
Well done.

17
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,500
Once again, I am impressed by
the strength of your soldiers.

18
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,625
[ARSLAN]
That's kind of you.

19
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,333
[RAJENDRA]
I found Lord Daryun's valor

20
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,291
to be particularly magnificent.

21
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,541
Yes. I have better
companions than I deserve.

22
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,916
On the contrary,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that such people follow you
must be seen as proof

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,166
of your able leadership
and noble character.

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,083
I only regret I was
not able to see

26
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,958
Lord Kishward's prowess
in battle, as well.

27
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,000
I have heard much about the
Twin-Blade General's skill...

28
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,291
Listen to him.

29
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,791
I just cannot bring
myself to trust that man.

30
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,125
You're not alone in that.

31
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,625
I wonder what sort of
deception he has planned.

32
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,250
I do hope it's inventive.

33
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,583
[RAJENDRA laughing]

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,000
[MAHENDRA]
I have a task for you.

35
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,875
You will feign
support of Rajendra

36
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,750
in order to join his army.

37
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,833
[JASWANT]
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,833
It will be a
dangerous assignment,

39
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,541
but you must halt their
advance at all costs.

40
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,958
Do you understand?

41
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
Yes, Your Excellency.

42
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,583
My entire life, you have
been as a father to me.

43
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,958
Ask, and that life is yours.

44
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,500
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 321.

45
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,208
Arslan and his companions
welcomed the new year

46
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,750
in the wastelands
of western Sindhura.

47
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,500
They conducted the
new year's ceremony

48
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,125
in the Parsian tradition,

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,416
with Arslan standing
as the king's proxy.

50
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
[PARS SOLDIERS]
Arslan! Arslan!

51
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,333
The star shining in the heavens!

52
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,541
The favorite of the gods!

53
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,166
With your wisdom
and your strength,

54
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,125
may you bring peace and
prosperity to our kingdom

55
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,000
and all its people
in the coming year!

56
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,375
[GIEVE]
Alas.

57
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:00,041
Even the wine in my cup
holds no power anymore.

58
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,458
This may as well be water,

59
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,541
for only a glimpse of your
beauty can intoxicate me.

60
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,875
No, from the sound of it,

61
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,333
the wine seems to be doing
its job most adequately.

62
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,750
Here, you must be hungry.

63
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,500
[ELAM growling]

64
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,666
Please. I can eat
without your help.

65
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,500
I want to! Ahhh!

66
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,875
Can you not see that
you're irritating him?

67
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,083
Oh, please. Off with you.
You're not needed here.

68
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,791
You can both go.

69
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,583
The finest tactician
in the kingdom,

70
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
and he's helpless
against two children.

71
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,416
Glad to see you
as always, Azrael.

72
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,125
This is unexpected.

73
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,583
[RAJENDRA]
Whoa!

74
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:54,916
Prince Arslan! I come to pay
my respects upon the new year!

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,541
[ARSLAN]
Kind of you to take the trouble.

76
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,541
[RAJENDRA]
Mm.

77
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,750
And I am glad to
see your soldiers

78
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,166
enjoying their celebrations

79
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,208
though they are
so far from home.

80
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,291
And since I'm here, my friend
and brother-at-heart,

81
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,791
there is something I
would discuss with you.

82
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,833
If you have a moment to spare.

83
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,875
What is it you wish to discuss?

84
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,000
Rajendra's soldiers
and ours would continue

85
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,208
on different paths so that
we can strike Gadhevi's forces

86
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,375
from two directions?

87
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,708
[ARSLAN]
Yes, or at least,

88
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,708
that is the strategy that
Rajendra has proposed.

89
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,083
What say you?

90
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,125
[DARYUN] I mislike that man.
He is not to be trusted.

91
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,750
I advise that you decline.

92
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,750
I am afraid I must
agree with you.

93
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,666
No doubt the prince
proposed this plan

94
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,666
because he intends to
use our army as a decoy.

95
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,291
Would you not agree with my
assessment, Mistress Farangis?

96
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,583
Though it pains me, I do.

97
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,791
Rajendra is considering
his interests alone.

98
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,250
He will be best served if
we can draw attention away

99
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,041
from his army.

100
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:58,541
[ARSLAN] I'd feared you
would say as much.

101
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,416
I would hear your
thoughts, too, Narsus.

102
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,416
Your Highness, first, I
offer my congratulations.

103
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,708
[ARSLAN]
What?

104
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,458
[NARSUS] Well, it must
be a relief to learn

105
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,166
that none among your closest
advisors is a gullible fool.

106
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,125
It is just as you all have said.

107
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,833
Prince Rajendra intends
to advance his own cause

108
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,000
by using us as a decoy.

109
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,958
That said, I actually believe
you should agree to his plan.

110
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,166
[ARSLAN]
Why do you say that?

111
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,791
We can say with some certainty

112
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,750
that the prince
means to deceive us.

113
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:30,375
As such, it is better for us to
operate at a distance from him,

114
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,125
where we will have more freedom.

115
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,625
[ARSLAN]
That makes sense.

116
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
[NARSUS] But you should lay down
conditions when you agree.

117
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,416
Provisions, the oxen
to transport them, maps,

118
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,291
and a guide who can be trusted.

119
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,666
Make those your requirements.

120
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,833
[JASWANT] Pardon me. I was
sent by Prince Rajendra.

121
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,666
I am Jaswant, Your Highness.

122
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,041
the prince has selected me
for the honor of serving

123
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,416
as your guide.

124

Please, be welcome.

125

Jaswant, is it?

126
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,541
[JASWANT]
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,000
If you wish it, I shall go
to the front of the army,

128
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,041
that I might direct its course.

129
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,041
Uh.

They remain active
during winter,

00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,666
so it is best to be on
your guard at all times.

135
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, thank you. I'll remember.

136
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,416
[JASWANT] If you'll excuse me.
I'll be about my duties.

A fine way to welcome
a man. Who might you be?

[GIEVE] Sorry, target
practice. My hand slipped.

I'm Gieve, resident minstrel.
And what is your purpose here?

141
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,000
[JASWANT] I was sent to serve
as a guide to your army.

142
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,708
[GIEVE]
Hmm. Were you, indeed?

143
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,750
You're good with a sword
for a simple guide.

144
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,916
Now, if you'll excuse me.

145
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,583
[DARYUN]
That is no ordinary soldier.

146
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,041
Damn Rajendra.

147
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,166
Is he planning to
harm His Highness?

148
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,375
Yes, it is a possibility.

149
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,333
[NARSUS] Your Highness,
that is the Fortress of Gujarat.

150
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,041
There are a number of ways
that we might take it.

151
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,458
However, we cannot spare
much time in doing so.

152
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,958
Then, what do you advise?

153
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,083
I think our first step
should be sending an envoy.

154
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,458
Let us explore the possibility
of passing through

155
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,083
without a fight.

156
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,583
He's handsome for a foreigner.

[GIEVE chuckling]

160
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,708
Lord Fortress Commander Gauvin!
Make your obeisance.

161
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,125
So, the Parsians
have sent envoys.

162
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,250
Sir, my name is Gieve.

163
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,500
I am Jaswant, Lord Commander.

164
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,791
[GAUVIN]
Why have you come here?

165
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,875
[GIEVE]
We have come seeking a truce.

166
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,125
We ask that you grant the
Parsian army permission to pass.

167
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,541
[GAUVIN]
Do you know what you ask?

168
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,083
I could never justify
a truce to Prince Gadhevi.

169
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,708
He would have my head.

170
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,916
Naturally, we know
there are risks.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,208
But once Prince Rajendra
has taken the throne,

172
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,791
he will be able to properly
demonstrate his gratitude

173
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,250
for such a service.

174
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,083
Whether you desire land or rank,

175
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,041
he assures me you will
be well rewarded.

176
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,416
[GIEVE]
What say you?

177
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,833
I must consider this further.

178
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,041
Very well.

179
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,041
Give us your answer tomorrow.

180
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,791
We look forward to
a favorable reply.

181
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,958
We've prepared a small
banquet to welcome you.

182
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,875
Come, let us show these
men our hospitality.

183
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,166
If you will please
follow us, Master Envoy.

184
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,083
Are you thirsty? We have
the most excellent wine.

185
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,958
And will you ladies
stay by my side

186
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,958
to do me the honor
of filling my cup?

187
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,875
Yes, it would be our pleasure.

188
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,583
We have food as well as drink.

189
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:38,625
[ALL chatting]

190
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,583
[GAUVIN]
What answer shall we give them?

191
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,583
[TAARA] If Pars is
siding with Rajendra,

192
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,083
as it appears they are,

193
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,625
that gives him the advantage
in the fight for the throne.

194
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,041
In which case...

195
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,791
That is true, but if we
support him and he doesn't win,

196
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,291
we'll be traitors.

197
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,875
If we don't agree, we'll have
to fight the Parsian army.

198
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,916
--[knocking]
--Hm?

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,125
Excuse me, sirs.

200
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,166
We didn't think to see
you again so soon.

201
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,958
Is something the matter?

202
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
[JASWANT] I wish to
discuss something with you.

203
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,833
But first, please look at this.

204
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,583
Sir, that appears to be the
signature of Lord Mahendra,

205
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,916
advisor to First Prince Gadhevi.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,166
[GAUVIN]
Do you care to explain this?

207
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,875
As you've seen, I answer
to Lord Mahendra.

208
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,708
It is at his command
that I came here,

209
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,541
as he has charged me with
halting Rajendra's advance.

210
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,708
You should be aware. The man
Gieve plays you false.

211
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,208
He has made nothing
but empty promises.

212
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,291
Lying rat!

213
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,875
But I may have solution.

214
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,833
[JASWANT] The Parsians
sent envoys as a diversion.

215
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,583
Their strategy
is to distract you

216
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,458
with the request for a truce.

217
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,583
They will use the time
you spend deliberating,

218
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,250
to bring the army past
the Fortress unnoticed.

219
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,333
Shameless sneaks!

220
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,875
Only cowards would
plan such a ruse!

221
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
Where is that deceitful dog?

222
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,666
We'll see how the Parsians
feel when I cut off his head

223
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,166
and hang it at the gates!

224
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,333
[JASWANT]
If you will but wait.

225
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,916
The Parsian army is strong,

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,750
it would be better not
to confront them directly.

227
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,333
[GAUVIN]
Then, what are you suggesting?

228
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,208
We will outsmart them instead.

229
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,625
The Parsian column
is led by the cavalry,

230
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,375
who make up the main force.

231
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,416
At the rear is
the provisions team.

232
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,958
That is where we should strike.

233
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,291
The loss of supplies
will halt their advance,

234
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,000
and our casualties
will be minimal.

235
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,750
I will ride with them
and await the proper time.

236
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,208
At my signal, you will attack.

237
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,083
[GIEVE] I always find you
skulking about on your own.

238
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,250
What a lonely little
life you must lead.

239
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,750
[JASWANT]
You followed me?

240
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,625
The Black Cat of Sindhura.
That's what they call you, yes?

241
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,125
Well, kitty, I'm here to
clip those claws of yours

242
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,000
before they can do any damage.

243
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,375
[JASWANT] So you've known
who I am all along.

244
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,625
[GIEVE] Our Master Tactician
always seems to know more

245
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,500
than any man has a right to.

246
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,250
[GAUVIN]
Why has he not signaled yet?

247
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,000
Before long they will have
passed by the fortress entirely.

248
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,541
Can't wait any longer.
Launch the attack!

249
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,958
[GUJARAT SOLDIERS yelling]

250
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,000
[GAUVIN]
Target the supply wagons!

251
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,500
We're under attack!

252
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,416
Damn! Those aren't
supply wagons at all!

253
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,875
We've been trick--!

254
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,500
Cowardly dogs!

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,458
[yells]

256
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,916
[GUJARAT SOLDIER F]
Lord Gauvin!

257
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,333
We were tricked. I'm sorry, men.

258
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,250
Circle around!

259
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,250
The Parsian boy-prince!

260
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,291
For this, you die!

261
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,250
On your right!

262
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
[GUJARAT SOLDIER J]
Lord Gauvin is dead!

263
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,458
[GUJARAT SOLDIER I]
Quick! Retreat!

264
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,291
It should not be long now.

265
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,083
[GIEVE]
This battle is over.

266
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,333
The Fortress Commander is dead.

267
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,708
Will you surrender?

268
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,666
You were holding back earlier.

269
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,958
Do I seem the type who
enjoys giving up his secrets?

270
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,250
[ARSLAN]
Well done.

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,958
[ARSLAN]
Tell me something.

272
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,041
Did you mean to betray
me from the beginning?

273
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,500
"Betray?" That word
doesn't apply.

274
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,250
I am a Sindhuran!

275
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,333
I followed the Grand Vizier's
orders as they were given to me.

276
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,875
It is not you to
whom I am loyal.

277
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,333
I assume you are sworn
to Prince Gadhevi?

278
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,750
[JASWANT]
No.

279
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,958
I obey Lord Mahendra,
the Grand Vizier of Sindhura,

280
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,208
who has been as a father to me.

281
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,041
Pardon, Highness,
but I would be happy

282
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,041
to permanently silence
this wretch's babbling.

283
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,458
Have patience, Gieve.

284
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,791
I wish to speak with
him a bit longer.

285
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,458
Jaswant, how is the Grand
Vizier like a father to you?

286
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,791
He raised me.

287
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,000
I was an orphan and never
knew who my father was.

288
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,333
But a man took me in
and cared for me.

289
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,833
That man was Lord Mahendra.

290
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,208
I would give my life for him.

291
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,916
Never knowing your own father.
That must've been difficult.

292
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,791
Now. End my life swiftly.
I am ready for it.

293
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,666
Certainly. I'm happy to oblige.

294
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,625
Hold your sword.

295
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,208
Untie him. I wish
this man released.

296
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,500
[gasps]

297
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,333
[GIEVE]
I suspected you might say that.

298
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,416
If Your Highness bids me,
I must of course obey.

299
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,541
We shall set the Black Cat free.

300
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,625
I hope we don't regret it.

301
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,541
For what it's worth, I think
you're being too soft,

302
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,083
but it is done.

303
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,791
And whatever harm may
result from this fit of mercy,

304
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,000
I suspect we can overcome.

305
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,416
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.

306
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,416
[ALFARID] I shall prepare
Narsus's meal tonight.

307
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,708
No, I will do it.

308
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,666
I know his preferences
better than you do.

309
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,666
I've spent years seeing to his
nutritional and culinary needs.

310
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,625
Ha, ha. Do you think
he'd rather have

311
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,500
a pretty girl cook for
him or a scrawny boy?

312
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,083
What do you say, Narsus?

313
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,708
[ELAM]
Whose food would you like?

314
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:36,791
[NARSUS] Uh. I can't decide, so
I'll sample both of your dishes.

315
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,583
Will that be satisfactory?

316
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,666
Yes!

317
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,416
I will prepare
your meal immediately.

318
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,708
I know you'll love it!

319
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,500
Ha! I'm sure Lord Narsus
will swiftly realize

320
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,500
that he needs no other
cooking than mine.

321
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,208
[ALFARID]
We'll see about that!

322
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,250
[groans]

323
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,666
[DARYUN chuckling]

324
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,791
You saw all that?

325
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,041
Yes. I found it
most entertaining.

326
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,208
[NARSUS grunts]

327
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,000
Ah, do not glare so.

328
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,791
Oh, foolish Elam.

329
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:04,000
He can still behave like
such a child at times.

330
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,458
[DARYUN]
He is a good boy, though.

331
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,875
And someday, when
Prince Arslan is king,

332
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,791
Elam will be at his
side to advise him.

333
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,166
And if you ask me,

334
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,208
Pars will be fortunate
to have them at the helm.

335
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,708
Agreed.

336
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,333
I only hope it will come to
pass before a decade is up.

337
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,583
Though, in all likelihood,

338
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,875
the prince is not
Adragoras' son,

339
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,458
and does not belong
to Pars' royal line.

340
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,666
That is true.

341
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,875
He must be aware
of it, as well.

342
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,875
[NARSUS] Nevertheless, I fully
believe he should become king,

343
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,958
for the sake of
Pars and her people.

344
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,833
Yes. As do I.

345
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,958
[GADHEVI] How could Gujarat have
fallen in a mere three days?

346
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,625
These Parsians must
be powerful indeed.

347
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,166
Forgive me, Prince Gadhevi,

348
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,583
but I believe the time has come
for us to ride against them.

349
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,333
Our troop strength is
still superior to theirs,

350
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,708
even with the combined force
of the two opposing armies.

351
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:11,541
And we mustn't forget that
we have the war elephants.

352
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,458
You are right. I had forgotten.

353
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,541
Even the vaunted
commander Andragoras

354
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,208
would not triumph against
the war elephants.

355
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,166
What hope could a boy
such as Arslan have?

356
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,000
[chuckling]

357
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,750
[roaring]

358
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,291
[ARSLAN]
It was reckless,

359
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,750
allowing Jaswant
to go free as I did.

360
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,541
But like him, I do not
know whose son I am.

361
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,208
[DARYUN]
Your Highness.

362
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,458
Perhaps you ought to
retire for the night.

363
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,875
The winter air has
a chill up here.

364
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,416
[ARSLAN]
Daryun.

365
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,708
Who am I? Do you know?

366
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,958
All I know... is that
I'm not of roya--

367
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:49,833
Please stop there,
Your Highness.

368
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,875
If you'd like, I will
tell you who you are.

369
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,625
Yes, please tell me.

370
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,833
You are my leader
and my liege lord.

371
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:02,666
You are the man for whom
I would gladly give my life.

372
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,833
Can that not be enough
for now, Your Highness?

373
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,625
[ARSLAN] Perhaps it can,
Daryun. Thank you.

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,625
[NARRATOR]
Magnificent and invincible,

375
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:33,625
the war elephants descend
upon the Parsian army.

376
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,875
What soldiers could stand
against such fearsome beasts?

377
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,458
Next time: "Elegy for
the Setting Sun."

378
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,458
And thus would the
boy become a king.
