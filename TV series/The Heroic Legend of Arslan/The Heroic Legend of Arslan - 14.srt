00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:37,041
[NARRATOR] Pars Era,
the year 320. December.

2
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:41,166
Arslan had finally arrived at
the border citadel of Peshawar.

3
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,041
Finding the Crown Prince
on the battlements unguarded,

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:47,041
Hilmes took the
opportunity to attack.

5
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,083
[ARSLAN grunting]

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,541
Your Highness!

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,666
If you kill him, Daryun,

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,625
the true bloodline of Pars's
royal family dies, too.

9
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,875
[NARRATOR] Veteran general
Bahman saved Arslan

10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,125
from Hilmes's sword.

11
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,083
However, he pled for
the masked man's life,

12
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:17,041
and his dying words were
as sharp as any blade.

13
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,041
Amidst the chaos
came a startling report.

14
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:24,041
Sindhura, to the east,
had launched an invasion.

15
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,250
[RAJENDRA]
I will not be outshone

16
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,291
by First Prince Gadhevi.

17
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,083
His will not be
the name celebrated

18
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,916
throughout all of Sindhura.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,125
That honor will be mine!

20
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,916
[KISHWARD] We are working
with rough estimates,

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,041
but we believe the Sindhuran
army numbers 50 thousand.

22
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,208
They have already crossed
the river at the border,

23
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,416
and are officially
on Parsian soil.

24
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,625
Excellent.

25
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,666
How much bad luck
is going to find us?

26
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,291
We have enough to
see to as it is.

27
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:36,708
[NARSUS]
Your Highness.

28
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,625
[ARSLAN]
Uh.

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,333
Oh, apologies.

30
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,291
If you aren't feeling
well, get some rest.

31
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,083
We can handle matters here.
I will keep you informed.

32
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,583
[ARSLAN]
Thank you.

33
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,666
I'm well enough, I assure you.

34
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,583
[BAHMAN]
If you kill him, Daryun,

35
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,416
the true bloodline of Pars's
royal family dies, too.

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,875
Everyone, on to business.

37
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,166
We will retake
the Royal Capital,

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,750
but before we can do that,
we must defend our border.

39
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,541
We will make a stand
against Sindhura.

40
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,583
[RAJENDRA]
Ah!

41
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,500
Feel how cold it is.

42
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Frozen rain? It must be
what they call "snow."

43
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,500
[RAJENDRA'S ADJUTANT]
Pardon me, Prince Rajendra,

44
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,875
but are you certain
it was prudent

45
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,583
for us to launch this invasion?

46
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,375
[RAJENDRA]
Certainly I'm certain.

47
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,375
Matters within the borders of
Pars are in disarray just now.

48
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,166
This is a golden opportunity.

49
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,666
[RAJENDRA'S ADJUTANT]
Unfortunately,

50
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,041
matters within our own borders
are in disarray, as well.

51
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,791
For you to absent yourself from
the kingdom at such a grave time

52
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,333
given the health
of King Karikala.

53
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,416
You're worried about Gadhevi.

54
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,458
There is no need.
I am definitely not.

55
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,458
The First Prince? Hah!

56
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,208
He was born one measly month
earlier than I. One month!

57
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,791
What should a handful
of weeks matter

58
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:07,250
when I am clearly more capable
of ruling than he could ever be?

59
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,625
Your Highness!

60
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,000
Now.

61
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,750
Let us find that Parsian
prince and cut off his head.

62
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,666
That should prove
a worthy trophy.

63
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
[RAJENDRA laughing]

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,125
[DARYUN]
Your Highness.

65
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,250
All is ready.

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,250
Battle preparations
are now complete.

67
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,750
We shall be leaving.

68
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,666
[ARSLAN]
I see. But...

69
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,208
Something wrong?

70
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,750
Should I not come with you?

71
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,875
I know we decided
against it, but...

72
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,041
I feel like I would be
breaking faith with the men

73
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,458
if I stayed behind.

74
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,833
I'm their prince.

75
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,500
There must be
something I can do.

76
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,916
[NARSUS]
Your Highness.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,833
You are now the
leader of an army.

78
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,625
There are tens of thousands
of men at your command.

79
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,791
There is no need for you
to take to the battlefield

80
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,250
for every engagement.

81
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,791
Are you sure?

82
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,625
[DARYUN] Please trust us to
command the men in your place.

83
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,083
I feel I can promise
a favorable outcome.

84
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,500
Yes, of course.

85
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,041
You have my trust.
Please do as you see fit.

86
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,583
[DARYUN]
That was it?

87
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,416
I assumed it was yesterday's
events that were on his mind.

88
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,416
[NARSUS]
Well, can we truly blame him

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,958
if he wishes to avoid
thinking about it?

90
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,375
He fears failing to ride
forth for every battle

91
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,250
would break faith with his men.

92
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,666
Hah.

93
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,541
That is not a sentiment
one often hears from a ruler.

94
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,666
Nobody could ever doubt
that he has a kind heart.

95
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,500
However, it takes more than
kindness to rule a kingdom.

96
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,791
Does it, though?

97
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,125
[DARYUN]
Hm?

98
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,166
[NARSUS] We follow him
because of the man he is.

99
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,041
Because he is just,
and hopeful, and kind.

100
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,041
There are worse things
that could happen to Pars

101
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,500
than to be ruled by a kind king.

102
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,208
I can't argue that.

103
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,625
Now, let's be off.

104
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,666
I made a promise to His
Highness, and I plan to keep it.

105
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,166
[SORCERER chuckles]

106
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,000
[SORCERER]
Unfortunate prince.

107
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,708
He seems to encounter one
obstacle after another.

108
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,916
One could almost pity him.

109
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,041
Are you certain leaving
now is the best course?

110
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,541
Daryun and Narsus
have left Arslan.

111
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,583
With his closest
advisors off at battle,

112
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,791
we have the perfect
chance to kill him.

113
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,458
I said we're returning
to Ecbatana.

114
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,250
[SORCERER chuckles]

115
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Then return we shall.

116
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,958
About time for us to part ways.

117
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,916
We'll be going
ahead, as planned.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,708
Good luck, though I
know you don't need it.

119
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,083
[DARYUN] Perhaps you could
answer a question for me.

120
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,416
[NARSUS]
And what is that?

121
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,458
[DARYUN] The invading army
numbers 50 thousand men.

122
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,291
We're riding to meet
them with ten thousand.

123
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,791
[NARSUS]
Yes.

124
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,416
We're attempting to defeat
an army five times our strength.

125
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
Is that not unorthodox?

126
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,375
Often, the unorthodox strategies
are the the best ones.

127
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,541
Think on it.

128
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,625
Remember what you
learned while in Serica.

129
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,750
I know you were taught
about the three factors

130
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,833
one must be mindful of in war.

131
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,291
What are they?

132
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,958
Terrain's advantage. Heaven's
time. People's harmony.

133
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,916
That is what this is about.
Those three factors.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,166
With this invasion,
Sindhura ignores all three.

135
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,500
[RAJENDRA'S ADJUTANT]
Your Highness,

136
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,083
the hour is growing late.

137
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,125
Should we begin looking for
a place to make our camp?

138
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,333
No. We continue
over the mountains.

139
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,333
But, Highness,

140
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,333
our men and horses
are exhausted.

141
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,875
The cold is beginning
to take its toll.

142
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,541
All the more reason
to push on then.

143
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,875
The movement will
keep their blood warm.

144
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,208
We need only clear this pass
and we'll be at Peshawar's door!

145
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,500
Then we shall--

[SINDHURAN SOLDIERS yelling]

147
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,250
It's an attack!

Fortunately, I expected
this. Forward!

151
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,375
[NARSUS]
Three factors.

152
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,250
Let us now consider
each of them.

153
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,916
Starting with time.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,375
The Sindhurans are
from the south,

155
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,041
with its perpetual summer.

156
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,541
So how well will they fight

157
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,208
in snow-covered mountains
in mid-winter?

158
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,500
You think to invade my domain?

159
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,541
I'll send you back
where you came from.

160
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,541
If you live through the night!

161
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,666
Stand strong!

162
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,166
Let's teach these Parsian dogs
what true valor looks like!

163
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,416
Then we have terrain.

164
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,500
And so the trap closes.

165
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,125
They've got us
flanked. Fall back!

166
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,875
[NARSUS] We are intimately
familiar with the land of Pars,

167
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,625
but to the Sindhurans,
it is relatively unknown.

168
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,750
Now, begin the charge.

169
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,000
Yashasuiin!

170
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
Push them back!

171
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,166
You call yourselves
men of Sindhura?!

172
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,166
Trying to push back
by main force?

173
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,500
This general is
an arrogant one.

174
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,291
You thought you had us!

175
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,416
Your sneaky tactics won't make
my men turn tail and run!

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,750
[NARSUS]
Hmph. A confident man indeed,

177
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,750
to invade when both
time and terrain

178
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,041
are undoubtedly
against him.

179
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,666
However, there remains
our third factor.

180
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,666
The people.

181
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,416
We have them! Keep pushing!

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,625
Those shots came from behind.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,583
There are more Parsians?

184
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,041
No. I think those
are Sindhurans.

185
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,666
It's true. Just look
at the banner.

186
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,500
[SINDHURAN SOLDIER P] Yes!
It's Prince Gadhevi's standard.

187
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,833
But what is the First
Prince doing here?

188
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,750
They could be here
as reinforcements--?

189
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,666
More arrow fire.

190
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,666
They aren't here to aid us.

191
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,541
[SINDHURAN SOLDIER Q]
Your Highness!

192
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,041
What's happening out there?

193
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,041
[SINDHURAN SOLDIER Q] It appears
to be Prince Gadhevi, sir.

194
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,750
He's come with an
army at his back,

195
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,625
and they're attacking our rear.

196
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,833
Impossible!

197
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,250
He shouldn't know I am here.

198
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,250
I did not make my
intentions known.

199
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,250
Perhaps not, but the First
Prince is treacherous.

200
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,791
I would not be surprised to
learn he had been spying on us.

201
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,458
Surely not.

202
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,750
Everyone, go around to the left!

203
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,125
Gadhevi's men are
closing in on us!

204
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,708
What're you doing? To the left!

205
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,875
Pushing out front will just
get us killed more quickly!

206
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,333
I'm pleased to see
the deception working.

207
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,833
Even given the new moon,

208
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,083
I doubt these soldiers would
normally be so easy to fool

209
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,500
as they've proved tonight.

210
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,833
Fortunately for us,

211
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,166
two Sindhuran princes are
fighting over succession

212
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,791
to the throne.

213
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,250
These soldiers carry the
uneasiness of that conflict

214
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,541
in their hearts.

215
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,875
Strike them in the right place,

216
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,250
and they will break
with little effort.

217
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,500
[DARYUN]
The third factor: The people.

218
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,125
[NARSUS] We have nearly
maneuvered them into place.

219
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,208
A few moments more.

220
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,083
Now! How can a smaller
force best a larger?

221
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,791
Ride with me and
have your answer!

222
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,041
[DARYUN]
Hiyah!

223
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:18,583
[SINDHURAN SOLDIERS yelling]

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What is that? Do you hear it?

225
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,625
[RAJENDRA] The ground.
It's cracking! But how?

226
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,250
[RAJENDRA]
Run! Everyone!

227
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,583
Get away from here!
It's going to--

228
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,291
Yes, terribly sorry.

229
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,750
That's the trouble
with frozen lakes.

230
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,000
A nightmare.

231
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,416
This cannot truly be happening.

232
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,083
[NARSUS]
I have a message of some urgency

233
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,125
for Prince Rajendra.

234
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,500
Where is His Highness?

235
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,500
[RAJENDRA] The prince
fights beside his men.

236
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,916
What is your message?

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,500
This is him, the man we seek.

238
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,666
What?

239
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,250
I am afraid for you
the battle is over.

240
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,083
You'll be coming with us.

241
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,750
You will not survive
our next encounter!

242
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,000
[ALFARID]
You're a very pretty man.

243
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,625
But one move,
and I will kill you.

244
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,208
[RAJENDRA chuckles]

245
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,083
I can admit when
I've been beaten.

246
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,250
You have outwitted
me brilliantly.

247
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,000
[ARSLAN] You took him, Alfarid?
That was quite well done.

248
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,541
Me? I did nothing.

249
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,750
We succeeded thanks
to Lord Narsus's genius.

250
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,208
[ELAM]
Hmph.

251
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,250
[RAJENDRA] I'd heard the
Parsian prince was small,

252
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,750
but I thought the reports
were exaggerated.

253
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,916
Well, then,

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,833
what plans do you
have in store for me?

255
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:33,458
Will you make an example by
executing me in front of my men?

256
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,416
No, Prince Rajendra.

257
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm Arslan, Crown
Prince of Pars.

258
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,416
And this is Peshawar Citadel.

259
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,541
I realize the means
was somewhat crude,

260
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,041
but I needed to invite you here,

261
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,291
as I wished to speak with you
in person about something.

262
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,500
[RAJENDRA]
Crude? I'll say.

263
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,000
In my country, an invitation
does not often involve

264
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,208
being tied up and hauled away.

265
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,666
Of course not.

266
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,916
You've my deepest apologies.

267
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,750
Perhaps now it will
be easier for us

268
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:12,208
to talk to one
another as equals.

269
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,875
Yes, as equals.

270
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,583
I am willing to hear
what you have to say.

271
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,791
You may find our hospitality
is somewhat limited,

272
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,583
being in the
borderlands as we are.

273
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,208
It will do.

274
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,500
That's quite good.

275
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,916
Borderlands or no,
this is delicious.

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,166
We don't have anything
like it in Sindhura.

277
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,291
Please. Be welcome, all.
Eat and drink your fill.

278
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,083
[ALL]
Hear, hear!

279
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,333
[NARSUS]
Well said, Your Highness!

280
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,166
[GIEVE]
I am famished!

281
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,958
[RAJENDRA]
Prince Arslan.

282
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,875
I had been told you
were still a child,

283
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,458
but your leadership
earlier was brilliant.

284
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,541
You outwitted me.

285
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,208
That is no small feat.

286
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,541
Alas, I cannot claim the
credit for our victory.

287
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,291
[ARSLAN] I was aided by
my friends, as I ever am.

288
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,166
Ah. You call them
friends, not subjects.

289
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,458
I find you a most
intriguing man.

290
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,583
Now, come. You must
drink as well.

291
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,000
I, uh, sure.

292
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,291
[FARANGIS]
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

293
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,333
I will keep our guest company.

294
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,666
Ah! Allow me!

295
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,416
Prince Rajendra, care
for some entertainment?

296
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,916
I believe a Minstrel's Song
would complement the wine

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,083
most perfectly.

298
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,333
No songs tonight.

299
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,208
I propose a drinking
contest, instead.

300
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,416
Wait, uh...

301
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,833
The two of you did me proud
on the battlefield today.

302
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,583
I'm only glad I could help.

303
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,666
Well, it was a simple mission.

304
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,000
I could've done it
alone just as easily.

305
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,541
You're the one we
could've done without,

306
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,125
but you always intrude
where you don't belong!

307
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,708
You're a fine one to
accuse me of being intrusive!

308
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,000
Now, run along!

309
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,583
Narsus and I are having
a private conversation.

310
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,416
[ALFARID, ELAM growling]

311
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,625
Can't you quit growling and make
an effort to like each other?

312
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,291
Oh, my head.

313
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,333
I can't.

314
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,541
A herd of water buffalo
is dancing in my head.

315
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,583
And singing, too, I think.

316
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,541
[RAJENDRA] Gods.
Someone I cannot out-drink?

317
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,333
Parsian women are not to be
taken lightly, it seems.

318
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Oh, your cup looks empty.

319
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,333
Please, allow me to fill it.

320
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,416
It's full enough.

321
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,625
[ARSLAN]
Prince Rajendra.

322
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,458
Yes! Prince Arslan,
how may I be of service?

323
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,833
Shall we continue
our earlier discussion?

324
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,750
Certainly! I would
like nothing more.

325
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,500
Except.

326
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,458
I can't quite recall what
we were talkin' about.

327
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,083
I would like to enter
into an alliance.

328
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,916
[RAJENDRA]
Ah.

329
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm listening.

330
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,208
My proposal is simple.

331
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,833
You're fighting to be recognized
as the Sindhuran heir.

332
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,583
I'd like to help you
achieve that goal.

333
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,041
And in exchange,

334
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,916
you would ask for my help
in your war with Lusitania.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,166
Yes.

336
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,458
It is a fair deal,
all things considered.

337
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,416
[RAJENDRA chuckles]

338
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
How will you hold
up your end of it?

339
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,750
You're a prince
without a kingdom.

340
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,833
I fail to see what
you can do to help me.

341
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,458
What did you say--?

342
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,375
That's not important
at the moment.

343
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,875
Now, I hate to be
indelicate, but I do hope

344
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,750
that you haven't forgotten
your current situation.

345
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,750
That sounded very
much like a threat.

346
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,791
Harming me would be most unwise.

347
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,166
I warn you, my men would not
suffer such an insult lightly.

348
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,458
I would not do
something so barbaric.

349
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,583
Especially when there's no need.

350
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,208
Not when you consider
the information

351
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,833
we've already given Sindhura.

352
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,375
Which would be?

353
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,625
[NARSUS] Why, that Crown
Prince Arslan of Pars

354
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,875
and Prince Rajendra of Sindhura
have formed an alliance

355
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,041
based upon friendship and
respect for each other's' goals.

356
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,250
[RAJENDRA]
But I haven't said--

357
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,916
[NARSUS] And furthermore,
that the Prince,

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,583
eager to bring peace and order
to the Kingdom of Sindhura,

359
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,375
has begun a march upon the
Royal Capital of Uraiyur.

360
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,708
Bastards! I can't
return home now.

361
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,416
They'll kill me for a traitor!

362
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,833
Rajendra.

363
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,166
You were always going to
challenge First Prince Gadhevi.

364
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,041
We have done nothing to
truly change your plans.

365
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,208
All we did was slightly
accelerate their unfolding.

366
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,083
[RAJENDRA gasps]

367
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,666
It is not what I wish,

368
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,333
but I could use you to negotiate
with Prince Gadhevi, instead.

369
00:20:52,708 --> 00:21:00,666
[laughing]

370
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,916
I am bested again. Pars has
a very clever prince.

371
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,500
Then we can expect
your cooperation?

372
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,875
Yes, you can.

373
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
Consider me your ally.

374
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,750
I shall aid you in the
defense of your kingdom.

375
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,250
[NARRATOR]
And so,

376
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:23,291
Arslan found his ever-shifting
fortunes changed once again.

377
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,958
Pars Era, the
year 320. December.

378
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,958
Leaving the defense of Peshawar
Citadel to Marzban Kishward,

379
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,083
Arslan joined his new ally,

380
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,791
accompanying Rajendra's
army as it began its march

381
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,750
toward Sindhura.

382
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,875
The path forward was uncertain.

383
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,583
Not knowing where it might lead,

384
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,125
the young prince had
to trust to fate.

385
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,500
[RAJENDRA] Well, Prince Arlsan,
what do you think of my men?

386
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,541
Are they not a sight to behold?

387
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,041
I'm sure they'll like you.

388
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,750
[laughing]

389
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,083
[DARYUN]
I don't like this.

390
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,791
Do you really think
we can trust that man?

391
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,916
[GADHEVI] I knew that my younger
brother was a fool, but this?

392
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,083
Allying himself with Pars?

393
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:48,041
Offering loyalty to some foreign
prince ahead of his own blood?

394
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,750
[MAHENDRA] It seems indisputable
proof that he has no intention

395
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,041
of acknowledging your
right to ascend the throne.

396
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:57,250
What do you wish to do?

397
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,416
What choice have we?

398
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,666
We'll destroy the
traitor Rajendra!

399
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,916
As the younger brother,

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,708
it is his duty to accept
my place as the heir.

401
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,208
Instead, he divides the kingdom!

402
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,916
[MAHENDRA]
It shall be as you wish it.

403
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,125
Indeed, I can bring
your brother to heel

404
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,791
more swiftly than you think.

405
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,583
Rajendra does not know it,

406
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,541
but I have already placed
one of my men in his ranks.

407
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,916
[NARRATOR]
Jaswant's piercing green eyes

408
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,416
shimmer with
intelligent ferocity.

409
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,583
Gieve's icy blue eyes shine with
mischief and reckless courage.

410
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,125
Next time: "The Black
Leopard of Sindhura."

411
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,000
And thus would the
boy become a king.
