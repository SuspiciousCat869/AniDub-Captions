1
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,458
What do you want?

2
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,333
[SORCERER A] You will have to
forgive me for remaining seated.

3
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,666
Raising that fog upon the Fields
of Atropatene was rather taxing.

4
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
I have yet to regain
my full strength.

5
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,125
[HILMES chuckles]
And?

6
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,958
What is so important you felt
the need to summon me here?

7
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,791
Kharlan is no longer
among the living.

8
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,125
It seems that he was killed
by Arslan's company.

9
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,375
If you ask me, he is to be
pitied for such a fate.

10
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,625
He went to his death
still marked as a coward

11
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,375
and a traitor to
the Kingdom of Pars.

12
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,833
[HILMES growls]

13
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,708
[SORCERER A] I will instruct my
disciples to continue to provide

14
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,416
you with such aid
as you may require.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
But do not misunderstand,
Lord Silver Mask.

16
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,458
The situation is more
complex than it may seem.

17
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,875
The sun over Pars does
not shine for you alone.

18
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,583
[NARRATOR] Kharlan's
dying words revealed that

19
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,166
King Andragoras yet lived.
Armed with this information,

20
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,291
Narsus and Daryun left
Arslan and Elam behind,

21
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,416
and infiltrated
the Royal Capital

22
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,250
in hopes of locating the king.

23
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,958
[NARSUS] The devastation
here is considerable.

24
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,208
Truly. I'm glad His Highness
isn't here to see this.

25
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:52,583
[INNOCENTIS panting]
Lady Tahamenay.

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,333
[INNOCENTIS chuckles]

27
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,875
[INNOCENTIS]
Are you well?

28
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,708
If you lack for anything, please
do not hesitate to tell me.

29
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,250
I would not leave you wanting.

30
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,541
[INNOCENTIS]
I have good tidings today,

31
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,583
and I could not resist
bringing them to you.

32
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,208
Well, you see, with the
dawning of the new year,

33
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,416
I anticipate being styled
emperor rather than king.

34
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,583
The Emperor of the
new Lusitanian Empire.

35
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,291
And that glad news brings me
to the reason for this visit,

36
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,708
my lady. The people believe

37
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,916
that an emperor must have
an empress beside him!

38
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,666
A sentiment with which
I cannot help but agree.

39
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,666
[INNOCENTIS] Is there
nothing I can get for you?

40
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,000
That heathen has not accepted

41
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,583
the divine grace of
the God of Yaldabaoth.

42
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,458
She should be burned to death!

43
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,291
Why will His Majesty not do so?

44
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,958
[growls]

45
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,083
[NARRATOR]
Innocentis the Seventh,

46
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,666
King of Lusitania, refused
to execute Andragoras,

47
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,750
the fallen King of Pars, or
Tahamenay, his heathen queen.

48
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,125
Archpriest Bodin lost patience
with his king's inaction

49
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:24,333
and turned his attention
to Pars's Royal Library.

50
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,958
He ordered the burning
of twelve million volumes

51
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,541
of rare historical texts
that were stored within.

52
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,916
[BODIN] Unleash the flames!
I'll see it all burned!

53
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,250
You can't! It's our
kingdom's history!

54
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,833
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
Stay back, you!

55
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,708
[BODIN]
Let the flames devour them!

56
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,916
These blasphemous,
heathen texts!

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,125
Feed the fire until
the very last volume

58
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,458
has been reduced
to ash and smoke!

59
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,208
[BODIN laughs]

60
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,708
[SOLDIER A]
Lord Archpriest?

61
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,958
[BODIN]
Huh?

62
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,791
[SOLDIER A] I understand
they're heathen texts.

63
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,833
But, should we consign them
to the flames unexamined?

64
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,375
They might contain
valuable information.

65
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,458
Perhaps if we were to
look through them--

66
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,791
[BODIN]
Blasphemer!

67
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,708
The world of man
needs no other text

68
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,458
save the holy book
of Yaldabaoth!

69
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,083
I will not preserve
words written

70
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,583
at the behest of the Devil!

71
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,333
[SOLDIER A] No, sir, but some
of those are medical te--

72
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,833
[BODIN]
Be silent!

73
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,750
Those whose hearts are pure
need not fear disease.

74
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,750
Their faith shall
safeguard them.

75
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,708
[SOLDIER A whimpers]

76
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,833
And if a person does fall ill,

77
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,166
clearly he harbors
evil within his heart,

78
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
and so he is punished by God!

79
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,500
[SOLDIER A screams]

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,791
[BODIN]
With the staff of disease,

81
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,416
God smites the arrogant.
No man is immune

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
from divine justice, be
he a peasant or a king!

83
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,958
His decisions shall be judged,
and if they are found lacking,

84
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,250
nothing will save him
from God's wrath!

85
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,083
If your heart is impure,
now is the time to repent!

86
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,666
[BODIN laughs]

87
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,500
It is one thing to steal
jewels and golden trinkets,

88
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,666
but to immolate
our very culture?

89
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,958
[DARYUN] The word "savage"
is too kind for them.

90
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,541
They're not even human.

91
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,791
[BODIN]
Burn it all!

92
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,666
This Archpriest Bodin
is mine to kill.

93
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,208
The rest I leave to you,

94
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,958
but I would like the pleasure
of destroying that creature.

95
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,041
Very well.

96
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,000
[GIEVE] Hello, my beauty!
I have returned.

97
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,500
Well? What is the situation
on the main road?

98
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,208
Painfully dull,
to be honest. Ah!

99
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,708
And I was just thinking that
I would love something to eat.

100
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,375
To imagine that you
would anticipate

101
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,500
my needs so accurately!

102
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,875
It seems like further
proof that we are linked

103
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,250
by some unseen thread.

104
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,666
Elam was the one
who prepared that.

105
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,875
Huh?

106
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,833
Enough of this. I shall
take over the watch.

107
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,166
Get some sleep.

108
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,750
[GIEVE] Please, Mistress,
that won't be necessary!

109
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,125
This is the only road
that leads to the village.

110
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,958
Standing watch over it
is no trouble at all.

111
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,250
Indeed, I have even
had sufficient time

112
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,166
to compose a poem that extols
your virtues, my beauty.

113
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,625
If you would but
listen a moment--

114
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,958
Where are you going?!

115
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,250
If you find it so easy, then
you can keep watch indefinitely.

116
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,666
But left alone, I fear
my poetic sentiments

117
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,250
would flow so freely
as to fill this forest.

118
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,958
It would be a shame to poison
all these lovely trees.

119
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,791
[ARSLAN] How do you think
they're faring?

120
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,041
Do you suppose they've
reached Ecbatana yet?

121
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,250
Likely so.

122
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,208
Surely nobody could
wish to locate

123
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,791
my Lord Father and
Lady Mother more than I do,

124
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,666
but to ride straight into
enemy-held territory?

125
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,875
That's horribly dangerous,
even for them.

126
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,125
[ELAM] You know how capable
they are, Highness.

127
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,583
I cannot imagine there
is any need for you

128
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,416
to fear for their safety.

129
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,625
Yes, I'm sure you're right.
And what of you, Elam?

130
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,916
Did you have any trouble
on your trip into the city?

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,458
[ELAM]
Uh!

132
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,166
Oh, no, none to speak of.

133
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,208
Unlike the others, I was in
no danger of being recognized.

134
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,833
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll fetch us some water.

135
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,416
Excellent. I'll come, too.

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,083
Uh. I think it's best for you
to wait inside, Your Highness.

137
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,625
But if you go all by yourself,

138
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
you will be forced to
make multiple trips.

139
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,041
And besides that,

140
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,708
I find it's more heartening
to travel in pairs.

141
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,083
Then I suppose
we'll go together.

142
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,458
[VILLAGERS murmuring]

143
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,041
[VILLAGER A]
Here you are.

144
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,583
We finally arrived
at Ecbatana.

145
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,083
And we get sent right back out
for the Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

146
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,083
Not surprising. They say
he's a real taskmaster.

147
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,791
He'll hear you!

148
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,791
[SOLDIER B grunts]
We can at least get some food

149
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,791
while we're in this village.

150
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,416
Keep movin'! We're hungry!

151
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,166
[VILLAGERS murmur]

152
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,125
There's no one in sight
right now. Let's be quick.

153
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,000
We're in luck,
Your Highness.

154
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,500
It doesn't seem
to've run dry yet.

155
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,666
There.

156
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,916

I'll admit, I didn't think you

207
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,833
[laughs] Well,
I managed somehow.

You don't even know your

I can tell you're just
as naïve as ever.

211
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:54,958
[ARSLAN]
Yes, well...

212
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,791
However. I must
apologize for my men.

213
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,583
[ARSLAN] Those men were
under your command?

214
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,291
Yes. I'm in charge
of a small company.

215
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,083
Things are a lot different
than the last time we met.

00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,208
You won't be making
any of us into slaves.

I wouldn't anyway, not ever.

You might not,

219
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,791
but I'm sure Andragoras
and Arslan would do it.

220
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,458
Those bastards are the ones
who lead the heathens, right?

221
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,041
I hear they even look evil,

222
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:24,208
with twisted horns, monstrous
mouths, and long, black tails!

223
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,791
[ÉTOILE] The ignorant Parsians
are going to have to repent.

224
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,125
You heathens must convert
to the Faith of Yaldabaoth.

225
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,458
If I were unable to
find it within myself

226
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,541
to believe in your god,
what would you do?

227
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,333
What? Such a thing
would be impossible.

228
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,708
Once you are touched
by the Faith,

229
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,541
you cannot help but
revel in its glory!

230
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,375
[NARSUS] Interestingly enough,
in Archaic Lusitanian

231
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,291
the original meaning
of "Yaldabaoth"

232
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
is "sacred ignorance."

233
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:56,625
[DARYUN]
Huh.

234
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,166
[NARSUS]
That is key, Daryun.

235
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,875
They did not invade simply
to conver heathens.

236
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,166
Apparently, their
holy book tells them

237
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,875
of a most abundant land.

238
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,583
A land that they believe
belongs to those who follow

239
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,416
the God of Yaldabaoth.

240
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,250
How utterly self-serving
of them. So, tell me this.

241
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,458
Just how sincere are they when
it comes to belief in their god

242
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,166
and adherence to his will?

243
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,041
You mean, is their
faith truly that strong,

244
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,791
or are they only
pretending it is

245
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,500
to justify their invasion
of other kingdoms?

246
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,583
If you sincerely believe
that all men are equal,

247
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,291
then why did you
invade Ecbatana?

248
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,666
Sorry?

249
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,208
You criticize Pars for
the institution of slavery,

250
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,958
but what then of your
kingdom's conduct

251
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,791
toward the people of
the Royal Capital?

Your ignorance is so
obvious it's almost painful!

00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,500
Parsians are heathens, so they
can be treated differently!

254
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,500
You do not deserve to shelter
beneath the hand of God.

You're beasts without rights.

Of course. What is it?

Uh!

[ÉTOILE] Read that. It will help
you to understand our faith.

280
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,458
[DARYUN]
I'd braced myself for it.

281
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,291
But actually seeing them
act as if this city is theirs

282
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,875
is different. I feel
defeated all over again.

283
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,500
So. How do we take
our city back?

284
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,375
One possible plan could
include freeing the slaves

285
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,791
all throughout Pars in
Prince Arslan's name,

286
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,416
and promising to abolish
slavery entirely.

287
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,666
Even if only one in
ten takes up arms,

288
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,791
we could form an army more than
five hundred thousand strong.

289
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,583
In that case,
it would be imperative

290
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,250
that we be self-sufficient.

291
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,166
[DARYUN]
That makes sense.

292
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,833
[NARSUS]
Obviously.

293
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,333
We couldn't very well expect the
support of vassals or nobles,

294
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,416
or other former slave owners.

295
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,625
Freeing the slaves
is only a start.

296
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,208
The act of emancipation
itself isn't the hardest bit.

297
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,833
It's what comes after
that will be complicated.

00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,416
What now?

311
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:31,041
Well, clearly I'm the
more attractive target.

312
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,833
[KHARLAN'S MAN B]
Hmph. I knew it. It's Narsus.

313
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,708
Thanks a lot, you bastards.

314
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,875
We're out in the cold
with no commander.

315
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,875
You're gonna die,
but before you do,

316
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,541
you'll tell us where
Prince Arslan is.

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIERS groaning]

318
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,416
[NARSUS] So you assumed
that, because I was alone,

319
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,041
I would be easily disposed of.

[whimpering]

321
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,166
Now it's your turn to
tell me something.

322
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,541
Where is King Andragoras?

323
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,500
Uh. I-I don't know!

324
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,666
Ah! I really don't know!
It's the truth, I swear!

325
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,041
I'd tell you if
I knew! I would!

326
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,333
Please, I don't wanna die!

327
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,666
Perhpas you've heard
nothing more than rumors.

328
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,833
Regardless, tell us,
for your own sake.

329
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,458
I have heard King
Andragoras is alive.

330
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,875
Yes, we know that much.

331
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,583
[KHARLAN'S MAN B] I guess
they've got him locked up

332
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,916
somewhere. Lord Kharlan
only told his closest Parsian

333
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,333
advisors about it, though.

334
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,625
In fact, none of the
Lusitanian generals

335
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,375
even know anything about it.

336
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,000
[NARSUS] And what
of Queen Tahamenay?

337
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,416
Now that's something
I do know.

338
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,000
She's to marry Innocentis,
the King of Lusitania.

339
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,083
I heard some Lusitanian
soldiers gossiping about it.

340
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,083
Saying the king is
quite infatuated.

341
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:14,125
[NARSUS] The Lady Queen's
beauty is a terrible thing.

342
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,583
[DARYUN]
What do we do about this?

343
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,458
Even if His Majesty is alive,

344
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,625
as an obstacle to this
new sham marriage,

345
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,791
he could easily
be done away with.

346
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,791
There is an
additional possibility.

347
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,416
Andragoras's life could
be a bargaining chip

348

offered up to the queen
to secure her cooperation.

349
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,000
[DARYUN] I would prefer to
have a little more information.

350
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,125
Shall we split up
and keep fishing?

351
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,166
[NARSUS]
Yes.

352
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,125
[DARYUN] We don't know
the fate of Lord Garshasph,

who was guarding the city.

Nor do we know what
happened to Lord Sam.

[HILMES] Well, then.
I shall tell you something.

I think it's information you'd
be most interested to know.

going to ask my name, too?

It's embarrassing having to
offer one's own introduction.

And who are you, clown?

I suppose that's close enough.

My name is Narsus. When the
next king takes his throne,

I shall become

some sort of joke?

Who does that
man think he is?

He had the nerve to insult my
painting skill! He must die!

[NARSUS] Why do you suppose
he wears that mask?

410
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,416
Is it merely to add
to his reputation?

411
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,166
Or does he want to keep
others from knowing his face?

[DARYUN]
I don't know,

but sooner or later we will
have to fight him again.

falls into his clutches,

415
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,708
the master of Kashan Fortress
will likely take full advantage

416

of the situation to
further his own ambitions.
