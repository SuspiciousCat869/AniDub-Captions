1
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,291
The slaves may be
Lusitania's best weapon.

2
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,458
They could open the city gates.

3
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,250
All the Lusitanians
would have to do

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,666
is give them a reason
to fight against Pars.

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,875
They could promise them freedom,
or some kind of reward.

6
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,916
If they felt that freedom
was within their grasp,

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,583
I'm sure some among
the slaves would rebel.

8
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,708
The slaves in Ecbatana outnumber
the members of the ruling class

9
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,291
by a good margin.

10
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:57,625
If they do fight.

11
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,541
[NARSUS] Yes, I came to
the same conclusion.

12
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,541
If enough slaves were to rise
against their masters,

13
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:08,500
even impregnable Ecbatana
is unlikely to last for long.

14
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:09,708
Then what're we doing?!

15
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,333
We need to get back
there with all haste!

16
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,041
That's exactly what
we must not do.

17
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,375
There are only four
of us, Your Highness.

18
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,666
What can we possibly hope
to do to save Ecbatana?

19
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,458
It's too late to
avert this disaster.

20
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,125
If your father had
freed the slaves,

21
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,125
things would be different now.

22
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,708
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS] Listen
to our words, Parsian slaves!

23
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,458
Seize your freedom!

24
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,166
All men are equal in god's eyes.

25
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,833
The time has come to rise
up against your masters!

26
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,916
Overthrow your
Parsian oppressors!

Damn those Lusitanian beasts.

There's Marzban Manuchurh
and Marzban Khayr.

[GARSHASPH]
No. Even Lord Eran Vahriz.

34
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,916
[TAHAMENAY]
All of them? His Majesty?

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,375
[SAM]
No, my lady.

36
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,666
From what we saw, his head
was not among those exposed.

37
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,666
[LADY-IN-WAITING D]
My Lady Queen.

38
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,666
Thank you, men. You did
well to tell me this.

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,208
That will be all for now.

40
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,708
[BOTH]
Majesty.

41
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,916
[SAM]
Am I alone,

42
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,666
or do you find it odd that she
didn't ask after Prince Arslan?

43
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,833
[GARSHASPH] It only shows
how troubled she must be

44
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
by the news.

45
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,458
We must act.

46
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,375
I still believe we should open
the gates and launch an attack.

47
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,416
What else is our
cavalry good for?

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,250
Patience, friend.

49
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,750
We should wait for
reinforcements

50
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,041
to arrive from Peshawar.

51
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,875
Then we can attack
on both fronts.

52
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,125
We'll suffer fewer losses
and put an end to the siege.

53
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,291
I don't like it.

Throw off the shackles
of captivity!

[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS] You do
not have to remain slaves!

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,625
[GARSHASPH] Clear out! Don't
listen to the enemy's drivel.

Garshasp! What do you
think you're doing?

65
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,958
We mustn't use force with them.

[grunts]

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,875
It is best to take
decisive action. Always.

[SAM]
Listen.

69
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,000
We must remain firm with them.

Who knows what trouble
these cattle might cause

71
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,916
given the chance.

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,041

Wait a while longer.

When the reinforcements arrive--

And when will that be, Sam?

75
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,291
They must first hear of our
defeat, then muster more troops.

76
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,250
Even assuming they march day and
night, how long till they come?

00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,250
[MESSENGER]
My lords, come quickly!

78
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,125
The slaves are rebelling!

00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,291
We must hurry! They've already
set fire to the Great Temple!

00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,541
Uh. What?

81
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,708
[MESSENGER]
Worse than that,

82
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,875
they're trying to open
the western gates!

83
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,458
[GARSHASPH] They mean to
invite the Lusitanian Army in!

84
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,791
[SAM] The discontent
among the slave population

85
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,000
runs even deeper
than I had imagined.

Keep well away from this gate.

be killed without a question.

Stop this!

94
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,666
Does killing unarmed
slaves make you proud?

95
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,375
[GARSHASPH]
I don't see any slaves here.

96
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,583
I see rebels.

97
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
Who have nothing but
sticks to fight with?

98
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,250
In their hearts they
are holding swords.

Look at them, Garshasph.

101
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,083
[SAM]
You killed ten rebels,

102
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,541
but you did nothing
to help the city.

103
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,875
Because now that
those ten have fallen,

104

a thousand more will rise
up to take their place.

Stay clear of the north gate!

What the hell are
they thinking?

Are the lazy brutes so
afraid of honest labor?

109
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,625
We should keep 'em in cages
with the rest of the livestock.

00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,791
We could lock them up,
but no work would get done.

to keep the slave

[TAHAMENAY]
But how is that possible?

117

The slaves should not
even have proper weapons.

They may not be as well
armed as the soldiers,

but they've grown
too numerous to fight.

If we want to put a stop
to this rebellion,

121
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,041
we must try a
different approach.

122
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,583
To that end, I would ask that
you issue a proclamation

123
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,500
granting the slaves
a modest sum,

and guaranteeing
better treatment.

How can I do such a thing?

It would shake the
foundations of our society!

foundations against us, my lady!

From what I've seen, young man,

[GIEVE] That's something I've
been told time and again

I will accept on
a few conditions.

That the cause is just,
the reward large,

I trust the continued
survival of Pars

157

will be reason enough for you.

And the reward will be generous.

00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, listen closely. Here is
what I'm asking of you.

160
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,916
Using a secret passage,

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,166
you are to escort the Lady
Queen to a safe place

162
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,291
outside the palace.

163
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,708
[GIEVE]
You may want to watch your step.

164
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,291
It is rather slippery.

165
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,541
[GIEVE]
No king in residence,

166
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,291
and now the queen
is leaving, too.

167
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,916
Some Royal Capital.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,666
The one million
people of Ecbatana,

169
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,583
abandoned by the people
meant to lead them.

170
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,500
Poor, forsaken Pars.

171
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,541
Surely this country
deserves a more worthy ruler.

172
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,416
[DARYUN] How long do you
intend for us to remain here?

173
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,375
I don't know. Perhaps we should
make for Ecbatana soon.

174
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,791
[NARSUS] Must I lecture you
on strategy as well, then?

175
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:25,041
No matter how spectacular
a fighter you may be,

176
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,333
one man on a horse cannot
win against an entire army.

177
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,708
If we could join up with the
men inside the city, maybe--

178
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,875
[NARSUS]
Let it go, Daryun.

179
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,083
Together, the slaves
and the Lusitanians

180
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,625
number several hundred thousand.

181
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,166
With only the soldiers
left within the walls,

182
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,375
we simply have too few.

183
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,375
Would you knowingly expose
His Highness to such danger?

184
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,875
[DARYUN]
Uh.

185
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,541
Consider this.

186
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,083
While we cannot win
against a whole army,

187
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,750
we can surely bring
down one commander.

188
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,416
Just explain what
you're getting at.

189
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,875
It's a question of
choosing opponents.

190
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,416
Forget the Lusitanian
Army for now.

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
We need Kharlan.

192
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,041
At the moment,

193
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,833
he is no doubt fully occupied
with the siege of Ecbatana.

194
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,291
But once that is over,

195
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,291
he is certain to come
after Prince Arslan,

196
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,500
and with relatively few men.

197
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,083
[DARYUN]
How can you know that?

198
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,791
He was an officer
in the Parsian Army;

199
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,958
he's unlikely to have
yet earned much trust

200
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,291
among the Lusitanians.

201
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,166
Fear not, our time
to fight will come.

202
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,125
But it will come when
Kharlan makes his move

203
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,416
apart from the rest of the army.

204
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,750
By capturing him,

205
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,583
we will not only diminish
the enemy's strength.

206
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,000
We will learn why
he turned traitor.

207
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,916
And that is information
we most certainly need.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Wouldn't you agree?

209
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,291
[DARYUN] So we just have
to sit here quietly

210
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,458
and wait for Kharlan
to make his move?

211
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,791
[NARSUS] Controlling your
emotions isn't your strong suit,

212
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,833
I know.

213
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,791
I'm back. Would you
like my report?

214
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,083
[NARSUS]
By all means, report away.

215
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,375
[ELAM] They don't seem
to be getting anywhere,

216
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,708
from what I can tell.

217
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,958
Their search for us
is haphazard at best.

218
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,625
I don't think we're in any great
danger of being found.

219
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,708
Then Kharlan has yet
to leave Ecbatana,

220
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,250
which means we stay
put a while longer.

221
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,125
[GIEVE]
You must be getting tired.

222
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,875
Perhaps we should rest awhile.

223
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,416
[GIEVE]
Don't want to work you too hard.

224
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,125
Just pretending to be the queen
must be an arduous enough task

225
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,208
without me adding to it.

226
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,458
[FAKE TAHAMENAY gasps]

227
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,916
[FAKE TAHAMENAY]
How did you know I'm not her?

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,833
[GIEVE]
By the scent of you.

229
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,333
Your skin gives off
a different aroma

230
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,666
than the Queen's noble flesh.

231
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,083
Even if you're using
the same perfume.

232
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,083
You're playing
the part of decoy.

233
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,625
Drawing any lingering attention
while the real queen escapes.

234
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,583
That is the idea, isn't it?

235
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,625
Such an attitude is
typical of the aristocracy.

236
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,750
They expect others
not only to serve them

237
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,125
but to sacrifice their lives
for the good of the nobility.

238
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,875
It works well for them.

239
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,416
[FAKE TAHAMENAY] I won't listen
to you disparage the queen so.

240
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,166
[GIEVE]
She's got you snowed.

241
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,250
[FAKE TAHAMENAY]
Whatever the Lady Queen

242
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,416
or the Lord Grand Vizier
may be planning,

243
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
my sole concern
is to fulfill my duty.

244
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,250
[GIEVE]
Are you just well trained,

245
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,916
or are you truly so servile?

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,791
[FAKE TAHAMENAY]
Consider your point made.

247
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,500
Now, will you continue
as my escort or not?

248
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,000
I accepted this job
when I thought

249
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,916
I was escorting the queen.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Not a lady-in-waiting poorly
disguised as the queen.

251
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,000
Whoa.

252
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,916
Ha. Now, wait.

253
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,208
From what I can see, you
are reasonably attractive,

254
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,625
so I wouldn't be opposed to
delivering you to your final--

[SILVER MASK]
My, what have we here?

261
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,458
I never thought
I would happen upon

262
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:17,666
the esteemed Lady Queen of
Pars in a place such as this.

263
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,625
You've saved me the
trouble of looking for you.

264
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,333
It appears that you and
Andragoras are better matched

265
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,583
than I had imagined.

266
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,375
One abandoned his men
to flee the battlefield.

267
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,541
The other abandoned her city
to hide away underground.

268
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,375
What's become
of the stoic dignity

of those who sit on the throne?

With any luck,

the real queen will still
be waiting inside its walls.

[GIEVE]
Just a moment.

I don't know who you
are beneath that mask,

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,458
[GIEVE]
I know.

316
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,250
I'll take advantage
of the chaos

317
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,958
and see what sort of
treasure I can make off with.

318
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,041
While I'm at it, if there
are any beauties around,

319
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,333
I shall make off
with them, as well.

320
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,166
[GIEVE] Don't have
any use for this, friend.

321
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,958
I, however, can find many
noble purposes for it.

322
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,333
You have my sincere thanks.

323
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,708
[water splashing]

324
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,208
[GIEVE]
Sounds like quite a few men.

325
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,416
I think I had best be on my way.

326
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,166
[SAM]
The east gate needs men!

327
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,000
Reassign some from
the north gate!

328
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,666
--[PARSIAN SOLDIER D] Yes, sir!
--[PARSIAN SOLDIER E] Lord Sam!

329
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,291
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E] No matter
how many we bring down,

330
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,541
more come to replace them!

331
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,333
[SAM] They are attacking
even more fiercely

332
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,250
--than usual tonight.
--[rumbling]

333
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,333
[SAM]
Uh.

334
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
[SAM]
The palace is ablaze.

335
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,791
How can this have happened?

336
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,000
You have the command here!

337
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,041
[PARSIAN SOLDIER F]
Sir!

338
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,750
Where did the
bastards come from?

339
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
[SLAVE E]
What's goin' on?

340
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,833
[SLAVE F]
I wish I could tell.

341
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,958
Get back!

342
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,333
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER B] You all
know what to do now, don't you?

343
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,166
Rise against your masters! Go!

344
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,458
[SLAVES yelling]

345
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,291
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER C]
Savor your freedom!

346
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,208
A gift from the
God of Yaldabaoth!

347
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,791
Damn!

348
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,791
They must've come through the
aqueducts! But how did they--?

349
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,583
[SAM]
Kharlan!

350
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,625
[SAM]
So it is true!

351
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,166
You deserted Pars
for Lusitania.

352
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,125
--[SAM] Why did you do it?
--[swords clanging]

353
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,708
[KHARLAN]
I have good reason!

354
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,166
You wouldn't understand.

355
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,791
[SAM] You're right. I could
never understand betrayal!

356
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,458
[KHARLAN]
Just surrender, Sam.

357
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,500
If you convert to the
Faith of Yaldabaoth,

358
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,666
I will guarantee your
life and your rank.

359
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,291
An offer of protection
from a cur like you?

360
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,666
I'd rather die!

361
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,375
Sam! Come back!

362
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,666
[SAM grunts]

363
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,625
[SAM]
Who.. are... you?

364
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,833
--[SOLDIERS yellsl]
--[SAM groans]

365
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,541
[PARSIAN SOLDIER I]
Lord Garshasp! Look!

366
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,333
The gate, sir. It's opening!

367
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,875
[GARSHASPH]
What? Impossible!

368
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,833
[SLAVE C]
Turn it faster!

369
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,083
[GARSHASPH]
It's the slaves.

370
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,250
Guard the west gate
with your lives!

371
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,291
[PARSIAN SOLDIER J]
No use! It's opening!

372
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,166
[GARSHASPH]
To the gate, men!

373
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,791
Keep as many from
entering as you can!

374
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:22,125
[NARRATOR] Pars Era,
the year 320. November.

375
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,125
The Royal Capital fell to
the invading Lusitanians.

376
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,250
With the fate of King
Andragoras still unknown,

377
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,958
the kingdom was plunged
into chaos and confusion.

378
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,500
[NARRATOR]
One soul moved in secret

379
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,208
behind a curtain of
fear and hysteria.

380
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:45,375
One soul gazed upon the cruel
fires that lit the night sky.

381
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,708
And one soul raced through
the now-hostile land,

382
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,916
determined to do her duty.

383
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,541
[NARRATOR] The board was laid
out. The pieces were assembled.

384
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,125
It was time to begin the game.

385
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,375
[yells]

386
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,500
[NARRATOR]
Surely death by execution

387
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,583
could be the only way to
deal with a heathen queen.

388
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:49,750
But one among the faithful

389
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,666
may have a very
different idea in mind.

390
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,375
Next time: "The Beauties
and the Beasts."

391
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,916
And thus would the
boy become a king.
