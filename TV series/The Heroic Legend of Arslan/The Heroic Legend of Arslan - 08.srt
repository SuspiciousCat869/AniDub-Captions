1
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR] A force of soldiers
led by Eran Kharlan,

2
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:40,291
betrayer of Pars, left Ecbatana
in search of Prince Arslan.

3
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:44,125
Meanwhile, shortly after
departing the Royal Capital,

4
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,541
musician Gieve lost his heart
to the exquisite beauty

5
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,916
of Farangis, a priestess of
the Temple of Mithra.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,583
[GIEVE] What's an
emissary from the temple

7
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,291
doing way out here?

8
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,250
My sworn duty. I was
sent as both priestess

9
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,083
and warrior to find His
Highness, Prince Arslan.

10
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,333
[FARANGIS]
Master Musician,

11
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,666
would you happen to know the
whereabouts of the Crown Prince?

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,208
Alas, I'm afraid
I couldn't say.

13
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:12,916
[FARANGIS]
Hm.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,958
[GIEVE]
Hm?

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,666
[FARANGIS]
Farewell, then.

16
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,083
[GIEVE]
No, please wait!

17
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,708
I may yet be able to
provide assistance.

18
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,500
Perhaps if you tell me why you
are looking for the prince?

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,041
[FARANGIS]
In a way, my temple exists

20
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,000
because of
Crown Prince Arslan.

21
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:29,541
Thanks to a donation made
in his name upon his birth.

22
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:32,208
Thus, it was the last
High Kahina's dying wish

23
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,125
that someone skilled
in the art of fighting

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,541
would be sent to assist him,

25
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,333
should he ever appear
to need such aid.

26
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,541
I was the priestess
chosen to go to him.

27
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,500
A convenient way
to be rid of me.

28
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:43,791
What do you mean?

29
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,291
I am a gifted woman,

30
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,958
skilled in both scholarly
pursuits and the arts of war,

31
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,250
which has evoked some
envy among my peers.

32
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,791
Yes, I understand.

33
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,291
[FARANGIS] Luckily for them,
they were given the opportunity

34
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,250
to turn me out of the
temple on the pretext

35
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,958
of doing the will
of the deceased.

36
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,625
Tch. You're awfully
committed to following me.

37
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,750
[GIEVE] I find myself unwilling
to part with your company yet.

38
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,375
If you despise your mission,
why not abandon it?

39
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,416
You can travel with me,
instead. I'm sure we--

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,083
[FARANGIS]
No. My mission aside,

41
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,791
I don't care for
the Lusitanians

42
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,500
and how they force their
beliefs upon others.

43
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,666
I wish to see them
driven out of Pars.

44
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,833
[GIEVE]
I agree with you completely!

45
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,958
It's as if they've chosen
one type of woman.

46
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,791
Say, golden-haired
and blue-eyed,

47
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,291
and decreed that
only those fitting

48
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,750
that description can
be considered beautiful!

49
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,916
Such a way of thinking seems
utterly ridiculous to me.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,333
We each have our own
idea of what is beautiful,

51
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,666
what we hold precious.

52
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,208
It is not something we can
be coerced into feeling.

53
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,125
I would be honored if you would
allow me to accompany you.

54
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,291
Pardon, Mistress Farangis,
are you listening to me?

55
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,333
Mistress Farangis!

56
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,083
[GIEVE] A whistle?
I didn't hear any sound.

57
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Interesting.

58
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,791
[FARANGIS] I've consulted
the Djinn, Master Musician,

59
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,250
and it would seem your hatred
of Lusitania is no false thing.

60
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,041
[GIEVE] Djinn? I'm sorry
I don't quite understand.

61
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,875
[FARANGIS]
I don't imagine you do.

62
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,291
Infants are able to hear
the voices of adults,

63
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,541
but they don't understand
what the words mean.

64
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,208
You are the same.

65
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,916
You are able to hear the wind,

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,833
but the whispers of the
Djinn which ride upon it

67
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,708
elude your comprehension.

68
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,041
I've never been compared
to an infant before.

69
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't take the
comparison too far.

70
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,041
There is no babe so full
of impure intent as you are.

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,666
[GIEVE]
Whatever else you think of me,

72
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,791
you have recognized
my sincerity.

73
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,500
May I take that as permission
to continue on with you?

74
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,583
[FARANGIS] Do as you like.
Though any man who wishes

75
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,458
to travel with me
must swear his loyalty

76
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,166
to Prince Arslan as I have.

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,458
My loyalty is in
somewhat short supply.

78
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,791
I fear I've only enough
to swear to you, Mistress.

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,125
[FARANGIS]
You may keep it, Musician.

80
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,375
I have no need of
such hollow niceties.

81
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,125
[GIEVE] You are as cold as
the moon on a winter's night!

82
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,791
Are you not moved at all by
the connection between us?

83
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,583
[FARANGIS]
What connection?

84
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,708
[FARANGIS]
Parsian.

85
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,000
They only appear so. Those
are the soldiers who ride

86
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,333
under the treacherous
Marzban Kharlan.

87
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,500
It's better if we keep
well away from them.

88
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,416
[FARANGIS]
Not if they can be useful.

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,708
There may be someone among
them who has information

90
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,958
about the prince's location.
I shall follow and see.

91
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,541
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER A]
This man was apparently hired

92
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,583
as a porter by
Prince Arslan's party.

93
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,291
Was he? How did you
come by those wounds?

94
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,458
Arslan's men did this to me!

95
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,666
That prince isn't
as sweet as he looks!

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,875
Seems he tried to steal
the prince's belongings

97
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,458
and received a nasty beating.

98
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,666
[MAN A groans]

99
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,541
[KHARLAN] How many in
the prince's party?

100
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,000
[MAN A]
Just four! That's all!

101
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,083
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER A]
Liar!

102
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,666
There must be a hundred
times that many.

103
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,750
I'm telling the truth! What's
more, two of them are children.

104
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,791
That's why they hired
me as a porter.

105
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,500
[KHARLAN]
Very well, then.

106
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,375
Which way were the prince
and his party traveling?

107
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,666
[MAN A]
To the south, sir!

108
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,250
I heard you were looking
for him, Lord Kharlan.

109
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,458
That's the reason
I came to find you.

110
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,541
I figure this information's
gotta be worth a little reward.

111
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,750
Right...? Right?

112
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,708
--Quiet.
--Aw, just a little somethin'?

113
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,083
[KHARLAN]
Why, of course.

114
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:08,041
[MAN A chuckles]
Thank yo--

115
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,583
Does he think me a fool?
I'm not so easily tricked.

116
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,583
I don't understand, sir.

117
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,541
He was a liar in
Narsus's employ.

118
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,375
I suspect those
wounds are only there

119
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,750
to make his story
more believable.

120
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,000
Then the prince and his
people are close by.

121
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,333
Our unfortunate guest here
said they were headed south.

122
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,875
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER C]
Lord Kharlan!

123
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,666
We've come across some
travelers who saw

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,750
what sounds like
Arslan's company.

125
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,125
They all agree the group seemed
to be headed to the north, sir.

126
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,541
As I thought.

127
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,750
If they pass through the
mountainous region to the north,

128
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,500
there is a road that
leads to Daylam.

129
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,458
Perhaps they intend to head
straight east from there.

130
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,083
[KHARLAN]
Since Kishward and Bahman

131
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,791
are to the east at
the Peshawar Fortress.

132
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,833
We're moving out!
Prepare to ride north!

133
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,375
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

134
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,083
[NARSUS]
It was simple enough

135
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,458
to lure you into these
mountains, Kharlan.

136
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,625
All I had to do was let you
believe you'd outwitted me.

137
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,791
[NARSUS] Those with
passably sharp minds

138
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,250
always dance the most prettily
upon the game board.

139
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,291
[NARSUS gasps]

140
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,666
[FARANGIS] You are not
a Lusitanian soldier?

141
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,000
You do not serve the traitor
Kharlan? Who are you, then?

142
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,166
[NARSUS] If it helps,
and I serve Prince Arslan.

143
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,458
I am Narsus.

144
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,791
[FARANGIS gasps]
Forgive me.

145
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,458
[FARANGIS] I am Farangis in
service of the Divine Mithra.

146
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,958
I have been following Lord
Kharlan's company for some time.

147
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,791
It is my hope to find Prince
Arslan and offer him my aid.

148
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,791
Ah, a new ally for
the prince? Excellent.

149
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,750
We can put you to
work straight away.

150
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,958
You do not wish to
question me further?

151
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,458
If you were with Kharlan,

152
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,375
or another Lusitanian loyalist,
you wouldn't stop to chat,

153
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,083
you'd be shouting out
my location to them.

154
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,416
[NARSUS] We are about to capture
the treacherous dog Kharlan

155
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,250
and deliver him
to Prince Arslan.

156
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,250
I won't turn down an
additional pair of hands.

157
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,500
Can you tell me how many

158
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,833
are currently in His
Highness's service?

159
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,791
[NARSUS] There's me
and my young squire,

160
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,958
and one knight whose
skill is without equal.

161
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,291
So with the addition of
you and your companion.

162
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,625
It brings our number to five.

163
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,208
You're kidding. Five?

164
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,333
[ELAM]
Sure enough. They're coming.

165
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,750
Which implies he was completely
taken in by Narsus's scheme.

166
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,875
Oh, yes. He believes his own
prediction has proven correct

167
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,750
and will march this way without
suspecting anything is afoot.

168
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,333
Despite the danger this
terrain places his army in.

169
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,083
[ARSLAN]
And I will face him at last.

170
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,708
Are you nervous at all?

171
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:57,875
I would be lying if I
told you I was not, but...

172
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,083
This is something I must do.

173
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,375
Perhaps you would
feel a bit easier

174
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
if you carried more
than one weapon.

175
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,541
While this bow is not
the work of a master,

176
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,208
it has served me well.
Please use it.

177
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,791
While I thank you
for the kind offer,

178
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,583
I do not wish to
leave you weaponless.

179
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,625
Don't concern yourself. I'll
be fine. Please take the bow.

180
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,250
It will keep you safe
from harm in my stead.

181
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,833
Good luck, Highness.

182
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,166
[ARSLAN] Thank you,
Elam. I may need it.

183

There he is!

00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,958
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER D]
On the cliff!

187
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,708
[ARSLAN] Kharlan! I am
here, as you wished.

188
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,750
I cannot stand by and watch
you murder any more innocents.

189
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,458
Now you face me, coward!

190
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,333
Then you will
face your death!

191
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,958
Die, Prince Arslan!

192
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,333
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER A]
Kill him!

193
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,875
His head is worth a hundred
thousand gold pieces!

194

[panting] That'll do.

00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,958
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER K]
What's happening up there?

201
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,416
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER A]
Bring more torches, quickly!

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,958
How many of 'em are we fighting?

[groans]

204
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,791
What was that?
Did a ghost kill him?

205
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,291
[NARSUS]
There are few things weaker

206
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,791
than a cavalry company
that's had its morale trampled.

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER N]
There's one! After him!

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER O]
What? Where?

209
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,458
Just shoot in the
direction he fled!

210
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,875
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER O]
Enemies in the woods!

211
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,041
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER N]
More of them?

212
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,083
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER P]
They have archers!

213
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,875
[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER R]
Fire! Fire!

That's Lusitanian horse tack!

[NARSUS]
Finely done.

219
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,708
This is nothing.

220

Where are they
all coming from?!

221

We must be surrounded!

How many are
we up against?

223

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER Y]
A hundred? Two hundred?

224

Look! It's Daryun!

225
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,916
It's Marzban Daryun,
and he's coming this way!

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIER A]
Won't anyone stand and fight?!

231
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,291
[NARSUS] I'd hoped to take
advantage of his notoriety,

232
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,458
but I never thought it
would be this effective.

233
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,500
I leave the rest to you,
old friend. Fight well.

[KHARLAN'S SOLDIERS screaming]

235
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,916
Incredible. They're
actually on the retreat.

236
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,833
At least a thousand of them,
routed by a handful?

237
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,083
This was an ambush!

238
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,916
The enemy lured us into
the mountain passes!

239

00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,666
What happened?
How could it come to this?

244
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,250
You were a Marzban.

245
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,041
A respected knight of the realm,

246
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,125
and were once a
true man of Pars.

247
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,041
No man ever dared so
much as speak ill of you.

248
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,375
Why would you bend
the knee to Lusitania?

249
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,333
Greed would not
move a man like you.

250
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,083
If there is a good reason,
I beg of you to tell me!

251
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,291
It's for your own good
that you not know.

252
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,000
Far better that you die
believing that I am a traitor,

You have shown
admirable restraint.

I ask that you
allow me the honor

of dealing with this wretch.

be fighting today.

Will you run from me?

Does your courage fail you

if your opponent is a man
instead of a young boy?

invincible! Think again!

You want to know
about the king?

Very well. Andragoras...
still yet lives.

But the throne is his no
longer. It never truly was.

ascend the throne.

[KHARLAN] A woman, a child.

able to get out of him.

311
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,125
That's something, though.
My father's alive.

312
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,916
And I believe we
have reason to hope

313
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,083
for his continued survival,
Your Highness.

314
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,500
After all, the Lusitanians
have kept him alive this long.

315
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,458
They undoubtedly have a reason.

316
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,666
Presumably that reason will keep
him from coming to undue harm.

317
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,125
Please forgive me,
Crown Prince Arslan.

318
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,166
I hope you will excuse
my earlier informality.

319
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,541
I am the priestess Farangis.

320
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,000
I was formerly in the service

321
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,291
of the Temple of
Mithra in Khuzestan.

322
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,166
I came in accordance
with the dying wish

323
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,916
of the previous High Kahina.

324
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,416
Truly, you have my
thanks, Farangis.

325
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,416
Were it not for your
timely intervention,

326
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,083
I would be dead now.
And who might you be?

327
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,625
I've come to offer you
my service, Highness.

328
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:27,791
Indeed, it was for that express
purpose that I escaped Ecbatana.

329
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,333
I am certain you
would like to know

330
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,625
that the Lady Queen
Tahameny was still well

331
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,166
when I left the
Royal Capital.

332
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,875
My Lady Mother is all right?
Tell me everything you know!

333
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,541
[NARSUS] We'll be in
trouble if what's left

334
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,958
of Kharlan's company returns.
We should leave this place.

335
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,958
[ARSLAN] We can wait
a short while yet.

336
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,916
I would ask a favor
of you, as a priestess.

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,458
[FARANGIS gasps]

338
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,875
Kharlan and many of
his men died today.

339
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,875
Will you please offer
them an elegy?

340
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,333
[FARANGIS gasps]

341
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,333
[GIEVE]
Hm?

342
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,208
[ELAM, DARYUN gasp]

343
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,125
I am certain that some
of them, at least,

344
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,958
had family in Ecbatana.

345
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,958
For them to have been a party
to this treachery even so,

346
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,333
the reason must have
been great indeed.

347
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,291
The Divine Mithra is the god
of contracts and fidelity,

348
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,625
but also of war.

349
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,583
Please, an elegy to
mourn fallen warriors.

350
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,375
[FARANGIS]
As you wish, my prince.

351
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,625
[GIEVE] He mourns the death
of those who betrayed him.

352
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,291
This prince is naïve indeed.

353
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,125
Is anyone in the royal
family fit to rule?

354
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,750
Well, for the time being,

355
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,791
this will keep me at
Mistress Farangis's side.

356
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,166
I can always slip away later
if it seems the better option.

357
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,583
Glad to be joining you.

358
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,083
[ELAM groans]

359
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,958
[DARYUN] So a party
of four becomes six.

360
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,208
And while I'm glad for
the considerable increase

361
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,625
in our fighting strength,

362
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,916
are you certain that
we can trust these two?

363
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,458
The bard, in particular.

364
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,625
His skills make
it worth the risk.

365
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,541
Assuming the enemy army has
three hundred thousand men,

366
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,208
this means we each face
only fifty thousand apiece.

367
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,708
I find those figures
far more favorable.

368
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,791
[DARYUN]
Hm. Let's see.

369
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,958
Yes, fifty thousand
should be manageable.

370
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,416
[NARSUS] For a fighter like
him, it may actually be.

371
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,750
Now, then.

372
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,583
Since we know the king
and queen are both alive,

373
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,625
it's time we determine
their whereabouts.

374
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,375
Which means it's time
to head for Ecbatana.

375
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,041
[SILVER MASK]
Andragoras.

376
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:45,208
[SILVER MASK] Have you
puzzled out who I am yet?

377
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,666
I shall tell you.

378
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,375
And I do not think you will
find the name unfamiliar.

379
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:55,583
You see, I am called Hilmes,
and my father was Osroes.

380
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,666
[ANDRAGORAS]
Hilmes.

381
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,333
[HILMES]
That's right. I am Hilmes.

382
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:04,333
Your nephew and heir to your
brother, the previous king.

383
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:08,791
Yes. I am the kingdom's
rightful ruler.

384
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:14,125
[HILMES] Look at my face.
Don't you dare turn away!

385
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,041
I want you to see the
proof of the crime

386
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:19,208
you committed sixteen years ago.

387
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:24,708
I am the true king of Pars,
dear uncle. Not you.

388
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:36,625
[laughs]

389
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,625
[NARRATOR]
Has Daryun met his match?

390
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:49,208
No one can deny his bravery, and
yet even this peerless knight

391
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,958
cannot help but
shudder with dread

392
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,041
at the monstrous skill
of his opponent.

393
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,375
Next time, "Beneath the Mask."

394
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,875
And thus would the
boy become a king.
