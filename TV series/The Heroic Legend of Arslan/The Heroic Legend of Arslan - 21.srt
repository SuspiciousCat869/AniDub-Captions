1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,333
[DARYUN] How are the
preparations coming along?

2
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,625
[NARSUS]
Exceedingly smoothly.

3
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,000
With Lord Lucian taking
on the role of satruyp,

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,291
I'm able to concentrate
fully on my duties

5
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,958
as military strategist.

6
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,916
He seems to be doing well.
I'm glad we appointed him, too.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,666
And luckily for us, he's
harder working than you are.

8
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,125
[DARYUN]
Uh! Me? What about you?

9
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:55,125
Foisting half your tasks off
on that poor old fellow.

10
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,833
[ZARAVANT] Would you
like to say that again?

11
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,375
You should watch your tongue,
you damned Sindhuran cur!

12
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,666
[JASWANT] I'll say it
as many times as needed.

13
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,208
You will obey the orders
Lord Narsus has given you.

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,083
[ZARAVANT] I've read through his
orders. There must be a mistake.

15
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,250
He can't mean for us
to act as reserves

16
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,083
to Lord Daryun's company.

17
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,250
Why is that a problem?

18
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,083
How can we
distinguish ourselves

19
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,833
if we're relegated to the rear?

20
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,458
Now, where is Lord Narsus?

21
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,458
I should be speaking
with him, not you!

22
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,750
[TUS]
Come now. Let's cool our heads.

23
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,333
I backed down the other day out
of respect for Lord Kishward,

24
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:30,041
but I won't let this foreigner
continue to disrespect me.

25
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,750
It's only getting worse.
We must do something soon.

26
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:37,708
[music playing]

27
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,291
Surely there's no need for
violence. The day is fair.

28
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,708
Why not take a moment to bask in
the sunshine and enjoy a song?

29
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:51,916
The matters we have to discuss
don't concern you, musician.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,250
Be on your way.

31
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,291
You will have to pardon me.

32
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,083
I had forgotten that you
hail from Oxus, you see,

33
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,208
and thus aren't likely

34
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,416
to appreciate more
sophisticated music.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,791
Why, you little--!

36
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,458
[NARSUS]
Lord Zaravant.

37
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,250
[NARSUS]
I decided on our formation

38
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,250
after considering the unique
qualities of each company.

39
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,333
It is by no means an indictment
of your soldiers' abilities.

40
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,708
That said,

41
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,708
I do not wish to offer even
unintentional offense.

42
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,208
Perhaps you could allow me time
to consider the matter further.

43
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,791
Yes, certainly.

44
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,458
That is, if you would be kind
enough to do so, Lord Narsus.

45
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,291
[NARSUS] Will that suit
you as well, Jaswant?

46
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,666
I can think of no objections.

47
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,750
Let us leave him to it then.

48
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,250
By the gods.

49
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,166
First the Sindhuran dog and
now that traveling musician.

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,625
His Highness should
be more careful

51
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,208
of the sort of person he
surrounds himself with.

52
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,416
[TUS]
That's not for us to say.

53
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,541
This is a problem.

54
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,625
Such infighting
is bad for morale.

55
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,875
Especially on the
eve of a march.

56
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,625
The more people
gathered in one place,

57
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
the more issues will arise.

58
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,375
And I cannot entirely
blame Lord Zaravant

59
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,500
for his reluctance to accept us.

60
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,625
Consider it from
his point of view.

61
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,375
The prince's closest advisers

62
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,083
are a mismatched group
of questionable people.

63
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,833
Yes, including me.

64
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,750
Even so, we can hardly
leave matters as they stand.

65
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,250
True.

66
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,833
We shall have to play one
more gambit before we depart.

67
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:54,875
[door opens]

68
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,083
[KUBARD]
Cross these mountains

69
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,458
and I'll be at
Peshawar Fortress.

70
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,125
We can't let you
continue any further.

71
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,791
Thought he'd send someone.

72
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,958
Can't well have Prince
Arslan finding out

73
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,541
what your little crew
is up to, right?

74
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,291
Prince Hilmes did send you?

75
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,375
[SOLDIER A]
Hmph.

76
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,625
We're here to dispose
of a traitor.

77
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,416
Such duties are beneath
his Highness' notice.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,916
Ah, then I suppose
it was Zandeh.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,833
[BOTH yelling]

80
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,750
[KUBARD]
Sorry for this, Sam.

81
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,375
[thud]

82
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,541
[SOLDIER A groans]

83
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,250
[KUBARD]
You can choose your loyalties.

84
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,625
But you can't choose mine.

85
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,000
[ISFAN]
What?

86
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,750
[ISFAN]
You?

87
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,458
You were the one who shot
and killed my elder brother?

88
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,708
[GIEVE]
Yes, and what of it?

89
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,875
[ISFAN growls]

90
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,875
[GIEVE] I've heard
the stories about you.

91
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,625
Abandoned as a babe on
a snow-covered mountain.

92
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,375
Doomed until Shapur rescued you.

93
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,166
And for that they call
you Far al'Khu Din.

94
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,125
That means, "one who was
raised by wolves," yes?

95
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,083
We're discussing my
brother right now, not me.

96
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,250
Do you know how badly
your brother was suffering?

97
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,833
My arrow was what freed him.

98
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,041
You've no cause
to be angry with me.

99
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,125
[growls]

100
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,708
Master Gieve, just let it lie--!

101
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,250
[GIEVE] By rights, in fact, you
really ought to be thanking me.

102
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,833
I'll kill you!

103
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,416
He's no better than a murderer!

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,916
You can't lose to
a musician, sir!

[SOLDIER I]
Get him!

[ZARAVANT]
Hey, Isfan!

107
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,708
Give that outsider a
punch from me as well!

108
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,375
[GIEVE] See, that's another
thing you've got wrong.

109
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,291
From where I stand, you
people are the outsiders.

110
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,958
I've been by His Highness' side
ever since he left Ecbatana.

111
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,875
I protected him throughout
his journey here.

112
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,500
Unlike you and your men,

113
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,833
who came like sheep
to join his flock.

114
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,708
That's all I'm gonna
listen to from you!

115
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,958
[ISFAN]
Maybe you'll show some respect

116
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,583
once I cut out
that lying tongue!

117
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,875
Don't you understand?

118
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,000
The Lusitanians were
the ones torturing Shapur.

119
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,541
You should blame them for
his death, instead of me.

120
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,416
Oh, they will pay.
But you're here now!

121
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,291
Sheathe your swords,
both of you!

122
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,416
You are in the presence
of Crown Prince Arslan.

123
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,708
[ARSLAN]
What is the meaning of this?

124
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
Gieve? Lord Isfan?

125
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,916
[GIEVE]
Your Highness,

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,291
it was nothing but a small
difference of opinion.

127
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,833
[thud]

128
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,291
I saw everything, Gieve.
This was avoidable.

129
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,500
You were clearly provoking
Lord Isfan to no purpose.

130
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,541
[GIEVE]
Indeed.

131
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,916
And what do you plan
to do about it?

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,416
I have been troubled by
your irresponsible conduct

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,708
from the beginning.

134
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,875
You've presumed upon
His Highness' kind nature

135
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,250
long enough!

136
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,458
Listen to you.

137
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,291
It's always "His Highness
this, His Highness that."

138
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,291
Have you no identity
of your own, Daryun?

139
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:45,375
I hate to say this
to you, but really,

140
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,250
it's sad.

141
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,708
That's enough, both of you!

142
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,958
[GIEVE]

143
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,375
I'm done.

144
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:56,083
You've been given
enough chances, Gieve.

145
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,708
I hereby banish you.

[SOLDIERS murmuring]

Ha, ha. As good a time as any.

148
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,958
My thanks for your hospitality
until now, Your Highness,

149
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,625
but court life doesn't
suit me anyway.

150
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,500
[KISHWARD] Now, Master Gieve,
Let's not be rash.

151
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,375
Surely if you apologize--

152
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,750
Your Highness, I wish you well.

153
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,583
I shall pray for your
good fortune in battle.

[KISHWARD]
Wait, Master Gieve!

[ARSLAN]
Narsus.

156
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:47,000
Did that truly need to
be done? You're certain?

157
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,416
I apologize.

158
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,708
It was a most unpleasant role
we asked you to play.

159
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,333
Never mind me.

160
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,583
My thoughts right
now are with Gieve.

161
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,625
He's the one who's been wronged.

162
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,583
[NARSUS]
A necessary charade.

163
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,791
Punishing him will
gratify the lords,

164
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,750
and should allay their
dissatisfaction for a time.

165
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,041
Gieve understood what
we asked of him, Highness.

166
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,916
Don't be troubled.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Perhaps if I spoke to him...

168
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,083
[NARSUS]
He has already departed.

169
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,333
On a mission.

170
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,708
I tasked him with finding
a certain someone.

171
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,083
[ARSLAN]
Finding who?

172
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,416
Someone we may
eventually have need of.

173
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,958
If you'll forgive me, I will
say no more for the moment.

174
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,458
I understand.

175
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,041
Though I do wish I'd had
the chance to bid him farewell.

176
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,708
[GIEVE] I think the kingdom you
build when you sit the throne

177
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,791
will be one I shall be
proud to be a part of.

178
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,833
[ARSLAN]
And so it shall be, Gieve.

179
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,125
Now we march! We will
strike down the enemy!

180
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,708
We will reclaim the
Royal Capital! To war!

181
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,791
[ARSLAN'S ARMY yelling]

182
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,000
[GUISCARD]
I see. Arslan has taken action.

183
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,708
I was expecting as much.

184
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,291
Who leads the effort to
muster our own troops?

185
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,125
[LUSITANIAN OFFICER B] Generals
Baudouin and Montferrat, sir.

186
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,000
Our troops were scattered
throughout Pars,

187
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,583
but all are now making
their way back to Ecbatana

188
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,208
to form a unified
army once again.

189
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,416
All except...

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
All except for Silver
Mask. Is that right?

191
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,916
[LUSITANIAN OFFICER B]
I'm sorry, Highness.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,666
The messenger we sent to
Zabul Fortress hasn't returned.

193
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,375
Fine. Don't worry overmuch.
He'll return here eventually.

194
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,583
If for no other reason
than to take Arslan's head.

195
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,541
Hmph. Let him make his plans.

196
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:50,916
As long as he remains useful,
I will be happy to use him.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,083
And when I no longer need him,

198
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,916
we'll see who has
the last laugh.

199
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,500
[NARSUS]
This is our initial destination.

200
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,708
Here. The Keep of
Saint Emmanuel.

201
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:09,916
[ARSLAN]
Saint Emmanuel?

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,291
[NARSUS]
Yes.

203
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,250
It is the name of an
historical Lusitanian figure.

204
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,041
The fortress had
long been abandoned.

205
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,500
In fact, it was all
but forgotten

206
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,375
until they came to occupy it.

207
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,666
I don't care for the
look of this terrain.

208
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,208
[NARSUS]
Nor I.

209
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,333
But given its location right
on the Continental Highway,

210
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,333
we can not be able to move
forward without taking it.

211
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,083
As for the man
guarding the keep,

212
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,833
his name is Lord Barcacion.

213
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,041
He was the Chief Royal
Librarian in Lusitania.

214
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,958
The chief librarian?

215
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,666
He is not a military man?

216
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,625
[NARSUS] A weakness we can
likely use to our advantage.

217
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,875
Good.

218
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,125
First we take back the
Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

219
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,500
It will be a foothold
on our way to Ecbatana.

220
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,083
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, Sir!

221
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,583
[ELAM]
Excuse me, Lord Narsus?

222
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,583
If we are making our way
to the keep from here,

223
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,250
we will be passing near this
castle as well, won't we?

224
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,500
[FARANGIS]
Chasoom Fortress it's called?

225
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,583
Curious. I don't believe
I've heard of it.

226
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,125
It is another structure

227
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,750
the Lusitanians have recently
made into a fortified base.

228
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,916
They likely mean to keep
an eye on our activity

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,541
by controlling a key
point along the highway.

230
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,625
Yes.

231
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,541
Their strategist,
Prince Guiscard,

232
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,416
is no slouch as a
tactician, it would seem.

233
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,166
[ZARAVANT]
Lord Narsus.

234
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,125
I beg you grant me
and my men permission

235
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,166
to lay siege to
Chasoom Fortress.

236
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,333
We'd be glad of the opportunity
to prove ourselves

237
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,416
an asset to His
Highness's cause.

238
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,208
[NARSUS] Your offer, while truly
noble, will not be necessary.

239
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,333
[TUS]
Lord Narsus?

240
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,041
Our primary objective at present

241
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,416
is the Keep of Saint
Emmanuel and that alone.

242
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,791
Strategically speaking, there's
no need to take the fortress.

243
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,791
[ARSLAN]
Isfan. Zaravant. Tus.

244
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,500
I appreciate your
bravery and dedication,

245
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,291
but if this battle
need not be fought,

246
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,708
I'd sooner save our
men and resources.

247
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,750
Surely you understand.

248
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,166
It shall be as you
wish, Your Highness.

249
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,833
Slower, Zaravant.
Rein in a little.

250
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,041
If you're worried, you rein in.

251
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,583
[TUS]
Hey! Both of you slow down!

252
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,958
You'll outpace the
rest of the army.

253
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,583
[ZARAVANT, ISFAN]
Shut it!

254
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,375
So prideful.

255
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,750
You're in command here
until I get back.

256
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,916
Choose 500 men and follow me!

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,208
Yes, sir!

258
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,333
[ZARAVANT] What is that up
there? Some sort of trap?

259
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,291
[ISFAN] Ha. They think to stop
us with a couple platforms

260
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,375
and a makeshift barricade?

261
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,416
Be careful. We haven't fully
assessed their defenses.

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,666
We should turn back and
report this to His Highness.

263
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,500
Ha. Go ahead.

264
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,875
We charge!

265
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:54,625
[TUS]
No, wait!

266
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:59,666
[CAVALRYMEN yelling]

267
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:06,875
Give the signal.

268
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,041
Yes, sir!

269
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,291
[growls]

270
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,458
We're cut off!

271
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,125
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER C]
We're trapped like rats!

272
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,291
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
Slaughter the heathen scum!

[ALL gasp]

274
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,583
[ARSLAN]
Where are they now?

275
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,375
[NARSUS] It seems they
are completely cut off

276
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,000
from the rest of the army.

277
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,125
The survivors report that they
engaged a Lusitanian force

278
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,375
that was waiting
along the highway.

279
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,416
The enemy sprung a trap that
cut off our troops' retreat

280
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,708
and forced them
into the mountains.

281
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,375
[DARYUN] Is there any way
we can locate them?

282
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,083
[NARSUS] They are almost
certainly being pursued

283
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,750
by the enemy, and the sun
will be setting soon.

284
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,958
It won't be an easy to
find companies on the move

285
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,125
in the dark.

286
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,500
There's another option.

287
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,125
We can give them up for
lost and move forward.

288
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,375
However, that's not
my decision to make.

289
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,458
[ARSLAN]
There is no decision.

290
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,875
First call an immediate halt,
then prepare a rescue party.

291
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:12,625
[KISHWARD]
Huh.

292
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,041
As it happens,

293
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,791
I've already sent Elam and
Alfarid to scout the area.

294
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,125
As soon as they return, I'll
see that our men are retrieved.

295
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,458
[ARSLAN]
Do so.

296
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,375
I was too eager for glory.

297
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,916
If I die today, I can
only blame myself.

298
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,708
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

299
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,875
[NARSUS]
You had no luck finding them?

300
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,500
We saw no sign of them.

301
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,375
The cliffs in this
area form a maze.

302
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,208
We nearly got lost ourselves.

303
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,125
And there won't be
a moon tonight, either.

304
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,291
I don't think there's
anything else we can do.

305
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,166
[NARSUS] "Terrain's advantage"
goes to the enemy this time.

306
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,666
A situation I prefer to avoid.

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,875
Is there nothing we can try?

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,208
I think I hear something.

Ah, the Djinn. Ever capricious.

It appears one has seen fit to
help us find our lost soldiers.

00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,708
Oh, good.

315
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,000
Uh...

316
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,375
What's this?

317
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,291
[TUS]
It appears we're surrounded.

318
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,958
[ZARAVANT] Urgh. I came so
far to fight for my prince,

319
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
and this is how I end?

320
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,250
What a useless way to die.
I am truly a fool.

321
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,166
[TUS]
Consider it another way.

322
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,000
We'll be here keeping
the Lusitanians busy.

323
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,375
Which will allow the main
army to progress unscathed.

324
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,833
When you put it that way,

325
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,708
I believe our deaths
will have purpose.

326
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,625
[SOLDIERS yelling]

327
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,583
More Parsians.

328
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,791
Impossible!

329
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,291
They're ours. Let's go!

330
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,625
Right! With me!

331
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,291
I can't...
believe we were saved.

332
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,541
[ARSLAN]
Zaravant! Isfan! Tus!

333
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,291
[ISFAN]
Your Highness!

334
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,916
I am glad to see
you three are safe.

335
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,666
[ISFAN]
With all due respect,

336
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,583
we're grateful,
but why come for us?

337
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,958
You could easily have chosen to
give us up as sacrificial pawns

338
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,083
and ridden on ahead unharmed.

339
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,375
[NARSUS]
True.

340
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,750
It would have made for
a more relaxing evening.

341
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,041
[DARYUN] But we have a
momentous task in front of us.

342
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:34,166
We cannot afford to lose you
before we've even begun.

343
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,500
[ARSLAN]
Listen to me.

344
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,958
I'm sure many lives will
need to be sacrificed

345
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,625
in the fight to
regain our country.

346
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,208
[ARSLAN]
That said.

347
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,791
When it's over, I want as many
of my men standing as possible.

348
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:52,041
Instead of valorous deaths,
let us seek honorable lives.

349
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,791
Your Highness.

350
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,333
[TUS grunts]

351
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,583
Your Highness.

352
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,708
[ISFAN]
If you still judge us worthy,

353
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,500
we ask permission to swear
our loyalty to you anew.

354
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,958
[FARANGIS] Were you going to
leave without saying anything?

355
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,750
It wasn't pretense when I said
that court life doesn't suit me.

356
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,958
[GIEVE]
Narsus has given me a task.

357
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,208
I don't plan to return
for quite some time.

358
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:21,541
Understood. I am not
here to stop you.

359
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,000
I would only deliver a
message from His Highness.

360
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,333
Will you hear it?

361
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,083
[FARANGIS] He said he is sorry
to have made trouble for you

362
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,875
to the very end.

363
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:39,625
[music playing]

364
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,375
What is life?

365
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,333
It is a risk.
An adventure. A journey.

366
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,958
And cannot the same
be said of death?

367
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,166
Time flies swiftly.

368
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,791
A bird with midnight
feathers and sharp talons,

369
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:01,708
bringing old age to a man in the
space of a single dark wingbeat.

370
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,625
[GEIVE] And with those
words, I leave you.

371
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,833
Think back on them when
the nights are lonely.

372
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,500
I will treasure them.

373
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:14,958
Although if that was a ruba'i,
it was a poor one indeed.

374
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,708
[GIEVE]
Hmph. Farewell, then.

375
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,125
[ZANDEH] We've received a report
from one of the sorcerers

376
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:06,125
that Arslan's army
is on the move.

377
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,791
They've passed by
Chasoom Fortress entirely.

378
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,583
It appears they are
continuing westward.

379
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,958
Oh, are they?

380
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,333
We should move, too.
Make the preparations.

381
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,541
Sir.

382
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,791
[HILMES]
Come, Arslan. I am ready.

383
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,625
The stage is set for
our final conflict.

384
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,458
I will be waiting
for you... eagerly.

385
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,166
[NARRATOR]
On the eve of battle,

386
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,166
Arslan found himself
contemplating

387
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,916
many weighty matters.

388
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,250
Such is the burden of
those who assume command.

389
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,083
Next time: "The Night
Before the Attack."

390
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,125
And thus, would the
boy become a king.
