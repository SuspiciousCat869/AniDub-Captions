Pars Era, the year 321. May.

2
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,791
Crown Prince Arslan
left Peshawar Fortress

3
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,291
with an army at his back,

4
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,333
advancing down the
Continental Highway

5
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:51,125
to retake Ecbatana
from the Lusitanians.

6
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:53,458
Leading the van with
ten thousand cavalry

7
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,166
were those who had
rallied to Arslan

8
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,583
in response to his decree:

9
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:02,083
The warriors Zaravant,
Isfan, and Tus,

10
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:06,250
who were newly re-sworn
to the Crown Prince.

11
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,458
Arslan's army made good time,

12
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:13,041
racing across 200 farsangs
in just five short days.

[NARRATOR] News of Crown
Prince Arslan's advancing army

14
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:56,416
preceded it, swiftly reaching
Ecbatana and Guiscard's ear.

15
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,500
[GUISCARD'S COURTIER E] Arslan's
forces supposedly number

16
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,958
sixty thousand.

17
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,208
They've passed by
Chasoom Fortress entirely

18
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,916
and are advancing west down
the Continental Highway.

19
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,041
It seems probable the
Parsians spread rumors

20
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:09,625
inflating their total
number of troops

21
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,125
in order to intimidate us.

22
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,125
More than likely, their
actual number is closer

23
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,250
to 30 or 40 thousand.

24
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,916
Assemble the troops
we have stationed here

25
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,416
in Ecbatana, immediately.

26
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,458
I want a force of
100 thousand men.

27
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,625
Perhaps I didn't hear
Your Highness correctly.

28
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,291
You wish for us to send
100 thousand of our men

29
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,833
against the enemy's
30 or 40 thousand?

30
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:38,375
To ready so many men
for war so quickly

31
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,375
is not an easy task.
A smaller force--

32
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,083
You understand
little of strategy.

33
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:48,166
[GUISCARD] That could be
playing right into their hands.

34
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,708
Perhaps they've crafted
their information in such a way

35
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:53,500
that we will send out
a smaller force.

36
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,083
With a larger number we can
crush them and have done.

37
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,125
[door opens]

38
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,916
It is exactly as
His Highness says.

39
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,958
Their tactician is
quite a crafty man.

40
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,541
He is known to use rumor
to serve his own purposes.

41
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:14,083
I have just returned
from my campaign.

42
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,875
[GUISCARD'S COURTIER D]
And a fruitful campaign it was,

43
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:17,916
we hear.

44
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,333
You and your troops
were successful

45
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:22,000
in ridding Zabul Fortress
of its infestation

46
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:23,583
of Temple Knight fanatics.

47
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:24,750
Impressive.

48
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,166
Although from what I have heard,

49
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,208
you failed to capture
Archpriest Bodin, didn't you?

50
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:30,916
Failed, did I?

51
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,125
Ha.

52
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,625
[GUISCARD'S COURTIER D]
What is so amusing?

53
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:36,083
That you judge me when you've
done so little yourselves.

54
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,458
[GUISCARD'S COURTIER E]
What was that?

55
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,583
[GUISCARD]
Easy, men.

56
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:43,708
Without his followers, Bodin is
as fearsome as a toothless dog.

57
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:47,083
I see little reason
to bother with him.

58
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,250
Now then, Highness,

59
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,125
I've returned from
a successful campaign

01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,666
with just under
30 thousand men.

61
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,791
If you would but lend me

62
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:56,750
some 70 thousand
of your Lusitanians,

63
01:04:56,833 --> 01:05:00,750
I would happily demolish
Arslan and his army for you.

64

You shall have them.

Wait.

You may command them for now,

but ultimately their
loyalty remains to me.

69

to remember that.

That's a pointless question.

I do not place my hope for the

01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,791
You sought help from those
filthy Lusitanian savages,

159
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:49,500
and in so using them, you
dragged me from my throne.

160
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:52,083
You do not truly believe
you deserve the credit

161
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,375
for your triumph over me.

162
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:56,041
Surely, you cannot
be so ignorant.

163
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,375
[HILMES]
What?

164
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,833
[ANDRAGORAS] You don't know, do
you? What a blind fool you are.

165
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,541
What're you talking about?

166
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:11,708
[ANDRAGORAS]
I speak of the blood

167
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,833
that drenches the
royal family of Pars.

168
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:17,375
[HILMES]
You sound like a madman.

169
01:10:17,458 --> 01:10:19,458
[ANDRAGORAS]
It is as it was prophesied.

170
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:20,833
Prophesied?

171
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,458
All is happening
just as was foretold.

172
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:27,333
Destiny moves you about
like a piece on a game board.

173
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,916
Even if you're too
ignorant to realize it.

174
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,958
[chuckles]

175
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:36,791
Don't think for a moment
you've won against me, boy.

176
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:37,958
Because you haven't.

177
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:39,250
[growls]

178
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:45,791
[ANDRAGORAS laughing]

179
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,208
This isn't the last
you'll see me.

180
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,416
And the next time I come,

181
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,375
I'll bring your son's
head as a souvenir.

182
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,041
The Black Knight is mine.

183
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,500
This time when we meet,
I will send him to his grave,

184
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,791
like he did to my father.

185
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,666
Pardon, Highness.

186
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,791
For now we are riding out to
defeat Arslan and his army,

187
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:40,333
but then it's back to
the capital, is it not?

188
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,833
To expel the Lusitanians?

189
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,750
You truly need to ask?

190
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,416
[NARSUS]
That's unfortunate.

191
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,375
I had intended to trick our
enemy into sending fewer troops

192
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,333
by understating
the number we had,

193
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:11,750
but it appears he's
seen through that ploy.

194
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:15,583
This man Guiscard is more
cunning than I'd anticipated.

195
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,666
A hundred thousand men.

196
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,416
Then they'll have the
advantage of us in numbers.

197
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,875
Yes.

198
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,416
[ELAM]
There is more.

199
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,541
Among the Parsian survivors,

200
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:28,083
it appears there's
a general named Sam.

201
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,500
Surely not!

202
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,000
[ALFARID]
You know him, then?

203
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:34,041
He's well known as a great
commander and a fierce fighter.

204
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,750
In other words, not someone
we want as an enemy.

205
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,000
I don't understand.

206
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,750
He fought loyally and
well under my father.

207
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,375
For the Atropatene battle,

208
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,791
he remained behind at the royal
palace to guard my mother.

209
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,833
Him turning like
this... is a shock.

210
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,583
Quite so. We will
need a new plan

211
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:55,500
that takes this
information into account.

212
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,750
[ARSLAN]
Indeed. Can you manage it?

213
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,875
I would stake my
reputation on it.

214
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,166
Of course you may count
on me, Your Highness.

215
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:05,250
I shall devise a plan
to win us this battle.

216
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:10,750
[swords clanging]

217
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:12,333
[DARYUN]
Upper!

218
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,916
Mid! Low!

219
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,500
[ARSLAN] I am asking
so much of everyone else.

220
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:20,291
I can ask no less of myself.

221
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,541
[yelling]

222
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:41,291
I fear I'll never be
a good swordsman.

223
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,250
[DARYUN]
Don't say that. It's not true.

224
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,625
You're strong now
and ever improving.

225
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,541
Besides, feats at
arms are one thing,

226
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,458
but a monarch has many skills.

227
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,208
Yes. I agree with you, but...

228
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:56,916
...I know I still must
improve many of those skills.

229
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,125
I hope to be a king who
makes his subjects proud.

230
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,583
Highness.

231
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,791
[ARSLAN]
Do you need something, men?

232
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,083
We're sorry, sir,
we didn't mean to gawk.

233
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:13,291
We just became distracted while
admiring your swordsmanship.

234
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,125
[ARSLAN'S SOLDIERS]
Excuse us, Highness.

235
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,208
[ARSLAN]
Wait just a moment!

236
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,583
Daryun.

237
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:22,125
There's a favor I would
like to ask of you.

238
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,291
[ARSLAN'S SOLDIER D]
Put your hip into it!

239
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,166
[FOOT SOLDIER A]
Yessir!

240
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:29,791
Your dominant hand goes in back.

241
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,000
Yessir!

242
01:14:32,375 --> 01:14:34,041
Just keep in mind, when
you're shooting an arrow,

243
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:36,125
you wanna stand tall
and keep your upper torso

244
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:38,583
in a straight line, like this.

245
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:39,791
Now you try.

246
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:40,958
Yes, sir.

247
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:44,958
You can stand
straighter than that.

248
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:49,083
[NARSUS]
Weapons training.

249
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,500
I take it the prince asked you
to show our newer recruits

250
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,791
how to handle themselves
on the battlefield.

251
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:55,291
How very like him.

252
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:56,625
Indeed.

253
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:02,000
There is not much time remaining

254
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,500
until His Highness must
face Prince Hilmes.

255
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,750
[DARYUN]
Hmm.

256
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:08,250
You're not still
concerned, are you?

257
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:11,166
Our Crown Prince is far
stronger than he looks.

258
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,333
And fiercer, too, if you ask me.

259
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:14,833
Yes, I know.

260
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:19,208
He seems truly determined to
take the throne. Even so...

261
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,541
[NARSUS]
Even so,

262
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,250
you fear his kind heart
will get the better of him

263
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:25,000
and he'll yield the
throne to his cousin.

264
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:27,333
Well, what if that
were to happen?

265
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:29,916
Would you become a loyal
follower of Prince Hilmes?

266
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,833
Now you're just
being ridiculous.

267
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:34,750
Let's keep faith in
the prince we follow.

268
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,666
I believe he's earned it.

269
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:40,583
[DARYUN]
Agreed.

270
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:54,875
It's Arlsan. May I enter?

271
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:55,958
[NARSUS]
Yes.

272
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,916
[ARSLAN]
Oh. I've interrupted you.

273
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,291
[NARSUS]
No, not at all.

274
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,375
In fact, I was just thinking
now might be a good time

275
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,083
to take a break.

276
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:07,208
Whoa! What is that?

277
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,958
It's a still life.

278
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:11,416
[NARSUS chuckling]

279
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,291
[ARSLAN] Of course it is. And,
as always... it's... lovely.

280
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:20,750
Now, it seems there's
something troubling you.

281
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:22,541
Yes, there is.

282
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,208
I was observing
some of the soldiers

283
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:25,666
while they trained today,

284
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,041
and I noticed
something interesting.

285
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:32,333
Ah. Were these any
soldiers in particular?

286
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,375
[ARSLAN]
The foot soldiers.

287
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:37,458
And what you noticed was they
seemed hesitant at first,

288
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,916
but as time passed, they
gained a sense of confidence

289
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,666
and pride in what
they were doing.

290
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,666
Does that describe what you saw?

291
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,416
It does. How did you know?

292
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,125
Before they came to
fight in your army,

293
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:50,166
all the foot soldiers
were slaves.

294
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,416
As such, it's highly
unlikely that any of them

295
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,458
have ever received
military training.

296
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:57,000
Of course. They did seem green.

297
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:00,416
Honestly, I'd think that would
make them even more reluctant

298
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,541
to participate in drills.

299
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:09,208
I know war is unforgiving and
that casualties are unavoidable.

300
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,000
When you lead
people into battle,

301
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,875
you're asking them to
fight and die for you.

302
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:16,750
But I don't want a single life
lost that doesn't have to be.

303
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,333
Especially due to inexperience.

304
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:22,083
That's why I wanted
to make sure

305
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:24,625
they were able to receive
at least some training.

306
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:26,541
You did a great thing.

307
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:30,583
It's human nature to question
ourselves. Who are we?

308
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,958
What are we meant to be doing?

309
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:35,500
In fact, I believe most
of us spend our entire lives

310
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:38,000
seeking those answers.

311
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,666
But slaves are
deprived of the chance

312
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:41,416
to even ask those questions.

313
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,916
They can do nothing
but follow orders.

314
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,625
Today you offered
them the opportunity

315
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,791
to learn something
of their own volition.

316
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:50,333
They could participate
in the training

317
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,791
because it was what they wanted.

318
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:55,750
As slaves, those men
were probably used

319
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:58,625
to lives of faceless
subordination.

320
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,666
But now they have a
cause they can fight for.

321
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,208
Something greater to
belong to if they wish it.

322
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,666
They finally have the chance
to wonder who they are

323
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,625
and what it is they
are meant to be doing.

324
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:12,291
You helped them move closer
to finding those answers.

325
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:14,125
Is that possible?

326
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:21,541
Now, is there anything else
weighing on your mind tonight?

327
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:24,000
That's all. I'm sorry.

328
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,416
Seems I'm always burdening you
and Daryun with my troubles,

329
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,708
aren't I?

330
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,083
I'm happy to help. I need
you to become king.

331
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:32,875
If you don't, I can't
realize my own dream.

332
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,250
It's been some time.

333
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:37,416
I hope you haven't forgotten
the promise you made me?

334
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:38,958
You mean my vow
that I will appoint you

335
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,041
to the post of Court Painter?

336
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,625
How could I ever
forget such a thing?

337
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,125
Excellent.

338
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:47,666
I look forward to
my appointment.

339
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,708
Here's a thought. Why don't
I paint a portrait of Daryun.

340
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:57,750
I shall title it: "The Night
Before the Decisive Battle."

341
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,666
What do you think?

342
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:02,125
Yes. Portrait...
that is an idea.

343
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:07,166
[ALFARID] It feels quieter
than usual, doesn't it?

344
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,500
Yes, it does.

345
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,958
Maybe it's because
Master Gieve is gone.

346
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:12,416
Maybe.

347
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,625
So, have you been
lonely, Farangis?

348
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:18,625
And what, pray tell,
would make you wonder that?

349
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:21,208
Well, because the two of you
had a special connection,

350
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,333
didn't you?

351
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:24,708
That is absurd.

352
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:25,666
However...

353
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,833
[ELAM, ALFARID]
Hm?

354
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:29,333
I have consulted the Djinn,

355
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:32,208
and they tell me his spirit
rides along beside us.

356
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:34,291
Is he dead or something?

357
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,833
No, no.

358
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:39,458
That man has more lives than
a cat. I'm sure he still lives.

359
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,166
That's a good point.

360
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,541
When I said his
spirit was here,

361
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,500
what I meant was
though he is far away,

362
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,125
his heart is still
with His Highness.

363
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:01,958
[NARRATOR]
The Keep of Saint Emmanuel.

364
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:05,291
A fortress that had long
been abandoned by Pars.

365
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,625
It took its name from a
Lusitanian religious figure.

366
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,541
When the Lusitanians invaded,

367
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:15,000
they restored the keep and made
it one of their strongholds.

368
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:17,916
Its current lord
was a man of virtue.

369
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
His name was Count Barcacion.

370
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,916
[ÉTOILE]
Sir, please! I don't understand.

371
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,208
Parsian soldiers
are entering the keep

372
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,375
and you're permitting
it to happen?

373
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:34,375
[BARCACION] Such a din
you raise. Calm yourself.

374
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,958
I received this.

375
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:40,000
It is an Imperial Decree from
His Majesty, Emperor Innocentis.

376
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,458
We have orders?

377
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:42,708
Indeed we do.

378
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:45,083
With the joint Parsian
and Lusitanian force,

379
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,083
we are to engage Arslan's army

380
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:49,500
here at the Keep
of Saint Emmanuel.

381
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,916
Further, our forces are
to be under the command

382
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,666
of Lord Silver Mask.

383
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:55,708
Why does he have command?

384
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,041
We are to prevent Arslan

385
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:59,750
from bringing his army
any closer to Ecbatana.

386
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,291
Those are our orders.

387
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,583
[ÉTOILE] I understand
that we must stop them.

388
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:04,916
But like this?

389
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,583
We're truly to go into
battle alongside heathens?

390
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,208
Have faith, Étoile.

391
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:12,375
Can you not think of this
as a trial sent to us by god?

392
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,000
Perhaps he sees fit to test us.

393
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:17,708
But, sir...

394
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,458
Are we clear?

395
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,083
I understand.

396
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:28,875
[sighs]

397
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:45,750
I wish I knew.
Is this, too, a trial?

398
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:01,166
[ANDRAGORAS]
It is as it was prophesied.

399
01:22:03,291 --> 01:22:07,916
A prophesy, is it?
I am not fate's pawn.

400
01:22:37,208 --> 01:22:39,583
The time has come.

401
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:40,791
Sir.

402
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,083
Sir.

403
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,541
Then we go.

404
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:51,208
It will not be easy,
but when we are finished,

405
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,333
the kingdom will be ours!

406
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,333
[NARRATOR]
With a dusky silver blade,

407
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:38,041
the Knight in Black
drew a bright scarlet arc

408
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,625
through the air.

409
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:43,291
Next time, "The Battle for
the Keep of Saint Emmanuel."

410
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:46,541
And thus would the
boy become a king.
