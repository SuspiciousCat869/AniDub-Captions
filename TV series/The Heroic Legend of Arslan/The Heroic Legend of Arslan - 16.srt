Have we received word?

Yes. Sir, Gadhevi has
left from Uraiyur.

00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,083
He's leading their
war elephants.

Hmph.

They will not be
easily defeated.

Even King Andragoras never
dared to face the elephants

Our reports indicate

12
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:12,000
that Rajendra has circled
his army behind Gadhevi's.

13
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,791
Well, of all the possible
situations I had considered,

14
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,916
we face the one that requires
the greatest creativity.

[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, early in the year 321.

16
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:32,041
Gadhevi's army took the field,
supported by war elephants,

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,541
whose invincibility
was well known.

18
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,958
Set to oppose them
were the allied forces

19
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,000
of Rajendra and Arslan.

20
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,375
But even together,

21
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,416
their numbers were less
than half that of Gadhevi's.

22
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:50,583
Today we defeat Rajendra, who
seeks a throne that is not his.

23
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,083
This usurper must be destroyed!

24
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,333
Gadhevi has lost every
battle he's fought.

25
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,666
He is inept as
leader and general.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,416
He simply does not
deserve the throne!

27
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,166
[NARSUS] This is our ten
thousand Parsian troops.

28
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,166
Here are Gadhevi's 150 thousand.

29
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,291
And, finally,
Rajendra's 50 thousand.

30
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,916
We have them caught between us.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,041
Ordinarily, that would
be a tactical advantage.

32
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,291
Yes.

33
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,333
But when the enemy
outnumbers us so severely,

34
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,666
it is of no significance.

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,166
Gadhevi could easily send
20 thousand of his men

36
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,416
against our forces,

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,666
keeping us neatly pinned down.

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,666
His remaining 130 thousand men

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,833
would be free to
strike at Rajendra.

40
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,333
In which case, we will
certainly be defeated.

41
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,166
This battle is beginning
to seem unwinnable.

[MAHENDRA]
Prince Gadhevi!

48
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,375
[MAHENDRA] Your anger
is justified, of course!

49
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,250
I humbly beg for
the chance to atone.

50
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,291
You would abase yourself so?
And for a mere spy?

51
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,166
[GADHEVI]
I shall honor this request.

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,083
Out of respect for Mahendra,
you will keep your head for now.

53
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,458
However.

54
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,333
Fail me again in even
the smallest way,

55
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,375
and I will show no mercy.

56
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,625
I will not disappoint you again.

57
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,458
We shall be triumphant.

58
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,833
Our fighting strength remains
vastly superior to theirs.

59
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,416
I cannot imagine a situation
in which we could face defeat.

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
I'm well aware of that.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,791
Are you going to be
all right, Jaswant?

62
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,750
[JASWANT]
I am so deeply sorry.

63
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,000
My failure is inexcusable.

64
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,375
To have brought trouble
upon you, Lord Mahendra.

65
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,708
[MAHENDRA] I am fine.
It was not your fault.

66
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,708
We are simply faced with an
uncommonly resourceful enemy.

67
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,458
And, regrettably,

68
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,666
First Prince Gadhevi lacks
compassion for his people.

69
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,208
As it stands,

70
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,291
he will only continue to lose
the hearts of his subjects.

71
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,041
Is that what it takes?

72
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,708
The Parsian prince
cares for his subjects,

73
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,541
and they for him, as well.

74
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,083
[DARYUN] The scouts tell us
that Gadhevi has indeed

75
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,416
divided his army.

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,916
One group is headed
in our direction,

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,666
while the other has been sent
against Rajendra's army.

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,250
Once again, things are
progressing as you predicted.

79
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,375
The enemy is following
standard tactical practice.

80
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,916
However,

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,166
Gadhevi is mistaken if he thinks
Pars is a standard opponent.

82
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,500
To be honest,

83
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,041
I find the conflict between
Gadhevi and Rajendra

84
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,375
feels distressingly familiar.

85
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,250
I am assuming it
puts you in mind

86
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,708
of the struggle between
Prince Arslan and Prince Hilmes?

87
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,208
How could it not?

88
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,125
In time, His Highness will have
to confront Prince Hilmes.

89
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,416
What path will he take?

90
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,708
What will that
confrontation look like?

91
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,416
Will he be up to the challenge?

92
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,833
When that time comes,

93
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,916
His Highness's fitness to
rule will be scrutinized.

army faced each other

across the battlefield, prepared
for a fierce and brutal fight.

formally declare
you crown prince.

had me to compare you to?

00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,583
[GADHEVI SOLDIER K]
Think you can turn your back?

161
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,541
An excellent idea, Gieve.

162
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,916
[RAJENDRA]
How have you come here?

163
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,250
I had word that you and your men
were trapped in the fortress.

164
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,500
I thought we'd lost
our reinforcements.

165
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,625
We were not as
trapped as we seemed.

166
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,166
What?

167
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,458
[NARSUS]
I would wager

168
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,791
the soldiers who breached
the fortress walls

169
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,291
are feeling more than
a little disappointed.

170
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,458
They'll most likely know
by now they were tricked

171
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,333
into guarding a harmless
pile of stones.

172
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,000
There's no one within
the fortress, sir!

173
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,958
What do you mean?
Where are they?

174
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,500
Excuse me, sir.

175
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,583
A few Parsian soldiers were seen
fleeing from the back gate.

176
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,208
They what? Sly dogs.

177
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,750
Their main force must have
escaped before we even arrived.

178
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:53,208
Arg! Damn them! Damn! Damn!

179
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,750
[laughs] I should've
expected this of you!

180
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,750
You're a masterful
schemer indeed.

181
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,041
You honor me with such
praise, Your Highness.

182
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,541
Still, the most critical
part of the plan remains.

183
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,750
We must find a way to neutralize
Gadhevi's war elephants.

184
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,958
Yes.

185
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,333
I promise, it can be done.

186
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,541
As you'll see, the true
worth of our cavalry

187
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,541
lies in their mobility
and tactical flexibility.

188
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,166
Charge the Parsian army!

189
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,458
They won't stand
against the elephants!

190
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,875
[MALE ELEPHANT TRAINER A]
Remember, our target is Pars!

191
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,375
[MALE ELEPHANT TRAINER B]
Crush them!

192
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,708
[DARYUN]
Now, men!

193
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,458
[PARS ARMY yelling]

194
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,791
Close ranks!

195
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,458
[GADHEVI laughing]

196
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,500
Just look. Unbeatable
Pars is retreating.

197
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,208
Even their vaunted cavalry flees
before my fearsome beasts.

198
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,250
[JASWANT] We must stop
the charge, Your Highness!

199
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,458
Please! Something is not right.

200
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,500
I beg you to stop the elephants!

201
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,333
And why would I do such a thing?

202
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,833
This is a golden opportunity
to annihilate the enemy.

203
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,375
We will run down their
army to the last man!

204
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,333
I shall ride, as well!

205
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,875
You're making a mistake.

206
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,666
What's that up ahead?

207
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,791
Is it a trap?

208
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,583
Stop the charge!

209
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,000
It isn't obeying my commands!

210
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,041
By the gods.

211
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,333
[NARSUS]
Given their size,

212
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,791
elephants are not naturally
nimble creatures.

213
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,083
And when they've been whipped
into a drug-induced frenzy,

214
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,875
there's no stopping them.

215
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,333
Fire at will!

216
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,250
[NARSUS] Arrows will not
pierce an elephant's hide.

217
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,666
Instead, we are shooting
spears tipped with poison

218
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,500
so striking a killing
blow is not necessary.

219
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,000
Stop the stupid beast!

220
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,500
We should have time
at this distance.

221
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,750
[ELEPHANT RIDER D]
Halt, you!

222
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,208
Stop, do you hear me?

223
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,583
[ELEPHANT RIDER D]
Prince Gadhevi, Your Highness!

224
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,500
It's Pars's black knight!

225
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,458
[GADHEVI'S CAVALRYMAN A]
Protect the prince!

226

[GADHEVI CAVALRY yelling]

227
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,166
So, we carry the same weapon.

228
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,500
Let him come. I will show him
my skill with the spear!

229
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,250
[DARYUN]
Hiyah!

230
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,291
Go! We ride for
the black knight!

231
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,375
[ELEPHANT RIDER D]
Yes, sir!

[GADHEVI yelps]

234
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,791
Prepare yourself.

235
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,500
[JASWANT]
Prince Gadhevi!

236
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,916
[GADHEVI]
What're you doing?

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,083
[JASWANT]
Please hold on.

238
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,208
You won't get away.

239
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,833
[ARSLAN]
Hold fire!

240
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,041
Please, stop. Put your bow down.

241
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,416
As you wish, Your Highness.

242
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,083
But this will now
be the second time

243
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,000
you have spared that man's life.

244
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,541
Though you are merciful,

245
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,125
I hope that mercy is repaid
with gratitude, not with blood.

246
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,375
[NARRATOR]
And so ended the battle

247
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,166
upon the Fields of Chandigarh.

248
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,208
Desperate, Gadhevi's forces

249
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:29,875
allowed the elephants
to be annihilated, and fled.

250
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,000
The battle was an
undisputed victory

251
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,875
for the allied forces
of Rajendra and Arslan.

252
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,791
[GADHEVI] Why did you
flee the battlefield?

253
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,958
And I am not interested
in any feeble excuses

254
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,500
about saving my life!

255
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,666
Your Highness. I've no excuse.

256
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,333
[GADHEVI]
By leaving the field of battle,

257
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,583
I assured the defeat of my army.

258
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,500
A First Prince
should never flee!

259
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,291
Surely flight is
better than death.

260
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,250
[GADHEVI] Focus on assuring our
victory, not arguing with me!

261
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,958
I will not tolerate
another defeat!

262
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,333
I understand
completely, Highness.

263
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,125
Well. Isn't that a load off.

264
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,708
My heart is troubled.

265
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,541
I may have made a mistake
in whom I chose to advise.

266
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,666
[JASWANT]
I must apologize again.

267
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,000
Once more, my actions have
resulted in your disgrace.

268
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,333
Whether he sees fit to
thank you for it or not,

269
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,125
your intervention
is the only reason

270
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,708
Prince Gadhevi is still alive.

271
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,083
We have one hope.

272
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,541
The walls of the Royal
Capital are all that stand

273
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,250
between Rajendra and
the throne of Sindhura.

274
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,333
You must see that they hold.

275
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,958
I will do all I can.

276
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,500
I cannot promise to succeed,

277
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,791
but you have my word I will
serve you well and faithfully.

278
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,083
[GADHEVI SOLDIER L]
Pardon, sir!

279
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,250
An urgent message.

280
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,208
The king is awake!

281
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,333
[BOTH]
What?

282
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,583
[GADHEVI]
Lord Father!

283
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,583
Come closer.
Is that you, Gadhevi?

284
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,666
I am glad to see you have
recovered some of your strength.

285
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,750
And everything is well here?

286
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,791
Yes.

287
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,625
Go call Rajendra
into my chamber.

288
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,166
I should like to
see his face as well.

289
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,666
It saddens me to
tell you, Father,

290
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,958
but Rajendra seeks to kill me.

291
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,416
He would take my place
in the succession.

292
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,333
He what?

293
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,291
[GADHEVI]
He has gathered soldiers to him,

294
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,166
men who should be loyal to me,

295
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,375
and even now he seeks
to invade the capital.

296
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,750
I beg you, Father,

297
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,458
put an end to this violence.

298
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,166
Punish my brother
as he deserves,

299
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,666
and formally declare me the
heir to Sindhura's throne.

300
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,333
Foolish boys.

301
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,625
The kingdom is not
a toy to squabble over

302
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,541
like spoiled children.

303
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,291
I had thought you
would grow out of this.

304
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,375
[GADHEVI] But if you would
only name me heir.

305
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,875
It is too weighty a
decision for a sick old man.

306
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,958
And so I will not make it.

307
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,958
Instead this will be settled
by those with greater wisdom.

308
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,958
Let it be known:
The next heir of Sindhura

309
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,208
will be determined by
a duel before the gods.

310
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,208
A duel before the gods, you say?

311
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,333
[RAJENDRA]
Hm.

312
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,333
And what is that, exactly?

313
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,083
[FARANGIS] My understanding
is that in Sindhura

314
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,833
such a duel is something of an
alternative to holding a trial.

315
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,208
The two who have a
quarrel fight one another.

316
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,500
The victor is recognized
as the righteous one,

317
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,500
having been chosen by the gods.

318
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,666
Is that right?

319
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,291
[RAJENDRA]
Yes. That is a good description.

320
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,458
Essentially, Gadhevi and I are
to meet in single combat,

321
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,666
and whoever wins will
be named the next king.

322
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,041
It seems to me the king
of Sindhura didn't care

323
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,041
to take responsibility
for the succession

324
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,625
upon his own shoulders.

325
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:05,083
So instead he simply foisted off
the decision onto the gods.

326
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,666
It is strange.

327
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,250
A man wins a fight,
so his cause is righteous?

328
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,625
I find that troubling.

329
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,000
As you say.

330
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,583
It's a rather flawed method
of settling a dispute.

331
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,208
However, for our purposes,
it is not without merit.

332
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,000
How so?

333
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,500
It ends the need for our armies

334
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,666
to keep slaughtering
one another.

335
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,250
A duel will settle everything
with but a single casualty.

336
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,916
[RAJENDRA] There is another
factor to consider.

337
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,208
The combatants can name
champions to fight for them,

338
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,916
and though it wounds my pride,
I have a great favor to ask.

339
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,041
Brave Lord Daryun.

340
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,458
I ask you to serve as
my proxy in this duel.

341
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:52,291
Prince Arslan, Lord Daryun.
I beg of you. Grant me this.

342
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,833
[NARRATOR]
Arslan has no more loyal subject

343
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,041
or fierce protector than Daryun.

344
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,958
Will it prove a mistake
for the prince to risk

345
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,541
his Black Knight fighting
for another man's cause?

346
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,166
Next time: "The Duel
Before the Gods."

347
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,958
And thus would the
boy become a king.
