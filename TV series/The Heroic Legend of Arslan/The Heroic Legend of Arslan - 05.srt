1
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,416
I would add my
voice to Daryun's.

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,208
I'd feel more confident
with both of you by my side.

3
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,750
I hate to refuse
you a second time.

4
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,500
Well, then, accept my offer.

5
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,166
I hope you don't think your
loyalty would go unrewarded.

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,791
I would compensate
you handsomely.

7
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,291
Once I have driven
off the Lusitanians

8
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,250
and succeeded my father
on the throne of Pars,

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,958
I promise you this.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,750
I will appoint you,
Lord Narsus, Court Painter!

11
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,791
[NARSUS]
Uh.

12
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:05,250
[NARSUS chuckling]

13
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,208
I find I like you, Highness.

14
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,666
What say you?
From his lips, Daryun.

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,208
His Highness has
magnanimity of spirit!

16
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,250
Your Highness, you would truly
appoint Narsus Court Painter?

17
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,291
Doing that would leave
an indelible stain

18
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,166
upon Parsian culture!

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,708
It seems a worthy trade.

20
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,083
At least, I know what
I would choose

21
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,916
between Narsus painting
a living portrait of me

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,250
versus a Lusitanian artist
painting my death portrait.

23
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,583
But do consider.

24
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,875
King Andragoras finds the
very mention of my name

25
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,458
to be offensive.

26
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,583
This offer of yours will surely
cause him great displeasure.

27
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,041
Are you willing to
accept that, Highness?

28
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,625
Without question.

29
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,000
[NARSUS]
Very well.

30
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:48,291
I pledge you my sword and
what wisdom I may have.

31
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,833
I am at your command,
Prince Arslan.

32
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,333
I accept your service gladly.

33
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,333
And now that that's settled,
we need to depart in haste.

34
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,500
We must return to the Royal
Capital as soon as possible.

35
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,833
Yes. We'll just pack our
bags and ready the horses.

36
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,416
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
Ah, one thing, Elam.

38
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,833
Sir?

39
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,750
I believe I'll have a friend
in the port town of Gilan

40
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,625
look after you while I'm away.

41
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,291
Uh. My lord, why?

42
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,833
The man I have in mind
owns a merchant ship.

43
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,125
So if the Lusitanian
incursion continues,

44
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,541
you can take to the sea.

45
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,375
Even crossing to foreign
lands, should need be.

46
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,500
You should at least
be safe there.

47
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't wanna go to sea!

48
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,291
I owe you a greater debt than
I could ever hope to repay

49
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,666
even were I to spend a
lifetime in your service.

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,458
I beg you to let me accompany
you on this journey, my lord.

51
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,583
[NARSUS]
It will be dangerous,

52
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,250
and you're hardly
more than a child.

53
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,625
I cannot ask you to risk
your life in such a way.

54
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,791
[ELAM] I am more of an
adult than you, my lord.

55
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:45,916
[NARSUS gasps]

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,250
Sorry, but the fact is,

57
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,250
you're incapable of doing
anything for yourself!

58
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,750
There's the laundry,
and cleaning,

59
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,416
acquiring art supplies.

60
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,875
[DARYUN] You have to admit,
the boy has a point.

61
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,125
Quiet, you.

62
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,500
Help me convince him.
He'll listen to you.

63
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,666
[ARSLAN]
Narsus, I make another request.

64
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,708
Your Highness.

65
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,208
[ARSLAN]
Allow Elam to come.

66
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,791
If we were to leave him behind,

67
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,125
who else could prepare
such delicious meals?

68
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,958
We might starve out there.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,208
It's settled, then.

70
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,833
Elam, I look forward
to having you along.

71
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,833
And I look forward to coming.

72
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,083
I'll see to the bags
and horses now.

73
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,208
[ARSLAN]
Excuse me.

74
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,333
I must get my things
in order, as well.

75
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,750
Let me help. Is there
some task I can perform?

76
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,500
As I've explained before,
Your Highness,

77
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,625
you need not trouble yourself.

78
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:34,708
[ARSLAN]
But I'm happy to.

79
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,041
Surely there's something
you could use...

80
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,083
As you can imagine, His
Highness had little chance

81
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,833
to make friends
his own age at Court.

82
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,666
[DARYUN]
He and Elam are of an age.

83
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,583
It would be nice if they
could form a friendship.

84
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,375
[ARSLAN]
All right, if you're sure.

85
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,166
[NARRATOR]
Pars Era, the year 320. Autumn.

86
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,458
When Prince Arslan made good
his escape from the battlefield,

87
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,458
he had only the warrior
Daryun at his back.

88
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,875
To his company,

89
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,666
he now adds the strategist
Narsus and his page, Elam.

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,333
The four set out upon a journey

91
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,708
that will be nothing
if not perilous.

92
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,541
[KHARLAN'S MAN B] 
What? The horses!

93
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,458
Where are they?

94
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,833
[KHARLAN'S MAN A]
Damn that man!

95
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,791
Well, they won't
escape so easily.

96
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,291
We already have men in place
along the mountain path

97
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,000
ready to intercept them.

98
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,291
The poor fools. They've headed
down the mountain on foot.

99
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,291
[NARSUS]
How unfortunate for them.

100
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,625
There is very little likelihood

101
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,000
they will reach
bottom by day's end.

102
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:40,500
It would be tragic if they came
across a bear or pack of wolves.

103
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,666
[NARSUS]
Your Highness.

104
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,458
There is something
weighing on you.

105
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,916
I can't stop thinking
about Ecbatana.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,291
Your frustration
is understandable,

107
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,458
but have patience.

108
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,791
Were we to descend
the mountain immediately,

109
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,916
a fight with Kharlan
would be unavoidable.

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,125
Better to remain in this cave
for a bit and wait them out.

111
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,916
We can use the time to think of
a way to turn their scrutiny

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,250
to our advantage.

113
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,333
How do we do that?

114
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,125
We can't leave until
they stop looking for us.

115
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,875
So we draw their focus
where we want it to go.

116
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:20,791
Controlling the game play, the
first step in any good strategy.

117
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,750
No matter your military prowess,

118
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,250
the goal of a sound plan
is to secure victory

119
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,833
without exhausting
your strength.

120
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,583
[ARSLAN]
Daryun used his strength.

121
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,916
He broke through a
whole army to get to me.

122
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,541
And there is no
denying his valor.

123
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,375
But warriors like Daryun
are one in a thousand.

124
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,916
If the commander of an
army hopes to succeed,

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
when planning for battle he
must use his weakest soldier

126
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,416
as his standard.

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,208
This holds doubly true
for the monarch of a kingdom,

128
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,833
who must devise his plans

129
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,000
so that even his least competent
commander is used to advantage.

130
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,000
[DARYUN]
Hmph.

131
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,458
What's funny?

132
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,541
Nothing at all. Do continue.

133
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,958
If he puts too great an emphasis
on strength over strategy,

134
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,041
should that strength
then fail, the war is lost.

135
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,250
You were there at Atropatene.

136
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,333
You know how disastrous
such a situation can be.

137
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,416
[NARSUS] King Andragoras
had never experienced

138
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,208
the sting of defeat.

139
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:21,041
Because his army was so strong,
he had no interest in politics.

140
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,875
Relying instead upon battle
to resolve all conflict.

141
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,916
If you would be his
successor in that,

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,125
I beg of you to stop
wasting both of our time

143
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,666
and tell me now.

144
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,041
Because I say to you, I would
not serve such a king,

145
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,125
not even as Court Painter.

146
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,041
I take your words to heart.

147
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,041
And as for you. Should we
come upon Kharlan,

148
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,500
do not kill him.

149
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,166
We need information. There's
more to this than we know.

150
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
I'm well aware.

151
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,708
[ARSLAN]
What kind of information?

152
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,125
I cannot yet guess
at the specifics,

153
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,250
which makes me fear
the truth is unthinkable.

154
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,875
[KHARLAN] There were
circumstances, Highness.

155
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,000
Poor, pitiable prince.

156
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,166
Truth of it is, you've
done nothing wrong.

157
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,166
No, you've done
nothing wrong,

158
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,125
and yet, you must
die here today.

159
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,625
[ARSLAN]
Something truly remarkable.

160
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:36,791
[AZRAEL squawking]

161
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,916
[ALL]
Huh?

162
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,916
That's Azrael.

163
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,333
Why are you here?

164
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,833
I sent you to accompany
Prince Arslan in his battle.

165
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,333
[SOLDIER C]
Lord Kishward!

166
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,166
I've been looking all over, sir!

167
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,541
[KISHWARD]
What's the matter?

168
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,000
[BAHMAN]
Kishward!

169
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,500
[KISHWARD]
What is it, Lord Bahman?

170
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,875
What's happened?

171
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,083
A mounted courier has just
arrived from Atropatene.

172
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,833
What news then from
the battlefield?

173
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,083
[BAHMAN] Our army was
slaughtered on the fields.

174
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,250
And after the battle, King
Andragoras went missing!

175
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,750
[BAHMAN] The Lusitanian
Army is closing in

176
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,333
on the walls of Ecbatana.

177
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,208
The Royal Capital is threatened!

178
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,291
[RESIDENTS whispering]

179
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,083
[RESIDENT A] We're surrounded
by Lusitanian soldiers?

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,708
[RESIDENT B]
What happened at Atropatene?

181
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,791
[RESIDENT C]
Surely our army wasn't defeated.

182
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,041
[RESIDENT D] With King
Andragoras commanding? Never.

183
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,375
[RESIDENT E] But they say the
enemy's surrounding the capital.

184
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,750
[RESIDENT F]
Probably a lie.

185
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,458
[RESIDENT J]
Then where is the king?

186
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,708
[RESIDENT G]
What's happening?

187
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,208
Are we going to die?

188
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,500
[MALE RESIDENT H] The walls
of Ecbatana are impregnable.

189
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,000
They'll never fall.

190
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,208
[PARSIAN SOLDIER A]
What's that?

191
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:16,916
[BOTH gasp]

192
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,666
Those bastards! Look!

193
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,208
[SAM]
Their captive.

194
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,958
It's Lord Shapur.

195
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,125
[PARSIAN SOLDIER D]
Impossible!

196
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,166
[PARSIAN SOLDIER E] They've
taken one of the Marzban!

197
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,750
Hear me, heathens!

198
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,916
All among you who know
not the grace of god!

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,125
Consider me a holy emissary.

200
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,916
I am Grand Inquisitor
Archpriest Bodin.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,041
I bring the Word of the
One God, God of Yaldabaoth.

202
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,750
Listen to me well!

203
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,291
Using the body of this
heathen as our medium,

204
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,916
we shall convey
to you god's will.

205
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,125
[BODIN]
How?

206
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,875
We will begin by cutting off
one toe from his left foot.

207
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,541
Then we'll cut off
another, and another.

208
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,000
When we're done with the left,
we'll move on to the right.

209
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,291
After that, his hands.

210
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,916
[chuckling]

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,375
Minute by excruciating
minute, we will show you

212
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,625
what befalls those foolish
enough to defy god!

213
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,666
[BODIN laughing, LUSITANIAN
SOLDIERS cheering]

214
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,166
Filthy savage!

215
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,791
Only a coward would
do something so barbaric!

216
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,625
[PARSIAN SOLDIER H]
You animals worship an evil god!

217
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,041
[PARSIAN SOLDIER I]
Don't you touch Lord Shapur!

218
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,833
[chuckles]

219
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,916
[PARSIAN SOLDIER J]
Stop it!

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,750
This creature is an apostle of
evil who seeks to deny god!

221
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Those like him are
more beast than man!

222
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,333
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

223
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,416
There can be no mercy
for any heathen!

224
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,333
[SHAPUR]
I've had enough of this.

225
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,666
[BODIN]
Huh?

226
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't listen to any more
of the blatant hypocrisy

227
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,958
that spews from your mouth.

228
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,583
Kill me and have done.

229
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,916
I would sooner go to
the deepest pit of hell

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,916
than to any heaven
your god has to offer me.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,791
And from there,
I will happily watch

232
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,833
as your kingdom is
destroyed from within,

233
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,750
brought low in the end
by your own cruelty.

234
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,041
Though you deserve far worse.

235
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,375
[BODIN]
Why you sinful cur!

236

You heathen scum!
You cursed beast!

You enemy of god!

238
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,916
[BODIN]
Do you have more to say?

[SHAPUR grunting]

240
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,875
You on the walls of Ecbatana!

241
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,000
Pierce me now with an arrow!

242
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,083
It's too late to save my life!

243
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,291
Don't give them the
satisfaction of torturing me!

244
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,708
I would die with honor!

245
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,125
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER A]
Enough!

246
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,458
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER B]
No arrow will reach you here.

247
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,208
We'll try, Lord Shapur!

248
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,833
You heard him! Start shooting!

249
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,500
[PARSIAN ARCHER B]
I'm aiming for the priest!

[PARSIAN SOLDIER M]
Savages!

251
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,666
The fools. We are well
out of arrow range here.

252
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,708
[BODIN] By all means!
Keep wasting those arrows!

[SHAPUR exhales]

256
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,125
It's not safe, Lord Archpriest.
Please stand back.

257
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,500
[BODIN] Was that shot
really fired from the wall?

258
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,416
Who fired that?
Bring him to me now!

259
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,125
It shouldn't be possible.
Not from that far.

260
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,708
Hey, look up there!

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,708
[TAHAMENAY]
I want that man brought to me.

262
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,875
[LADY-IN-WAITING C] The one who
fired the killing shot, my lady?

263
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,125
[TAHAMENAY]
We must grant him a boon.

264
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:42,875
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS yelling]

265
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,958
Fire at will, men!

266
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,166
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER D]
Forward!

267
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,958
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER E]
Kill the filthy heathens!

268
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,416
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER F]
Before this day is done,

269
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,291
we'll teach the blind fools
to fear the wrath of god!

270
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,041
A message for your god.

271
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,375
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER H]
Slaughter the heathens

272
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,750
and make an offering
of their city!

273
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,333
Give these devils the
deaths they deserve!

274
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,833
Will you tell us
your name, archer?

275
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,750
[ARCHER]
If it pleases my Lady Queen.

276
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:50,416
I am called Gieve, and
I am a traveling musician.

277
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,458
[LADY-IN-WAITING A gasps]

278
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,833
[GIEVE]
I play the oud.

279
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,916
I am also a flautist, a singer,
a poet, and a dancer.

280
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,250
In addition to my
talents as a performer,

281
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,583
I must admit I wield
the bow, sword, and spear

282
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,916
better than your
average soldier.

283
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You have demonstrated your skill
with a bow for all to see.

284
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,958
I thank you for
saving loyal Shapur

285
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,750
from further suffering
at Lusitanian hands.

286
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,958
I am not to be charged with
his murder, then, Your Majesty?

287
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,500
[LADY-IN-WAITING A] I beg your
forgiveness for interrupting,

288
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,083
my lady, but that man
is a base charlatan!

289
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,083
Explain this accusation.

290
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,916
You claimed to be royalty from
the Principality of Sistan,

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,875
traveling abroad as part
of your warrior training.

292
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:34,958
Don't deny it!

293
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,208
You told me that
story just last night!

294
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,875
I don't deny it.

295
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,291
And now you tell the
queen you're a musician!

296
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,875
Which means you lied
about being a prince!

297
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,541
T'was not a lie, but a dream.

298
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,625
A lovely dream I invited
you to share with me

299
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,541
for one exquisite night.

300
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,875
[PARSIAN SOLDIER R]
He's got a smooth tongue on him,

301
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,250
doesn't he?

302
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,083
[GIEVE] Dreams are such
precious, beautiful things.

303
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,041
It is a shame that
they must fade and die

304
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,208
with the harsh light of day.

305
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,500
Had you but accepted
it for what it was,

306
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,250
the dream could've
become a memory,

307
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,375
growing ever sweeter
as time passed

308
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,125
and lending depth and
richness to your life.

309
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,833
I will say I find myself
eternally confounded

310
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:15,541
by how easily moved women are
upon hearing the word "prince."

311
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,416
It seems to me a great weakness.

312
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,916
But when woman after woman
dreams of a prince in disguise--

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,458
And now you've demonstrated
your eloquence for us as well.

314
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,958
Your list of skills
is truly impressive.

315
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,416
Perhaps you would be so kind
as to display your talent

316
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,291
as a minstrel next?

317
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,416
Well.

318
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
[GIEVE]
Even as we speak,

319
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,583
the heroes of Ecbatana
stand strong on the city walls,

320
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,916
defending the Royal Capital.

321
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,833
For them, I offer this tale of
the Heroic Deeds of Kaykhusraw.

322
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,291
[GIEVE] Upon the desolate
plains of Mazangran,

323
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,583
Kaykhusraw's royal
standard proudly rippled.

324
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,833
Evil Zah-hak's army fled,
scattering in confused fright,

325
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:24,791
as a flock of sheep flees the
rolling boom of spring thunder.

326
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,125
They fled Kaykhusraw
and his sword, Rukhnabad,

327
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,875
which, forged from
a piece of the sun,

328
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,000
could cleave even steel.

329
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,416
They fled Kaykhusraw
and his horse Rakh-shna,

330
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,791
who, possessed
of invisible wings,

331
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,625
was truly a steed
worthy of the Jahangir.

332
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,416
Just as there is only
one sun in the heavens,

333
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,000
so is there only one
Shah upon the earth.

334
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,666
The hero with
no equal, Kaykhusraw.

335
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,416
With sun-forged sword and winged
steed, who will him succeed?

336
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,458
[CROWD applauding, murmuring]

337
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,500
Excellence deserves reward.

338
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,833
One hundred pieces for
your deed with the bow,

339
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,416
and another hundred
for your music.

340
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,583
I award you 200
gold pieces in total.

341
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,958
[GIEVE]
What, is that all?

342
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,416
For that performance, I was
expecting at least 500.

343
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,833
I have already deducted
a sum for the crime

344
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:35,333
of having misrepresented
yourself to my lady-in-waiting.

345
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,541
Majesty.

346
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,958
[NARSUS] Given Ecbatana's
distance from Atropatene,

347
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,583
the Lusitanian army has
most likely already launched

348
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,791
a full-scale attack on the city.

349
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,625
Now, the gates of the
Royal Capital are sturdy.

350
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,833
They will not be brought down

351
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,750
with flaming arrows
or battering rams.

352
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,583
However, there is no such
thing as an impregnable wall.

353
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:05,041
No matter how sturdy, a wall
can always be breached.

354
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,750
[ARSLAN]
I see.

355
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,500
You're saying the gate
could be opened from within.

356
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,666
Yes.

357
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,916
[ARSLAN]
Surely not.

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,500
How could such a
thing even be done?

359
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,875
Quite easily.

360
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:17,916
[gasps]

361
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,875
[NARSUS] If I were
leading the Lusitanians,

362
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,583
do you know what I would do?

363
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,166
I wouldn't force the gates.

364
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,625
I'd open them with words
rather than arrows or swords.

365
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,250
[ARSLAN]
What do you mean?

366
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,583
If I wish to open the gates
of the city from within,

367
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,625
I need only
assistance from within.

368
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,458
But there's nobody
inside Ecbatana

369
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,791
who would aid the
Lusitanian army.

370
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,333
[ARSLAN]
Uh.

371
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,166
[ARSLAN]
Wait.

372
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,875
There may be some who would.

373
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,500
A great many.

374
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,958
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIER J]
Hear us, Parsian slaves!

375
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,875
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS]
All men are equal!

376
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,958
You deserve to be free!

377
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,625
How long will you bow your heads

378
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,000
to those who chain
and misuse you?

379
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,500
The time has come to rise up
against your masters!

380
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,041
[PARSIAN SOLDIER S] What tactic
are those bastards trying now?

381
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,375
What's the yelling for?

382
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,708
Who knows?

383
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,041
I don't understand the way
savages think, do you?

384
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,625
[SAM]
Very clever.

385
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,791
[LUSITANIAN SOLDIERS]
We speak the divine truth!

386
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:32,416
Under the God of Yaldabaoth,
the one and only god,

387
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,041
all men are equal.

388
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,583
Come to the aid
of Lusitania now.

389
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,000
You will be granted
the rights of a free man.

390
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,416
And riches beyond
your imagining.

391
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,166
Claim your freedom now!

392
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,000
Overthrow your
Parsian oppressors!

393
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,666
Fight the oppressors?

394
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,375
Claim our freedom?

395
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,375
Rise up against Pars?

396
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,208
They can be breached.

397
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,875
By the slaves within.

398
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,708
[NARRATOR] Though his methods
may be brutal and bloody,

399
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,125
the man in the silver
mask does not doubt

400
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:51,291
the righteousness of his cause.

401
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,916
Next time: "The Royal
Capital Burns ~Part Two~."

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,791
And thus would the
boy become a king.
