(crickets chirping)

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.716
SHINPEI: I know it sounds ridiculous.

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.970
But once you... once you see it...

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.392
The walking shadow...

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.647
(soft gasp)

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.899
Wait, oh my gosh, we need to warn Shiori!

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.026
The shadow's coming
and it's gonna kill someone.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.736
It's not a superstition!

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.197
She could be in danger, right, Shinpei?

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.326
SHINPEI: <i>Shiori Kobayakawa</i>
<i>saw her shadow just the same way.</i>

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.494
<i>She's in danger.</i>

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.996
Hey, we have to go find her right now!

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.999
-SHINPEI: <i>But wait.</i>
-(gasps)

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.336
<i>I definitely can't let Mio</i>
<i>go anywhere near that kind of danger.</i>

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.672
I have to go alone, Mio.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.300
(theme music)

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.389

(exhales deeply)

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:39.076
SHINPEI: <i>Looks like the store is closed.</i>
<i>This is bad. Nothing changed.</i>

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.243
-SHIOMI: Hey there!
-(gasps)

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.454
Wait. Is that you, Shinpei?

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.955
SHINPEI: Mrs. Shiomi!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.333
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.044
Uh, thanks. It's good to see you.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.963
We don't really have
convenience stores here.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.216
You're quite a long way from Tokyo, huh?

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.302
Well, I've always been a fan
of this place.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.929
They have green tea ice cream.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.598
(chuckles)
A little taste of home, yeah?

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:04.768
-It looks like it's closed today, though.
-Huh.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.397
Usually, they're open, unless they say
they'll be closed in advance.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.024
3RD GRADE, CLASS 1 SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.863
-SHIOMI: Hey, Koba? You there? Open up!
-(doorbell dings)

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.408
SHIOMI: That's unusual. Are they out?

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:20.701
SHINPEI: Oh.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:25.372
Oh, I guess they left it unlocked.
Anyone there? Koba? Hello?

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.874
You sure it's okay
to just go in like this?

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.209
Don't worry about it.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:30.669
Koba, you here?

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.754
(solemn music playing on TV)

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.636
Huh, that's weird.
Looks like they even left the TV on.

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:41.596
(breathes sharply)

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.143
SHIOMI: Hey, Koba? Koba, you here?

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.894
Koba, hello?

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.564
Anyone home?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:51.898
(gasps)

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:56.862
SHIOMI: So weird. Koba! Hello?

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:58.655
SHINPEI: <i>It's the shadow.</i>

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.907
<i>The shadow must have done this.</i>

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:05.245
<i>Totsumura's shadow</i>
<i>did the exact same thing to him.</i>

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.459
<i>Didn't you see this coming, Shinpei?</i>
<i>You could have done something about it.</i>

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.128
<i>You could have saved them, you know.</i>

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.797
<i>That's enough! These things are monsters.</i>

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.133
<i>I'm not going to get killed again.</i>

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.802
<i>All I can do is warn people</i>

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:24.014
<i>and do my best to observe everything</i>
<i>as closely as I can.</i>

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.769
<i>So, what have you observed so far today?</i>

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.815
<i>The food is untouched and has gone cold.</i>

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.151
<i>They were attacked yesterday.</i>

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:37.819
<i>Around dinnertime.</i>

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.071
(gasps)

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.954
<i>There are deep marks in the floorboards</i>
<i>like something smashed them.</i>

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.501
(music continues playing on TV)

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.378
<i>What on earth happened here?</i>

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.927
Mrs. Shiomi, I'm just gonna take
a quick look upstairs.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.262
SHIOMI: Okay. Sounds good.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.144
SHINPEI: <i>The two dark stains</i>
<i>must be from adults.</i>

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.355
<i>They're too big for a child.</i>

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.899
<i>I'm guessing</i>
<i>they're from Shiori's parents.</i>

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.903
<i>So, where is Shiori, then?</i>

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.168
-(trilling)
-(gasps)

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.505
(quivering)

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.590
(ominous music)

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:41.883
SHADOW SHIORI: Hey.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.636
(shaky breathing)
SHINPEI: <i>That's it.</i>

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.142
Do you remember if you saw a girl
who looked like you?

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.481
SHADOW SHIORI: Hey, why did you ask me
that yesterday?

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.151
SHINPEI: <i>I didn't do that</i>
<i>last time around.</i>

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:04.823
(gasps)

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.869
SHADOW SHIORI: You're just standing there
staring at me.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.288
Is there something on my face, or what?

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.792
Or is there something weird
about... about my body?

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:17.836
SHINPEI: <i>You bet there is.</i>

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.462
Shiori, it's you.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.968
SHINPEI: <i>The shadow I saw at the funeral</i>
<i>must have been Shiori Kobayakawa.</i>

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.180
You, uh, got your voice back.
Are you feeling better?

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.642
SHINPEI: <i>God, I couldn't come up</i>
<i>with a better question than that?</i>

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.312
-SHADOW SHIORI: Oh...
-(static)

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:39.316
Mommy and daddy said
I shouldn't say anything.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.070
Are you gonna answer my question?
Uh, never mind.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.031
(gasps)

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.285
No need to answer.

00:06:55.624 --> 00:06:57.042
I'll ask you later.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.088
SHINPEI: <i>I think I just caught</i>
<i>the shadow sickness.</i>

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.006
<i>No.</i>

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.678
<i>I had it from the beginning.</i>

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:10.722
SHIOMI: Shinpei, you okay?

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:11.640
(gasps)

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.517
Anyone here? See any sign of them at all?

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.562
(door creaks)

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.777
Uh...

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.785
SHIOMI: What's going on?
You have a stomach ache?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:32.911
SHINPEI: Uh, no.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:37.832
<i>So I guess Mrs. Shiomi</i>
<i>just saved my life without knowing it.</i>

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.339
<i>Shortly after Mrs. Shiomi</i>
<i>called the police,</i>

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.758
<i>I left the Kobayakawas' house.</i>

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.512
(pensive music)

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.098
<i>If I do nothing until noon,</i>
<i>the same thing will happen.</i>

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.687
<i>That woman I met on the ferry,</i>
<i>she has to know something.</i>

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.066
<i>Maybe I can figure out a way to save her.</i>

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.362
<i>I didn't see her at all this time around,</i>

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.115
<i>because the day started at the port.</i>

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.617
(breathes heavily)

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.622
<i>She had a lot of luggage.</i>
<i>No way she was taking a day trip.</i>

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.835
<i>I should check the hotels on the island.</i>

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.423
NAKAMURA: A suit?

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.509
SHINPEI: Yes. She was wearing a suit,
and had long hair.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.136
Hmm...

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.929
She was wearing glasses as well.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.347
Oh.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:35.890
Did you happen to see her?

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:40.019
Difficult to say. There are always lots
of tourists hanging around

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.147
-at this time of year.
-SHINPEI: Um...

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.773
She also had...

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.444
She also had huge, you know...

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:52.615
Ah! You mean her? Sure, I remember her!
She came by here. How could I forget?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.951
NAKAMURA: Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you said so this morning.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.911
You said you were looking for this woman.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.372
-She had glasses and really big boobs.
-SHINPEI: <i>Huh?</i>

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.708
NAKAMURA: She came by,
but she didn't stay overnight.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.877
She didn't stick around long, either.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.671
She just stopped by the cafe for a bit
in the late afternoon.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:10.633
You should hang out for a while, too,
check out our cafe.

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:16.681
SHINPEI: <i>I tried, but that woman</i>
<i>was impossible to track down,</i>

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.642
<i>I just couldn't seem to find her anywhere.</i>

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.605
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>that I can do on my own.</i>

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.400
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.111
LUNCH SPECIALS

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.196
(bell chimes)

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.822
Hi, how are you?

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.744
Oh, Shin-chan.
So how'd it go? How is Shiori?

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.370
SHINPEI: Oh... Mm...

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:40.705
Ah!

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.165
MIO: Hello, good morning!

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.458
SHINPEI: <i>Totsumura.</i>

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.169
It's so damn hot out. Hey!

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.380
Listen, Shinpei, what was the deal
with that call last night?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.590
You straight-up lied!

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:51.883
You said there was a bar fight!

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.426
Can I get you your usual,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.637
the Lunch Special
with fried shrimp and rice?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.889
-Wow, you know me pretty well, kid.
-(Mio chuckling)

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.309
Huh? They disappeared?

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.687
The Kobayakawa family? As in, all of them?

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:05.939
TETSU: That's right.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.690
Seriously? Shin-chan?

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:08.775
Yeah.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.945
You know, I heard you went
inside their place with Mrs. Shiomi.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.363
SHINPEI: Oh, yes.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.740
TETSU: You can tell me about it later.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:17.742
That's really strange,

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:21.371
considering I had a conversation
with Kobayakawa just yesterday.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.039
TETSU: Oh, is that right?

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.708
You know, I really can't go
into details yet,

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.003
but a detective is coming
on the very first ferry this afternoon.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.714
SHINPEI:
<i>His response is different from before.</i>

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.133
<i>That's good,</i>

00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.803
<i>it's probably because I stopped</i>
<i>his shadow from killing him.</i>

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.930
<i>This is the real Totsumura.</i>

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:43.393
Oh, yeah, I forgot,
I'm supposed to give you this. Here.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.646
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.654
(Mio gasps)
That was my sister's phone.

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.072
(gasps)

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.782
Ushio came to see me,

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.618
so I wound up talking to her
the day before she died,

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.788
and she asked me to hold onto it for her.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:08.710
TETSU: But she wanted me to give it to you
if anything ever happened to her.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:11.796
SHINPEI: Ushio left this for me?

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.091
TETSU: It was like
she could see the future.

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:18.761
Like she knew exactly
what would happen to her.

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.515
SHINPEI: <i>Things are getting</i>
<i>more and more complicated.</i>

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:25.768
(bell chimes)

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:33.568
Hi there, Shinpei.
Uh, sorry, I'm not too early, am I?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.279
(chuckles)
No, I was waiting.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.326
SHINPEI: <i>I know I can trust Sou.</i>
<i>I'll tell him about everything.</i>

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.871
(crickets chirping)

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.958
SHINPEI: So that's why... I think her...

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.712
Do you think it was Shiori's shadow
that killed Ushio.

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.256
Is that what you're trying
to tell me, Shinpei?

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.842
Uh, that's right.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:01.638
The ligature marks prove two things,
she was strangled,

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.557
and only one person was there at the time.

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:10.063
Do you think
it's going to come after Mio next?

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:11.481
SHINPEI: Yes.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:17.612
Can you tell shadows and people apart,
simply by looking at them?

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.405
No.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.660
-SHINPEI: I couldn't tell the difference.
-SOU: Hmm...

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:27.372
Oh, man. That's not a good sign.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.752
So for all I know,
you might be a shadow yourself,

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:34.879
pretending to be the real Shinpei.

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:36.464
(gasps softly)

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.549
(dramatic music)

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.888
Yeah, but I could say the same about you.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:44.931
(Sou grunts)

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.018
What are you talking about?
Who's a... Who's a shadow?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.395
Just calm down, Mio.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.646
It'll be okay.

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:52.939
Hmm.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:58.444
They show up on camera,
so they must be living things, right?

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.405
Not ghosts or phantoms or something.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:07.245
If they're alive, there must be
a way to kill them, right, Shinpei?

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.455
(gasps)
That's right.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:13.084
Wait, Shin-chan,
why don't we go to Hiruko now?

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.338
Mr. Karikiri knows
all about the history of the island.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:20.091
Maybe he knows
something about shadows, too.

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:24.721
SHINPEI: <i>That's right,</i>
<i>Mio and I were trying to visit Hiruko</i>

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.264
<i>the first time around, too.</i>

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:27.557
<i>It's dangerous!</i>

00:13:28.349 --> 00:13:32.186
<i>That's where we ran into the shadow.</i>
<i>It was right by the shrine!</i>

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.187
(gunshot)

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.524
Uh, maybe tomorrow?

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:37.984
Tomorrow?

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.653
But isn't that the summer festival?

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.239
SHINPEI: Oh, the summer festival.

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:45.825
I knew it. I figured you'd forget.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:46.909
You know,

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.246
tomorrow is the busiest day of the year,
everyone will be at the shrine.

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:53.750
SOU: There'll be so many people,
the priest won't have time for us.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.837
SHINPEI: <i>Actually, the more people,</i>
<i>the safer it should be</i>

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.047
<i>for us to visit the shrine.</i>

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.425
<i>The summer festival</i>
<i>is the perfect time for us to go.</i>

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.721
SOU: I'll be at Kofune
at around five o'clock tomorrow.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:11.142
Let's decide on a code word,
just something that will help me tell,

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:12.977
you know, whether you're a shadow or not.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:13.936
Oh.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.607
-SOU: If I say "mountain," you say...
-SHINPEI: "River"?

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.691
SOU: That's too obvious.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.402
SHINPEI: Oh.
Uh, how about Tigris-Euphrates?

00:14:21.486 --> 00:14:23.863
SOU: Have any ideas
that aren't rivers, Shinpei?

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:25.531
MIO: How about "Mesopotamia"?

00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:26.824
SOU: That's a good one, Mio!

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.701
"Mesopotamia" it is!

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.787
SHINPEI: <i>Are these two joking right now?</i>

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.374
Thanks a lot, Sou,
I appreciate you trusting me.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.502
SOU: Mm.
(scoffs)

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:41.589
We're buddies, remember?
You trusted me enough to tell me.

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:42.757
That's no small things.

00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.676
SHINPEI: <i>You still can't trust him</i>
<i>completely yet.</i>

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.555
<i>At least not until you find a way</i>
<i>to tell shadows and people apart.</i>

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.182
<i>You always expect the worst from people.</i>

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.100
(sighs)

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:56.187
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to check out.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.565
SOU: I'll be sure to let you know
if I find anything.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.026
(thunder rumbles)

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.781
(thunder rumbles)

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.461
MIO: Oh! We're getting soaked!

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:21.838
(Mio pants)

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:34.183
(sighs)
This definitely wasn't in the forecast.

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.185
-Hm?
-SHINPEI: Oh.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.145
(Shinpei grunts)

00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.153
(Shinpei grunts)

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:47.071
(exhales heavily)

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.536
HITO SUMMER FESTIVAL
JULY 24, 2018

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.204
MIO: Shin-chan.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.497
Hm?

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:59.750
How long do you think
you'll stick around here?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:02.587
Oh, well, you know...

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.382
I was thinking I would leave
pretty much right after the funeral,

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.300
but I'm not sure.

00:16:08.134 --> 00:16:09.385
(breathes sharply)

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.889
MIO: I think you should stay forever.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:17.143
Forever?

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:23.232
Oh. Never mind. I... That was stupid.
I didn't mean that.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:26.068
MIO: I was just kidding.
Oh, here, you should take this.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.820
Here, go ahead.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.657
Sis was wearing this necklace
when she died.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:36.120
I'm sure she'd want you to have it.
It's yours. Keep it somewhere safe.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.625
Oh, thanks a lot.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:44.837
(gasps softly)

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.978
SHINPEI: <i>Is it her birthday?</i>

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.563
INPUT PASSWORD

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:06.692
<i>That's not it.</i>

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:08.945
(knocks on door)

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.031
SOU: Mountain.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.492
Huh?

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.164
You have to say "Mesopotania," remember?

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.583
Ah. Is it time to go already?

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:26.587
God. You're such a party pooper.
At least we know it's the real you.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.632
Shinpei, whoa! Go put some pants on!

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.134
-SHINPEI: Sorry, whoops, sorry, Toki!
-(clothes rustling)

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:36.222
Just hurry up and get changed.
We're pretty much ready to go.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:37.848
Right, Mio?

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:39.058
(gasps)

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.564
(dreamy music)

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:49.235
Do I look okay?

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.489
It's just that this is my first time
wearing a <i>yukata.</i>

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:54.991
You look so--

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.076
You look fantastic!

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:01.163
How is it? Tokiko dressed Mio herself.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.917
Don't you think it might help us
to tell her apart from her shadow?

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.752
Yeah, it's possible.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:07.837
Are you sure it looks okay?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.089
SOU: I still haven't told Tokiko
anything you told me.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.466
SHINPEI: Good.
I think that's for the best.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.596
Oh, yeah, I forgot to ask,
what exactly were you looking into?

00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:18.431
Did you find anything?

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.183
Oh, yesterday?

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.477
Don't worry, that was nothing important.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:25.187
-Just forget about it.
-(groans)

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.316
All right, Let's quit chatting
and get outta here.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:30.526
Come on, Ushio must be waiting for us.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:35.072
Yes, that's right. I know
that Sis was really looking forward

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.574
to the summer festival.

00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.576
I'm sure she'll be there today in spirit.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.787
Come on, let's get going.
Today is for her.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:45.499
SHINPEI: <i>Sou, don't you want</i>
<i>to be a doctor?</i>

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.419
<i>You're starting</i>
<i>to sound pretty superstitious.</i>

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.422
(waves crashing)

00:18:55.509 --> 00:18:57.386
(indistinct chatter)

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.811
GYOKURINEN GREEN TEA ICE CREAM

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.525
Listen, Sou.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:12.943
Hm?

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.906
SHINPEI: It's been two years
since I left the island.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:21.327
I thought I had matured a little bit,
I thought I'd grown up,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.996
but I'm still totally helpless.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.501
I couldn't be here with her
when she really needed me.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:33.130
I promised I'd do anything
to keep her safe.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:36.550
SOU: You idiot!

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.137
Ushio died, but it sure
wasn't because of you!

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.306
Keep it together, Shinpei!

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.975
Right now, you need to focus
on protecting Mio!

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:47.853
Shinpei, you're her brother,
for god's sake!

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:49.980
I know that, I'm not a moron.

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:52.608
(grunts)

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.738
SOU: If you think
you're not up for the job,

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.116
if you can't do it,
you should leave Mio to me.

00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:06.747
SHINPEI:
Sou, do you still have feelings for Mio?

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:08.374
(munches)

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.376
-SOU: What the hell do you care?
-(gasps)

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:13.963
-MIO: Hey. What are you chatting about?
-(both gasp)

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:14.880
(Sou clears throat)

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.091
-Mm?
-SHINPEI: Ah, nothing, really.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.635
We were debating
whether we liked boobs or butts.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:20.553
Hey!

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.388
-MIO: Ew, creepy.
-SHINPEI: No, no, no!

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.724
Shinpei, your ice cream is melting.

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:25.850
(yelps)

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.269
I'm telling you,
he's lying through his teeth!

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:31.772
Actually, I'm sort of curious
what you said.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:32.982
Huh?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:38.154
Well, I heard the other day you barged in
on Mio while she was taking a bath.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.697
(both whimper)

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.701
What? What the hell is wrong
with you, Shinpei?

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.202
Take this!

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.330
Oh, Shinpei, I wonder
what you really think about Mio?

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:51.333
(gasps)
What do you mean, huh, Tokiko?

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:53.002
(coughs)

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:57.006
SHINPEI: What do I think of her?

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.595
Well, obviously, I care a lot about her.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.306
We're family.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.893
Oh, you're family, huh?

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.230
What're you... Stop, Tokiko!
Don't ask him weird things like that.

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:17.359
Shinpei, my old man just gave me a call.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:20.780
After the fireworks
and the customary goodbye ceremony,

00:21:20.863 --> 00:21:22.948
Mr. Karikiri should be available.

00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:26.035
Okay. All right. So until then...

00:21:26.577 --> 00:21:27.745
(gasps)

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.581
(gasps)

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.710
SOU: Hm? What's up, Shinpei?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.711
(soft gasp)

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:37.546
SHINPEI: Right there, I just saw...

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.090
Why don't we go a little further in?

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.676
We'll see the fireworks
a lot better from there.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.011
-(Shinpei gasps)
-ALL: Huh?

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:46.388
SHINPEI: Sorry. I'll catch up with you.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.603
SOU: H-Hey! Shinpei!

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:54.104
SHINPEI: Please look after Mio!

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:57.942
Huh? Where is he going? Number two?

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:59.652
(Shinpei panting)

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:02.738
Excuse me. Coming through.
Sorry about that.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.118
SOU: <i>Ushio must be waiting for us.</i>

00:22:08.744 --> 00:22:10.663
(Shinpei panting)

00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:14.375
MIO: <i>Sis was really looking forward</i>
