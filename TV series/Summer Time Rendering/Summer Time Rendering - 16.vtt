00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.837
(theme music)

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.343
SHINPEI: What's your name?

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:37.431
Kofune Mioh.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.893
When were you born? And how'd it happen?

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:46.898
Yesterday. Mother scanned Mioh
when she was attending the wake.

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.900
MIOH: And later that night...

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.779
(static)

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.490
<i>...I came into the world.</i>
<i>I was born in the cave.</i>

00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.413
When you say "Mother,"
you mean Heine in Shiori's body, right?

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.206
MIOH: <i>Mm-hm.</i>

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.420
Was it you that cut the brakes
on Mio's bicycle?

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:09.629
Mm-hm.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:11.965
Were you trying to take my life?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.176
MIOH: No, not exactly.

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:18.555
I just thought it'd be more convenient
if you were in the hospital.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:23.435
So your plan was to kill her there
and take her place right after?

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:28.482
That's right. You know, Dr. Hishigata
is on the shadows' side.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.233
SHINPEI: Did Heine make you do that?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:36.031
No, she didn't. The truth is,
it was all me, but I failed.

00:02:36.114 --> 00:02:41.119
I had no idea it happened that way.
That she made Mio's shadow.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.581
Don't worry, Tokiko.
I really don't even remember

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.793
why I wanted to kill her to begin with.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:52.756
So Heine created you for one reason
in particular, to find Ushio's shadow.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.216
She is a traitor after all.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.303
Right, anyway. I can't copy people.
What about you? Can you?

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.223
Well, there's two types of copying.

00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:04.518
There's taking the form
of the person we copy,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.563
and there's giving birth,
actually creating a new shadow.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.273
Giving birth?

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.942
MIOH: When we're children,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.986
we have the ability
to give birth to one new shadow.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.446
As a child?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.032
MIOH: <i>Heine can do it</i>
<i>as much as she wants,</i>

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:23.161
<i>but it's not as easy for her</i>
<i>now that she's this weak.</i>

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.833
<i>Shadows that are grandchildren</i>
<i>can't give birth at all,</i>

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.044
<i>but any shadow</i>
<i>can transform when it wants to.</i>

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.131
<i>Also, no matter which type we are,</i>

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.926
<i>we only have a maximum</i>
<i>of seven days to erase the original,</i>

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.928
<i>or we turn to mud and disappear.</i>

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:44.724
<i>So I only have six days left to live,</i>
<i>it doesn't really matter to me, though.</i>

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.436
And that's all I know.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:53.066
I'm sorry, Shin-chan.
I guess I don't have much you can use.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.526
SHINPEI: Oh, no, that's...

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.821
You... You don't...
You don't need to apologize!

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.574
Sou. That's a shadow, you know.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.410
Huh? Uh, yeah, but I...

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.079
MIO AND MIOH: Hey, Sou?

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.041
Ah, damn it! This is so confusing.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.755
We know Heine has to consume
quite a lot people to be revived,

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.842
so she's giving birth to build an army.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.137
My dad and I did our best,
we did everything,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.514
we really tried to revive Heine for Mom.

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:28.810
And we thought that was why
she needed the meals.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.815
TOKIKO: <i>Little did we know,</i>
<i>they had other plans all along.</i>

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.652
And you're saying he knew about it?
The whole time?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.324
SOU: Unbelievable. He doesn't give a crap
if we all end up dead.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:43.992
TOKIKO: My father.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.953
SHINPEI: I know it's difficult to take in,

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.958
but Doctor Hishigata probably knows
what Heine really wants.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:56.171
Here's the thing, I'm meeting him tonight
at ten o'clock.

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:01.176
Then, we know where we're headed next.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.136
SHINPEI: <i>Hishigata Clinic.</i>

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.846
(mosquitos buzzing)

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.517
Ugh, that really itches!
There are so many mosquitos here!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.185
Please protect Mio.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.186
(gasps)

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.189
MIOH: Is that an order?

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.277
I don't really know. Um, I guess it is?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.490
Shin-chan, are you afraid of me?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.492
You're so far away.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.620
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't at all.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.373
SHINPEI: You've killed me
a whole bunch of times.

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:34.125
That's true,
but that was in another world.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.753
I haven't really killed anyone yet.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:37.921
(exhales nervously)

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.882
Look, can I ask you something?

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.801
Uh, sure thing.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.304
-You have a girlfriend in Tokyo?
-(yelps)

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:48.515
-Girlfriend?
-MIO: Girlfriend?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:51.268
Wait, wait, why are you asking him that?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.771
Sometimes he talks
with a distinct Tokyo accent.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.022
It's weird.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.358
-Hm...
-I don't have a girlfriend.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:00.777
People in Tokyo
don't understand our accent.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.697
You know I gotta blend in
with the locals, right?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:08.577
(sighs)
Well, I was just giving you a hard time.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.954
MIOH: But haven't you ever wondered

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.582
why I don't call you
my brother, Shin-chan?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:14.916
(gasps)

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.461
-Uh...
-(truck horn honks)

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.384
Don't worry.
I'll follow your orders and protect Mio.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.471
But you're the only one
who can really protect her.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.057
-I can only do so much.
-Huh?

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:35.145
I... I have no idea
what she's talking about!

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.688
Let's just go, Shin-chan!

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.814
SHINPEI: Okay.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.525
(door shuts)

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.736
(engine revving)

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:50.118
(bird squawking)

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.080
Hey, it's open.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:01.046
What in the hell?
Everything in our house is gone.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.173
Our rooms are empty, too.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.549
There's nothing left.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.927
The desks, the closets,
the beds, everything.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.639
Ms. Nagumo, anything?

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.098
Mm-mm.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:17.562
There aren't any stains from people.
It looks like they only erased objects.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:21.274
You think there was something
they didn't want us to see?

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.653
Thing is, it looks
like they erased everything.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.489
HIZURU: I guess they must've had
to hide something,

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.199
but didn't know where it was.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.076
-That's got to be it.
-Oh.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.535
HIZURU: That's what I'm seeing.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:33.536
(grunts)

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.624
This has to be my dad's doing!
That must be why he's not here!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.795
Our mom's gone, too.
What the hell is happening?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.171
-Shinpei!
-(grunts)

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.093
SOU: You felt a shadow there,
didn't you, Ushioh?

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.803
USHIOH: Mm-hm.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.137
-(squishing)
-SHINPEI: Ow! Stop that!

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.264
-You're cutting off my circulation.
-(Ushioh whimpering)

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:55.433
What's wrong with you? Are you scared?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:08:01.022
Yeah, of course, I'm scared!
Hospitals are so dark and creepy at night!

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.942
-Shh.
-I hear something.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.404
(distant clanking)

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.910
No response. What's that sound?

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.497
SHINPEI: Is something blocking it
down in the basement?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.707
(grunts)

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.417
HIZURU: Bullet holes.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.586
-It looks like there was a fight here.
-Huh?

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.382
Be careful. I sense shadows below us.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.759
What's in the basement?

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:32.721
TOKIKO: The morgue.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.806
The morgue is down there?

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:36.307
TOKIKO: Don't worry. It's okay.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.896
There's nothing except for Ushio's body.
Dad never cremated it, you know.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.859
USHIOH: Oh. All right.
I guess it isn't scary if it's my body.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:47.027
That's the issue?

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.029
The fact that you're afraid,

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.406
just shows
that your survival instincts are intact.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:52.365
USHIOH: Oh.

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:53.658
HIZURU: Don't be embarrassed.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.745
Shadows are a lot scarier than ghosts.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.580
Brace yourselves.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.541
(door clangs open)

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:05.170
(clanking)

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.341
That's our mom's wheelchair.

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.052
What's it doing here?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.636
-Hm?
-USHIOH: Behind you!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.472
-(gasps)
-(door slams)

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.681
SOU: Huh?

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.393
Did you see their face?

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.478
USHIOH: No.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.776
(static)

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.987
(tense music)

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.036
-(Ushioh grunts)
-(thuds)

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.083
(gasps)
There's nothing here.

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:46.503
Uh...

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.592
-(clicks)
-SOU: What...

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.552
SHINPEI: Uh...

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.099
Seriously? I had no idea
this place was down here.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.560
Look. It's gone.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:04.729
SHINPEI: So Ushio's body was here?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:10.652
Yeah. But Ushioh can fully recover
if she's able to scan the original, right?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:11.611
(Shinpei quivering)

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:15.115
TOKIKO: I guess Dad thought it'd better
not to leave it here until tomorrow.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.075
(quivering)

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.995
USHIOH: Want to restart?

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:25.792
No, let's keep going.
We need to find Sou's parents.

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.211
All right, then.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:31.089
HIZURU: Tokiko, where does this go?

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.925
It leads straight to Hiruko's grotto.

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:36.469
USHIOH: There was an entrance here.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:40.473
TOKIKO: We mostly use it to take meals
to Heine when she needs them.

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:44.394
But it's a different route
than the path from the old clinic.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:47.689
I feel a subtle sense
of a shadow right here.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:50.900
That shadow must've gone down
this way to escape.

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.196
It's really close.

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.282
It's right there, I can feel it.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:58.950
(grunts)

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.036
Uh...

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.539
(whimpers)

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.542
(Dr. Hishigata choking)

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:08.543
(Dr. Hishigata coughs)

00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:13.923
(Dr. Hishigata choking)

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.842
SOU: Mom, is that...

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.846
(choking)

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.308
SHINPEI: What the hell is this?

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.268
(Dr. Hishigata groaning)

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.854
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot her!

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.981
Can't you see?
She's about to kill your father!

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.192
(Dr. Hishigata choking)

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.445
Ushioh!

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.655
-(static)
-It's okay, Sou.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.532
USHIOH: I'll bring her back.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.911
(groaning)

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.707
-Huh?
-Father!

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:54.214
(Tokiko breathing sharply)

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.257
He's not breathing.

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:58.718
(whimpering)

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:03.139
(Tokiko grunting)

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.939
(grunts)

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.316
Ugh! Let me!

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:18.154
(Sou grunting)

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.615
SOU: Come on, Dad.
Come on, don't die on me!

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:26.037
I'm not gonna let you go
without explaining yourself!

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.456
Wake up, old man!

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.666
-(Sou grunts)
-(gasps)

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:33.920
(Dr. Hishigata coughing)

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.632
-(Sou panting)
-(Dr. Hishigata coughs)

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:41.970
Sou, is that you?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:45.431
I've had enough of these secrets.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.267
We're family, right?

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.604
How is Chitose... your mother?

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.898
I cut her link with Heine.

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.025
Don't worry, she'll wake up soon.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:00.822
I never... never imagined...
(coughs)

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:03.241
...you would reach this point so quickly.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:10.498
I guess Heine must've thought I'd talk
and tell you everything I know.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.875
There's no point hiding it.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.170
We can just copy your data
and we'll find out.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.632
Tokiko, kill them all.

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:20.550
Dad, no!

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:21.801
DR. HISHIGATA: Kill them all!

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:27.432
If you kill them, I could be back
in Heine's good graces again.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.102
No, Dad. You're wrong. You're dead wrong.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.648
You should know,
they don't plan on keeping any promises.

00:13:36.107 --> 00:13:37.442
DR. HISHIGATA: Hmm...

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm disappointed in you, Tokiko.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:44.866
HIZURU: Step back, Sou.
Your gun is too close.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:45.867
(grunts)

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.494
(gunshot)

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.205
-(whimpers)
-(groans)

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.206
SHINPEI: Uh...

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.208
Hishigata...

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:55.918
(gunshot)

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.254
-(static)
-Huh? What...

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.506
(chuckles)

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:02.633
You...

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.928
Too bad for you.

00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:10.183
You think they'll be okay?
I'm very worried about them.

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:15.563
TOKIKO: They've got Ushioh and Ms. Nagumo,
they can handle themselves.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.857
Plus, they've got your shadow.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.068
MIO: To be honest,
that's my biggest worry.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.320
I still don't really trust that thing.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:25.907
Tokiko, I'm kind of surprised
you let it copy you.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.866
(chuckles)

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.452
When a shadow copies you,
it sees everything,

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.830
your body and your heart,
it reveals everything, you know?

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.373
Uh-huh.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:38.419
Mio, I just really wanted you to know
every little part of me.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.337
(gasps)

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.048
I can't believe you can say that
with a straight face, Tokiko!

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.382
(chuckles)

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:47.553
You know what? I'm done keeping secrets.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:51.057
SHINPEI: Mioh.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.686
So do you trust me
at least a little bit more now?

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.648
Yeah, I do, thanks.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.358
Do you mean that?

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.569
If you don't believe that I trust you,
I'll let you copy me.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.279
MIOH: I'm never going to do that.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.451
The truth is, I don't want to know
what's in your heart.

00:15:10.535 --> 00:15:11.661
(grunts)

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.371
-Sou.
-(Sou panting)

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:16.666
You shot Tokiko!
How the hell could you do that?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.084
(groaning)

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.252
DR. HISHIGATA: Just kill me.

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:23.464
You old bastard!
You've been playing with people's lives!

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:24.841
Just kill me.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.801
(Sou breathes heavily)

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:31.013
I thought you were a doctor.
You're a doctor!

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:34.183
How can you talk
about death like that, huh?

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:41.440
So you won't say anything? Fine, then.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.443
(Sou sniffles)
Mioh, go ahead.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.865
-(gasps)
-(flash clicks, squeals)

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.452
Hmm...

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:57.456
I can't copy him. I think he's immune.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.541
(gasps)

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.793
Okay. Then he'll have to talk.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.711
DR. HISHIGATA: Hold on.

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:06.799
That doesn't make sense!
What do you mean? Why can't you copy me?

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:11.470
Obviously, you already had a shadow self,
but it died and that's the end of it.

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:16.475
That's how people like you become immune,
and you can't be copied again.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:19.061
That can't be... It's not...

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:24.400
So now I... I'll never have a shadow?
As long as I live?

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.485
That's exactly right.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.366
Doctor...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.830
DR. HISHIGATA: Chitose, what...
what did I do all of this for?

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:38.748
(gasps)

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:43.920
-Negoro, is that you?
-(Ushioh gasps)

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.379
(gasps)

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:51.302
Well, doctor, I think I will be
on my way out now.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.639
SHADOW NEGORO: As you can see,
I certainly got what I came for.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:56.557
(gunshots)

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:57.600
(gasps)

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.976
SHINPEI: She's out of range.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.729
Shide wanted me to relay a message to you.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:06.108
"We appreciate the help
the Hishigata family has provided.

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:10.404
But now, our relationship is over.
We wish you the best."

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.697
(gasps)

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.408
SHADOW NEGORO: And I also have
a message for Shinpei Ajiro.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:19.872
"It seems you're still alive somehow.
And I'm fed up with your stubbornness.

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.500
But there's nothing you can do.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:26.170
In two short days,
everything will come to an end."

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.090
-Ugh! Hey, wait, get back here!
-Ushioh!

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.049
(Ushioh gasps)

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.345
Don't go after it.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:35.388
But why?

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:39.642
SHINPEI: Because it's carrying
your body with it, using it as bait.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.270
The time limit is meant to provoke us.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.940
If we go after her now, we're finished.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.735
Come on, Shinpei. We can't just turn back.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.697
That was the shadow we saw,
the one in the hall.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.324
Try to calm down, Sis.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.327
Shin-chan's got it worse than we do.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.287
(gasps)

00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:04.083
SHINPEI: Try not to let your feelings
get the best of you.

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:06.544
Step back for a minute,

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:09.255
and turn all your anger...

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.300
and all your regret into weapons.

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:13.259
(gasps)

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.094
Shinpei.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:19.974
So, doctor, is there still a point
in keeping quiet?

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:22.977
DR. HISHIGATA: Get my daughter.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.315
<i>You need to bring me the real Tokiko.</i>

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:36.198
-(groaning)
-(Dr. Hishigata gasps)

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.908
DR. HISHIGATA: Hey, are you awake?

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.786
Ah... Oh, uh, Sei.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.497
SHADOW CHITOSE: Where... Where am I?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.208
-(static)
-(gasps)

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:51.172
I gave Chitose all the same memories,
the ones that I showed you before.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.091
-Oh.
-(sobbing)

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.594
I'm sorry, Chitose.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:00.973
SHINPEI: <i>Sou's mom didn't know.</i>
<i>She didn't realize she was a shadow.</i>

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:05.311
<i>She had no idea.</i>
<i>But actually, she was created that way.</i>

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.482
DR. HISHIGATA: I know you're all
determined to stop the final ceremony,

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.985
but do you really think it makes sense
to kill Heine?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:15.363
-SOU: What?
-What do you mean by that?

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:19.200
Well, if Heine dies,
all the shadows will, too.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.871
DR. HISHIGATA: Think about it.
That means your Ushioh will die as well.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:26.040
(Shinpei gasps)

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.586
Ushioh.

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:35.424
Oh, come on, it's fine!
I mean, I died two days ago, anyway.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.136
USHIOH: Honestly, I'm lucky
I get to live a little longer.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.141
I wanna use whatever time I have left
to finish this and help save everyone.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.226
That's all.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:49.355
Defeating Heine would solve everything,
wouldn't it?

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.023
Well, that's good news, then!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.110
Because she doesn't stand
a chance against me!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.824
SHINPEI: <i>She's right.</i>
<i>I'm embarrassed that I hesitated at all.</i>

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:01.450
Right?

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.618
Right.

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:08.249
Okay, doctor, what's Heine planning
after she gets revived?

00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:13.295
It's really quite simple.
All she wants is to go back.

00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:17.633
DR. HISHIGATA: <i>To return</i>
<i>to the place she came from.</i>

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.802
<i>The depths of the ocean.</i>

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:26.434
<i>No living being from this world</i>
<i>can ever reach that terrible place,</i>

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:28.728
<i>but of course, shadows can.</i>

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:32.189
<i>Besides, Heine only wants to take shadows.</i>

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:35.776
<i>She'll only take the family</i>
<i>that she chose.</i>

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.945
So, she could escape?

00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:41.532
It's possible if she manages
to regain her power.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.453
DR. HISHIGATA: <i>That place exists</i>
<i>outside the constraints of time.</i>

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:49.999
<i>Chitose and I were going to</i>
<i>become shadows and live there forever.</i>

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:55.546
Sou and Tokiko were supposed
to become shadows along with us.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:58.424
That's why you though it was okay
to murder us both?

00:20:58.507 --> 00:20:59.759
Are you crazy?

00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:01.051
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:04.847
You old idiot! That's why you did this?

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:09.018
I can't believe you could be
so self-centered. You're hopeless.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.811
I really don't know what to say.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:17.151
Thank you for saving me.
I'll never forget that, Seido.

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.861
(whimpers)

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.322
Chitose.

00:21:21.405 --> 00:21:24.200
But you know, we have to finish this.

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:29.121
Sou. Tokiko. I'm so glad
I got to see you both grow up.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.165
-(both sobbing)
-SHADOW CHITOSE: At least for this long.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:37.463
Chitose. Please no. If you die now,
I'll have no reason to live anymore.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:41.050
Don't say that,
you have our children to live for, Seido.

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:45.679
You have the people on this island,
and they need you now more than ever.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:50.142
Shinpei was right, you know,
this isn't finished yet.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.229
You can still atone for your mistakes.

00:21:53.938 --> 00:21:57.608
(Dr. Hishigata sobbing)

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.745
SHINPEI: What's in there?

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:10.913
(clicking)

00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:11.914
(clanks)

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.376
DR. HISHIGATA: It's a collection
of the clinic's secret records.

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:16.794
Tokiko hid it for me.

00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:20.297
<i>Patients were diagnosed</i>
<i>with Capgras syndrome,</i>

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.843
<i>or the local disease</i>
<i>known as shadow sickness.</i>

00:22:24.468 --> 00:22:29.223
But in actuality, this is a list
of people that Heine consumed.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:34.186
Shinpei, your parents' names
are on the list.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.145
(gasps)

00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:40.776
But I was told that my parents' boat sank
while they were at work.

00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:44.321
The two of them discovered
Hiruko's grotto.

00:22:44.405 --> 00:22:46.240
They were going to make it public.

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:48.450
That's why they were killed.

00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:50.327
It looked like an accident.

00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:54.415
DR. HISHIGATA: But Shide killed them,
and I switched the bodies.

00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:56.250
I needed to feed Heine.

00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:58.168
I'm so sorry.

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:00.880
What? That's all you have to say?

00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:04.008
Who is Shide, really? You know, don't you?

00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:07.887
DR. HISHIGATA:
Mm. Look at this photograph.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.601
Shide is Heine's chief protector
and the very first child Heine ever had.

00:23:13.684 --> 00:23:14.852
(gasps)

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:18.522
DR. HISHIGATA: His original name
was Shidehiko Hishigata...

00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:21.400
(ominous music)

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:26.113
...the founder of the Hishigata Clinic
and its first director.
