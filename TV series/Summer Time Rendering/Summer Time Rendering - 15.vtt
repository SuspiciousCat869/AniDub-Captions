WEBVTT

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.796
(clock ticking)

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.799
(tense music)

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:10.260
-(door opens)
-USHIOH, MIO: Shinpei!

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:14.223
(both panting)

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:18.185
-(heartbeat)
-(quivering)

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.561
(muffled gunshot)

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:34.535
(grunts softly)

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:36.995
Shin-chan.

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.458
SHINPEI: That rifle shot, it came
from... from outside.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.379
(gasps)
They got to Nezu. How did they...

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.840
USHIOH: I didn't sense any shadows.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.135
If a shadow had killed you,
I would've seen it coming.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.137
The bullet must have been real.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.557
Damn it, we should have never
let Nezu be alone.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:00:58.600
(thumps)

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.186
SHINPEI: He was too far
outside your range,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.021
you'd have never detected him.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:05.649
This is my fault!

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.444
They must've found out that Nezu
was our sniper somehow.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.072
Damn it.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.992
I really thought
they'd want to go right after me.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.660
-(ominous music)
-(gasps)

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:18.537
(rocks rattling)

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.375
But wait, doesn't it make way more sense
for them to take you alive?

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.420
I mean, you'll just loop, anyway,
won't you? Why kill you?

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.006
SHINPEI: They figured it out.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:33.635
Heine is looping back with me,
I can't escape.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.595
(both gasp)

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.724
Remember that the starting point
gets later every time.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:42.978
I can see it now.
I'm approaching the limit.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.271
(clock ticks)

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.647
SHINPEI: <i>The ledge of time...</i>

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:47.983
<i>where I'm standing</i>

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.861
<i>is crumbling slowly but surely.</i>

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.033
Now, I'm pretty sure I can only loop back
one more time

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.953
if I die at the same moment
I did last time.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:02.622
(theme music)

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:35.340
(clock ticks)

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.093
NEZU: So you think
you only have one loop left?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:43.765
Yes, if this is the limit,
I return to this point every time I die.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.060
SHINPEI:
<i>But now I can't go back past that point,</i>

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:48.895
<i>so this is the new starting point.</i>

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:49.938
TIME - LIMIT: 6:40, DEATH: 7:55

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:55.610
<i>Last time I died, at 7:55 p. m.,</i>
<i>and my starting point was 6:40.</i>

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:56.528
LIMIT: 6:40

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.655
<i>So it's like I'm walking forward</i>
<i>from that point</i>

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:01.575
<i>with a slow, deliberate stride,</i>
<i>with no stopping it.</i>

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:06.079
<i>Right now, it's 7:20 p. m.</i>
<i>And the limit is still moving forward.</i>

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:10.500
But the limit can't catch up to me now
since it still moves slower than I do.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.503
But I also think it picks up speed
each time I die.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:18.175
So if you were to die right now,
when would the next starting point be?

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:22.053
If I were to guess...
I mean, based on my previous times,

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.432
maybe a little past seven.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.058
-(Mio gasps)
-Uh, wait.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.894
That was a few minutes ago!

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:31.897
So if I die any earlier than last time,

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.858
and my predictions
actually hold any water,

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.359
I won't get a ninth loop.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.112
SHINPEI:
<i>While I'm plodding forward in time…</i>

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:40.030
CURRENT LIMIT: 7:02
DEATH: 7:20

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:42.783
<i>…the limit will pass me by.</i>

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.369
And then there'd be nothing to go back to.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.373
SHINPEI: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>And I'd fall straight into the void.</i>

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:52.417
(foreboding music)

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.379
Wait, wait, are you serious?

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.590
You're not making this up,
are you, Shinpei?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.592
He's the observer, he can see everything.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:02.093
It's gotta be true.

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:06.515
HIZURU: <i>Think of the cliff</i>
<i>he's talking about like an event horizon.</i>

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:10.602
<i>If he falls over the edge into the abyss,</i>
<i>his death is certain.</i>

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.688
<i>And the world Heine envisions</i>
<i>will become a reality.</i>

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:18.443
Heine must have realized that
and came to kill you because of it.

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:19.361
That's horrible!

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.571
NEZU: Okay, so how did they find me?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.575
SHINPEI: Heine may have figured out
our strategy during the fourth loop.

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.994
HIZURU: They must have decided to scan me,

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.539
when I was fatally wounded

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.958
sometime near the end of the loop,

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:36.461
and then simply read all my memories
leading up to that moment.

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:41.466
How exactly do shadows
exchange information?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.969
Do they show each other
their memories like you do?

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:47.597
Mm-hm, plus, they can write
and talk to each other.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.933
And Heine also uses telepathy.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.603
Shadows experience pseudo-loops
but only in some cases,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.730
if they come in contact with Heine.

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.232
Hold on a second.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.526
Data can be passed
from loop to loop, right?

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.405
NEZU: Do you think it's possible
they could have copied my rifle?

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.492
If so, we need to be careful,
this place isn't safe.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:09.369
We're fine, don't worry.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.954
A copied item will disappear

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.039
if it's too far
from the shadow that printed it.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:17.043
USHIOH: <i>Copied items can't exist outside</i>
<i>of a 50-meter radius</i>

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.461
<i>from the shadow itself.</i>

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:23.216
NEZU: <i>So a bullet from the copied rifle,</i>
<i>no matter where the shooter is,</i>

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.886
<i>will have a maximum range of 50 meters.</i>

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:29.931
Then even an unlimited supply
of ammo would be useless.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.100
SHINPEI:
Obviously, the enemy won last time,

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.351
but we learned a lot.

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:37.397
This mark here means Heine knows
where I am at all times.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.860
Heine won't miss a chance to come here
and watch me die.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.571
Let's finish this, once and for all.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.164
(clock ticks)

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:58.543
Hm?

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.924
NEZU: Shinpei, they're coming
in your direction from the front.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.061
That's quite the entourage
you've got there, Shide.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:21.524
That's right, and it seems you've managed
to swell your ranks, too, Shinpei.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:27.072
I don't see them out in the open, though.
They must be hiding out somewhere.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:29.532
Is this a trap?

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:33.328
I'm not like you.
You're the only one here who cheats.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.624
It's time to stop playing around
and battle face-to-face.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.754
Oh? You sound awfully confident,
I can't imagine why.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:46.341
It would be our pleasure. Eh? Right, Mioh?

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.676
Right.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.969
I expected no less.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.180
God, you're so cool!

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.265
(suspenseful music)

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.522
Huh?

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:03.942
Hello, Sis.

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:07.862
SHINPEI: <i>If they're after me,</i>
<i>I'll draw them out, I'll be the bait.</i>

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.072
He ran away.

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.824
What happened to face-to-face?

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:14.035
Ugh! Where are you taking him?
Get back here.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:14.994
(gunshot)

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:16.746
(gasps)

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.583
Shinpei Ajiro, you dirty little rat.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.753
NEZU: <i>That Shide shadow has no weaknesses.</i>

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.923
<i>How are we gonna beat that?</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.258
SHINPEI: Hurry!

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.802
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Just wait, Mioh.</i>

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:32.762
Ugh!

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:38.184
(gunshots)

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.437
SHIDE: Excuse me for a moment.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.232
(thrilling music)

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:47.777
Huh?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.237
-(glass shatters)
-(groans)

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.406
Papa, Mama, come with me.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:55.660
(shadows screeching)

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:58.621
SHADOW SHIO:
<i>We'll go after Shinpei and Ushioh.</i>

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.624
<i>You go after the hunter, track him down.</i>

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.921
Yes. Yes, I understand, oh, Mother.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.092
(eerie music)

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.928
SHINPEI: Ryunosuke!

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:17.891
Keep moving, you two,
I'll take care of this.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.142
Watch our backs.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.646
I know you won't be able
to hear me now, I understand,

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.567
but I forgot to tell you
something important. Listen to me.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:31.988
HIZURU: Thank you.

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:34.449
(thrilling music)

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.038
Damn it! It's coming! It's your turn now!

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:45.085
That's my shadow!

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.087
I got this one, you guys!

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.134
No! Goddamn it.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:58.556
Uh-huh. I get it. You're all fired up,
but don't make a fool of yourself, okay?

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.439
Sorry, Tokiko.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.399
(whines)

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.901
TOKIKO: Rosencrantz.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.320
Guildenstern.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:13.363
(whines)

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.784
Time to explode.
But just make sure you do it quietly.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.747
(gunshots)

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.875
(yells)

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.210
(grunts)

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:30.672
(gunshots)

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:35.718
Hizuru... Hizuru!

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:37.053
Asako.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:40.140
Go to your left, move.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.099
(gunshot)

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:42.725
(grunts)

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.561
That bullet should have hit.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.817
(grunts)

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:52.735
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.782
I told you he'd take a hit for them.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.120
HIZURU: <i>I see...</i>

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:03.580
Ugh...

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:08.418
HIZURU: <i>It can predict how I move,</i>
<i>and it's always two seconds ahead.</i>

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.671
You got that right.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.047
(gunshot)

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:16.968
(gasps)

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.098
-(gunshot)
-HIZURU: It's Nezu!

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:24.475
-(cocks gun)
-(gunshots)

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.811
-(Shide groans)
-(gunshot)

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:30.481
Damn. That old man
doesn't even need the scope.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.275
SHIDE: He's quite the sharpshooter.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.862
SHADOW SHIORI: Are you okay, Shide?

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.114
SHIDE: You need to find a place to hide.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.658
It's dangerous here.

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:42.744
SHADOW SHIORI: For god's sake.

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.208
Where's Mioh? What's taking her so long?

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.004
(gasps)

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.048
SHADOW SHIORI: Tokiko?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.926
Take care of it, Gil.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:01.387
(shrieking)

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.559
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Stop it!</i>
<i>Tokiko's not the boss of you anymore.</i>

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.771
(whimpering)

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.148
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Kill Tokiko now.</i>

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.236
<i>Kill Tokiko now!</i>

00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:20.865
(Gil shrieks)

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:21.908
(thwacks)

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:23.868
(chuckles)

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.328
Uh...

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:27.830
What's wrong, Heine?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.626
My link got cut,
the one connecting me to that stray.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.962
The only one who can do that is...

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.590
Ushioh.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.510
Come on, I dare you to come and get me!

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:43.346
Did you do this, huh?

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.139
(static)

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:48.351
(gunshots)

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.394
(grunts)

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.898
Well, they're certainly making this fun
for us, aren't they?

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.443
(tense music)

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.238
(grunts)

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:06.411
(grunts)

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:09.580
(gasps)

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.169
(grunting)

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:24.762
TOKIKO: <i>Wow, what a body, so graceful.</i>

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.432
<i>You were always very athletic.</i>

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:33.187
<i>Ah, I'd love to just stand here,</i>
<i>watching you move, but...</i>

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.190
(Mioh grunts)

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:39.444
Now, do it!

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:40.445
(grunts)

00:13:46.784 --> 00:13:48.786
(grunts)

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.331
(music halts)

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.917
(light clanks)

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.756
SHIDE: You claimed you wanted
to fight us face-to-face.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.758
I guess you lied about that.

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.386
It's such a shame.
To think I actually believed you.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.222
I have much too trusting a nature.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:10.641
I knew you'd go after me,

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.227
even if you knew it was a trap
from the start.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:15.688
You're just that desperate and arrogant!

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.691
USHIOH: So you think
you're above all of us?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.026
-(static)
-(gasps)

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.489
Shinpei is even higher!

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:29.660
(groans)

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:41.422
(blasts)

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:45.718
(grunts)

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:49.680
That right there's a gas fire.
There's no way they'll get out.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.141
-(Shide screeching)
-(Shadow Shiori crying)

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:58.356
USHIOH: <i>It's working.</i>
<i>They really are vulnerable to fire.</i>

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.483
(both screaming)

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.526
(grunts)

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.117
I'm sorry, Papa, Mama. I know it's hot.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.993
But no need to worry.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.455
I'll be back right after I kill him!

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.500
Take this, you giant monster!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.668
-(weapon fires)
-(gasps)

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.628
(grunting)

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.172
-Uh...
-(static)

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.423
SHINPEI: Look at me.

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.886
-You underestimated us, Heine!
-(grunts)

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.224
This is for Ushio!

00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.725
(gunshot)

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:35.685
(groans)

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.441
(Shadow Shiori groaning)

00:15:42.525 --> 00:15:45.027
(Shadow Shiori choking)

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.989
(coughing)

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.073
(Shadow Shiori gasps)

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.909
I got you now.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.371
USHIOH: I'll erase you, okay?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.083
You're going to stop using Shiori's body,
you little phony.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.710
You hear what I said?

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.298
(splats)

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.757
-SHADOW SHIORI: Please stop.
-(gasps)

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.887
Stop. Don't do it. Don't erase me.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.765
You know, I chose this body
for one reason.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:18.186
SHADOW SHIORI:
<i>So I could go back home as her</i>

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:21.189
<i>and... and be with her family forever.</i>

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.650
Heine! Crying won't work on me!

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.986
(sobs)
Please don't...

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:30.865
HEINE: <i>Don't erase me.</i>

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.825
(grunting)

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:33.784
(Shinpei gasps)

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:38.122
It's... It's still alive?
Oh, my god! No way!

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.291
Ushioh!

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.255
(whimpering)

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.548
Shinpei!

00:16:50.593 --> 00:16:53.095
(screaming)

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.222
(Shide laughs)

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:58.017
Did you... you really think
you could kill... kill me

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.269
with fire, Ushioh?

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.564
But... But it can kill you!

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:07.068
You... You... You know, I was thinking.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:13.741
You and Heine carry the data
into the next loop... loop, right?

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:20.039
That... That means
you'll carry your injuries, too... too,

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.458
even your own death!

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:28.631
It will probably take a few minutes
for Shinpei to die this time,

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:32.552
since I made sure not to hit his vitals.

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:36.389
You know, I wonder what would happen

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:40.476
if you died before he does.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.648
I really want to... really want
to see how it...

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.317
how it turns out.

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.653
SHINPEI: Oh, no.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:52.029
(Shinpei gasps)

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:56.742
Ushioh!

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:07.003
(gasps)

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:09.547
(groans)

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.343
Sorry to ruin your experiment,
but I don't plan on dying!

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:17.430
SHIDE: That was very sly of you.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.975
Somehow I didn't notice you change places.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.185
All I grabbed was

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:28.649
a dummy printed on a single lock of hair.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.110
-(static)
-(warbles)

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:32.111
(Ushioh grunts)

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:36.532
You're not unbeatable!
You're getting erased!

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:45.374
SHINPEI: <i>A human hand.</i>
<i>There's someone inside.</i>

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:49.253
(screaming)

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.797
(silence)

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.177
(gasps)

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.721
Where did the fire go?

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.641
(choking)

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.770
SHINPEI: I can't breathe... Heine...

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.397
What did...
(coughs)

00:19:09.106 --> 00:19:10.566
...you do?

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:16.530
(grunts)

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:29.752
(gasps)

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.629
(coughing)

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:32.713
What the hell?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.548
(grunting)

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.842
SHINPEI: I think they got away.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.055
I was so close to erasing it.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:43.808
(thuds)

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:45.810
Ushioh!

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:52.817
SHADOW SHIORI: Shide, are you okay?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.986
SHIDE: Yes. I can mold myself
back together.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.364
Where are Papa and Mama?

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.701
SHIDE: I know Shinpei is fatally wounded.

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:06.497
It shouldn't be too much longer
before he dies and enters his final loop.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.458
(stomach rumbles)

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:12.878
(groans)
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>I'm very hungry.</i>

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.134
SHIDE: Yes, I know.

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:23.806
(panting)

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.391
SHINPEI: Ushioh.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.270
USHIOH: It's okay, I'm fine, Shinpei.

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:32.356
I'm just tired from copying so much.

00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:37.945
You're bleeding, look at you.
Don't act so tough, just let me help you.

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:39.447
Shinpei.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:44.410
This blood is just
from all the glass I touched.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.954
You're the one
with the serious wound, look!

00:20:48.414 --> 00:20:52.376
Bulletproof vest.
I learned how to make it online.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.211
(gasps)

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.921
(sobs)

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.257
(Shinpei groans)

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.509
SHINPEI: No, no, no, that hurts!
Stop, stop!

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.887
(Shinpei grunts)
My shoulder and my side still got hit!

00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:05.598
Thank goodness.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.391
(Shinpei gasps)

00:21:18.694 --> 00:21:20.696
(somber music)

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:28.245
HIZURU: A fire caused by copied gasoline
and matches is nothing more than data.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.540
Ushioh was able to control
what the flames touched.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.584
It didn't burn us or the building.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.587
So fire works against shadows,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.507
and it instantly kills
the ones made by Shide.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.384
It also seems
to slow Shide down significantly.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.970
Ushioh's hacking helped us learn

00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:48.557
that someone is inside Shide's body,
trapped or imprisoned there.

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:53.020
However, Heine scanned the oxygen
in the gym and erased it.

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.525
Suddenly, a huge rush
of outside air blew into the building,

00:21:57.608 --> 00:21:59.193
and Heine escaped.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:02.905
Ushioh didn't get
to scan Shide's true identity.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.951
All the air in there... crazy.

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.912
We can copy gases and liquids, too.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:13.207
It just needs to be
in some kind of container, you know?

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:17.086
You copied all the gasoline in that drum,
didn't you, Ushioh?

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.128
USHIOH: Mm-hm.

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:21.006
If you consider the gym a container,
it's possible.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.299
(Tetsu sighs)

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.885
USHIOH: You know, I hate to say it,

00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.972
but I don't think I can scan
something that big.

00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:29.265
It's impressive.

00:22:30.516 --> 00:22:31.684
So close.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.271
Well, we did learn a lot from tonight.

00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:36.230
Mm-hm.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.400
USHIOH: Everyone survived.

00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:42.403
And that's what really matters.

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:45.072
You're right.

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:46.699
-SHINPEI: Ushioh.
-Huh?

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:48.158
Come on.

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:50.327
Like we planned?

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:51.620
SHINPEI: Yeah.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.415
Let me ask you one more time, Ushioh.

00:22:54.999 --> 00:22:58.210
If you cut the link to Heine,
will it really be safe?

00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.546
I'm sorry, I'm just not sold on this yet.

00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:03.507
It worked with Rose and Gill, right?

00:23:03.591 --> 00:23:06.135
Mm-hm. I'll tweak its mind a bit.

00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:09.513
It'll basically be like me, more or less.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:13.142
We could kill it right now
and be done with it.

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:15.311
Are you sure, Mio?

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:19.023
Mm-hm. I am. Do it, Sis.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.487
MIO: Make her an ally. We need her.
