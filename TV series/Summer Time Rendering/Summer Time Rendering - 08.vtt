WEBVTT

00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:05.506
Ah! Wait. Are you making curry for us?
Shinpei's famous curry?

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.216
Aah!

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.842
(groans)

00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:10.219
Ushioh?

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:15.140
Really? This again? Hey.
Why do you look like you just saw a ghost?

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.352
You're only supposed
to appear on the 24th!

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.812
Huh? Wait. How would you know that?

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:22.064
Huh?

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:26.026
Listen, Shinpei.
This might be kinda hard to believe,

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.737
but something terrible happens
on the 24th.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.281
USHIOH: Everyone at the festival
gets swallowed up

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.617
by some black shadow monster.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.203
SHINPEI: Uh... Wait a sec, you...

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:40.123
Did you come from the summer festival too?

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.627
-USHIOH: Huh? Uh, wait a second, did you?
-(door opens)

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.836
(Mio sighs)

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.382
I just washed my eyes,
I feel a lot better now.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:49.466
(gasps)

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.051
Uh, what... what is it?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.428
MIO: That smell!
Are you making your curry?

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:54.972
SHINPEI (stammers): Yes.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.183
MIO: Aah! I should've thought of that.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:00:59.393
-(stomach rumbles)
-Aah!

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:03.772
Shin-chan! Your stomach is rumbling!
You're just like Sis.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.444
Thank goodness.
That means you're feeling better.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:10.779
Uh, I guess so.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.951
SHINPEI: <i>Calm down, calm down.</i>
<i>Just try to focus on making the curry.</i>

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:20.414
<i>I... I can't believe this. This is bad.</i>

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:27.504
<i>Oh, god, Ms. Nagumo, this isn't</i>
<i>just some insignificant difference.</i>

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.714
(chuckles)

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:29.840
(door opens)

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:34.261
ALAIN: Ah, hey, sorry I took so long
to get back, Shinpei.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:37.472
That Mr. Karikiri sure can talk.

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.100
SHINPEI: Welcome back. It's almost done.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.518
-Mio.
-Hm?

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:44.104
Aren't you supposed
to be helping with the cooking?

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.482
Come on, don't be silly,
my only job is eating!

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:51.862
ALAIN: Boy, that smells great.
Ushio always used to love that.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.573
SHINPEI: <i>Five minutes from now,</i>
<i>Alain does the laundry,</i>

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.158
<i>Mio goes to the bathroom.</i>

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.785
<i>Go to my room, but be careful.</i>
<i>Don't be seen.</i>

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.703
Mm!

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.039
SHINPEI: <i>Does she have any idea</i>
<i>what's going on here?</i>

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:04.499
FAKE CALL TO TOTSUMURA
TELL SOU I'LL CALL HIM TOMORROW

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.418
SHINPEI: Okay. All done!

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.170
MIO: Hey, where are you going?

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:11.131
SHINPEI: Ugh! Uh, I'm going to eat
in my room.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:12.924
Why two plates?

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:17.220
Ugh! Well, I'm just super hungry.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.016
(nervous laughter)

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.477
(theme music)

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.945
-Curry! Curry!
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.321
-SHINPEI: <i>That's the...</i>
-Curry!

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.575
-<i>...the curry chant!</i>
-Curry! Curry, ha-ha-ha!

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.535
-Chef Shinpei...
-SHINPEI: <i>Goddamn it.</i>

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.162
-<i>Why is this happening?</i>
-USHIOH: ...hurry with the curry!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.874
Don't let the shadows trick you
with their outward appearance, Shinpei.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.585
(shrieks)

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.044
(breathes sharply)

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.504
Can I eat?

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:15.422
SHINPEI: Sure.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.258
All right! Thank you for this meal!

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.930
SHINPEI: <i>Somehow, this shadow managed</i>
<i>to loop back with me this time.</i>

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.308
-Yummy!
-SHINPEI: <i>That has to be what happened.</i>

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.770
Wait. How exactly did you get here?

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.230
Huh? I just walked, you dummy.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:35.442
I woke up right in the middle
of Omotohama Beach.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.361
But don't worry. I'm sure no one saw me.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.739
MIO: It's a monster!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:44.284
USHIOH: I guess I am a lot like a monster.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.620
I'll make sure no one sees me again.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.372
Like a monster? No. No, that's...

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.958
that's not... not true.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.048
Huh? What was that?
Did you just do something?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.342
I felt something! It tickled!

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.886
Ah... No. I'm sorry.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.472
(Ushioh groans)
God, I got goose bumps.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:09.768
SHINPEI: <i>I can kill it.</i>
<i>Just stab its shadow. Just do it.</i>

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.770
(munches)

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:14.397
Mmm!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.859
SHINPEI: <i>This'd be the perfect moment.</i>
<i>It's totally off guard.</i>

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:24.115
<i>But now that I think about it,</i>
<i>it did basically save me that time.</i>

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.827
(giggling)
Mmm!

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.078
SHINPEI: <i>What the...</i>

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.041
USHIO: Tokyo?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.585
SHINPEI: Alain has a friend
who's lived there for a while.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.713
I'm going to stay there
and go to culinary school.

00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.882
I won't do high school in Wakayama.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:42.092
USHIO: Wait, seriously?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.510
SHINPEI: I made up my mind.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.595
USHIO: You never told me any of this.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.181
SHINPEI: It's not like I need
to tell you, do I?

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:51.518
How can you make
a decision like that by yourself?

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.104
I don't understand
why I can't decide for myself?

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:57.607
The truth is, I'm not a Kofune.
I have to be my own person.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.944
I just need to go out there
and start making a living on my own.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.823
I'm done being a constant burden
to you and Alain! I'm done!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.324
A burden?

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.244
USHIO: Do you hate it here that much?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.079
Huh? Why'd you say that?

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.706
SHINPEI: <i>It's not that, Ushio.</i>

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.500
Forget it!

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.127
-I didn't even have to tell you!
-SHINPEI: <i>Listen, I... I...</i>

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.087
-You know what? You forget it!
-SHINPEI: <i>I love you.</i>

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.297
(Ushio grunts)

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:21.756
(gasps)

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.306
SHINPEI: <i>I don't want us</i>
<i>to become family this way.</i>

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.932
<i>Not brother and sister.</i>

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.977
(waves crashing)

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.355
USHIO: Hey, Shinpei.
Today is your last day, right?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.816
I want Shinpei's famous curry for dinner.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.236
Huh? I really need
to finish packing, okay?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.447
SHINPEI: Next time, though.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.451
USHIO: You big dummy.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:57.626
SHINPEI: <i>But there was no next time.</i>
<i>At least, that's what I thought.</i>

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.756
You finally made your curry for me.
I'm so glad.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.675
I'm so glad I got to eat your curry again.

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:07.927
I'm glad I'm alive.

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.766
You like it?

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.476
Look, seconds!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.229
USHIOH: To be honest with you,
it's just not as good when Dad makes it.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.940
I really like yours, Shinpei,
it's the best.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:25.153
SHINPEI: <i>This has to be Ushio.</i>
<i>She's Ushio.</i>

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.863
(stomach rumbles)

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.865
That's good. I'm glad.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:34.663
USHIOH: <i>Hey, Shinpei. Do you think</i>
<i>the same thing will happen on the 24th?</i>

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.874
SHINPEI: <i>Yeah. I think so.</i>
<i>And I'm going to try to stop it.</i>

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.210
-USHIOH: I wanna help too.
-Huh?

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.838
I can't stand by and do nothing
while the summer festival gets ruined

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.173
by that monster.

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.134
And I can't let Mio
and the others disappear.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.513
That's right. Me too.
We will do it together!

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:52.430
Mm!

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.141
Can you analyze and copy humans?

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.102
Ah! Hmm...

00:07:58.103 --> 00:07:59.229
Ha!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.397
SHINPEI: Okay, I guess not.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.276
HIZURU: Current time is 8:45 p. m.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.570
Mio's shadow should appear
in about ten minutes.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.115
<i>How are things going over there?</i>

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.868
NEZU: All clear so far.
Just a breeze coming off the water.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.996
Looks like there's plenty
of light in town tonight.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.665
You hear from Shinpei?

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:19.749
HIZURU: <i>Nothing yet.</i>

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.918
NEZU: <i>You can't rely too much</i>
<i>on what he's seen</i>

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.420
<i>in other loops, Ryunosuke.</i>

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.091
Prey never moves the way you expect it to,
no matter what plans you make.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:32.387
Even the best hunters
constantly need to adapt.

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:33.847
HIZURU: Roger that.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.515
(cell phone buzzes)

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.979
SHINPEI: <i>It's from Ms. Nagumo.</i>
<i>Should I mention Ushioh to her?</i>

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.272
<i>Or should I just lie?</i>

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:43.732
<i>But I...</i>

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.942
-USHIOH: Shinpei?
-Uh, yeah?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.029
Why are you still dressed like that?

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.448
It's weird to wear a swimsuit
in the house.

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.701
-Huh? Oh, yeah. Wait, why didn't...
-(static)

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:58.288
Why didn't it bother me until just now?
That's weird.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.916
-Uh, hey!
-Huh?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.753
What the hell did you do?

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.254
SHINPEI: It wasn't me!

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:10.341
USHIOH: My swimsuit disappeared!
What happened? What the...

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.177
Is it because you copied the swimsuit?

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.637
USHIOH: Whatever!
Just give me something to wear!

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.807
(eerie music)

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.730
Huh? Mio's shadow is coming?
Did you lock up?

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.315
SHINPEI: We'll be fine.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.862
Honestly, locking up
won't help much, anyway.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.490
A shadow can slip in
through the tiniest gap

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.657
in a window or wall.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.327
Seriously? Hang on, I want to try!

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.288
(grunting)

00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:41.998
SHINPEI: It's fine, don't worry.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.085
If I remember correctly,
it hasn't come in here.

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:46.669
Not even once.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:47.712
(knocks on door)

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.631
MIO: Shin-chan?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.299
-It's Mio! Quick, hide!
-(gasps)

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:52.592
(Ushioh groans)

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:57.931
-Did you finish eating?
-Huh?

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.183
I wanna wash the dishes for you.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.477
SHINPEI: Ah, the dishes. Sure thing.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.815
MIO: Uh, you all done?
Why did you use two spoons?

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.775
-(both grunt)
-MIO: Two glasses too.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:13.488
Huh? Is that weird or something?
Nope, it's not weird at all!

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:17.283
MIO: Answering your own question?
Hang on a sec, Sis isn't here, is she?

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.618
(grunts)

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:22.413
I get it. You made this bowl for her,
didn't you, Shin-chan?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.915
Aah...

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.000
MIO: She's definitely here, isn't she?

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.254
MIO: <i>Legend says</i>
<i>that on the island of Hitogashima,</i>

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.006
<i>lost souls return home</i>
<i>as guardian spirits.</i>

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.217
Mr. Karikiri always said that.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.181
Ah... You can just leave the bowls.
I'll wash them later, Mio.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.434
Mm. Thanks for the meal, Shin-chan.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.732
Man, oh, man. That was a close one.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.110
Mio really does have good instincts.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.070
Whoa! Oh, god!

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:57.031
What... What is it? You forget something?

00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.450
SHINPEI: <i>What the...</i>

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.371
<i>It's not...</i>
(gasps)

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:06.708
(splatters)

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.751
(foreboding music)

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:10.879
Ushioh!

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.048
That hurt!
(grunts)

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:19.679
(grunts)

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.767
(tense music)

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.320
(groans)

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.030
(yells)

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.867
(panting)

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.287
SHINPEI: <i>There's no way</i>
<i>I can beat it in a fight.</i>

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.624
<i>But if I'm going to die, anyway,</i>
<i>I have to try.</i>

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.293
<i>Just try! I have to do everything I can!</i>

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:57.467
Come on, Mioh. I'm taking you down!

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.386
Shin... Shinpei.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.642
MIOH: Hey, Sis, why are you
on Shin-chan's side?

00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:09.312
He's with Nezu and Minakata,
they kill shadows.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.398
So the fake ones
don't have the same instincts.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.776
I love Shinpei. He's family.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.947
Go ahead, tell me what's wrong
with helping someone I love?

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.157
(sighs)

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.078
But you died, didn't you?

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.830
MIOH: My sister died that day.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.458
You already died!

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.212
Shin...

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:35.964
(gunshot)

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.007
(screeches)

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.092
(grunts)

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.802
-NEZU: What did I tell you?
-(cocks gun)

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.184
(panting)

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.770
-MIOH: It... I... It hurts...
-(static)

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.983
Why would you do this, Shin-chan?

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:59.028
One other thing. Shin-chan, listen.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:00.446
(Shinpei exhales sharply)

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.032
(grunts)

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.829
(Shinpei breathes heavily)

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.331
(gasps)

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.710
Ushioh. Hey, come on, stay with me.

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.044
-Ushioh!
-HIZURU: I'm coming in.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.004
(gasps)

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.217
Wait, Ms. Nagumo...

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:22.218
(Shinpei grunts)

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.556
Shinpei, why are you getting in my way?

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:29.934
HIZURU: I'm really glad you to see
that you're safe.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.730
But look at that thing.
It's clearly a shadow.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.899
Now, move, so I can kill it.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:38.443
I... I won't!

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:41.029
Hey. Did that shadow get into your head?

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.281
Didn't I tell you the longer
you talk to them,

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:44.991
the easier they can trick you?

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:48.619
I know you have a deep grudge
against shadows in general,

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:51.622
and you're determined to hunt down
every last one.

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:57.045
But listen, this one wound up
protecting me twice, it sacrificed itself.

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.838
The shadow is so irrational.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.300
It doesn't even think before it acts.
You know what that means, right?

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.010
That means it has to be Ushio!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:09.098
Ms. Nagumo, I beg you, please promise me
you'll treat her injuries

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.892
like my broken arm!

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.936
-(head thuds)
-Please help it, I'm begging you!

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.193
This is unbelievable.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.070
Letting a shadow go is one thing,

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.781
but going out of your way
to heal it is another.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.950
If you side with the shadows,
then I'll have to kill you too.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:28.910
Okay, fine.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.746
The next time I loop back,
I'll be sure to talk you out

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:32.914
of killing of her shadow.

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:36.793
-USHIOH: Shinpei.
-Uh...

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:38.711
(gasps)

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.590
Mio? Is the real Mio okay?

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.468
Oh, um... I...

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.678
-HIZURU: The real one is in the bath.
-(gasps)

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.305
I checked on her already.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.640
SHINPEI: What? Really?

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.851
All right. That's great.

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.813
HIZURU: <i>She does have the same voice.</i>

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.564
USHIO: <i>Nagu... Can you hear me?</i>

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:01.359
HIZURU: <i>That's the voice</i>
<i>that brought me to this island.</i>

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.029
So I guess we should adapt? Okay, fine.

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:06.572
HIZURU: Show me where you're hurt.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:10.993
HIZURU: <i>The person who sent me</i>
<i>that message was Ushio Kofune.</i>

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:14.956
(Ushioh grunts)

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:20.169
Huh? No way! Wait! Wait, it's gone!
Look, my arm disappeared!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.379
Ushioh?

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.880
Wait. It doesn't hurt.

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:26.676
That injury is a projection
of the damage felt by the actual shadow.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:29.053
Normal treatment won't be able to heal it.

00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:32.306
-So be careful of--
-Nah, it's cool. It doesn't hurt at all.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.267
You got over that way too quick.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.811
HIZURU: You've grown up a lot
since I last saw you.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:40.565
My name's Hizuru Minakata.
You probably don't remember me.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:43.442
HIZURU: <i>I used to come</i>
<i>to Bistro Kofune a lot.</i>

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.111
Huh? Really?

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.071
Sorry, I don't remember.

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.407
HIZURU: Here, listen to this.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.119
-USHIO: <i>Summer festival...</i>
-USHIOH: Huh?

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.579
USHIO: <i>Killed by shadows...</i>

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.791
<i>And only Shin... Shinpei Ajiro</i>
<i>can stop it.</i>

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:01.419
<i>Please, I need help.</i>

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.714
<i>-Please, please. Help me.</i>
-Oh.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.424
Does this message sound familiar?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:10.136
What is that? It sounded like my voice.

00:16:11.053 --> 00:16:16.559
This is the reason I came here.
So you really don't remember this at all?

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.810
Mm.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.689
I see. All right, then.
Just forget about it.

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.316
We've got a bigger problem right now.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.528
Why did the shadow Mio
go inside the Kofune's place at all?

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:30.990
The shadow Mio knew
that Shiori was done for.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.492
Apparently, they're sharing information.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.663
The shadow Mio was aware of us
and decided to get rid of us.

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:40.458
It was after Nezu and I
had already joined forces,

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:43.628
but then it found out
that Shinpei was with us too.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:47.924
So the shadow Mio entered
your house determined to kill Shinpei.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.344
Is it because I went
with you to Koba Mart?

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:52.845
But how did it find out?

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:56.599
SHINPEI: <i>We killed all the shadows</i>
<i>we could find when we got there.</i>

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.313
In any case, I don't think
I can work alongside you anymore.

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.608
At least, as long as you stay
with Ushio's shadow.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.320
This version of Ushio
may have saved your life,

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:11.781
and it might not seem
like it's a threat to us.

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:16.035
HIZURU: But if she's just a shadow
that's temporarily broken,

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.704
<i>we don't know when she might get fixed.</i>

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:22.583
Listen to what she's saying, Shinpei.
That's the most we can do.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.841
-SHINPEI: Ms. Nagumo!
-Hm?

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:35.680
Listen to me, at three tomorrow,
Mio's shadow will try to kill you

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.098
in Shinju Forest.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.934
We killed one Shadow Mio,
but there could be others.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.022
Be careful. Please don't get killed.

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:50.903
We can change our destinies.
And this is a chance for us to prove it.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:56.993
BISTRO KOFUNE
LUNCH SPECIALS

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.079
ALARM
SNOOZE, STOP

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.010
-USHIOH: Shinpei.
-Uh...

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.596
Good morning.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.180
Oh, wait, you're awake?

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.601
Man, I'm really hungry.
I'm pretty thirsty too.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.227
Hang on, I'll bring you something.

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:24.812
Thanks!

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:27.315
Oh, yeah.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:35.156
Mm-hm. Thanks a lot, Tokiko.
I definitely feel better.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:41.203
Oh, no, I'm sorry I kept you up.
Yeah. Goodbye.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:43.914
Huh?

00:18:44.874 --> 00:18:46.876
Good morning, Shin-chan.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.171
Obviously I'm up already,
so you don't have to come wake me.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:51.797
Uh, okay. Got it?

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.507
Uh, okay.

00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.469
SHINPEI: <i>She can't come wake me</i>
<i>if I'm already up.</i>

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.095
MIO: Hang on, Shin-chan!

00:18:58.179 --> 00:18:59.013
(gasps)

00:19:01.432 --> 00:19:03.142
Mio gave you this?

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.353
Yeah. That's the original necklace.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.104
The original.

00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:09.732
Does it make you
remember anything, Ushioh?

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.151
Like, maybe before you died?

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.362
Uh...

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:16.822
SHINPEI: <i>Will just you think</i>
<i>about it for me?</i>

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.449
USHIOH: <i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.493
SHINPEI: <i>We're opening</i>
<i>the restaurant today.</i>

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.746
USHIOH: <i>Oh, okay. Sounds a lot like Dad.</i>

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:27.541
SHINPEI: <i>Yeah, the restaurant</i>
<i>is always there.</i>

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:30.378
<i>It has to stay exactly the same.</i>

00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:31.712
<i>Alain always said that.</i>

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.800
<i>It's my job to protect</i>
<i>these simple, everyday rituals.</i>

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:42.098
Hey, Shinpei! Sorry.
Did I come a little early?

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.558
(crickets chirping)

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:46.686
-Sorry about that.
-Oh.

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.521
-Take it.
-What the...

00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:50.272
It's super sunny today.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.774
SHINPEI: Come on. Just take one.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:55.236
What's up with you? You're such a weirdo.

00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.328
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:08.791
I need to tell you something.
It's actually about Ushio's death.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:10.751
Mm.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:14.672
Ligature marks, right? It turns out,
someone might have killed me.

00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:15.715
That's right.

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:18.217
(stammers)
Who the hell are you?

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.720
SHINPEI:
Ushioh, you can lose the disguise.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.264
SOU: Huh? Ushio?

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:26.434
Ah... No, god! It... It can't be...

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:27.685
(terrified groan)

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.395
SOU: Ushio!

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:30.312
Yo.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:33.858
USHIOH: I think he froze.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.278
SHINPEI:
<i>Eventually, we told Sou everything.</i>

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.907
<i>He sat there quietly and listened</i>
<i>to everything we had to say.</i>

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:48.289
SOU: Sorry. If only I had done...
done more to save her life that day...

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.082
If only... I just...

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:53.252
I know regrets like this
will never bring her back!

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:56.797
But, please, please just...
Hit me! If you don't...

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.632
-I'm gonna--
-(grunts)

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:00.634
-Nailed it!
-(body thuds)

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:01.927
Stand up, Sou.

00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:04.305
-Do you feel better now? Do you?
-(groaning)

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:06.599
Listen to me,
we're relying on you here, okay?

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:08.559
Quit whining, pull it together!

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.775
The private beach behind
the elementary school.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:20.070
USHIOH: Here it is. This is where I died.

00:21:20.571 --> 00:21:22.823
So she really doesn't remember it?

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:23.949
Mm-hm.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.410
USHIOH: Oh! Hey, that's my phone.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:29.580
I wanted to see what's on it,
but I guess it's locked.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:30.831
(cell phone buzzes)

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.167
-Huh? The password changed.
-(cell phone beeps)

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.127
-Oh, it opened.
-(gasps)

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.629
By fingerprint.

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:40.341
Check your email, memos,
photos, anything could help.

00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:43.844
Huh? Friday was the 20th, right?

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:48.349
There's a video file from the morning
of the day before I died.

00:21:48.432 --> 00:21:49.266
SHINPEI: That's it!

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.394
USHIOH: Hold on. We should watch it.

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.111
(closing theme music)
