00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.712
(theme music)

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.852
SHINPEI: <i>The date changed.</i>
<i>Now, it's the 23rd.</i>

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:46.773
(thuds)

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:49.067
(shower squeaks)

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:52.279
Hey, look, I found a bottle of shampoo.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.240
-HIZURU: Oh. Thanks a lot.
-(Ushioh chuckles)

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.036
-So, uh...
-HIZURU: Hm?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.332
USHIOH: Shinpei and I actually saw
the memory of you and Heine.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.001
You know, the one from 14 years ago.

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.503
Right, I heard about that.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.089
USHIOH: Back then, you were super flat!

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:14.134
Mind if I touch them?
I wanna know what they're like.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.636
HIZURU: Okay, go ahead.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.389
USHIOH: Oh, wow, uh...
Your shoulders must hurt a lot.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.642
-HIZURU: They do.
-USHIOH: Uh...

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:28.023
I'm wondering,
how exactly did Heine end up like that?

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.115
<i>She was really just a normal kid at first,</i>
<i>back when she was playing with you.</i>

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.121
I shouldn't have let my curiosity win out.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.124
It got the better of me,
it was a stupid move.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.837
Right, you know, I think
I was born from a part of Heine.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.175
USHIOH: <i>A piece of her flew off</i>
<i>and fell on the ground</i>

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.761
<i>when Ryunosuke died,</i>
<i>and I think that was me.</i>

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:01.056
I'm afraid that I...

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.686
I might turn out like her someday.
I can't bear the thought of it.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.688
HIZURU: Not to worry, Ushioh.

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:11.233
I'll be sure to kill you
if that ever happens.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.697
-MIOH: Mio.
-(gasps)

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.741
MIO: What the... Oh, it's me.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.702
-What is it?
-(Mioh sighs)

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:23.745
MIOH: You're so cold to me.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.583
But I guess that makes sense.
I guess I've always hated myself.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.460
(gasps)
What... What are you...

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:37.801
Tiny little nose, short, stubby fingers,
way too much hair, too damp and sweaty.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.718
Cut it out.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.804
MIOH: You hate all of it.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.101
'Cause you're the complete opposite
of... of Ushio, right?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.227
(Mio gasps)

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.773
It's not just how you look,
it's the grades... it's personality.

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:53.066
I said cut it out!

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.192
(grunts)

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.905
You're just always
in her shadow, aren't you?

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.906
(gasps)

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:02.993
How long are you gonna take this?

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.788
At some point, you have
to tell Shin-chan how you feel.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.458
MIOH: If you don't want to,
I'll do it for you.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:13.670
What, no! You can't just do that.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.631
DR. HISHIGATA:
These are your mother's ashes.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:21.261
I would never, ever feed
the woman I loved to Heine.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:25.766
She passed away on January 3rd, 2013.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.268
She died from cardiac failure.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.564
So I guess you lied about the donor,
didn't you?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.902
SOU: She was already dead
on the day of her surgery.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:37.819
I...

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.238
wish I knew.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:42.073
You really should've told me.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:44.785
DR. HISHIGATA:
The Hishigata family has been involved

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.703
with shadows for three centuries.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.874
I knew I had to pass it down
to the next generation,

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.918
but I only needed one successor.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:57.547
My father didn't tell any of my brothers,
he decided he'd only tell me.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.551
I thought it'd be too much
for you to bear.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:02.552
(Sou grunts)

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.557
DR. HISHIGATA: Sou. You believe
that human life is precious, don't you?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.060
Of course, I do! Why're you asking me?

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.189
That's why I couldn't tell you, Sou.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:17.609
DR. HISHIGATA: I'm very sorry.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.533
If you wanna say sorry, say it to Tokiko.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.958
Somehow, I can't blame him.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.544
I get why Dr. Hishigata did what he did.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.756
He was doing everything he could
to save someone he loved.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.761
Honestly, if I were him,
I might have done the exact same thing.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:49.057
Yeah, but he orchestrated the mass murder

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.853
at the revival ceremony,
that was his choice.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.356
He turned all his human sacrifices
into shadows,

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.650
and erased the memories of their deaths.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.319
He thought no one would ever know.

00:06:01.987 --> 00:06:06.449
The more I hear, it seems like your dad
was always thinking a few steps ahead.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:07.659
Yes.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.247
They might be shadows,
but Ushioh is Ushio,

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.416
Chitose is Chitose, that's the thing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.043
It's hard to treat them differently.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.546
(chuckles)
You're just too good.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.006
SHINPEI: Uh...

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.549
TOKIKO: Hey, Shinpei.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.886
When was the last time you got some rest?

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.053
Huh?

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:31.057
TOKIKO: You haven't slept once,
during any of your loops so far.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.060
-You have bags under your eyes.
-Oh...

00:06:34.853 --> 00:06:37.856
I guess I have been awake
this whole time, haven't I?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.692
TOKIKO: Exactly.
Don't wear yourself out, okay?

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:41.610
SHINPEI: Mm-hm.

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.114
Look, we're all with you here,
so you should get some rest tonight.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.325
SHINPEI: <i>She has a good point.</i>

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:51.369
<i>It might be my only chance</i>
<i>to get some sleep.</i>

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:53.371
SHINPEI: Thank you.

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.373
(snoring)

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.842
(snoring)

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.976
-USHIOH: Where're you going?
-NEZU: Uh?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.397
Oh, it's just you, Ushioh.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.858
You really shouldn't go out on your own.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.943
Do you need to use
the bathroom or something?

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.404
I've decided I'm going home.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:30.408
USHIOH: Going home alone?
You crazy? What are you thinking--

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.409
(shushes)

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.078
You're being too loud!

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:34.913
USHIOH: Did you forget something?

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:39.542
Hmm... Something like that.
Can I go now or what?

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.213
Um...

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:47.384
Why don't you let me come with you,
if you really need to go?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.886
-Hmm...
-(chuckles)

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.140
Fine, come on, then. Let's get going.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.441
Just wait outside.
I'll be right back, okay?

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.245
Why didn't you wait outside
like I told you!?

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:16.371
Mm...

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.959
Well, I... I felt a shadow in here.

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:27.006
Don't worry.
This one's not going anywhere.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:30.969
NEZU: I'm home.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.971
Oh, Gi...

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.225
Uh... Who is this person?

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:42.272
It's a shadow. She was my wife.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.273
(gasps)

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.777
NEZU: One day a few months back,
she went out and paid a visit to our farm,

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.280
<i>And then she came back a shadow.</i>

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:55.535
The moment I saw that flash of light,
it reminded me of that day.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.038
(Nezu grunts)

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:02.959
<i>I'll never forget it,</i>
<i>it was the day Ryunosuke was killed,</i>

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.461
<i>14 years ago.</i>

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:09.507
Her shadow tried to copy me that day,
but thankfully, I was immune.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:16.931
-(Shadow Kaoru screaming)
-Hm? What's wrong?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.352
NEZU: This isn't normal.
It's never done this.

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:24.564
She probably just received
the same telepathic order

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.108
from Heine that made Chitose go mad.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.319
Hm... Think so?

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.320
-(gun clicks)
-(grunts)

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.739
USHIOH: Nezu, hold on!

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.201
I'm sorry, Ushioh, but this is between us.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:40.413
Wait a minute! I can hack into her,
and she'll be herself again!

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.625
NEZU: Even if you did that,
it would still be a shadow,

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.920
and it won't be like you
or Mrs. Hishigata.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.340
Listen. It murdered my wife
and took her form.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.550
That makes it my wife's enemy.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.177
But you...

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.097
I couldn't bring myself
to kill it until now.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.433
I swore I would kill any shadow I could.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:04.312
Then, out of weakness,
I let my greatest enemy live.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.440
But that's over now,
I don't need any more time.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:12.153
Just let me end this,
so I can finally have some closure.

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.948
(Ushioh sobs)

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:15.949
All right?

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.995
(somber music)

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:29.796
NEZU: I'm so sorry about this, Kaoru.
I'll be with you soon.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.384
(gunshot)

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.851
SHIDE: Impressive, Nurse Negoro.
You're quite handy with a bandage.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.910
SHINPEI: <i>The long night finally ended.</i>

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.415
It's morning.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:09.919
Hey, how are you feeling?
You were asleep for a long time.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.799
SHINPEI: <i>This is good, the edge of time</i>
<i>is a bit farther off now.</i>

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.262
I've got a little leeway now
for the number of loops I have left.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:24.726
But my eyes are still hurting,
and my headache is worse.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.519
<i>Is everyone safe?</i>

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:27.687
Oh, right.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.648
Oh.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.108
Morning.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.069
Uh... Good morning.

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:39.032
SHINPEI: <i>We all made it to the morning</i>
<i>of the 23rd alive.</i>

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.117
(birds chirping)

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:45.705
<i>Today, on the 23rd, we're gonna hunt.</i>

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:50.877
<i>Before the final battle, we need to try</i>
<i>to weaken the shadows' forces.</i>

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:55.423
<i>To start, we'll go after the shadows</i>
<i>Ms. Nagumo saw at the funeral.</i>

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.592
<i>Team Nagumo takes the Kogaitos,</i>

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.638
<i>and at the same time,</i>
<i>team Ushioh takes out the Hitobuchis.</i>

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.475
<i>Our team started by returning</i>
<i>to Bistro Kofune.</i>

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.186
<i>Alain was prepping for lunch.</i>

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.980
<i>We thought he'd be mad at us</i>
<i>for showing up,</i>

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.067
<i>but he was kind</i>
<i>and he just welcomed us home.</i>

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:20.698
<i>Rose and Gil stood watch at Kofune</i>
<i>all night long, so we sent them to Tokiko.</i>

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.118
Mio, you'll help Alain.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.371
Shadow Mioh will keep watch.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.373
Sou, you'll hang back here as well.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:32.794
Well, guys, looks like Shin-chan
and our sis here will be all alone today.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.754
Huh? Oh, yeah.

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.840
Sounds nice, huh, Mio?

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:38.967
Huh? Uh...

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.427
MIO: It'll be fine. We have Sou with us.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.596
-Right?
-Yeah, Of course.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.349
MIO: Okay, you two, listen up.
Just be safe.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.768
-Here, take this.
-Hm?

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.855
These are real strands
of hair, from Ushio.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.483
-USHIOH: Uh, what're they for?
-Oh, I get it!

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.570
Well, I found hair
on the floor of some of the rooms.

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.073
It should have Ushio's data in it, right?

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.075
I only found a few strands,

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:07.036
but I think you should be able
to use them to recover.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.456
USHIOH: Mio, you're a genius!

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:19.007
My hair's been restored!

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:24.053
All right, let's get started.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.013
USHIOH: Yeah.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.223
You take good care of Mio, Sou.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.934
Leave it to me. Don't die out there.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.145
Shin-chan.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:36.607
There's something I have to tell you.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.779
So that means you have to come back.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.573
SHINPEI: Understood.

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.075
Call me if anything happens.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:49.495
MIO: Uh-huh.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.713
I don't sense any shadows.
They're not here anymore.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.967
Looks like Ms. Nagumo's conclusion
was accurate,

00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.636
the Hitobuchi family got wiped out.

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:09.182
SHINPEI: <i>She saw the shadow</i>
<i>of Kanae Hitobuchi,</i>

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.516
<i>a school teacher.</i>

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.768
<i>She had a nickname.</i>

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.604
<i>They called her "Bucchi."</i>

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.315
<i>She taught pretty much every kid</i>
<i>on the island,</i>

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.693
including Ushio, Ms. Nagumo, and myself.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.614
(cicadas screeching)

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.244
There she is. Hey, look at that!

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:32.497
BOY 1: How did her hair get that blonde?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.040
BOY 2: And she's got those blue eyes, too.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.167
-BOY 1: It's so weird!
-BOY 2: It's 'cause she's a foreigner!

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.877
BOYS: Foreigner!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.295
-Foreigner!
-Hey!

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.338
BOYS: Huh?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.507
-Take that!
-(boys groaning)

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.383
(boys whimpering)

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:45.468
Ushio.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.427
Get back here!

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:51.057
Hey, stop! What do you kids
think you're doing over there?

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.185
SHINPEI: Bucchi.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:55.228
(grumbles)

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.065
It's not my fault.
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:02.443
HITOBUCHI: No, of course not.
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:04.153
You were just upset.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.279
I'm not upset.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:10.076
USHIO: Those two always pick
on the weak kids, 'cause they're weak.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.577
But I'm not a weak kid, you know?

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.080
I just taught them
that they can't mess with me.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:17.083
Well, yes, you certainly are strong.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.918
Huh?

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:22.547
But violence is unacceptable.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.592
Truly strong people don't need
to hurt others to feel powerful.

00:15:26.676 --> 00:15:29.053
That doesn't make sense, I don't... Mm!

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:34.016
These little hands of yours
were not made to hurt people, Ushio.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.811
HITOBUCHI: You should use them
to embrace people,

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:39.522
you should use them
to hold hands with people.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.234
You want me to hold hands with them?
That's so gross! Ew!

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:44.986
HITOBUCHI: And, Shinpei...

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.195
Uh, yes?

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:50.575
Keep your eyes on Ushio for me, okay?
Try to keep her out of trouble.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.659
I'm counting on you.

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:53.119
Okay.

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:58.082
Next time, before you decide
to make a fist, think about what I said.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.003
Well, I can't promise that.
I can't not fight back.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.422
All right.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.465
Huh?

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.263
You're always honest with me, Ushio.
That's what I love about you.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.310
Bucchi.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:20.313
USHIOH: She was so kind to me.

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.564
SHINPEI: I know.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:24.525
But she was scary when she got mad.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.485
Yeah.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.908
USHIOH: We're the only ones
who can avenge her death.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.204
(cicadas chirping)

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.040
SHINPEI <i>We followed the presence</i>
<i>of shadows</i>

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.834
<i>into the forest on Mt. Takanosu.</i>

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:45.129
You feel anything, Ushioh?

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:48.049
Yeah, I feel them more here.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.761
Be careful.
Chances are they sense me, too.

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.512
Yeah, I got it.

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.515
Shinpei, are you nervous right now?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.477
Of course I am.
It's just the two of us against them.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.563
Well, you don't need to be,
I got your back.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.941
All you gotta do is sit back and relax.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.442
(people screaming)

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.652
Shinpei, get on!

00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:13.741
Ugh, go... go away!

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:18.204
Well, well, just look at you Hamaji,
full of energy and spirit as always.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.165
You'll be a very tasty meal.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.875
(grunts)

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.757
Huh? Ushio?

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.177
Wait! I missed one!
Shinpei! Behind the kids!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.387
BOTH: Huh?

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.557
(gunshot)

00:17:38.641 --> 00:17:39.517
(coughs)

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:44.772
Oh, my gosh, Shinpei. You got so big.
Are you doing well?

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:48.317
I am, Mrs. Hitobuchi.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:51.904
Mm...

00:17:56.242 --> 00:18:00.329
So you're telling me good shadows
have started fighting bad ones,

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.624
-and you're good?
-Right, Todai! You nailed it.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.836
Don't worry.
We'll beat up all the bad shadows.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.546
We won't let them hurt you.

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:09.755
Right, Shinpei?

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.340
Yep, exactly right!

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.717
USHIOH: Why are you still up there?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.594
That's because I can't get down!

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:16.429
You're the one
who put me up here! Remember?

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:19.056
Shinpei really gets led around
by the nose.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.350
AKARI: Yeah! It's like they're married!

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:22.560
BOTH: It's not like that!

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:28.566
Listen, this mission is top secret, guys,
so you can't tell any grown-ups, okay?

00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:29.483
Hm...

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.526
Okay. Roger that!

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.486
HAMAJI: This is so cool!

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.699
USHIOH: I just didn't have the heart
to tell those little kids,

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.451
that the real Bucchi was killed.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:42.163
It's for the best.
There's no need to scare them.

00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:45.708
USHIOH: You think they'll keep quiet
about the shadows?

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.586
No one would believe them, anyway.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.795
(gasps)

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.757
USHIOH: Look, there's blood.
It's still fresh.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.551
I wonder if Bucchi did this.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.720
(flash squealing)

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.014
It's a 34-year-old woman.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.433
She's not from the island.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:06.896
USHIOH: <i>She lived in Osaka.</i>
<i>She was a tourist.</i>

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.482
SHINPEI: There's no stain
in the shape of a person.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.068
That tourist was taken away from here.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.030
Damn it, Heine's eating more
to heal her wounds,

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.907
the ones she got yesterday.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.034
(in demonic voice)
She's a fool.

00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.870
Eating more strangers
won't heal her at all.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:28.209
Shiori Kobayakawa and Heine,
their originals are gone,

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.794
they don't exist anymore.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:31.504
Ushioh?

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:34.965
(in normal voice)
Huh, did I just say something?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.426
-Wait a sec.
-(cell phone buzzing)

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.387
SHINPEI: It's Ms. Nagumo.

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:42.598
Let's meet up with everyone
like we planned earlier.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.560
SHINPEI: I'll send the kids
to Bistro Kofune. They'll be safe there.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:50.356
Both teams met up
and filled each other in.

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.318
<i>Basically, we only defeated</i>
<i>three shadows total.</i>

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:56.404
<i>Mrs. Hitobuchi and two kids.</i>

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.784
<i>The Kogaito home had human stains,</i>
<i>but there were no shadows to be found.</i>

00:20:03.327 --> 00:20:05.371
<i>Then we went with Totsumura later</i>

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.082
<i>to do some digging on the shadows</i>
<i>we fought in the gym.</i>

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.546
<i>All of their homes were empty,</i>
<i>but all the families told their neighbors</i>

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:17.550
<i>that they were going to leave,</i>
<i>and then they vanished.</i>

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:21.470
The thing is,
the Kobayakawas said that Shiori

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:25.933
would be recovering at a relative's house,
as in, she'd be living there temporarily.

00:20:26.517 --> 00:20:29.895
So naturally, I called the relatives,
and there was no truth to it at all.

00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:33.816
In the first loop, your shadow told me
that they were running away

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.025
from their debt.

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:36.402
From their debt?

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:39.947
You think they're trying to cover
themselves to avoid being found out?

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.782
In case we erase all of them?

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:43.743
It looks like they want
the summer festival to go

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:44.869
as they planned earlier.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.289
It just doesn't seem
like they're going to attack us.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:51.834
Do you think they're afraid that Ushioh
will be able to hack them.

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:56.756
Tell you one thing,
they won't show their backs to us anymore.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.092
So we know they want
the summer festival to go forward.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.720
Do you guys think
we can cancel it somehow?

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.430
Hm...

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:09.226
If we're going to do that,
we'll need to pay a visit to that man.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:18.110
SHINPEI: <i>Looking back, I was trying</i>
<i>to meet him from the very beginning.</i>

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:22.364
<i>The first place I died.</i>
<i>In my very first loop.</i>

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:28.245
<i>The Hiruko Shrine.</i>
<i>It's where everything began.</i>

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.956
(cicadas chirping)

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:34.835
Hello there.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.217
Oh, hi. Good afternoon.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:45.679
I'd like to discuss
something with you, Mr. Karikiri.

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.181
Do you have some time?

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:52.394
Sure. Of course, I do.
Why don't we go inside and talk?

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:53.896
Come with me.

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:01.987
(closing theme music)
