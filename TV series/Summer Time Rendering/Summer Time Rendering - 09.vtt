WEBVTT

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:04.505
USHIOH: What's this? A nice view?

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.424
SOU: Isn't this the beach
we're on right now?

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.634
SHINPEI: Yeah, looks like it.

00:00:09.468 --> 00:00:12.137
Shinpei?
(chuckles)

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.974
Or Mio, I guess.
Or whoever else might be watching.

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:18.977
USHIO: <i>Anyways,</i>
<i>I'll just assume it's Shinpei.</i>

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.065
<i>If you are watching this video, Shinpei,</i>
<i>it means I'm not living</i>

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.942
<i>-in this world anymore.</i>
-(gasps)

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.903
GIRL: Oh, come on, clearly,
you just wanted to say that line.

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:29.238
How'd you know?

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.240
GIRL: Well, I know myself pretty well.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:34.910
Come here. Let's both be in it,
come over here for a second.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.287
SHINPEI: What...

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.872
Over here, this good?

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:40.249
A little to the left.

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:42.417
-SHINPEI: <i>Is that Ushio and her shadow?</i>
-USHIO: <i>No, that's too much.</i>

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.627
<i>That's perfect. There.</i>

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.379
SHINPEI: <i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.797
Shinpei.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.258
Listen carefully. Are you ready?

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.762
USHIO: <i>My shadow and I are the only ones</i>
<i>who can unlock this cell phone.</i>

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:58.100
<i>That can only mean one thing,</i>
<i>my shadow's with you right now.</i>

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.017
Uh...

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.062
BOTH: Oh, by the way,
can you tell us apart?

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.314
Hey, stop! I'm trying to talk here, okay?

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.400
-The one on the left?
-USHIOH: <i>It's me. I'm her.</i>

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.776
-USHIO: <i>No, it's me. I'm me.</i>
-Or on the right?

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.778
-USHIO: <i>Knock if off. I'm the real one.</i>
-It seems like they get along.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.989
-USHIO: <i>None of this really matters!</i>
-None of this really matters!

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.865
-USHIO: <i>Because we're both me.</i>
-Because we're both me.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:16.493
-Huh?
-USHIO: <i>Well, I'm sure you know by now,</i>

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.081
<i>but that version of me isn't evil</i>
<i>or dangerous like the other shadows.</i>

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.918
She's on your side,
she wants to help, I promise.

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:29.548
Listen to my shadow, she'll explain
the details and clear things up,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.510
but I felt like I should tell you,
I wanted you to hear it from me first.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.971
<i>So that's why I'm making this video.</i>

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.473
<i>Okay now, where to begin?</i>

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:42.894
<i>Right. Well, it all started with Shiori.</i>

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:43.895
(static)

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.440
(theme music)

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.614
I'm telling you, it's more than just
some look-alike, okay?

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.952
I'm pretty sure that someone
followed me home from school today, too.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:26.623
What, you mean like a stalker?
Be careful. Should I let Totsumura know?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:30.168
Totsumura can't help with this!
I know it's that girl.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:34.631
Uh, hey, Sis? is this the right medicine
for Dad's athlete's foot?

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.133
Yeah, you got it, that's it.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.094
You're not even listening to me!
I should charge you double!

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.596
Hey, what's going on? What's the problem?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.141
SHIORI: Forget it, see ya later.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.070
-(zaps)
-Huh?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.453
(gasps)
USHIO: Mio, look.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.413
Huh?
(gasps)

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.625
Who are you?

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.877
-Huh?
-(static)

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.379
USHIO: Uh, wait!

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.301
Did I lose her? Huh?

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:25.682
Ah...

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.642
MIO: Shadow...

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:28.643
Huh?

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.606
It's more than just some look-alike.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.648
(gasps)

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.361
A shadow?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.908
USHIO: Yeah, okay, Shiori, we'll look
into your story about the look-alike.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.577
Oh! So you decided to believe me?

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.122
That's right,
so you don't need to worry anymore.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:50.040
(chuckles)

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.711
KARIKIRI: Folks, the Omotohama cleanup day
is drawing to a close!

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:59.424
Thanks to you, the beach is spotless,
in time for the big opening tomorrow.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.927
We will burn all the trash collected today

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.804
at the upcoming Omiokuri event.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:09.309
Okay, everyone, we'll see you
at the summer festival on July 24th!

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.685
KOFUNE

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.314
USHIO AND MIO: Rock, paper, scissors...
Ready? And shoot!

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.692
Yay! I get to go first!
(chuckles)

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.279
Can I ask you something?

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.241
Do you think Shin-chan
will be back this summer?

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:28.245
Huh? Whatever, who cares
if he never comes back!

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.455
MIO: Yeah, right, I know you like him.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.373
(grunts)

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:34.793
You can't lie.
You really like Shin-chan, don't you?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.002
Ah...

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.796
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Wait, stop it...

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.966
Now, move, 'cause I'm going to
take a bath first!

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.512
MIO: Okay, go ahead, Sis.

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.935
USHIO: <i>Shinpei... I wonder</i>
<i>what he's doing right now?</i>

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:57.566
Ugh! Whatever, who cares?
Doesn't matter. Forget him.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.025
USHIO: Oh.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.820
Uh, uh...

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.323
-Oh, hi there.
-(gasps)

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.492
Mio!

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:09.202
(shushes)

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:12.372
(muffled grunting)

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.209
-(muffled screaming)
-(stomps)

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:19.379
(groaning)

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.339
(both panting)

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.258
Who are you? What are you?

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.387
Ow, you won't listen to anything I say.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.347
Did you follow us from Omotohama?

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:30.932
My name's Ushio Kofune.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.184
And I live here.
Everyone knows this is my house!

00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.897
Then, why... why were you hiding in here?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.024
Well, because you were with Mio.

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:40.859
So are you...

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.777
BOTH: Do you know about shadows?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.904
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.322
-You're the shadow.
-You're the shadow.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.283
USHIO: <i>Huh? What is going on?</i>

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:52.537
Just wait a second. If shadows
really do exist like they say...

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:54.497
(gasps)

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.418
BOTH: <i>Shiori's shadow must be</i>
<i>somewhere on the island, too!</i>

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.004
This doesn't feel right.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.047
Huh?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.716
USHIOH: Didn't Shiori say
that she first saw her shadow

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.801
up on Mount Takanosu somewhere?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.013
We should probably check it out,
shouldn't we?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:13.850
Yeah, I guess.
I'll just have to deal with you later.

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.523
Why are you following me?

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.567
You're the one who's following.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:26.905
I promised Shiori that I'd look into this,
then she can stop worrying,

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.323
and put her mind at ease.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.992
If you try anything funny
or make one wrong move,

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.536
I'll take you down, understand?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.376
(sighs)

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.461
USHIO: <i>Can't find any leads.</i>

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:45.590
<i>I'm almost out of time today.</i>
<i>I need to hike down before it gets dark.</i>

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.175
-USHIOH: Hey, come here.
-Hm?

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:48.510
KEEP OUT

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.638
USHIOH: Look.
There's a trail right over there.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.057
Now, I totally want to go for a hike.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.558
I know, right?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.521
(ominous music)

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:01.856
Ah...

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:07.278
USHIO: Oh, hey, this must be
the old clinic Sou's family owned.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.196
HISHIGATA CLINIC

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.824
USHIO: <i>Rumor has it</i>
<i>that this old run-down clinic is haunted.</i>

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.245
<i>Everyone on the island is afraid of it,</i>
<i>so they stay away.</i>

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.914
(Ushio shrieking)

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.459
So creepy! Places like this
freak me out. I hate ghosts!

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.377
Oh. You too?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.463
USHIO: You seem really excited
to go inside.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.466
You sure you want to? Aren't you scared?

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.845
Yeah, I'm pretty scared,
but I feel like...

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:32.762
PRESCRIPTIONS

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.432
USHIOH: ...this isn't my first time,
like I've been here before.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.475
-(crow squawking)
-(gasps)

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.602
Who is it? Who's out there?

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:47.027
(crow squawking)

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.572
(foreboding music)

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.827
(zaps)

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.037
(grunts)

00:08:58.705 --> 00:08:59.664
(gasps)

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:04.377
-(static)
-(crow squawking)

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.969
USHIO: <i>That's the shadow?</i>
<i>It's got my face!</i>

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.475
-(screams)
-Watch out!

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:20.852
What was that?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:23.104
(groans)

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.025
Let go! Damn! What's going on?

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.735
USHIOH: Damn it.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:33.073
Ugh! Let go of her! Let go! Get off!

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.159
Let go!

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:37.660
(grunts)

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.462
(coughing)

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.381
(muffled screaming)

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:54.552
USHIOH: <i>What's happening?</i>
<i>It wasn't my leg that got stabbed!</i>

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.013
<i>Oh, I get it now.</i>

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.476
<i>That's it, that's the shadow's weakness.</i>

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:06.940
<i>I know that. There's no doubt</i>
<i>that my body felt it.</i>

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.907
<i>That means I am not human.</i>

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:19.911
Come back here!

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.498
USHIOH: <i>My real body</i>
<i>is just a flat shadow.</i>

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:25.792
(shadow groans)

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:26.876
<i>This body...</i>

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.425
<i>It's just a shell to protect my real form.</i>

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.848
(panting)

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.810
(panting)

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.439
-Are you...
-(gasps)

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.275
So what the heck was that?

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:52.986
I don't...

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.364
That was amazing,
the whole thing was super cool!

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:59.200
Huh?
(chuckles)

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.286
USHIOH: I know, right?

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.914
(zaps)

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.417
(static)

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.878
Wow! It healed.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.922
I just copied the data
from your right foot.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.591
So it's like data to you?

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.595
USHIOH: I don't know exactly
how to put it, but yeah, I guess so.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.723
But this copy of the data
will probably disappear.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:25.768
The original gets deleted
and the copy becomes the original.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.105
Deleted? Does that mean killed?

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.900
So you're going to disappear unless I die?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.570
USHIOH: I think so,
I just have that feeling in my head.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:38.656
Normally, I guess I'm supposed
to kill you to stay alive.

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.535
That's why people say...
people say that you'll die

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.162
if you see your own shadow.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:46.706
Shiori is in danger.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.251
We have to do something about it.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.930
USHIO: So you must be
with my shadow right now,

00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.640
whether you know it or not.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.934
USHIOH: <i>What will Shinpei think</i>

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:09.312
<i>when he finally finds out</i>
<i>that I'm not real?</i>

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.440
BOTH: Oh, by the way,
can you tell us apart?

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.859
Hey, stop! I'm trying to talk here, okay?

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.488
-USHIO: None of this really matters.
-Oh.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.615
Because we're both me.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:23.117
(gasps)

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:36.756
Ushioh, you two actually tried
to save Shiori together, didn't you?

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:43.221
I remember. I do. I remember now.
(sobbing)

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:45.181
Your memory...

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.933
Has... Has it come back?

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:51.062
USHIOH: It's not just my memory.
My power came back too.

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.230
SHINPEI: Power?

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:56.067
I want you to see the truth
about the end of my life.

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:59.904
So I'll recreate it for you guys,
as I pull from my memory data.

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:07.245
Let's go to the private beach
behind the school on July 21st.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.876
Oh...
(sighs)

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.545
SHINPEI: <i>This place...</i>

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.506
SOU: Hey, Shinpei, look over there.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.467
I'm so glad it's sunny!

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.468
I know, right?

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.471
You know,
this is the perfect weather to study.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.223
-Whoa!
-Perfect weather for swimming!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:32.312
Hey, Shiori! I heard you can't swim,
like, at all. That's so lame!

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.231
Whatever, Hamaji!
You can't even eat mushrooms!

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.735
So what if I can't eat them,
that doesn't make me lame, you butthead!

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.528
Is that...

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:44.157
No doubt about it. That's us on the 21st.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.450
I need to stop 'em.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.452
Hey! Wait a sec!
(grunts)

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:48.953
SHINPEI: It's pointless.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:53.833
These are just old images.
We may as well be watching a recording.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.003
We can't interfere with them,
and they can't hear us at all.

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.546
That right, Ushioh?

00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:59.464
Mm.

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:00.923
Damn it.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.468
Do you remember
where you were around this time?

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.761
Come with me.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.518
BOYS: One, two, three, four, five.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.854
(zaps)

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.274
USHIOH: You think I've put on some weight
or is it my imagination?

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.360
No, don't say that.
It's been bothering me.

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.905
SHINPEI: This is where
you copied the swimsuit.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.573
USHIOH: Just watch.

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:28.951
I'll never get near Shiori
if I look like this.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.455
Hey, I have an idea.
Can you turn into this?

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:34.916
USHIOH: Mm-hm.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.755
USHIOH: Okay, well?

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.006
USHIO: That's perfect!

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.803
I turned myself into the shell necklace,
so that Ushio could wear me.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.265
Before that, I took off the real necklace
and put it away in my pool bag.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.976
-SHIORI: Hey. Hey, Mio.
-Huh?

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.563
How can I learn to be
a really good swimmer like you?

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:59.982
Can you teach me? I want to learn how!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:05.196
Yeah, of course, I can!
Why don't we do a swimming lesson today?

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.824
All right, now who wants
to learn how to swim?

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:08.908
Me!

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.160
SHINPEI: <i>Shiori.</i>

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.162
MIO: That's the spirit!

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.997
-Huh? Ahh!
-(chuckles)

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:19.085
Don't worry, I'll protect you,
no matter what.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.547
Huh? What was that, Ushio? Wedding vows?

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.340
HAMAJI: What?

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.384
MIO: What's wrong?

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.261
Akari says she just pooped.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.220
MIO: Uh-oh.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:32.181
No, I didn't! I just need to go,

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:34.267
-and it's starting to come out!
-MIO: Hey, would you like me to go

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.184
with you now?

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.102
That's okay.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:38.354
I'll take her, we'll be back!

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:40.857
Huh?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.359
(tense music)

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:44.861
USHIO: Hey, Shiori?

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.071
(both gasp)

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.447
What's wrong?

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.825
I don't know. I think Shiori's gone.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.035
-Wait, guys, look. Over there!
-(gasps)

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.040
USHIOH: Ushio, it's in the water!
I can feel a shadow!

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.125
(gasps)

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.587
MIO: Tokiko, you take Akari
to the bathroom. Come on, Sou!

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.005
SOU: Okay!

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:07.008
(all panting)

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.721
Shinpei, did you see
what's happening to Shiori?

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:12.930
Ah, no.

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:16.058
Sorry, this is a memory.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.978
I can't recreate what no one actually saw.

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:20.021
USHIO: Stay back!

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.900
Don't try to follow me!
Just leave this to me!

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:24.942
-Ugh!
-(water splashes)

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:26.068
Oh, Sis, wait!

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:28.529
Don't be stupid, Ushio!
What're you thinking?

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:30.865
USHIO: <i>Hang in there, come on, Shiori.</i>

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:46.005
USHIO: <i>That's it.</i>

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.593
USHIOH: It's Shiori's shadow!

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.470
USHIO: <i>Okay. Here I go.</i>

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.139
USHIOH: <i>Right. Leave this to me.</i>

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.182
Uh...

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.352
(grunts)

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.814
(suspenseful music)

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.326
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Stop it.</i>

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:16.285
USHIOH: Ugh!

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.083
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Don't you know that</i>
<i>I chose her? You can't take her.</i>

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.633
USHIOH: <i>I can't move.</i>

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.719
<i>Come on, I'm so close to the surface,</i>

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.680
<i>and Shiori is going to die.</i>

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.640
(whimpers)

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.100
(grunts)

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.397
USHIO: <i>Hurry! Take her! Take Shiori!</i>

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.400
(groaning)

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:48.484
USHIOH: <i>Ushio!</i>

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:49.860
<i>You idiot!</i>

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:56.367
USHIO: <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Don't stop! Just go!</i>

00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.996
(Ushio screams)

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:08.754
USHIOH: <i>How am I ever going to return</i>
<i>this kind of favor?</i>

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.718
USHIO: <i>Go on...</i>

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.220
<i>Leave me.</i>

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.688
-SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Hey, stop.</i>
-(whimpers)

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:30.568
<i>I told you to stop.</i>

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:31.777
(gasps)

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.280
(ominous music)

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.577
(whimpering)

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.705
(yelling)

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.586
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Huh. You're defective.</i>

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:51.547
(Ushioh sobbing)

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.513
(groaning)

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:08.856
Oh, I feel someone coming.
You really lucked out.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.130
MIO: <i>Shiori.</i>

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.094
(Mio gasps)

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.474
<i>No!</i>

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:44.975
Ushio!

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:55.903
I'm sorry, Ushio. I couldn't...
I couldn't save Shiori in time.

00:19:57.071 --> 00:20:01.200
But I will kill the shadows
right alongside Shinpei.

00:20:01.784 --> 00:20:04.912
USHIOH: I'll save everyone
at the summer festival on the 24th.

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:11.585
Is that enough to repay you
for what you did today?

00:20:12.169 --> 00:20:16.048
-SHINPEI: Yes, of course, that's enough.
-(Ushioh crying)

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:23.389
SOU: So she pretended
to lose consciousness

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:24.724
and took Shiori's place.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.225
SHINPEI: Yeah.

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:27.435
(grunts)

00:20:27.518 --> 00:20:29.729
I hate that damn monster so much.

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:30.646
SHINPEI: Yeah.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.358
I'm going to kill it
with my own two hands.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.902
SHINPEI: Yeah. We already did.

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:38.612
(Sou groans)

00:20:38.696 --> 00:20:41.741
God! How can you be so calm?

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.576
-SHINPEI: I should've...
-Huh?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.786
I should have done it myself.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:51.751
Shinpei. I'm sorry.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:56.172
SHADOW SHIORI: What was that?
Who should have done what now?

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:58.966
(gasps)

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:00.885
(eerie music)

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:01.927
(Shinpei gasps)

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.723
I found you.

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.893
Hey, Ushioh. Isn't this just an image?

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.520
You said they can't touch or hear us.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:14.774
Wait, what is this? It's not in my memory.

00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:18.110
That can't be good. End this, Ushioh!

00:21:18.861 --> 00:21:21.572
It took me a long time
to find you after that.

00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:24.116
(gasps)

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.579
I won't let you get away.

00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:30.664
(ominous music)

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:31.749
(gasps)

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.342
(panting)

00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:45.679
SOU: Are... Are we back?

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:47.973
Shinpei, your arm.

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:48.891
Huh?

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.895
(breathes heavily)

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.066
SHINPEI: That's right where it grabbed me.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.945
(closing theme music)
