00:00:01.585 --> 00:00:04.004
(water burbling)

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.186
USHIO: Hey, Shinpei.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.187
SHINPEI: Hmm?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.272
Close your eyes for a sec.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.484
SHINPEI: Hey, wait! Uh, what?

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.945
There we go. Open them now.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.780
SHINPEI: What... What did you do?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.864
USHIO: I got you a gift.

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:32.908
SHINPEI: I... I don't understand.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:36.787
USHIO: Come on, Shinpei.
When was the last time you came home?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.959
SHINPEI: Um, after I graduated
from junior high, so two years ago.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.379
No way. You never even came home
for the holidays.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.381
SHINPEI: Um... I'm sorry.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:49.591
Tell everyone I said "hi"
when you go back.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.387
SHINPEI: What're you talking about?
Ushio? You're coming, too...

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.805
I can't go with you.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.390
(static)

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.977
Shinpei. You have to find me, okay?
Please don't forget.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.230
What? Hang on! You can't go!

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.900
Take care of Mio. Please look after her.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.820
SHINPEI: Ushio!

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:14.157
(grunting)

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:17.119
What the...

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.914
(gasps)

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.544
(whimpers)
I didn't mean to, uh...

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:27.212
SHINPEI: I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.755
-I... I didn't mean to!
-(slaps)

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.509
I... I'm sorry. I swear!

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.678
HITOGASHIMA

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.725
SHINPEI: <i>Man, what a weird dream.</i>

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.894
<i>It almost got me</i>
<i>in some really serious trouble.</i>

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.525
<i>Calm down, calm down. In these moments...</i>

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.029
<i>I need to relax and see the big picture.</i>

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.575
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I've ever been slapped like that.</i>

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.952
<i>Okay. I think I'm calm.</i>

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:01.204
MAN (over PA): <i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>We'll arrive in Hitogashima shortly.</i>

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.414
Oh.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:05.500
SHINPEI: <i>At the heart</i>
<i>of Wakayama Prefecture,</i>

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:08.128
<i>there's an island</i>
<i>in the Kitan Strait Hitogashima.</i>

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.589
(tranquil music)

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.758
<i>It's home to 700 people.</i>

00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.428
<i>It's known for</i> yomogimochi
<i>and salted squid.</i>

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:20.349
<i>It's a small island supported</i>
<i>by tourism and fishery.</i>

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.062
<i>And I'm coming home</i>
<i>for the first time in two years.</i>

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.195
<i>I'm back in my hometown...</i>

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.405
(cicadas chirping)

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.324
<i>...for the funeral of my childhood friend,</i>

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.993
<i>Ushio Kofune.</i>

-(birds chirping)
-(sighs)

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.213
(rattling)

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.547
Oops.

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.257
MIO: Hey!

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.843
-Huh?
-Welcome home, Shin-chan!

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.720
(laughs)
Hey!

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.013
Mio?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.642
You have a nice trip?
I want to hear everything!

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:05.352
Ah!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.812
(yelps)

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:07.938
(Mio yelps)

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.900
Hey! What are you doing?

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.986
(gasps)

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.824
I was all sweaty and gross,
so I thought I'd take a little dip.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.284
SHINPEI: I'm glad to see
you're doing well.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.707
SHINPEI: <i>Mio Kofune</i>
<i>is Ushio's little sister.</i>

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.170
<i>There's no way she's doing all right,</i>
<i>so soon after her sister died.</i>

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:37.509
<i>"Take care of Mio. Look after her."</i>
<i>Huh, okay.</i>

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:39.469
SHINPEI: Come on.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.140
You sure you're okay?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.558
(Mio gasps softly)

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:48.687
MIO: The sea is so salty.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.441
(cicadas chirping)

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.695
MIO: So what's Tokyo like?
Been to Shibuya? Shibuya!

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.697
SHINPEI: Nah, I don't go out that much.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.783
(Mio sneezes)
Man, I got snot all over my towel.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.285
SHINPEI: I didn't need to know that.

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:04.828
-Yeah. That sounds good.
-SHINPEI: How's the restaurant?

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.246
-Bring that with you, for sure.
-Well, it's been super busy.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.706
Makes sense.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.749
SHINPEI: The restaurant's always busy
during the summer.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.129
MIO: The thing is,
I think it brings too many strangers here.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.591
These days, even the people I know
feel like strangers sometimes.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.509
You don't say.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.971
So many tourists come here
this time of year.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.348
(chuckles)

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.266
What is it?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.478
Shin-chan! You lost your country twang!

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.188
Huh? I did?

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.773
MIO: Tokyo rubbed off on you.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:34.524
SHINPEI: What? No way!

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.443
(leaves rustling softly)

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.112
SHINPEI: <i>We walked all the way</i>
<i>to the funeral home</i>

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:40.947
<i>talking about nothing in particular.</i>

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.949
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.952
(bell ringing)

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.041
(theme music)

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.381
USHIO KOFUNE FUNERAL CEREMONY

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.844
SHINPEI: <i>When I lost</i>
<i>my parents ten years ago,</i>

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:28.388
<i>the Kofune family took me in.</i>

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.685
<i>That's why Ushio was</i>
<i>both a close childhood friend</i>

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.312
<i>and a sister to me.</i>

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.565
<i>The day before I left the island,</i>

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.984
<i>Ushio wanted me</i>
<i>to make some curry for her.</i>

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:44.362
<i>But all I said was, "Maybe next time."</i>

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.909
<i>But there was no "next time."</i>

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.496
WOMAN 1: It's just so tragic.
What a shame.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.415
I can't imagine how hard

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.626
-this must be for Shinpei.
-WOMAN 2: Did you hear what they said?

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.294
About Ushio's body?

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:02.631
Doctor Hishigata did a full blown autopsy.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.051
WOMAN 3: An autopsy?
Wow, that sounds really serious.

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.385
(camera shutter clicks)

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.595
Huh?

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:12.015
MAN: Excuse me, who was that?
No photos allowed in here!

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.308
SHINPEI: <i>They used a flash?</i>

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.976
-Ugh!
-SOU: Shinpei!

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.311
(sobbing)

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:17.771
So glad you finally came back!

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:18.730
SHINPEI: Sou!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.652
Ushio was just trying to save
a drowning child.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:28.740
She was swept away.
I was... I was there, but I couldn't...

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.034
(sobs)
I'm sorry, Shinpei.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.577
Please, I'll do anything!

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.495
(sobs)

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.039
Go ahead, hit me as much as you want.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.750
(crying)

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:39.959
(Shinpei grunts softly)

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.464
-Huh?
-I'm not going to do anything like that.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.927
Seeing everyone cry like this,
it actually calms me down a little.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.388
Shin... Shinpei.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.391
HITOGASHIMA HALL

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:01.106
Hey. I heard your old man performed
the autopsy on Ushio.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.609
But it was just an accident at sea, right?

00:08:05.777 --> 00:08:07.153
See that girl over there?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:08.780
Huh?

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:13.868
SOU: Shiori Kobayakawa.
You know, from Koba Mart.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.621
Oh. She's a lot bigger now.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.415
Yeah, she's in third grade.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:23.336
SOU: She's the girl
who Ushio tried to save from drowning.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.879
Can you imagine?

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:27.215
So that's her, huh?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.342
SOU: That poor girl.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.138
She's so traumatized
that she hasn't said a word since.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:34.222
SHINPEI: That's terrible.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.895
It's time to carry the casket.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.025
-Shinpei, will you...
-SHINPEI: Uh...

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.235
Could you give us a hand?

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.236
Yes!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.990
I'll call you tonight
and fill you in on the rest.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:52.949
Mm.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.951
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

00:08:57.996 --> 00:08:59.164
(coffin thuds)

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.168
(wind gusting)

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:08.089
(waves crashing)

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.383
(dog barking in distance)

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:23.229
ALAIN: Ah. Hey. Sorry I took so long
to get back, Shinpei.

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:24.522
Welcome back, Alain.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.857
Welcome home!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.028
(exhales heavily)
That Mr. Karikiri sure can talk.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.531
Mio. Aren't you supposed to be helping
with the cooking?

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.201
Come on, don't be silly,
my only job is eating!

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.161
It's almost finished.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:42.373
Boy, that smells great.
Ushio always used to love that.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.542
SHINPEI: Mio, could you set
the table, please?

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.004
MIO: We'll set a plate for you too, sis.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.802
It's been so long since I had your curry!

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:56.888
Thank you for this meal.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.146
(bell ringing)

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.819
(humming)

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.781
Hmm?

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:21.579
What the... What are you up to, Mio?

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.456
You're just staring at your own house?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.626
Did you get into... a fight with someone?

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.254
(bell ringing)

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.341
(waves crashing)

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.804
SHINPEI: Hmm.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.640
Right. Okay.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.017
Why did she need an autopsy?

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.185
SOU: <i>Ah.</i>

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:48.106
<i>You know, that's just a rumor.</i>
<i>People love gossip.</i>

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:51.484
<i>It wasn't a full autopsy.</i>
<i>My dad helped examine her body.</i>

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:52.986
<i>So...</i>
(Sou sighs)

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.195
SHINPEI: <i>So it's nothing.</i>

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.363
SOU: Well, here's the thing.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.449
<i>There was something on her neck.</i>

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.326
-<i>Ligature marks.</i>
-Huh?

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.036
SHINPEI: <i>Ligature marks?</i>

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.288
That's right.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.623
It's a sign
that she might've been strangled.

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:06.875
What?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.753
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>it's very possible that she was murdered.</i>

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.298
(Shinpei gasps)

00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:15.258
(ominous music)

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:16.968
SOU: <i>On that day,</i>

00:11:17.468 --> 00:11:19.512
<i>we went to the beach by the school,</i>

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.848
<i>there are never any tourists down there.</i>

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:27.103
<i>Ushio saw Shiori drowning offshore</i>
<i>and she jumped in right away.</i>

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:32.650
<i>Mio and I jumped in right after that,</i>
<i>but I didn't see anyone suspicious.</i>

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.361
SHINPEI: <i>Do you think other people know</i>
<i>about the ligature marks?</i>

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.487
Of course not!

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.867
<i>It's just Mio, Alain, the police,</i>
<i>and my old man.</i>

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.827
<i>They're the only ones who know.</i>

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:46.456
<i>But with what happened,</i>
<i>the police decided to rule out murder.</i>

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:49.292
They called it an accident
and closed the case.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.252
(grumbles)

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.378
Got it.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:53.880
(knocks on door)

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:54.797
Huh?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.176
I understand. Thank you.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.431
Oh. Mio.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:07.143
Hi there. This is the necklace
she was wearing that day.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.270
(gasps)

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:15.485
MIO: I think that she would have
wanted you to have it.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.404
SHINPEI: So this was Ushio's?

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.368
-(Mio sobs softly)
-Hey. What's going on? What are you doing?

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:26.204
Could... Could you dry yourself off?

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:27.872
MIO: Oh, Shin-chan.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.082
(gasps)

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:32.543
(Mio sobbing)

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:41.219
She's gone forever.
I'll never see her again.

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.180
(crying)

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.350
I just hate that. I hate it!

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.310
Mio...

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:55.108
MIO: I'll never forgive
the person who took her life.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.317
(gasps)

00:12:56.734 --> 00:13:01.114
Hey, hold on, Mio. Do you...
Do you know something?

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.240
Mm-hm.

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.533
-(blows nose)
-(grunts)

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.742
Aah!

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.412
Come on, Mio!

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:12.250
Sorry. It's nothing, forget it.
Go ahead and take a bath.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:13.209
(sniffles)

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:17.714
I have a feeling sis would be mad
if she saw me crying like this.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.341
No more crying, starting tomorrow.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.525
Look at that!

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.609
Mm.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:40.987
-Shinpei!
-Mm?

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:43.698
Gosh, thank you!
I'll take good care of it!

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.911
SHINPEI: She kept it all this time.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.624
(sobbing)

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.592
(waves crashing)

00:14:04.302 --> 00:14:06.179
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:17.732
SHINPEI: <i>They say it's always best</i>
<i>to stay busy to help cope with a loss.</i>

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.402
<i>I'm sure Alain and Mio</i>
<i>totally agree with that.</i>

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:23.821
<i>I know I do.</i>

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.448
Hey, Shinpei! Come here!

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.365
Yes?

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.577
So, did ya happen to find
who you were looking for?

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.288
Huh? I was looking for someone?

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.707
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you said so this morning.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.961
You said you were looking for this woman,
she had glasses and really big boobs?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:41.589
Huh? Wait, are you positive
that was me you saw?

00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.216
(snickers)

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:46.219
I think you've had too much
to drink, Mr. Nakamura.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:47.678
Good afternoon, sir!

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:51.933
Ah! God, it's boiling out there today!

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.393
I'll take the usual, okay?

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.396
What a day, it's a real scorcher.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.148
(Tetsu sighs)

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.651
SHINPEI: <i>This is Tetsu Totsumura.</i>

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.861
<i>He's a relative of the Kofunes,</i>

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:07.365
<i>and he's a police officer</i>
<i>at the only station on the island.</i>

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:08.991
WEEKLY SUPER H

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.785
Excuse me. You said the usual?

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.496
Wait, whoa! Well, if it isn't Shinpei!

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:17.250
Oh, listen. About Ushio, well,
you know what I...

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.418
Testu! Good to see you!

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:21.838
Hey, Mio. Cute as always!

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.633
You want your usual Lunch Special
with fried shrimp and medium rice?

00:15:25.716 --> 00:15:27.218
(Tetsu laughs)

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.261
TETSU: Correct!

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.179
What happened this morning?

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.682
I didn't see you come around
for breakfast.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:37.019
TETSU: That's right. Just listen to this.
This is serious business.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:42.400
The entire Kobayakawa family
just completely disappeared.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.944
-(gasps)
-Hm... Kobaya.

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:49.949
SOU: <i>Shiori Kobayakawa. She's the girl</i>
<i>Ushio tried to save from drowning.</i>

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.202
Disappeared?

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:57.707
TETSU: Koba Mart was still closed
at eight o'clock as of this morning.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.128
So their neighbor, Shiomi, decided
to take a quick peek inside their house.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.047
And it was totally empty inside!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:06.507
(Shinpei gasps)

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:10.970
TETSU: Well, that store was always
up to its neck in debt.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:14.432
They might just be running
from their lenders.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.351
-(Mio whimpers)
-Hey.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.061
-Hey, Mio!
-(Shinpei grunts)

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.481
Mio! Where are you going?

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.651
LUNCH SPECIALS

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:27.028
ALAIN: Here you go.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.196
Ooh!

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:29.614
(clicks tongue)

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.490
-(birds chirping)
-(truck honks in distance)

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:36.120
(panting)

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.371
DAILY GOODS
KOBA MART

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:41.584
YOMOGIMOCHI

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:46.339
(approaching footsteps)

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.508
SHINPEI: I just saw them
at the funeral yesterday.

00:16:49.592 --> 00:16:51.302
The Kobayakawa family.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:53.721
Mm.

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.146
I'm sorry that I left.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.147
It's okay.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:07.276
Shiori has been acting
kind of weird lately.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.319
Yeah.

00:17:08.903 --> 00:17:11.239
I heard she stopped talking
after the accident.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:12.657
MIO: No, not that.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.699
SHINPEI: Hm?

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:18.287
MIO: I meant before that. Maybe last week?
She said something strange.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.499
She said she saw something
when she went bug catching

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.167
on Mount Takanosu.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:24.752
What was it?

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:29.799
She said she saw a girl
who looked just like Shiori.

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:36.722
MIO: And after that day she said
she felt like she was being watched,

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:39.225
like there were eyes on her everywhere.

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:44.021
What did she mean by that?
There was just some kinda look alike?

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:46.983
NEZU: That sounds like a shadow to me.

00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:48.609
(both gasp)

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:52.905
(whispers)
Who is this guy?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.032
(whispers)
A fisherman. Name's Nezu.

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.994
Sounds like a shadow sickness
you're talking about.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:00.454
Shadow?

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:04.917
NEZU: It's a curse, a local disease
that spreads all over the island.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.671
Hadn't heard of too many recent cases
around these spots,

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.257
but it was pretty common before the war.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:17.430
If you're unlucky enough to catch it,
you'll start seeing the shadow.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:18.389
(both gasp)

00:18:18.472 --> 00:18:20.474
Once you see it, your days are numbered.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:21.892
(gasps)

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.811
NEZU: The shadow kills you quickly.

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:27.648
Then it takes the figure of its victim

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:30.568
and doesn't stop
until it kills their whole family.

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:32.528
That's the legend, anyway.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:39.785
Anyone who catches the shadow sickness
has to be purified at the Hiruko shrine.

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.121
That's what my gramps used to say.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.083
SHINPEI: What the heck was that?

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.252
-MIO: Hey, Shin-chan.
-Hm?

00:18:49.045 --> 00:18:53.299
MIO: When I was little,
my grandma always told me the same thing.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.427
Do you know anything about the shadows?

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.139
I, uh... Not really. It's a superstition.
Don't you think it is?

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:04.644
Right. But I swear that I...
I swear that I saw it.

00:19:04.727 --> 00:19:06.854
I saw Sis's shadow.

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:07.855
(gasps)

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.816
MIO: It was just three days
before she died.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.279
<i>We decided to go to an event</i>
<i>for habitat cleanup at Omotohama Beach.</i>

00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.367
(ominous music)

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.493
<i>Then we saw it.</i>

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.454
-Hey. Look up there. Mio.
-Huh?

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:29.752
What are you saying?
Don't joke about stuff like that, Mio!

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.379
I swear it's true!

00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:34.340
It just vanished right in front of us.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:37.802
Then three days later,
the accident happened.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.972
-I'm worried about Shiori and her family.
-(heartbeats)

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:45.434
SHINPEI: <i>Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.</i>

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.104
(Mio sobs softly)

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:51.649
Mio. Did you tell anyone else
about what you saw?

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.276
(sobbing)

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.363
(breathes deeply)

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.366
SHINPEI: I said no more crying, remember?

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:03.160
(sobs)
Mm.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:08.124
Let's go see Hiruko,
and we'll ask about the shadows, okay?

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.166
(gasps)

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:14.505
And what was that guy
talking about? Purification.

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:16.382
SHINPEI: Come on.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:22.972
Uh, Shin-chan.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.183
(Mio gasps)

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:31.814
SHINPEI: <i>Hiruko is the nickname</i>
<i>for Hito Shrine, which sits</i>

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.482
<i>on the north side of the island.</i>

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:37.778
(cicadas screeching)

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:48.080
(buzzing)

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.416
SHINPEI: No answer. That's weird.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:57.131
No one's here.
Maybe we should try the one out front.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.924
Mio?

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.886
(bell ringing)

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.387
Are you okay?

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:05.848
Huh?

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.226
Hey, look!
Did... Hey, did you see that?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.187
I didn't get a good look.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.064
MIO: It was...
I'm pretty sure it was Shiori.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:15.024
SHINPEI: What?

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:18.152
-We have to follow her! Hurry up!
-Wait! Aah!

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:23.115
(waves crashing)

00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:28.579
She's not here.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:31.040
Do you think she went even further?

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.960
MIO: I think the old fort is up there.
But it's too dangerous to go that way.

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:37.755
Mio. Let's look at the big picture here.

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:40.132
There it is! Your big-picture method!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:41.926
If that really was Shiori,
I don't understand

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.261
why would she run from us like that?

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:46.597
Good question. I'm not sure, either.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.349
-(gunshot)
-(both gasp)

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:49.850
A gunshot?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:55.523
(panting)

00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:58.234
(groans)

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.448
(gasps)

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:08.452
(groans)

00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:13.415
SHINPEI: <i>I know her,</i>
<i>she was the one on the boat.</i>

00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.669
(grunts)
Ah, Shin-chan! Don't just stand there!

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:19.088
Look, she's bleeding. Look! Help her!

00:22:19.672 --> 00:22:21.674
MIO: What should...
What should we do, Shin-chan?

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.634
-I really messed up.
-Don't we?

00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:25.511
All right, I'm going to go get help!

00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:27.805
-Ugh! Mio! Ugh!
-(gasps)

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.184
(weakly)
Listen... Listen carefully.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.896
I... It's... It's...

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.314
(gunshot)

00:22:39.108 --> 00:22:40.359
(gasps)

00:22:44.154 --> 00:22:47.283
Do you remember
what Dad always used to say?

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.994
(eerie music)

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:51.579
(whimpers)

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:52.955
Shin-chan.

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:56.917
MIOH: Until you wash the dishes
and wipe the table down completely,

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.046
you're not done cooking.

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:04.967
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:09.263
(gunshot)

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:16.228
(static)

00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:19.607
Ushio!

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.860
(grunting)

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:24.862
What the...

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:28.699
(engine rumbling)

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.951
(closing theme music)
