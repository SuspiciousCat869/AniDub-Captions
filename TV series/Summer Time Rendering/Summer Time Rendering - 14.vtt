00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.203
I'm sorry, Hizuru.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:40.207
I know I said before that I would be happy
to meet all your friends.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.959
But when they came...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.378
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.339
I guess I really only like
being around you.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.008
(bells clinking)

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.469
You're not like other people, Hizuru.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.930
You think I'm different?

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.517
Well, yeah, most people
just run away when they see me,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.520
but you ran right toward me,
you always do.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:07.359
This is the second floor, huh?
You could still go upstairs 14 years ago.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:10.821
That's 'cause there's a rumor
that this place is haunted.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.783
Yes, I know, that's exactly
why I've been told not to meet you.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.410
By who?

00:01:16.994 --> 00:01:18.495
Well, by Shide.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:21.582
(theme music)

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.380
(raindrops pattering)

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.591
Shide told you? Well, who's that?

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.136
Hmm, I'm not really supposed to say,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.555
but I guess it couldn't hurt
to tell you a little.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.475
Well, for starters, he's got four arms.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.978
It's because he can be
so greedy sometimes.

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.105
(gasps)

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.439
Four arms?

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.316
Shide...

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.569
Shide... Shide.

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:16.530
That's the four-armed monster!

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.115
-(stomach rumbles)
-Huh?

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.492
-HIZURU: Oh, right, of course.
-Huh?

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:21.493
HIZURU: I brought it.

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:22.911
Here.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:23.954
(Heine gasps cheerfully)

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.290
I've always wanted this!
Thanks so much, Hizuru.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.043
I always wondered how these things tasted!

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.129
-(chuckles)
-(chomps)

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.007
HEINE: Okay, I want to be the mom!

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:38.260
Sure, I'll be the sister, then.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.430
This must be a different day.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:46.435
USHIOH: Shinpei, do you think
that could actually be Heine?

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:52.274
SHINPEI: I don't know. But let's keep
watching this memory till the end.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.736
HEINE: What's wrong, Hizuru?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.488
I just cut my finger.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.782
HEINE: Are you okay? Let me see.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:06.204
-Oh. Hey, what...
-(Heine slurping)

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.249
Heine? Heine, that tickles.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:13.920
(stomach rumbles)

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:19.551
I hate when I get this tired. I hate it.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.012
HEINE: I hate it.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.347
Hey, you don't look so good.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.975
Did you eat anything
besides what I brought?

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:28.435
HIZURU: Uh, Heine?

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.938
HEINE: So many of them starved to death.
(sobs)

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:36.485
All the adults died,
and then we couldn't catch a single fish.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.112
It was in the summer,

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:45.410
my mom died, my dad died,
my siblings died, everyone,

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.872
they all died.
(sobbing)

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.082
Hizuru?

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.585
-HIZURU: Hm?
-HEINE: My shadow...

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:58.965
Do you think you could touch
my shadow, too?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:00.050
Uh...

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.886
Would you, please?

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.642
(sobbing)

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.396
HEINE: <i>Your hand is so warm.</i>
<i>It feels good, Hizuru.</i>

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.398
HIZURU: <i>Your shadow can feel it?</i>

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.316
HEINE: <i>Mm-hm.</i>

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.277
HIZURU: I'll be sure
to bring more food next time.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.738
Thanks a lot, Hizuru.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:26.034
HEINE: I hope you'll always be my friend,
no matter what.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.703
SHINPEI: <i>It's summer.</i>

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:32.999
NEZU: Hey.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.046
You're the Minakata girl,
isn't that right?

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.298
What're you doing here in the forest?

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.050
Well, I'm walking.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.760
NEZU: Yeah, I can see that.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:48.723
This place can be dangerous, you know.
There are snakes in the long grass.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.310
Then isn't it dangerous for you, too?

00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:53.436
NEZU: You bet it is.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.441
That's why I work here. They pay me
to control the snake population.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:02.863
You're in the way, okay?
Have some respect, at least use the path.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.324
Huh? She got snacks?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.870
KOBA: Hm, she just bought a whole bunch.
Aren't you having a party?

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:13.331
That's right, but she never came back
from the Koba Mart.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:14.833
We're worried about her.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.919
Really? She said she was gonna share
with a friend.

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:19.754
I thought for sure she meant you.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:20.964
Huh?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.883
Koba, did she really say that?

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.719
BOTH: Mt. Takanosu!

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.763
RYUNOSUKE: Hey, Sis! You there?

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.182
(exhales heavily)

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:34.769
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I just hope she has some water.</i>

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.689
<i>What if she's passed out somewhere?</i>

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:42.277
<i>Sometimes she even forgets to breathe</i>
<i>when she gets too focused.</i>

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.530
<i>Hm? Wait. Who was that?</i>

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:49.951
Uh...

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.454
(Heine whimpering)

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.624
RYUNOSUKE: <i>A red kimono? Who's that?</i>

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:04.007
SHINPEI: <i>I got a bad feeling.</i>
<i>Is this the moment?</i>

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.968
(Heine whimpering)

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.430
RYUNOSUKE: <i>Is this the friend</i>
<i>Sis told us about?</i>

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:12.390
Hey.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.852
No, don't. Ryunosuke. Don't go.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:19.522
Are you okay? Do you feel sick?

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.568
-RYUNOSUKE: Aah!
-Ms. Nagumo!

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.903
(gasps)

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.989
(panting)

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.949
Hello? Is someone over there?

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:32.410
(gasps)
Did she hear me just now?

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.371
HIZURU: Must be hearing things.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.831
"Ms. Nagumo"? No way.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.752
SHINPEI: <i>Oh, no. She can't hear me.</i>

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:45.131
(flash squealing)

00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.384
What the... What was that?

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.512
(gasps)

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.764
(ominous music)

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.727
(snarling)

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.399
HIZURU: Ryunosuke...

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.610
-Why, Heine?
-(Heine gasps)

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.113
Did you... Did you do this?

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:10.740
Hizuru...

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:13.493
-HEINE: Huh?
-(static)

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.955
HEINE (whimpers): No.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.874
No, please, not me.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.876
No, not me!

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.294
Please, not me!

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.422
(Heine shrieking)

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:33.763
(splats)

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:38.101
SHINPEI: <i>An eye? Heine's right eye!</i>

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:39.894
(Shinpei gasps)

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.147
Was that what I think?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.527
HEINE (whimpering):
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.782
It hurts!
(shrieking)

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.368
HIZURU: Ryunosuke?

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:57.328
Ryunosuke!

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:01.291
HIZURU: No, why... Why'd this happen?
(sobbing)

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.209
Heine!

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:05.336
(gasps)

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.089
(ominous music)

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.550
You bastard!

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.598
SHADOW MOTHER: Wait a minute.
Who's that? Who is it?

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.808
-All right. Go on, then.
-(Hizuru gasps)

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.769
(Shadow Baby giggling)

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.190
(gasps)

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.237
-(grunts)
-HIZURU: The hunter.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.782
NEZU: What the hell happened?

00:09:34.365 --> 00:09:35.533
What the...

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:37.327
-HIZURU: Watch out! Stay away!
-(Nezu grunts)

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.244
(Nezu groans)

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.205
(flash squeals)

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:41.414
-Huh?
-(static)

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.458
(grunting)

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.545
Is that me? It can't be.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.465
-(gasps)
-Oh, Sis, I...

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.721
(screams)

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.475
No way!

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.145
Whoa!
(screaming)

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.236
(groans)

00:10:14.823 --> 00:10:17.575
Hey. What are you? How did you do that?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.663
(Shadow Baby chuckles)

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:25.667
What the hell? So are they immortal?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.878
-So... So this is where you've been.
-Hm?

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.089
-I was looking for you...
-Hey! Wait!

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:37.512
RYUNOSUKE: Don't worry,
I got enough water for you, too, Sis.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.185
Today is our... our birthday.
Isn't it, Sis?

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.397
I think he's inside Hizuru.

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.280
(Shadow Baby whimpers)

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:02.120
Heine must've released
the shadow's abilities

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.706
and Ryunosuke's data at the same time.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:09.961
SHINPEI: So that means Ms. Nagumo's
being moved by Ryunosuke.

00:11:10.044 --> 00:11:11.045
(gasps)

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.216
Huh? What was that?

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.265
(breathes sharply)

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:28.188
I'm sorry about that, Sis.
I might've hurt your shoulder.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:32.150
NEZU: Mm, huh? Hey! Are you okay?

00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:35.320
Wake up! Hey! Hey!

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.073
HITOGASHIMA ISLAND

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.785
(calm music)

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.996
(approaching footsteps)

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:59.427
(sobbing)

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.647
(gasps)

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.110
(gasps)

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.407
HEINE: I'll let you go this time.
Because we were so close.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.494
But the next time we meet, I'll kill you.

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:29.457
(Shinpei gasps)

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.751
(Shinpei groans)

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.920
Shinpei. You came back.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.757
Wait! This is before we went to Koba Mart.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.218
No, don't do it. Please don't.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:44.180
Don't go in. Don't go in.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:48.476
Oh, I'm at home again.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.897
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Ushioh broke Shinpei's neck</i>
<i>and looped back.</i>

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.610
Papa, what time is it?

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.571
It, uh, almost six o'clock.

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:04.575
Last time, the starting point
was before the funeral.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.035
It's getting later and later.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.496
SHIDE: Perhaps the starting point
is getting later,

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.959
because Shinpei's powers are growing
progressively weaker with each loop.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.211
(chuckles)
Every time he dies,

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:18.548
he has less and less time
to observe things when he comes back.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.508
Well, that's a good discovery.

00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:23.720
SHADOW SHIORI: Then we should let him loop
over and over again,

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.471
just like he said he would.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:28.057
Until he can't loop anymore.
(chomps)

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:28.975
(giggles)

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.187
So keep killing Shinpei
every time he comes back

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.606
until he loses his power
to loop altogether?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.525
And eventually, he'll die for good?

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.443
(chomps)

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:42.447
Exactly right.
Let him slowly use up his life.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.407
It's easier than taking him alive.

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.367
Right, Shide?

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:47.910
Right.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.790
SHIDE: Asako. May I have seconds, please?

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:01.632
-(door opens)
-Oh.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:05.219
Hey there. Are you hungry at all?
I brought you this.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:10.475
You know, you're a bit of an odd guy,
cooking at a time like this.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.272
That day, when Ryunosuke entered
your body forever.

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.401
I was definitely surprised,
but I got used to it.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.321
Ryunosuke is strong like Ushioh,

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.865
and you've saved me
more times than I can count.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:29.118
HIZURU: If possible,
I always prefer to fight for myself.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:31.621
I really don't like
bringing out Ryunosuke.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.457
SHINPEI: You care for your brother,
don't you?

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:36.417
Why do you say that?

00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.087
I have a younger sister, so I understand.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:42.715
You don't want Ryunosuke
to battle with shadows

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.843
and have to suffer all over again.
That's my guess.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.805
I'd say you're overthinking it.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.473
Really? Think so?

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.141
I'm only looking after myself.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:57.522
HIZURU: <i>If he fought with all his power,</i>
<i>it would completely shatter my body.</i>

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:01.234
<i>I dislocated my shoulder</i>
<i>and sprained my ankle that day.</i>

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.612
<i>I was totally bedridden for five days,</i>
<i>I could hardly move at all.</i>

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:07.281
It was excruciating.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.117
(chomps)
Mmm.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.577
Ah. I'm sorry, do you not like spicy food?

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.580
No, I like it.
It reminds me of eating at Kofune.

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:19.502
HIZURU: On every July 22nd so far,
Mio's shadow was at Bistro Kofune,

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.462
but tonight, she'll probably come here.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.007
<i>Shadow Mio pretty much ignores</i>
<i>the real Mio.</i>

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.760
<i>She's been given certain orders</i>
<i>that precede her instinct,</i>

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.470
<i>to kill her original.</i>

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.681
The orders are from Heine.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.891
We can use that to our advantage.

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.351
That's right.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:36.894
SHINPEI: With this mark,

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:40.356
do you think
Heine will know my location, too?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.608
HIZURU: I guess we'll find out.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.903
Remember, the enemy loops too,
so we have to move quickly.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.490
If Ushioh is able to share her memories,

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:52.076
then the others will feel
like they looped, too.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.706
We'll attack
with our full strength right away.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.297
MIO: I'm sorry.
Sorry I called you a monster.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.592
You were fighting
as hard as you possibly could.

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:10.761
Oh, at the summer festival?
Don't worry about it.

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:13.181
I sort of am a monster, to be honest.

00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:16.934
-I'm not upset about it at all...
-(Mio sobbing)

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:19.520
I was so afraid I'd never see you again!

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:24.025
-(Mio crying)
-Mio, don't cry, it's okay, I promise.

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.694
MIO: Let me fight,
please let me fight, Sis.

00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:30.489
I can't just watch you two
risk your lives to protect me.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:34.327
Mio, the reason we brought you here
is to keep you safe.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.413
Shin-chan. I'm finally ready
to fight back.

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:40.666
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:51.302
SHINPEI: <i>Alain's not answering.</i>
<i>That's odd. He's usually home by now.</i>

00:16:51.385 --> 00:16:52.553
(gasps)

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.513
(rumbling)

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:00.561
-USHIOH: Shinpei?
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.147
Are you okay?

00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:08.319
Uh, I think so, just a little bit nervous.
Do I have to do this?

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.864
Shinpei, every mission needs a leader.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.908
We all want to hear from you right now.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.829
Uh, I don't think I can be
the leader, all right?

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:20.748
I think you'd be better at that.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.167
-Shinpei, it's gotta be you!
-(grunts)

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.628
USHIOH:
'Cause if it weren't for your powers,

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.672
none of us would be here right now.

00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:32.927
Oh, okay. Well, I... All right.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.349
SHINPEI: For a long time, I've had
this habit of stepping back from reality.

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:42.645
It can often feel like
a different me is looking down

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.146
from high above and watching.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.900
So I was able to see myself
in the big picture,

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.986
amidst my surroundings.

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:53.531
If I messed up,
it didn't feel like I was doing it.

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:56.242
I thought I was being wise
by living like that.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:18:00.204
But after Ushio died,
all I had left was regret.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.707
I should've at least called her
once in a while.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.209
I should've come home for New Years.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:09.005
<i>I wish I'd been able to make her</i>
<i>my famous curry one last time.</i>

00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:11.966
<i>I thought I saw everything,</i>
<i>but I missed that.</i>

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.927
I've made so many mistakes in my life.

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.139
And the most painful feeling
is when I regret things

00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:19.765
I know I can't fix.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.853
I'll probably have more regrets
in the future, I'm sure I will.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.439
But I don't want to feel
like this anymore.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:30.526
So I'll avoid doing anything
that I might regret later.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.904
I always do this.
I always run away from my regrets.

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.531
Run away? Why?

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.367
SHINPEI: That doesn't mean
I'm not going to do anything.

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.869
I'm breaking the cycle.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:43.372
If I'm gonna have regrets,
I at least need to do something,

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.957
something to change this.

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.794
That's how I feel now.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:52.089
So even if I... if I fail,

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:54.759
if everything goes wrong
and I end up dead,

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:59.221
I need to know that I fought hard
and gave this my all.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.725
You saw that Ushio fought alone,
battling shadows,

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.769
until she couldn't fight anymore.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.689
That's how she lost her life.
Trying to save Shiori.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.443
It pains me to think
how truly disappointed,

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.904
how alone she must have felt then.

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.365
So I'll finish what she started.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.785
I won't let the end
of that festival repeat itself.

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:24.622
If we all work together,
I know we can do this.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.791
But don't take my word.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.459
-(Mio and Tokiko gasp)
-But why not?

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.961
SHINPEI:
Because I can't guarantee your lives.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:33.381
I don't know if we'll win this fight.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.343
But I... I'm not giving you
the choice to leave.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:41.847
I know it sounds like I'm being selfish,
but I don't want regrets.

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:44.141
So the reason I'm forcing you to stay

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:48.312
is because I don't want
to regret not forcing you.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:52.400
<i>So pick up a weapon,</i>
<i>take a deep breath, and fight with me.</i>

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:00.533
NEZU: Okay.
Now, how will you show yourself?

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:07.873
-(leaves rustling)
-(hissing)

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.793
Huh? A snake.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:11.919
(knife pierces flesh)

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:21.762
You're outta your mind.
You just expect us to die for you?

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:23.389
We're not your pawns, you know!

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:24.807
(gasps)

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.350
(approaching footsteps)

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:30.563
Shinpei loves this island, all right?
And he loves all of you!

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:34.608
He might not be good with words,
but Shinpei is on your side.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.529
What's wrong with taking the side
of the people you love?

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:40.281
MIO: I'll fight.

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:41.741
Wait, what, Mio?

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.701
-Me too, Shinpei.
-Uh...

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.872
I'm always on your side, my friend.
That'll never change.

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.665
-TOKIKO: Do you know the facts?
-Huh?

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:51.709
The numbers?

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:55.379
Do you know how many shadows
there are on this island?

00:20:55.463 --> 00:21:00.009
We don't have any chance of winning.
Especially not if Heine can loop back now.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:03.596
Shinpei is leading us off a cliff.
He's trying to get us killed.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:04.638
SOU: Tokiko!

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:06.766
Yeah, that's right! You tell him!

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:12.938
But the... truth is,
I've already died once before.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.857
-My life is yours now.
-Oh...

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:17.568
Huh?
(whimpering)

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.154
HIZURU: Unless we kill them,
there's no path forward.

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.909
God, oh, goddamn it.
Why, God, why? Oh, no!

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:27.995
All right, fine! Let's do it, then!

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.831
I'm a man of action, goddamn it!

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.877
SHINPEI: Thank you, everyone.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.962
(emotional music)

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:41.383
(silence)

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:42.843
(clanks)

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:47.723
SHINPEI: <i>Huh? I'm home again.</i>

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:52.478
<i>Am I back? I looped.</i>

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:56.065
<i>I died? But...</i>

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:57.733
<i>When?</i>

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.196
(closing theme music)
