00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:05.005
SHINPEI: <i>I finally found her.</i>

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:11.803
<i>What did she do at the summer festival?</i>
<i>No, what is she going to do?</i>

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.765
<i>If I can find out, I can stop her.</i>

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:20.812
Let me explain, Hiruko copied Heine
and now she appears in her form.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.650
And now, she prefers
to be called by that name.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.278
TOKIKO: She's the goddess of Hitogashima.

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:31.865
Hiruko-no-Mikoto, mother of shadows.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.327
You're telling me
this little kid is a goddess?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.788
TOKIKO: Lately, her legs have gone weak,

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.831
because she's undernourished,

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.209
so she needed another body right away.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.128
-(gasps)
-(static)

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:50.968
How many times
have you and I met like this...

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.680
Shinpei Ajiro?

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.098
(whimpers)

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.391
(gasps)

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.935
SHINPEI: So you didn't die.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.395
You...

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.855
So it was you!

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.066
SHINPEI: <i>You killed Ushio.</i>

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.859
<i>You killed Mio.</i>

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:11.321
<i>You're the monster</i>
<i>who destroyed this place.</i>

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.325
<i>You were the god of this entire island?</i>

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.955
<i>You were always there,</i>
<i>hiding in plain sight.</i>

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:23.959
You were right in front of me!
Weren't you!?

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.170
(grunts)

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.630
Shinpei, get back!

00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:29.881
(Shinpei grunts)

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.969
(theme music)

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.060
-(wailing)
-No, wait, Heine!

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.066
HEINE: His voice was so loud,
it's echoing in my head.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.235
It's driving me absolutely crazy.

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.613
I almost killed you by accident.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.281
(Shinpei grunts)

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:21.159
HEINE: I prefer to have
all my meals in silence.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:24.246
Don't ever speak to me like that again.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:25.872
Tokiko.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.836
SOU: Uh...
(Sou gasps)

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.047
-Ms. Negoro?
-SHINPEI: Huh?

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:37.759
She's a nurse at our clinic.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.472
TOKIKO: Every year on Hitogashima,
roughly four people are killed.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.558
-Illnesses or accidents.
-(gasps)

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.269
That's right, you heard me correctly.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:51.106
And we've been giving
all of those dead bodies to her

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.691
from the very beginning.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.651
-TOKIKO: My father.
-(gasps)

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:59.114
My grandpa, great grandpa,
and his father, it goes back far.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:05.078
What's with the coffins?
Don't tell me you feed people to her!

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:06.163
SOU: Do you?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:08.957
(giggles)

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.711
I've been waiting for this.
A nice big, delicious feast.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.881
SHADOW NEGORO:
Tomorrow will be even bigger.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:20.635
(Heine giggling)

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:21.970
(both gasp)

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.849
TOKIKO: I know I said
you could only kill shadows, not humans.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:32.189
But now I'm fully prepared to die
by your hands, Shinpei.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:37.402
Hold on. What are you...
Tokiko, You can't...

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:40.280
(static)

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.490
(zaps)

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.496
(panting)

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.750
(heartbeat)

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.043
(zaps)

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.586
(gasps)

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.671
(ominous music)

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:03.720
HEINE: Come take a look
for yourself, Ushioh.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.057
You may recognize this,
it's your original body,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.309
I missed out on eating it!

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.604
(gasps)
Oh, no! Ushio!

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.024
SHINPEI: Is it really Ushio in there?

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:19.194
Didn't we just cremate her body?

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.946
We picked up her bones!

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.949
TOKIKO: Dad switched out
the body in the coffin.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.536
Heine copied those bones
from another person.

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.455
But why?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:35.377
Why go that far with it?
Why take care of her like that? Why?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.171
Tokiko, you knew everything?

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:40.215
You knew Shiori was being targeted?

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.425
SHINPEI: You knew that Ushio got killed?

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.554
TOKIKO: I didn't know anything
about Ushio's death.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:50.600
I had no idea that she and her shadow
were working together to save Shiori.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:55.021
She died because she stuck her nose
in other peoples' business.

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.022
(both gasp)

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:57.566
What'd you say?

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.570
TOKIKO: All of this was for Heine.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.991
Shut the hell up!
I can't let you get away with this!

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.826
Where is the old man?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.538
Shut up, you idiot!
You don't know what you're talking about!

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:16.209
The only reason I got stuck with all this,
is because of you, you moron!

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:17.460
(gasps)

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.131
(coughing)

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.091
(breathing heavily)

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.344
TOKIKO: I didn't have a choice, okay?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.762
I really didn't.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:33.351
If I let Heine die,
then our mother will die, too.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.228
-Wait, what?
-(gasps)

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:41.902
TOKIKO: <i>Yes, Mom is alive right now,</i>
<i>but not because she suddenly got better.</i>

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:44.821
<i>Dad kept begging Heine</i>
<i>to turn her into a shadow,</i>

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.948
<i>he wanted to keep her alive!</i>

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:49.326
SOU: Huh?

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.952
What... What...

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.495
What do you...

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.497
I... I don't get it.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.792
Mom is what...

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.337
TOKIKO: Haven't you and Shinpei been

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.841
treating Ushio's shadow
like it's the real Ushio this entire time?

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.801
(both gasp)

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:07.969
Tokiko.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.721
(zaps)

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.391
(static)

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.894
(zaps)

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.774
(slurps)
Mmm!

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:21.900
(Shinpei gasps)

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:26.905
SHINPEI: <i>No. Whatever happens,</i>
<i>I can't let her eat Ushio.</i>

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.240
<i>She'll disappear forever!</i>

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:34.204
<i>Shadows always freeze for at least</i>
<i>a few seconds during a scan.</i>

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.081
<i>It's the same for Heine.</i>

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.250
-(zaps)
-SHINPEI: Ushioh, now!

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.960
Go on, print!

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:41.878
(gasps)

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.963
I was waiting for you to say that!

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.507
Here, take this!

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.549
(rattling)

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.967
(wailing)

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:48.885
(rumbles)

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:50.887
Ushioh!

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.182
(grunts)

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.656
-SHADOW NEGORO: Are you hurt?
-No fair! No fair!

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.701
That was supposed to be
my dinner and they took it!

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.662
Thank you, Ushioh. Are you okay?

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.208
SHINPEI: I think it's almost time.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:21.793
Now, I should...

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.169
-TOKIKO: Do what?
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.132
Why try to fight shadows?
Are you that stupid?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:32.345
They'll kill you, Shinpei.
You'll never win. There's no way.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.308
The Tokiko that I remember
would never willingly do this to us.

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:38.518
(gasps)

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:43.898
USHIOH: It's just using you, Tokiko,
taking advantage of your weakness.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.152
It's deceiving you,
playing with your emotions,

00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.612
while it tries to feed its hunger.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.741
And you're just
gonna sit there and take it?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.909
I won't let you do that!

00:08:55.493 --> 00:09:00.081
I'm not gonna let anyone mess with you,
you're my sister's best friend.

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.458
I don't know if you're a god, Hiruko,

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:05.336
or whatever you are,
don't underestimate humans!

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.297
Ushioh, I...

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.423
I'm so bored.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.969
(groaning)

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.180
-What the...
-(yelling)

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:17.390
SHINPEI: <i>So she doesn't need</i>
<i>to copy humans anymore?</i>

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.808
(static)

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.978
I want to devour all of Ushio's memories.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.481
-(snarls)
-HEINE: Just leave him for dead.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.901
(grunts)
SHINPEI: <i>I think the best option now is</i>

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:32.781
<i>for Ushioh to break my neck,</i>
<i>kill me so that I can loop back.</i>

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.493
<i>That was my plan from the start.</i>

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.371
<i>I need to keep Ushioh out of harm's way.</i>

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.706
<i>No matter what.</i>

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.626
(yelling)

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.713

-SHINPEI: <i>So I...</i>

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:49.839
(rumbles)

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.802
<i>I need to stop Ushioh,</i>
<i>but I can't bring myself to do it.</i>

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:56.513
<i>And I know why.</i>

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.598
-(growling)
-<i>Because Ushioh and I...</i>

00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.599
Gotcha.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:02.477
<i>...feel exactly the same way right now!</i>

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.147
<i>Don't underestimate humans!</i>

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.613
(gasps)

00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.698
(suspenseful music)

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.496
<i>If I'm gonna die anyway,</i>
<i>I'll die fighting.</i>

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.250

(squelching)

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.878
Shin...

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:31.256
FOUR-ARM: You can stop now, Heine.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.716
-That's quite enough.
-(gasps)

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:35.426
(Ushioh gasps)

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.848
(groaning)

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.307
(whimpers)

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.600
(Shinpei groaning)

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:45.270
You just tried to eat Shinpei, didn't you?

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.313
Yeah, but its not fair!

00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.649
I was so hungry and they took my food!

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.276
FOUR-ARM: That doesn't matter.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.111
Whoa!
(whining)

00:10:53.903 --> 00:10:55.238
SHINPEI: Wait, but...

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.365
Why her?

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.075
(Four-Arm snickers)

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.119
FOUR-ARM: Don't you worry, Heine.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:06.457
I know they took your meal,
but I'll get Ushio Kofune's body back.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.086
Look here, you can't eat this one.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.380
She's a very important captive.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:13.339
BOTH: Mio!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:17.302
Uh...

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.720
Shut up.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.513
I already knew that, okay?

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.474
(panting)

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.810
FOUR-ARM: No need to worry.

00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.812
Mio is very much alive.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:31.524
However, if you take even one more step,

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.987
I'll have to crush
her delicate little head like a melon.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.198
TOKIKO: Hey. What is this?

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:40.867
You told me you wouldn't touch Mio!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.160
You lied to me!

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.704
FOUR-ARM: Don't get so upset, Tokiko.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.874
Remember, everyone
will die tomorrow, anyway.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:50.168
What are you talking about?

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.130
Tomorrow, the last meal
at the summer festival

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:58.843
is going to heal Heine's body,
and then Mom'll finally come back.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.347
TOKIKO: Everything'll go back to normal,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.474
just how Dad thought it would happen.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.227
(Tokiko sobs)
Tell me I'm right!

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.980
FOUR-ARM: We certainly appreciate
the Hishigatas' support.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.107
However, that will end soon.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.694
You betrayed us.
(sobs)

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.780
-What're you gonna do to us?
-Tokiko!

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:20.198
(gunshot)

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.701
Wow.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:24.994
(gasps)

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.082
No, my... brother.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:33.378
Your father is well aware
of all of this, believe me.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:35.588
(Tokiko exhales sharply)

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.048
(gunshot)

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.427
(Hizuru breathing sharply)

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.432
(groaning)

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:51.062
<i>No, I... I... can't stay conscious.</i>

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.605
(groans)

00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.108
<i>Sis, I...</i>
(groans)

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:57.777
(gasps)

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.947
Hey, are you okay, miss?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.490
Oh, you're all bloody.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.200
HIZURU: <i>Totsumura.</i>

00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:05.994
Thank goodness.

00:13:06.077 --> 00:13:08.204
He's... human.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.541
<i>I'm not... gonna make it.</i>

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.336
<i>Sorry. Sorry, Sis.</i>

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.007
(groaning)

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:22.802
Ryunosuke.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.429
Hey, I know you!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.473
You're the lady from Ushio's funeral,
with the H cups.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.309
G cups, dumbass!

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.311
(breaths heavily, groans)

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:32.979
Where's Mio Kofune?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.398
(gasping)
I know she was with you.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.319
A... monster took her, I swear.

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:42.780
TETSU: These monster babies,
came outta nowhere.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.074
Hold on, where is your gun?

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.909
TETSU: I lost it somewhere.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.120
-(grunts in pain)
-I took it out and...

00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.621
and then I shot at them.

00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.417
(sighs)
I fell, then I ran.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.129
I don't remember
what happened after that, okay?

00:13:58.212 --> 00:13:59.505
(panting)

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.299
Running was the right decision.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.425
Huh?

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.344
Look, I need your help, all right?

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.930
I don't think I can walk at all.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.267
I just need you to...
I need you to carry me.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.728
Ah... Of course!
I'll take you to a hospital!

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:14.896
No, not there.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.983
You're going to take me
to the deepest part of this cave.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.486
(gunshot)

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:25.656
SHINPEI: <i>It can't be.</i>

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.575
<i>This can't...</i>

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:30.536
<i>this can't really be happening.</i>

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.540
Ushioh. Get over here right now.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.293
And do it slowly, please.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:41.255
I'll never... forgive you!

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.425
That's of no concern to us.

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.427
Do you want Mio to die?

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.345
(squeaks)

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.138
FOUR-ARM: Come here.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:50.223
(grunts)

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.602
SHINPEI: Stop... Stop, don't.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.938
Don't you dare touch her!

00:14:57.063 --> 00:15:01.150
If you want to eat humans,
then why don't you eat me?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.361
(squishing)

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.240
Well, there's no point dying in style.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.658
We never saw eye to eye.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.786
-(squishes)
-(gasps)

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:13.788
(gasps)

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.289
(groaning)

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:19.502
HEINE: Huh, looks like
you're not such a dud, after all.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:23.339
You certainly wouldn't
have beaten Negoro if you were.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:26.300
-You're not broken or defective at all.
-(Ushioh sobs)

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:28.302
HEINE: If anything,
I'd say you've evolved.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.179
(Ushioh whimpers)

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.849
HEINE: It'd be such a huge waste
to erase you.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.560
Instead, I'll fix your brain,
so I can use you.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.604
I'm going to need a lot of help tomorrow.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:42.066
(grunting)
No...

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.109
Shinpei!

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.653
-Please don't do this!
-Hm?

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:49.490
HEINE: I guess I'll never be able
to erase his power.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.701
Ever wonder which came first?

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.786
-(panting)
-The chicken or the egg?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.706
What difference does it make?
It's all a loop.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:58.666
No fair!

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:04.130
Your right eye has a unique power,
it can pull back and observe the flow

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.299
of time from a higher dimension.

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:09.719
FOUR-ARM: <i>It watches and presides</i>
<i>over multiple parallel worlds.</i>

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.929
(grunts)

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.307
Do you know what this means?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.851
You can take
these alternate worlds you observe

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.978
and you can make them real.

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:24.275
Don't you understand that you're
rendering this world as we speak?

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:26.986
You truly have the power
of a god, Shinpei.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:30.531
Shame that you don't have the skill
to use it as you should.

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:31.449
(grunts)

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.035
FOUR-ARM: <i>You can't activate</i>
<i>this extraordinary ability</i>

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.496
<i>unless you die and lose self-awareness.</i>

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.665
Do you know what that means?

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.628
It means all we have to do
is find a way to keep you alive.

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.880
It really couldn't be simpler.

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:47.256
(squishes)

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.342
(gasps)

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.594
(whimpers)

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.262
(body thuds)

00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:57.308
SHADOW: Shinpei, all we have to do now
is keep you here,

00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:00.269
-suffocating in your own despair...
-(panting)

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.521
...until tomorrow ends.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.816
(quivering breath)

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:08.527
Mio...

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:09.779
SHINPEI: <i>It's hopeless.</i>

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:15.701
<i>If I can't loop back,</i>
<i>I can't change anything in the past.</i>

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.744
(sobs)

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.704
<i>I'm breaking my promise again.</i>

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.040
<i>I can't protect anyone.</i>

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.126
SHINPEI: I'm sorry, Mio.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:27.004
I'm sorry, Ushio.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:28.464
(water splashes)

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.424
(panting)

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:32.385
Ahh! Whoa!

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.845
-I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
-Totsumu...

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.478
SHINPEI: <i>Ms. Nagumo!</i>

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.734
HIZURU: <i>That was my last shot!</i>

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:49.860
(Shinpei gasps)

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.788
-(gasps, yelps)
-(body thuds)

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.584
FOUR-ARM: That was close, that was close!

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:08.671
I almost let her kill you, Shinpei,
and we can't have that, can we?

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.006
Totsumura...
(groans)

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.174
Ms. Nagumo...

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.510
FOUR-ARM:
Now that we've dealt with the intruders,

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.387
nothing can get in our way.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.348
SHINPEI: Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.309
What?

00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:22.268
(retches)

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:24.478
MERCURY (II) CHLORIDE

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.689
I got a chance to...
(coughs)

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.482
...drink the whole thing.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.359
Huh? You...

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.445
(sobs)
Shinpei.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.324
All right, guys, listen.

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:37.783
-Hm?
-Huh?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.076
SHINPEI: This is important.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.955
If one of us dies or gets hurt
and it looks like we won't make it,

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:45.249
I'll loop back right away, okay?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.500
-USHIOH: Huh?
-(Sou gasps)

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:49.712
Uh, are you saying
you're going to kill yourself?

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:50.880
How will you...

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.132
SHINPEI: I'll use this, it'll be easy.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.928
SOU: You... brought... the bottle
of mercuric chloride.

00:18:58.012 --> 00:19:00.556
How much of this would be fatal?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.100
SOU: Even a single drop
would do the trick.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:06.395
SHINPEI: Then drinking the whole bottle
will do it for sure.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:09.899
(grunts)
Yeah, but you'll suffer.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.569
SHINPEI: Yeah. Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.363
POISON
MERCURY (II) CHLORIDE

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.907
(retching)

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.408
(coughs)

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.911
Is this poison?

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.163
You must be used to dying.

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:29.585
Don't tell me you've been here
that many times before, Shinpei?

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.962
(retching)

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:33.130
(gasps)

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:36.676
I don't have to come back much
to deal with you.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:41.263
Wow, I didn't think
you'd have the guts for this.

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.557
Listen.
(grunts)

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:48.312
I'll redo this many, many times,
you hear me?

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:51.190
(breathing heavily)

00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:54.151
And in the end, I'll...

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.236
(grunts)

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.445
...I'll defeat you.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.406
(groaning)

00:19:58.489 --> 00:19:59.699
Count on it!

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:01.409
HEINE: Hey!

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:04.203
FOUR-ARM: I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do now.

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.372
I'm sorry about this, Heine.

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:09.667
-Forget about him for a second.
-Hmm?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.836
HEINE: There. Look at her.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.753
(grunts)

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:16.799
HEINE: It looks like she's been repairing
all the damage I did to her.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:24.014
Shinpei is risking his life for us,
I'm not going down without...

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:27.226
a fight!

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:31.981
I... I can't... believe
she's actually hurting me somehow!

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:32.940
(grunts)

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.400
HEINE: No, it can't be.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:35.818
You're the egg, aren't you?

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:37.778
Just kill her!

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:39.321
Don't worry about me!

00:20:39.405 --> 00:20:40.656
(gasps)

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:44.034
(gasps)
She's gone?

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.037
HEINE: That bastard...

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:50.166
That bastard took her with him.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.294
(ominous music)

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:57.089
-Ushioh!
-Shinpei!

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.799
You'll be okay.

00:20:59.467 --> 00:21:00.718
I won't let go!

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.386
I'm sorry, Shinpei.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.471
It's all my fault.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:05.639
Everyone, even Mio...

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:07.475
-No!
-(gasps)

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.311
Don't look back, okay, Ushioh?

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:11.979
Focus on the present.

00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:14.273
-(Ushioh gasps softly)
-SHINPEI: We'll beat them.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:17.860
Even if... Even if it costs me my life.

00:21:19.445 --> 00:21:20.654
USHIOH: I'll go.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.074
As many times as you want me to.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.702
I'll be with you, Shinpei.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:37.004
So in other words, you're a time traveler.

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:38.589
(gasps)

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.676
-SHINPEI: Yes.
-Really?

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.138
(static)

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.348
Mm?

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:48.432
Huh?

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:50.935
Yeah.

00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.022
We just returned from the future.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.986
(closing theme music)
