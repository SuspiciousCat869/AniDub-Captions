WEBVTT

00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:03.128
(theme music)

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:18.560
SUMMER TIME RENDERING

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.015
Are you okay?

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.225
Well, it doesn't hurt at all.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.977
I found you.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.480
Shiori's face changed.

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:47.941
She looked way different
when she grabbed me,

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:48.900
Huh?

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:50.861
SHINPEI: <i>Guess I'm the only one</i>
<i>who saw it.</i>

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:56.116
<i>But I swear, it was definitely the girl</i>
<i>from the festival.</i>

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.661
<i>So what does this mean?</i>

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:05.375
Didn't you lose some of your memories
fighting with Shiori's Shadow,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.669
when you turned into a dark blob?

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:12.883
USHIOH: <i>Yeah, but it didn't have time</i>
<i>to erase me and my memories completely.</i>

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.928
<i>So I restored my body</i>
<i>with the data that was left.</i>

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.390
And then I came back,
so you would know the truth.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.352
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.354
Oh.

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:28.065
SOU: Looks like it started to come down.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:30.609
I told you we'd need umbrellas.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:35.572
Right. Oh, wow. I guess you really did
go back in time, didn't you?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.824
Okay, let's go to the old clinic.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.702
SOU: Wait, you mean in this rain?

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.330
-(umbrella rustles)
-That place is in the mountains.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.499
And it's going to be dark soon, you know.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.958
And the problem is, well...

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:48.877
Ushio was there.

00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.963
We gotta hurry up.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:56.176
You don't have to come with.
Ushio knows the place.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.137
Oh, man, you're a real piece of work.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:00.389
SOU: Hey, dummy.

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.474
Of course, I'm coming with you, Shinpei.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.392
(chuckles)

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.189
It's still raining really hard.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.901
TOKIKO: Well, the festival's tomorrow,
I hope it clears up before then.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.072
Mio, are you going?

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:21.284
MIO: I don't know.
I just have a lot going on right now.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.829
Oh, of course, sorry.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:28.708
Oh, no, it's okay.
Besides, I don't have a <i>yukata,</i> anyway.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:33.588
Don't worry. That's no problem at all.
I have an extra one that you can borrow.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.549
That's really nice, Tokiko.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.718
MIO: But I really don't...

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:45.058
Mio, please, come on,
just go with me tomorrow!

00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.435
Tokiko?

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.019
MIURA: Ahh! This rain!

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.481
I'm soaked to the bone. Oh, my god.

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.943
Oh, hey. Are you girls
from this island by chance?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:55.861
Yeah, we are.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.487
Wait a second, Mio.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.865
TOKIKO: Who's asking, mister?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.784
All right, sorry, sorry.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:05.704
I'm Officer Miura,
with Wakayama North Police.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:09.249
I'm looking for someone.
The name is Kobayakawa.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.464
SOU: Hey, sorry I'm late.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:22.637
Uh...

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.061
You know you look
kind of stupid, don't you?

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.355
SOU: Oh, come on! This is serious!

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.025
What about you?
Huh? I don't see any weapons!

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.818
-Are you gonna defend--
-USHIOH: Oh, it'll be fine.

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:37.736
Huh?

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.822
USHIOH: You got me after all.

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:43.825
SOU: Whoa! Didn't know
you were armed with Ushioh.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:47.162
DANGER: KEEP OUT

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:51.333
So why were you trying
to search the old clinic?

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:55.754
Oh, I actually tried to sneak in
one summer back in the fourth grade.

00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:59.591
SOU: Totsumura and his friends
invited me to go ghost hunting.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:03.220
USHIOH: Oh, god. He's a cop, isn't he?

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.597
How did he not see the "Keep Out" sign?

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.557
You're one to talk.

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:10.519
SOU:
Yeah, but we couldn't even get in, though.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.604
(tense music)

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.109
HISHIGATA: What are you doing here?

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.529
(all whimper)

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.240
SOU: <i>My dad came out of nowhere.</i>

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.784
My family actually owns the land,

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.119
so I didn't think
anything about it back then.

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:32.582
I figured he'd be around
once in a while, but it was so weird.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.086
Why would he even wanna come
to this abandoned clinic?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.006
SHINPEI: Best place to hide a leaf
is in the forest.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:43.593
And if there isn't a forest, you grow one.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.930
Right, but what would someone wanna hide
in such an abandoned clinic?

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.392
Ushioh, any shadows nearby?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.644
USHIOH: Um-um-um...

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.146
SHINPEI: <i>Ushioh's been able</i>
<i>to detect shadows</i>

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.148
<i>ever since she restored her memories.</i>

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:58.859
Anything?

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.819
USHIOH: Well...

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.864
-(static)
-No, not right now.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.826
Come on, seriously, Ushioh,
are just here to mess around or what?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.872
And what are you doing in a swimsuit?
We didn't come here to take a dip!

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.832
Yeah? Well, we're not heading
to a baseball game, either!

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:14.875
SHINPEI: Let's calm down.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:15.876
-Wait.
-And, yes,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.296
this is what I wear when I fight!
Don't you dare underestimate me!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.966
Ugh! She's terrifying!
The real Ushio wasn't like this!

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.134
-(Sou whimpers)
-(Ushioh sighs)

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.802
USHIOH: Go ahead, tell him, Shinpei.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.346
Sou, if Ushioh starts
to wear real clothing,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.724
they'll definitely hold back
her transformation.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:34.936
Even if I was wearing armor or a helmet,
I'd still cast a shadow.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.897
And if that gets hit, I die.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.482
So a swimsuit really is
my best bet for fighting.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.528
USHIOH: <i>I can always transform</i>
<i>into whatever I copied at least once.</i>

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.698
<i>As long as I have the capacity,</i>
<i>I can expand my repertoire.</i>

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.116
Cool, right?

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.660
Yeah, but also kinda distracting.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.620
SHINPEI: Hey.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.457
(approaching footsteps)

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.791
(floor creaking)

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:03.757
SHINPEI: Unbelievable.
It's like it was frozen in time.

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.468
Some of this stuff has historical value.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.638
It was built over 100 years ago
during the Meiji period.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.682
I think it was abandoned
some time back in the '60s.

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:17.145
SHINPEI: <i>Does this place</i>
<i>have anything to do with shadows?</i>

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.399
It looks like the stairs are no good.
Guess we can't check the second floor.

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.653
Think your powers
can get you up there, Ushioh?

00:07:24.736 --> 00:07:26.321
Oh, uh, I...
(stammers)

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:31.076
Aw, is our little Ushioh scared?
Scared of what haunts this place?

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.037
Uh, uh... I...
I shouldn't have told you that.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.958
Ah! Did it!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.001
Whoa, nice.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.005
Huh?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.091
SOU: The shelf's full of drugs.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.054
This is...

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.931
corrosive sublimate.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:54.015
Corrosive what?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:58.520
Mercury chloride, very toxic.
In fact, no one uses it anymore.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.481
SOU: Can't believe this bottle
is just sitting here.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.565
(gasps)

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.404
Old medical records and prescriptions.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.324
SHINPEI: <i>"Appendicitis.</i>
<i>Bronchitis. Pneumonia."</i>

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.828
<i>I don't see anything</i>
<i>about the shadow sickness.</i>

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.454
SOU: Shi... Shinpei?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.039
Huh? What is it?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.374
Take a look.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.961
What is that thing?

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.046
(eerie music)

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.300
Whatever it is, it's creepy.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.220
SHINPEI: Some kind of wooden statue.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:38.059
And a really old one.
Hang on. Looks like it's holding a fish.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.394
A cod?

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:43.398
SOU: Wait a minute, isn't that a symbol
of the god of good luck or something?

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.899
You mean Ebisu?

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:45.859
Oh, yeah, him.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.319
SHINPEI: He's the god of fishermen.

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:51.322
But isn't Ebisu supposed to be
a chubby old man?

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.491
This one looks more like a woman.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:58.788
Weird. I don't remember
there being a female Ebisu. Oh!

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:00.915
What's up?

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.463
Oh, no way.

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.382
SHINPEI: It's Hiruko.

00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:12.385
That's Hiruko? What's it doing here?

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.096
I don't know. It's just a guess.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.348
SHINPEI: <i>But if this is actually Hiruko...</i>

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.810
Wait, what does Hiruko even look like?

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.645
I've never seen a picture.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:27.817
"...deformities, a strange, lumpy body.
Kinda like a leech."

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.863
Seems like kind of a weird body type
for the god of good luck, doesn't it?

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:33.865
(grunts)

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.242
-(wind howling)
-Uh...

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:47.003
A recipe book.
I wonder if a family live upstairs?

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.714
-(dripping)
-(shrieks)

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.343
USHIOH: Huh?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.765
These are old photos
of the Hishigata family.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.558
-SHINPEI: Hey! Ushioh!
-Huh?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.519
USHIOH: Hey, what's up?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.981
Whoa! That's so creepy!

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:08.399
SHINPEI: Look at this.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.359
USHIOH: Huh?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.112
How was the second floor?

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.989
There's a lot of stuffs up there.
I can't go through it in one day.

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:18.451
SHINPEI: Here.
Any chance you can slip into this?

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:22.914
Oh, come on. Do I have to do everything?
You owe me some takoyaki tomorrow.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.166
-SHINPEI: You got it, as much as you want.
-Huh?

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.170
You serious? I'm gonna own you to that!
You got a deal!

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.510
Okay. Anything?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.972
USHIOH: Something's on the floor?
What the heck is this?

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.932
It's too dark to see.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:45.145
Do you think you can flash right now?
You don't have to copy anything.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.688
USHIOH: Oh, yeah, sure.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:51.067
(zaps)

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.279
Oh! There's a keyhole.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.448
USHIOH: I think the wall is a door.

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.992
All right. So come on back.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.327
-(clanks)
-(grunting)

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.496
I guess we can't just break it down.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.582
We're gonna need the key to get in.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.252
Goddamn it. This is really suspicious.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.922
Ugh, all this exploring
is making me hungry.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.674
SOU: What? Is this thing serious?

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.634
-SHINPEI: Here.
-(gasps)

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.636
A rice ball? Is it for me?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.014
-SHINPEI: Yeah, it's dinnertime.
-(chuckles)

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.558
Oh, come on, Shinpei.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.101
(chomps)

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.853
-(Ushioh squeals)
-(Sou grumbles)

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.064
It's good.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:35.445
(Ushioh chuckles)

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.449
Yeah, rice is definitely my favorite food.
Makes me so full.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:40.992
SOU: Oh, my god.

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.952
-I can't believe you ate that much.
-USHIOH: Good stuff.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.370
-(Ushioh sighs)
-(gasps)

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.832
-You said it was a woman, right?
-Huh?

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:52.003
Check this out.
Look at the statue's stomach.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.755
It looks pregnant, doesn't it?

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:55.590
Yeah, I guess it does.

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.218
Maybe Hiruko was supposed to be
a god of fertility?

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:03.139
Hold on. Shadow scans
can penetrate things pretty deep.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.308
USHIOH: <i>That's how we're able</i>
<i>to copy things</i>

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.101
<i>like human bones and organs.</i>

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.854
I see something in its stomach.

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:11.272
(both gasp)

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.608
I'm gonna copy it, okay?

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.568
SHINPEI: <i>Using your hair?</i>

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:17.862
(static)

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.323
What... What is that?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.491
It's the key.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:23.201
-(key clicks)
-(scraping)

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:28.623
SHINPEI: It's a secret door
that leads underground.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:33.503
Be really careful, guys. I have a feeling
there're shadows down there.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.965
My guess is only shadows
can open this door.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:40.426
So why is it here, then? Was it my dad?

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.387
Ushioh.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.557
If I'm with you,
you don't need to be scared. Let's go.

00:12:51.854 --> 00:12:53.356
Hey, don't look up.

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.822
I heard they dug a lot
of underground tunnels

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.865
as a last line of defense during the war.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:07.745
SHINPEI: <i>Since the entrance was closed,</i>
<i>I guess no one's been here in decades.</i>

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:11.374
<i>Is this tunnel only for shadows?</i>

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.377
You sense anything?

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:16.087
USHIOH: Over there.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.047
(eerie music)

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.592
I'm getting a... a bad feeling.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:23.928
All right, guys, listen.

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:29.309
SHINPEI: Ushioh, if things go south,
or we get into trouble,

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.644
just protect yourself and get out.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.939
And, Sou, do everything you can
to save her. Got it?

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:35.857
(gasps)

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.153
Hey, you saw my powers, didn't you?
I'm not the one who needs protection.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.572
Ushioh, if I die today,
I'll just loop back.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.157
But what happens if you die first?

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.993
SHINPEI: Do you think
you're gonna loop back, too?

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.536
Uh...

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:50.079
SHINPEI: <i>Think about it for a minute.</i>

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.167
<i>I might not see you</i>
<i>until the fireworks on the 24th.</i>

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.879
<i>And that's not even</i>
<i>the worst-case scenario.</i>

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.506
USHIOH: What are you talking about?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.884
SHINPEI: <i>If you die first,</i>
<i>I might never see you again.</i>

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.969
The point is,
we can't replace your powers.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.471
We can't afford to lose them.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:10.433
Okay, wait a minute, Shinpei.
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.394
I'm just trying
to be realistic, that's all.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.897
SHINPEI: <i>Besides, I made a promise.</i>

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.899
I have to follow through on that.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.109
-Hm? What promise?
-Huh?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.236
SHINPEI: <i>This time, I'll protect you.</i>

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.073
Shinpei. You don't have to.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:29.535
I don't really get what's going on,
but I swear I'm not going to let you die.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.996
Will you let us protect you, Ushioh?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.208
Hmm... Right, yeah.
I don't care. Whatever.

00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:38.461
(water trickling)

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:41.881
(gasps)

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.760
SHINPEI: <i>A black stain,</i>
<i>shaped like a person.</i>

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:56.270
It's old. Someone was copied
and then erased by a shadow here.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.272
-(mouse squeals)
-(gasps)

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.526
SOU: Oh, it's just a mouse.
That scared me.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.114
-USHIOH: In there.
-SOU: Oh, man.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:09.575
I sense a shadow somewhere over there.
Right where the mouse went.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.702
You think it's us?

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.038
I don't know.
I'll go check, just wait here.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.959
-Hey, I told you. I'll go.
-Huh?

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.627
Be careful.

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.801
SHINPEI: <i>It takes three shots.</i>
<i>Three shots is all I need.</i>

00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:28.553
<i>That'll paralyze it.</i>

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.306
-(zaps)
-(gasps)

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.810
(squeaking)

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:39.021
(panting)

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:40.898
SOU: You see it?

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.401
SHINPEI: Yeah, right over there.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.862
It looks like it's eating it.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.532
Hey, Ushioh, so if you can sense shadows
wherever you are,

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.118
do you think they might be able
to sense you as well?

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:53.327
USHIOH: I'm not really sure.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.957
SHINPEI:
<i>We don't have time to think about it.</i>

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.750
<i>We need to act right now.</i>

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:04.964
We're going to attack first.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.425
SHINPEI: <i>I'll do my best</i>
<i>to paralyze it right away.</i>

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:12.263
<i>Then Ushioh will actually kill it.</i>
<i>Sou will be there as backup.</i>

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:14.557
(suspenseful music)

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:23.608
SHINPEI: <i>Nothing yet.</i>

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.484
(squeaking)

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.404
(panting)

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:36.996
I'm pretty sure it hasn't noticed us yet.
It isn't hiding its shadow at all.

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:40.082
SHINPEI: <i>Perfect.</i>
<i>That means a bigger target.</i>

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.960
<i>Only five or six more steps.</i>

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:43.961
(gasps)

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:46.881
(sniffing)

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:49.842
SHINPEI: <i>Not good. It can smell us.</i>

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.552
(grumbling)

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.306
(yelping)

00:17:01.145 --> 00:17:02.772
SHINPEI: <i>It's just hid in its shadow.</i>

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:11.030
It's just like hitting a fastball
from a home plate!

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:12.198
(Sou grunts)

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.699
(gasps)

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.868
Heck, yeah! Got a clean hit!

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:17.912
(suspenseful music)

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.499
(shadow baby groaning)

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:22.833
Oh, no!

00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:25.503
Stay back, Ushioh!
We can take care of this!

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:29.799
-(Sou grunts)
-SHINPEI: <i>Oh, crap! It's gonna kill Sou!</i>

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.218
-(yells)
-(gasps)

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:37.640
<i>Calm down. Just breathe.</i>
<i>Just breathe. Do it. It's now or never.</i>

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:42.812
(Sou groaning)

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:47.942
Your hands are shaking. Easy.
You'll never be able to hit it like that.

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.737
Relax and stay focused.

00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:55.741
SHINPEI: <i>Just remember,</i>
<i>you've been doing this since...</i>

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.203
since Mom and Dad passed away.

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.165
-SHINPEI: <i>I learned how to...</i>
-(Sou groaning)

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.335
<i>...to step back</i>
<i>and distance myself from it.</i>

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.089
Look.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.592
-(grumbling)
-(groaning)

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.221
(whimpering)

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.937
(yells)
Ushioh!

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:27.857
I got it!

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:31.944
(yelps)

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.783
We... We did it.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.328
SOU: Shinpei! We killed it!

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:41.787
-(Sou snickers)
-Yeah.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.458
BOTH: Nice!

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.377
Sorry for shooting at you.

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:49.670
(chuckles)

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:52.590
No. Don't worry about it,
it turned out okay.

00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:54.050
You were really calm!

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.219
Well, I did get worried
when you missed that first shot.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.681
Well, I knew you'd hit it.
You weren't gonna miss.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.225
I mean, come on,
you were up all night practicing.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.229
SHINPEI: <i>Wait, seriously?</i>
<i>You were awake for that?</i>

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.649
<i>She gotta be kidding me. Oh, god.</i>

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:10.900
(chuckles)

00:19:11.692 --> 00:19:12.526
(Ushioh grunts)

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:16.572
-(static)
-SHINPEI: What's wrong?

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.785
We can't let our guards down yet.

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:23.371
The first shadow I sensed
is still down here.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.081
I don't feel good about this.

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.167
It sounds a harsh engraving,
like nails on a chalkboard.

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:30.628
Can you tell where it's coming from?

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.879
-That way.
-Huh?

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:34.173
USHIOH: I think it's to the left
of that corner.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.801
-SHINPEI: Okay.
-SOU: Wait, Shinpei!

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:39.303
God, look at him.
He just went right in there.

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.846
That's 'cause he's seen it.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:45.059
USHIOH: <i>He's already seen what will happen</i>
<i>if we don't do anything.</i>

00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.687
You want to protect Mio, is that right?

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:51.023
Of course, I do. I'd give my life for her!

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.280
Then there's no time to be scared.

00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:01.492
-(groans)
-So get going, okay?

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:02.952
(gasps)

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.954
USHIOH: <i>It's the wound from Mio's shadow.</i>

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.916
<i>When I got my powers back,</i>
<i>I constructed the arm from Ushio's data.</i>

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.543
<i>Is it fake or something?</i>

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.796
<i>I still haven't recovered</i>
<i>from the damage my body took.</i>

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.257
(groans)
<i>Go away!</i>

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:23.597
Hey, Shinpei.
I've been wondering about something.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.642
Why can't Ushioh just copy the nail gun?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.353
If she pulled it off,
then we'd have two guns.

00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:32.356
We tried that already,
she did copy the gun.

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:34.650
SHINPEI: But it wouldn't shoot.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.986
If the original machine still exist,

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.488
copies of it are like
non-functional replicas.

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.451
SHINPEI: <i>If you want the copy to work,</i>
<i>you have to erase the original first.</i>

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.368
ORIGINAL, COPY (UNUSABLE)

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:45.286
(USABLE)

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.747
So basically, we can't use both.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.459
SHINPEI: If we just needed the shape,
like with the key, it wouldn't matter.

00:20:52.126 --> 00:20:53.669
But if it uses energy at all,

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:55.838
where if it requires some kind
of power source,

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.673
the original has to be erased.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:20:59.633
Okay, how about that nail gun?

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:04.680
This? This one right here is a copy.
They can be really super useful, actually.

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:06.557
SHINPEI: <i>And Ushioh was a big help.</i>

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.476
<i>She can restore the nails or canisters.</i>

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:10.936
<i>All she has to do</i>
<i>was reprint the original data.</i>

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.438
(gunshot)

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:14.982
What was that?

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.358
A gunshot.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:17.359
SOU: Shinpei.

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.280
(gasps)

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:23.365
(tense music)

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:27.244
This place feels way different,
doesn't it?

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.704
It's a natural cave.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:32.166
SHINPEI: <i>Why do I smell salt water?</i>
<i>Is the ocean nearby?</i>

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:35.711
Huh? What the... Are they...
There's no way.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:36.629
Huh?

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.089
I'm sensing shadows all over the place.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.550
We're surrounded! Come on!

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.052
(tense music)

00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:46.472
(shadow babies cooing)

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.557
SHINPEI: How many are there?

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.355
Run, Ushioh!

00:21:54.438 --> 00:21:56.357
Run!

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.444
(closing theme music)
