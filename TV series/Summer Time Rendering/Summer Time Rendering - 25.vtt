WEBVTT

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:05.255
Ushio!

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:13.805
(gasps)

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.314
(gasps)

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:24.650
What?

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.320
Ms. Nagumo?

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:29.238
Huh?

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.032
You're alive.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.743
What?

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:40.374
Young man, I don't believe
we have met before.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.252
MAN (over PA): <i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>We'll arrive in Hitogashima shortly.</i>

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:47.714
Hold on, Hizuru,
you're actually Ryunosuke Nagumo, right?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.092
-Aren't you?
-(gasps)

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.389
HIZURU: How... How do you know who I am?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.519
SHINPEI: <i>Hitogashima lies</i>
<i>in the Kitan Strait in Wakayama City,</i>

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:01.687
<i>Wakayama Prefecture.</i>

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.315
<i>You can see Awajishima behind it.</i>

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.318
<i>It's about two square miles.</i>

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:10.612
<i>With a population of around 700.</i>

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:15.075
<i>And it's known for its Yomogimochi</i>
<i>and Salted Squid.</i>

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.912
<i>It's a small island</i>
<i>supported by tourism and fishing.</i>

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:26.044
<i>It's been two years</i>
<i>since I returned to my hometown.</i>

00:01:28.297 --> 00:01:29.131
<i>What?</i>

00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.721
<i>This view, I've seen it before,</i>

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:39.141
<i>but of course, I have,</i>
<i>this is my hometown.</i>

00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.852
<i>More recently, though...</i>

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:43.437
(gasps)

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.899
-(Hizuru grunts)
-Uh...

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.155
SHINPEI: <i>How did I know</i>
<i>she's Ryunosuke Nagumo?</i>

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.032
(chains rattling)

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.742
-(gasps)
-MIO: Hey!

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.535
Welcome home, Shin-chan!

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.288
Hope you had a nice trip!
(chuckles)

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:02.247
SHINPEI: <i>Mio.</i>

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.168
Watch out, Mio!

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:09.546
(brakes squeal)

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.466
What are you doing, Shin-chan?

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.094
It's just... What am I doing?

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:17.846
-SOU: Shinpei!
-Huh?

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.599
Come get a hug!
(laughs)

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.644
-Ah, you finally came back.
-(gasps)

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:25.312
It's been a long two years.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.397
Your hair got so long.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.025
-Are you taller, too?
-SHINPEI: <i>Thank goodness, everyone's safe.</i>

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.402
-SOU: Oh, you're a real Tokyo boy now...
-SHINPEI: <i>Wait.</i>

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:33.862
...aren't you, Shinpei? Ooh.

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.490
SHINPEI: <i>Why am I so happy about that?</i>

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:42.537
Hey, Sou. Any idea why I came back home?

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:46.041
Wow, that hurts!
It's like you're not excited to see us!

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.086
Are you serious?
What do you mean, Shinpei?

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:54.383
Just... For some reason, I feel like
I was really worried about you guys.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:58.553
He's almost a different person.
His hair. He grew it so long.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.347
It makes him look older.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.683
Uh, you think so?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.809
(clears throat)

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.814
Ushio reached out to you, right?
You said so on the phone yesterday.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.732
SOU: She was gonna beat
the crap out of you

00:03:10.816 --> 00:03:12.442
if you didn't come back this year.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.576
Sis said she'd punch you when she saw you.
(Mio chuckles)

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.246
-TOKIKO: She'd actually do that.
-(Mio giggles)

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.289
SOU: Come on. Shinpei did come back.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.958
-USHIO: Ah!
-ALL: Huh?

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.167
(Shinpei gasps)

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.128
There you are!

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.587
Ushio!

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:34.798
ALL: She hit him!

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.925
(grunting)

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.010
ALL: Wait, she didn't.

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.137
Hm!

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.598
So, Shinpei, you're back now?

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:47.811
Back? Why are you surprised?
You asked me to return in your voicemail.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.688
(grunting)

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.774
Don't act like
you're doing us a favor! What?

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:55.819
USHIO: You thought we'd still be here
after ignoring us for years.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:56.778
Whoa!

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.405
She's so mad.

00:03:58.864 --> 00:04:02.576
She's just frustrated,
because the beach won't stay clean.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.870
-MIO: We just cleaned it up the other day.
-YAMATO: Who was that?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.997
-Is that really Shinpei?
-MIO: But someone left trash there.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.331
USHIO: Nope, a stranger.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.459
Mio, go back to the restaurant!

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.626
MIO: Okay!

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.672
(ship horn honking)

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.763
Oh, what are you doing here?
Don't you have to go home first?

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:23.847
SHINPEI: Uh...

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.934
SHINPEI: No. No one's home today.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.686
(bell chimes)

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.024
Oh, hey, Shinpei. You're back.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:35.609
I am.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:40.322
Yo! You look kinda manlier now.
Is that the Tokyo effect?

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.573
Come on.
(laughs)

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.326
Hey, Shinpei!
Are you back for the festival?

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.161
Yeah. I, uh...

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:49.372
Ushio, right? She said she called you.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.335
SHIOMI: Oh! Did you make up with Ushio?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.295
Well, not exactly.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.255
They met at the port earlier.

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:58.548
SHIOMI: And?

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.508
(chuckles)

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.550
SHIOMI: Oh, no!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:09.267
You two've been at war
ever since you went to Tokyo, haven't you?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:10.685
Yeah.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:18.735
USHIO: <i>Uh, I'm hoping</i>
<i>this is Ajiro's number.</i>

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.406
<i>It's not that I want to see you</i>
<i>or anything,</i>

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.660
<i>but you should at least come back</i>
<i>during summer break.</i>

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.331
<i>If you ignore this message,</i>
<i>I'm gonna go to Tokyo myself,</i>

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.708
<i>and drag you back by the neck.</i>

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.919
<i>Anyway, later, Ajiro.</i>

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:36.837
(phone clanks)

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.340
SHINPEI: <i>She got my attention</i>
<i>when she called me Ajiro.</i>

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.134
<i>When I thought about why she called,</i>

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.138
<i>I remembered this strange dream</i>
<i>from the night before.</i>

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:50.392
<i>I don't remember what it was about,</i>

00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.061
<i>but I remember hearing someone's voice,</i>

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.439
<i>I was scared that this island</i>
<i>would disappear.</i>

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.900
(cicadas chirping)

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:03.613
<i>I guess I came back</i>
<i>to make sure that everyone was safe.</i>

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.536
HAMAJI: Wow, that's cold!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.288
TOUDAI: Well, yeah. It's ice cream.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.998
-HAMAJI: Which one should I get?
-AKARI: I wanna see, too.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.625
-Just pick! They're gonna melt!
-Oh, hello, this one is mine, guys.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.419
-Let me see!
-Would you hurry up and pick one already?

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.921
-I'll take the green tea ice cream!
-I said close it!

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:20.839
-Me too!
-Close it!

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.883
-I want one!
-Oh, roasted green tea flavor!

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:23.925
SHINPEI: Hi.

00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.677
-Welcome!
-(kids gasp)

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.178
-Oh, Shinpei!
-Shinpei!

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:30.140
Been a while. You all got so big.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.309
AKARI: Are you really Shinpei?

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:33.393
Huh? I, uh...

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.645
HAMAJI: Wow! You really came back!

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.148
Oh, it's just like Ushio said!

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.608
Ushio?

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.109
GREEN TEA ICE CREAM

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.153
SHIORI: She's been talking
about it all morning.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.614
She said you were coming back,
'cause she called you.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.157
Like, five times!

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.491
(slurping)

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.243
Why five times?

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:54.205
Don't you get it?
She just really wants to see him.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:58.001
It's so cool that you actually came back!

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.753
So cool, Shinpei!

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.921
It's not that I'm cool.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.468
Well, I mean, didn't she call me Ajiro?

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:07.886
Ajiro?
(laughs)

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:08.845
So weird!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.473
-She was like, "Shinpei, Shinpei..."
-HAMAJI: She likes you way too much!

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.976
-AKARI: You're like a married couple!
-(kids chuckle)

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.394
-TOUDAI: Get the green one. It's yummy.
-HAMAJI: Shiori! One more!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.229
-AKARI: Give me one, too!
-SHIORI: Go grab it yourself.

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:19.648
HAMAJI: You don't want one?

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.149
SHIORI: They're melted!

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:22.859
61ST HITO SUMMER FESTIVAL

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:24.819
(gentle music)

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.530
SHINPEI: Fireworks?

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:32.535
But, look, the festival is on the same day
as Heine's birthday!

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:35.497
Plus, Ushio's birthday is the day after.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.958
HAMAJI: Right! Lots of celebrations!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.669
-SHINPEI: <i>I feel so...</i>
-I wanna eat cake.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.879
-It's not your birthday, dummy!
<i>-...relieved.</i>

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:43.797
GRADE 3-1 SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.049
-SHINPEI: Well, I'm off.
-SHIORI: Already?

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.135
SHINPEI: It has been a while,
so I thought I'd have a look around.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.012
-SHIORI: Huh? You're like a tourist.
-(Shinpei laughs)

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.349
-SHINPEI: Tourist!
-SHIORI: Tourist!

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.393
(gentle music)

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.817
(wind gusting)

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.152
Hito Shrine.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.823
(birds chirping)

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.208
(clanking)

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.215
-IWAO: Shinpei?
-Uh...

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.302
Shinpei Ajiro.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.304
Ka... Karikiri!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.932
IWAO: It really is Shinpei.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.101
Long time no see, Iwao.

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:39.561
IWAO: How long has it been?

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:40.478
Two years.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:45.150
It's been a while. This is my son.
Do you remember him?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.485
I saw you at the port earlier.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:48.987
Yamato, right?

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.113
That's right!

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.115
Impressive, Shinpei.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.328
He came back from the mainland last year,
so I'll let him do the ceremony this year.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.456
He's the next generation.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.915
IWAO: Exactly.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.460
SHINPEI: It's already
that time of year again.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:10.216
Yes, it really is, it's great to celebrate
another year with no problems.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:17.182
By the way, Ushio did lose her necklace
while cleaning the beach.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.808
IWAO: Oh, no.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:22.729
It seemed important,
she's been searching for two days.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.522
YAMATO: She can't find it.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.690
Poor thing.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.234
(wind gusting)

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.077
Are you all right, Shinpei?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.620
Would you excuse me?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.121
Of course.

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.207
(soft music)

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.755
SHINPEI: <i>I can hear the ocean,</i>
<i>no matter where I am on the island.</i>

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:55.011
<i>I felt like that sound</i>
<i>would lead me to her.</i>

00:09:55.095 --> 00:10:00.225
(waves crashing)

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.567
(soft music)

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.193
(gasps)
Shin...

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:55.780
Ajiro! We keep running
into each other today.

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:03.204
You called me "Shinpei" earlier
when you saw me at the port, remember?

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.916
Huh? Seriously? Ugh! No way.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.711
USHIO: Are you sure
you heard me right? Dummy.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.172
SHINPEI: I'm sorry.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.550
I left for Tokyo without saying goodbye.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.969
I feel really bad about that.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.682
USHIO: I'm glad.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.144
I'm just glad you're safe.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.063
(gasps)
SHINPEI: Ushio.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.650
USHIO: You know what? I had a weird dream.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.738
Two nights ago...
(sniffles)

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.449
...I dreamed that I'd never see you again.

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:40.950
(gasps)

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:46.915
I guess it was my punishment
for not seeing you off,

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:52.754
but I... I didn't want for us
to end up separated like this.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:56.007
I couldn't stop myself from calling you.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.967
(sobs)
Sorry.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.304
No, I... Actually...

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.056
-USHIO: Gotcha!
-Oh?

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.019
You can't move now.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:14.525
SHINPEI: <i>I feel like I saw the same dream.</i>

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:17.612
(Shinpei laughs)

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.155
Now we're even!

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:20.698
Huh? Whoa!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.868
You... You got me!

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.954
(chuckles)

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:26.871
Huh?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:31.459
Huh?

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.132
Oh!

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.551
What is it?

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:45.306
Uh, is this... I think it's your...

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.183
USHIO: Oh!

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.812
Wow! There it is!

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.818
I'm so happy!

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.782
I lost it at the beach cleanup
two days ago.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:04.450
I looked everywhere.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.370
I thought I couldn't face you
if I lost it.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.622
(sighs)

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.583
I got so worried, 'cause of that dream.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.836
But it's okay.

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.297
I was sad and lonely.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:19.299
But I'm happy now.

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:29.100
(romantic music)

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.402
USHIO: Shinpei. Your hair is so long.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:42.447
SHINPEI: Yeah.

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.490
USHIO: It looks weird.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.122
(cicadas chirping)

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.958
61ST HITO SUMMER FESTIVAL

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:06.304
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.307
SHINPEI: Thank you.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.641
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO
FESTIVAL PARALLAX

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.602
Wow.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:15.897
Mm.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.818
We saw the same dream
on the same day separately,

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.530
and you found out who I was in that dream.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.785
Well, I'm pretty sure that's case. Yeah.

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:34.248
SHINPEI: But neither Ushio nor I
remember the details of the dream.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:37.794
HIZURU: Foresight? No, memory.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:42.548
Is it some sort of local memory shared
by the people on this island?

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:46.969
Hm... Feeling of repeating.
Parallel worlds.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:50.181
Sort of memories of parallel worlds.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:54.102
SHINPEI: Oh, there was a book I remembered
after that dream.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:57.146
I just saw it online,
but haven't read it yet.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:05.404
<i>The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin</i>
by Ouspensky. Right?

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.989
SHINPEI: Yeah! That's it!

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.283
Hello.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.576
(kids giggling)

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.495
Is Heine's birthday party over?

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.498
Yes! I am so full.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.917
-Hello, Alain.
-Hey, Ryunosuke.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.127
-(door closes)
-Oh?

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.462
(inaudible chatter)

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:24.632
Do Hizuru and Shinpei know each another?

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:28.219
Yeah. Seems like they met on the ferry.

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.221
Oh. Thanks.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.431
HEINE: Ah! Hizuru!

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.766
(both gasp)

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.727
Thanks for the birthday present!

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:37.728
Sure, Heine.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.523
HIZURU: Did everyone come to your party?

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:44.485
Yeah! Tomorrow is Ushio's birthday, too.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.195
Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.407
-RYUNOSUKE: Heine, don't interrupt them.
-Uh?

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.868
Hey, sorry, Shinpei.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.035
It's okay.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:58.166
Heine was just thanking me for the gift.
Really, she wasn't interrupting us at all.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.167
Oh yeah?

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:04.422
Mm-hm. Excuse me.
Dad, you shouldn't interrupt them, either.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:05.715
Oh.
(Ryunosuke chuckles)

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:08.593
(soft music)

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.972
HIZURU: Does something interest you
about my niece?

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.684
SHINPEI: No. Actually, yes.

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.227
(both laughing)

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.896
SHINPEI: I'm just glad.

00:16:22.773 --> 00:16:24.108
It's odd, isn't it?

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:26.360
I wonder why I feel that way?

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:31.449
Why dost thou pass away
and leave our state?

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:36.996
Dim vast vale of tears,
vacant and desolate?

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:38.080
Uh...

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.790
SHINPEI: Uh, that's...

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.709
Recognize it?

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.502
SHINPEI: No, sorry.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.715
Sis. Don't pick on Shinpei too much.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:53.679
He's a huge Ryunosuke Nagumo fan.
No wonder he found you, huh?

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:57.808
I am a masked author.
I've never revealed my identity.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:01.395
I told you,
don't bother me with that, dummy.

00:17:01.479 --> 00:17:02.688
Whoa.

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:06.359
HIZURU: You'd better not have told anyone
on the island about me.

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.446
Of course not! Isn't she a tough one?

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.950
She's working on a new book now,
so she's even worse.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:14.992
HIZURU: Uh...

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:19.664
But despite all of that,
she's actually really happy to meet a fan.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:20.957
HIZURU: What are you saying?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.877
Uh, a new book, are you writing it now?

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:26.921
I guess so.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:30.883
SHINPEI: Wow, that's great.
The <i>Hijiri</i> series, or something else?

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:33.094
Ugh! Why would I tell you?

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.011
KISHU SPECIALITY HAYAZUSHI

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:38.808
HIZURU: I'm in Wakayama for research
and rest, but this was unexpected.

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:41.894
Your story is interesting.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.772
I want to hear some more.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.733
(gasps)
Sure!

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.698
MIO: Dad. Sis wants to go soon.

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:56.826
Okay! Everything is ready over here.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.452
(gasps)

00:17:58.536 --> 00:17:59.453
Oh.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.831
Wel... Welcome.

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:03.040
-(gasps)
-Oh!

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.209
What are you standing there for, Mio?

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.294
I'm sorry.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.255
Ah! Hizuru and Shinpei. You're here.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.008
(chuckles)
Come, follow me!

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.884
-ASAKO: Wait.
-KIDS: Okay!

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.344
ASAKO: Before that.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.889
Okay. Get closer together.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.809
-ASAKO: Say "cheese."
-Cheese!

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.019
(camera shutter clicks)

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:23.936
(Shiori chuckles)

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.900
CROWD (chanting):
<i>Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!</i>

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.945
<i>Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!</i>

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:37.283
<i>Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!...</i>

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.372
SHINPEI: <i>Time has overwritten summer.</i>

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:51.339
<i>And with its passing, I'm relieved,</i>
<i>but also pained and lonely.</i>

00:18:51.422 --> 00:18:53.841
(traditional music playing)

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.180
So, Shinpei. Did you make up with Ushio?

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.849
Huh? Ah... Yeah.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.186
What? Cat got your tongue?

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:07.438
We did.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.775
I see. Glad to hear it.

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:12.735
SHINPEI: I mean...

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.445
Hm?

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.406
There was nothing to do.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.909
All the tension between us
just disappeared.

00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:23.204
SHINPEI: It was a little awkward.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:25.915
You know what I mean?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.210
I see. That's fine.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:31.754
No. It's not.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:32.713
SHINPEI: Huh?

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:36.300
I mean, you two are fine, but I'm not yet.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:38.552
You're not?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.889
SOU: Shinpei, lend me your strength.

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:43.891
SHINPEI: Strength?

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:47.812
During the fireworks,
stay on the beach with everyone.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.106
I'll take Mio to the shrine grounds.

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:55.611
SHINPEI: Sou.
You still have feelings for Mio?

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.489
Is that a problem?

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:00.950
-MIO: What are you talking about?
-Huh?

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:02.660
SOU: Uh, um...

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.829
-(both slurping)
-Huh?

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:07.123
You're like two peas in a pod.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.877
-...the best job ever.
-You're exactly right.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:19.427
(laughing)

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:24.390
SHINPEI: Ms. Nagumo.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.684
The fireworks will be starting very soon.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:27.852
(Hizuru chuckles)

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.770
HIZURU: Just wait.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:34.358
The ideas are just flooding in
right now. I can't stop.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.486
Thanks to you, I broke out of my slump!

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.951
(cell phone buzzing)

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.413
-USHIO: <i>It's me.</i>
-SHINPEI: Hey.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:48.497
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:49.582
By the food stands.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.167
SHINPEI: <i>I'm heading to the beach now.</i>

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:52.877
USHIO: Oh? Where's everyone?

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.337
SHINPEI: <i>Sou and Mio are gonna watch</i>
<i>from the shrine grounds.</i>

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:59.300
USHIO: Hmm, he still wants to tell her
how he feels, huh?

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.594
SHINPEI: <i>What? How do you know that?</i>

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.220
USHIO: Sou told me himself.

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:07.475
Huh. He wanted me to be at the beach,
so I wouldn't see.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.437
He said the exact same thing to me.

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:14.064
USHIO: <i>He never gives up.</i>

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.319
<i>Mio rejected him last year, too,</i>
<i>during the festival.</i>

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:19.528
SHINPEI: Seriously?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:20.446
(stomach rumbles)

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.699
USHIO: Hm, I'm so hungry
after carrying the <i>omikoshi.</i>

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.284
<i>Buy me</i> takoyaki.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:28.162
SHINPEI: Sure.
Come to the end of the levees.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.592
What do you like about me, Sou?

00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:44.970
(waves crashing)

00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.143
SHINPEI: Ushio.

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:55.147
Shinpei. You're so late.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:56.440
SHINPEI: Here.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.610
USHIO: Yay! Thank you! Oh, wait.

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.196
Is that all you got?

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.698
What do you mean? How many did you want?

00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:08.077
What? But you promised me
<i>takoyaki</i> last time!

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:11.413
I promised? Did I really do that?

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:17.461
Yeah! Remember? When was it...
Ugh! I almost have it.

00:22:18.087 --> 00:22:22.925
Oh, back then? When we were
in that narrow space at the old clinic?

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:23.884
Oh.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.179
BOTH: "I promise I'll buy you ten
or a hundred of them."

00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:29.390
(fireworks whistling)

00:22:31.392 --> 00:22:34.603
(fireworks popping)

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:44.530
Welcome back.

00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:51.829
I'm finally home.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:05.092
SUMMER TIME RENDERING

00:23:09.513 --> 00:23:11.640
(Mio humming "Happy Birthday to You")

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:21.233
Mmm. I forgot the sugar.

00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:26.864
CROWD: <i>♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪</i>

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.073
(blows air)

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.993
USHIO: Thanks, everyone!

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.620
SHINPEI: Happy birthday, Ushio!

00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:37.166
(overlapping chatter)

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:40.294
(waves crashing)
