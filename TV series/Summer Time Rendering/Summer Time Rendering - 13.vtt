00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:08.217
(static)

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.596
Ushio?

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.097
-Oh, my god! Hizuru!
-Oh.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:18.936
Oh, thank god! Hizuru, you're alive again!

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.062
(gasps)

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.272
Nezu, wait! Let me explain!

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.442
Don't you know
Kofune's daughter died yesterday?

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.945
You're working
with the shadows, aren't you?

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.447
HIZURU: Stop it, Nezu. Take it easy.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.657
-NEZU: Hm?
-(gasps)

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.244
So I died, is that right?

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:38.580
Yes.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.668
HIZURU: I understand.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.796
So whatever world
you observe becomes real.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.423
Four-Arm said that, didn't he?

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:52.970
Yeah, but I have no idea
why I'm able to do that.

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:56.848
Well, if your right eye
really did belong to Heine,

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:01.228
then that eye must be made of shadows.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.688
(gasps)

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.815
HIZURU: Do you don't remember
when it was printed?

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.109
No, I'm not sure.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.280
It was probably after I came back
to the island, though.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:16.034
Hm. All the pieces are finally starting
to fit together.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.454
Ushioh, I'm pretty sure
you gave Shinpei that eye.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:20.622
HIZURU: It was you.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.958
You... You think it was me?

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.626
What are you talking about?

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:29.506
Why do you think you failed again
during the last loop?

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.175
Well, for one, we were totally split up,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.887
and we acted separately
after we beat Mio's shadow.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:39.349
So this time,
all of us need to work together.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.392
NEZU: Hey.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.060
You're right. We're a team.

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.520
Wait, Hizuru.

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.026
(warbling)

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.444
(gasps)

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.121
That... That was...

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.999
Nezu, Ushioh's on our side.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.335
And she was on our side
until the very end.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:09.379
USHIO: <i>Nagu. Can you hear me?</i>

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.340
HIZURU: <i>That explains the message,</i>

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.551
not to mention the situation
with Shinpei's right eye.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.262
-I trust you, Ushioh.
-(gasps)

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:18.680
Ms. Nagumo.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.143
It's human nature to believe
all kinds of fiction, you know?

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.271
Whether it's schemes,
dreams, religion, or stories.

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.815
That's why I decided to be a novelist.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:32.194
Uh, yeah, but you know I'm real, right?

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.279
(chuckles)
HIZURU: I'm aware of that.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.948
SHINPEI: <i>That's the first time</i>
<i>I've seen Ms. Nagumo smile.</i>

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.411
Huh. So you two are risking
your lives just like us?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:46.458
HIZURU: That monster, Four-Arm,
is he trying to bring Heine back to life?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.960
SHINPEI: Well, at the summer festival,

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.380
Four-Arm did feed Heine
a lot of innocent people.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.716
I don't know what happens
after the ceremony.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.052
But he referred to it as "ending."

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.471
NEZU: <i>That huge body</i>
<i>you were talking about,</i>

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.056
<i>it's Hiruko's true form.</i>

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.810
And the shadow at Shiori's feet
is just a part of that.

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:09.314
That's why we couldn't kill her,
no matter how damn hard we tried.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.734
Shiori isn't all that much
of a fighter, though.

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:14.861
She walks, and that's it.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.532
Hiruko is way too weak
to leave her underground lair.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:20.867
SHINPEI: <i>Could this be our way out?</i>

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.460
So what's the plan, then?

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.965
SHINPEI: <i>Well, I wanna go underground</i>
<i>and kill Heine's true form,</i>

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.175
<i>but if we don't beat Four-Arm,</i>

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.886
<i>it'll probably just end up</i>
<i>like the last loop.</i>

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.098
Plus, I'm really worried about Mio.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.310
And then there's Sou.
Gotta come up with a plan for him, too.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:52.816
Maybe we should try to catch Shiori
at Koba Mart like last time.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:53.817
(gasps)

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.737
But you can't kill her.
What's the point of catching her?

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.074
Yeah, but I might be able to erase her.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.619
(theme music)

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.088
What a shame, it just so...

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.758
MIO: Yeah, I feel a lot better
than I did yesterday.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.639
It's 'cause Shinpei's back.
It's so good to see him.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.224
Oh.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.976
-(sobs)
-TOKIKO: Huh.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.523
Oh, what is it you need, Sou?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.402
I need to talk to Dad. It's about Ushio.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.114
DR. HISHIGATA: Get out of here.
I don't have time for that.

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.365
SHADOW CHITOSE: Seido, you...

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:06.825
Don't worry about him, okay?

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.161
Make some time for him, will you? Huh?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.584
DR. HISHIGATA:
Negoro, you take care of it.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:16.877
Mm?

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.256
Dad, wait!

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:27.929
Come to my room at ten o'clock tonight.
I'll give you five minutes.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.723
-(door closes)
-Huh?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.268
Thanks a lot, Mom.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.229
Of course, but what's this about?

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.732
SOU: Uh, nothing much.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.906
That's right. Shinpei Ajiro has decided
to look into the shadow sickness.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.991
What the hell's going on?

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.745
First, it was Ushio Kofune,
now it's Hizuru Minakata.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:55.874
I don't understand why people
are so determined to pry into this.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.043
FOUR-ARM: <i>Well, for what it's worth,</i>

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.379
<i>I don't think it's a coincidence</i>
<i>that Hizuru Minakata is back.</i>

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.883
<i>And my guess is Ushio must have</i>
<i>contacted Shinpei somehow.</i>

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:09.179
DR. HISHIGATA: Do you think it's true
that Ushio's shadow wasn't erased

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.014
and is still out there somewhere?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.851
FOUR-ARM: <i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>We'll find it and we'll erase it.</i>

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.062
<i>We'll just have to get</i>
<i>to her family first.</i>

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.773
DR. HISHIGATA:
Turn the Kofune family into shadows?

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:23.443
FOUR-ARM: <i>Yes, that's the plan,</i>
<i>and that includes Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:27.238
<i>Hm? What is it? I'll be right there.</i>

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.159
<i>Hello? You still there?</i>
<i>My mother needs me right now.</i>

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.244
<i>-I got to go.</i>
-(line beeps)

00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:34.704
(Dr. Hishigata sighs)

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.166
(scoffs)
Mama's boy.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:41.211
<i>We have a report from Kinokawa City.</i>

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.421
<i>It's time to hear</i>
<i>all about the delicious treats</i>

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.340
<i>and offerings that await Wakayama's...</i>

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.591
KOBA MART
YOMOGIMOCHI

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.683
HIZURU: <i>You're up, Ryunosuke.</i>

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.602
Wait, did you say you can erase Shiori?

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:01.606
In the last loop, I swear
I could feel Heine coming right for me,

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.358
and trying really hard
to mess with my head.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.319
So maybe I can reverse that somehow.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.613
Do you really think you can do that?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.450
Not gonna lie, I don't get it,
but it seems like it's worth a try.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:16.746
Oh. I really wanna put
that thing down myself, though.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.582
Last time, Nezu told me something.

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:24.087
SHINPEI: He said that a shadow
killed Ryunosuke 14 years ago,

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:28.216
and that there were ligature marks
on his neck.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.345
That can't be just a coincidence.
Did Heine kill him?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:37.058
That's right. And Heine was actually
a friend of mine.

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.852
-What?
-Your friend?

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.437
(phone buzzing)

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.021
SHINPEI: Oh. It's Mio.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.400
HIZURU: Answer it. We can talk more later.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:48.361
I wanna hear her voice!
Hey, let me answer it!

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.779
-(Ushioh chuckles)
-Knock it off!

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.657
I was just kidding.
(grunts)

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:57.412
SHINPEI: <i>She's alive. This phone vibrating</i>
<i>means Mio has to be alive.</i>

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.039
<i>I'm not going to let Mio die again.</i>

00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.081
SHINPEI: Hello?

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.501
HIZURU: <i>If we repeat</i>
<i>everything we did last time,</i>

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:05.587
<i>we'll end up with the same result.</i>

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.507
<i>Which means,</i>
<i>we'll capture Heine with Plan B.</i>

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:14.179
<i>She took you and Asako from me.</i>
<i>So she's definitely our top priority.</i>

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:19.059
<i>If it wasn't for her, then Ushio Kofune</i>
<i>and the others would still be alive.</i>

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:21.269
Let's end this, Ryunosuke.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:25.231
Roger that. Thanks, Sis.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.366
Are you ready, Nezu?

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.702
I was ready before you were even born.

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.662
USHIOH: I'm good to go, Shinpei.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.998
SHINPEI: <i>Four-Arm protects Heine.</i>

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:46.461
<i>And we're actually going to be able</i>
<i>to erase her. Here and now.</i>

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:50.340
<i>Then we can save everyone</i>
<i>from the end of that festival.</i>

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.383
Hi! Oh, Hizuru!

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:57.347
Hey, did I catch you at dinner...
I mean, excuse me, I had some gifts.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.308
SHADOW ASAKO:
Aw! You really didn't have to do that.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:02.519
Oh, please, come on in.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.978
HIZURU: Thanks a lot.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:17.742
Okay, there's no one around.
You can come out, Ushioh.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.578
-(grunts)
-Whoa.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.332
You're a shape-shifter
and you're handy in a fight.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:25.792
You remind me of <i>Pretty Cure.</i>

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.920
Uh, seriously? I always wanted
to be just like a <i>Pretty Cure</i>

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:32.841
-when I was a tiny little girl!
-SHINPEI: You know about <i>Pretty Cure</i>?

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:34.759
My granddaughter was obsessed with it.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.887
-Wait. I just realized...
-Huh?

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.514
USHIOH: It's gonna blow your mind!

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.313
-(static)
-SHINPEI: Whoa!

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:50.692
Is that the nail gun
that Four-Arm destroyed?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.820
Huh? So that means you can...

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:58.283
bring all the data you were able to scan
from the last loop to the next one.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.284
I know. Isn't it great?

00:10:59.367 --> 00:11:02.871
Yeah, it's great. You're amazing, Ushioh.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:05.373
That's the outfit
you scanned last time, isn't it?

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.709
PARISIENNE

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.212
It's too bad, though.
I wish it wasn't broken like this.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.881
NEZU: It should be fine.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:16.050
Since I have the original right here,
and it works great.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.386
SHINPEI: <i>Nezu brought two different guns.</i>

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:21.848
<i>His own nailgun, gun A,</i>
<i>and my nailgun, gun B.</i>

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.809
<i>Ushioh scans the data from nailgun B.</i>

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:28.021
<i>She overwrites the old data,</i>
<i>then destroys the original.</i>

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:28.938
Oh?

00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.815
SHINPEI: <i>Now I can use nailgun B again.</i>

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.109
<i>We'll hold off on copying nailgun A,</i>

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:36.029
<i>because Ushioh can't store</i>
<i>any more data right now.</i>

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:38.656
Ryunosuke went in five minutes ago.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.493
It's almost time for him to tell us
to switch to Plan B.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:46.706
That's right, then two minutes later,
Shiori will come down

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.041
from that balcony there.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:51.836
SHINPEI: <i>The third shot misses,</i>
<i>and then she'll run,</i>

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:55.256
<i>but I jump out and catch her</i>
<i>by the green flag.</i>

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.133
<i>Then, finally, I'll erase her.</i>

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:58.218
Mm.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.803
But first, we gotta wait for Ryunosuke.

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.388
(glass shattering)

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.602
(thrilling music)

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.692
(groans)

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.153
What the...

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.154
Ugh!

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:22.075
Get out of here. Run away.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.534
-Ms. Nagumo!
-Hey!

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:27.455
This isn't like the last July 22nd.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:36.130
Ah, I see all of you got together.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.384
Hiz... Hizuru!

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:44.889
It... Impossible. It can't be.
Why is he... You shouldn't even be here!

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.519
You just don't know how to play fair,
do you, Shinpei?

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:50.979
What the...

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.231
I told you, remember?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.776
I said, "I found you."

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.778
See that thing on your arm?

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.740
I made that mark, so I can find you
no matter what world you're in.

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:07.370
You get it now? You see,
I've been following you this whole time.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.332
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Didn't our eyes meet</i>
<i>at the end of the summer festival?</i>

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:16.587
-(Shinpei gasps)
-Surprise. I can loop back, too.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.090
SHADOW SHIORI: And, of course,
I knew you would come here

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:22.552
because I read all of Ryunosuke's memories
from the last time.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.014
This isn't happening.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:29.225
The truth is, we don't need two observers.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.852
-FOUR-ARM: It's either Mother...
-(chuckles)

00:13:31.436 --> 00:13:32.854
...or you.

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:40.653
The one who survives controls fate
and they will decide, which world is real!

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.032
Bring it on! Your ass is grass!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.992
NEZU: Three shots... Huh?

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:53.124
The three shots from the nail gun,
they didn't stop him.

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:55.918
No!

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:00.590
FOUR-ARM: Huh?

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.301
USHIOH: <i>If I scan everything,</i>
<i>it'll disappear.</i>

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:04.802
<i>I'll have to settle for one arm!</i>

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.013
-(static)
-(thuds)

00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.725
(scoffs)
Whatever.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:15.063
HEINE: <i>This is just a friendly</i>
<i>little greeting, Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.941
<i>You can loop back</i>
<i>as many times as you like.</i>

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.111
<i>I'll find you every single time,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:26.824
<i>And in the end, that power</i>
<i>will be mine and mine alone.</i>

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.701
SHINPEI: <i>I was careless.</i>

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:32.747
<i>I guess I should have known</i>
<i>the enemy might have the same power I do.</i>

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.373
<i>Heine came from the summer festival.</i>

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.336
<i>And those two lost their lives</i>
<i>because I was careless.</i>

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:39.921
Ushioh! Where are you?

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:41.631
USHIOH: I'm right here!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.094
Sorry. Did your neck hurt?
I tried to make it as quick as possible.

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:50.807
Thank you, Ushioh. I'm doing all right.
That was quick thinking.

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:55.019
What about you, Ushioh?
I was really worried about you back there.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.646
USHIOH: I thought I might be able
to figure out

00:14:56.729 --> 00:15:00.316
who Four-Arm actually was,
but there was nothing.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.609
(gasps)

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:05.321
USHIOH: There was no data to be found.
How does it even move?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.240
I don't know.

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.744
<i>Four-Arm does smell</i>
<i>really similar to Heine.</i>

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.373
SHINPEI: Can we beat an enemy
who can loop back?

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.335
USHIOH: Heine's just probably
taking advantage of the powers you have.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:22.755
That means she'll loop
to the same place as us.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.715
I know we can win this.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.759
We're on a level playing field.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.095
-(Shinpei grunts)
-USHIOH: What?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.721
SHINPEI: Thanks, Ushioh.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.518
(raindrops pattering)

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:42.024
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:43.943
What the...

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:46.821
USHIOH: This is our house. That's weird.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:51.284
Even if our starting point changed,
when were we ever here?

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.244
Uh, wait a sec.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.957
This doesn't make any sense.
July 22nd was a sunny day.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.336
RYUNOSUKE: Hey, hold on.
Hey, just hold on a minute. Wait up, Sis.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.969
(gasps)
I think that's...

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.892
Wait, no way. Ms. Nagumo?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:20.521
USHIOH: No point thinking about it.
Shinpei! Come on, let's follow them!

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:21.606
Yeah.

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:26.360
Huh? Whoa!

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.155
Uh... We're inside now.

00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.116
RYUNOSUKE:
Oh, man. Looks super busy today.

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:36.871
Oh, Hizuru, hi there. Hi, Ryunosuke.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:42.335
So these two really are Ms. Hizuru
and her twin brother Ryunosuke.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:44.253
USHIOH: What's going on?

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:47.840
SHINPEI: <i>When I died the first time,</i>
<i>something similar happened.</i>

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:50.176
-AKEMI: Hi, welcome. Table for two?
-Uh...

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.263
Ah. Why are you wearing
an apron today, huh, Akemi?

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:58.309
Because it's Bistro Kofune's
tenth anniversary today,

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.978
so the whole island came in here
to eat this morning.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:03.981
RYUNOSUKE: Oh, is that right?
Well, congratulations!

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.609
Thanks a lot!
So, yeah, thought I'd help out.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.486
Mm, it's Mom?

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.863
USHIOH: Oh, wow, it really is Akemi.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.741
That means this must be the past.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.202
SHINPEI: Fourteen years ago.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:21.749
When I died the first time, I was with Mio
and the same thing happened.

00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:24.752
I was transported to the beach,
the one where you died.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.171
It was the past, and I saw everything.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.382
That must've been Mio's memory.

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:31.634
Then, do you think
this is Ms. Nagumo's memory?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.844
Dessert's on the house today!

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:35.388
(chuckles)
Awesome!

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.307
I don't like crowds,
I think I'm gonna go home.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.142
-Uh...
-Hey, just wait a second!

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:44.647
-Asako. You're here.
-It's a special day for Bistro Kofune.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:46.816
We should celebrate together!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.236
I don't see the point
in making some huge fuss over it.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.863
Are you really going to go home, though?

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.199
How can you be
so cold and heartless, Hizuru?

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:58.286
Well, I am human, so I do have a heart,
but I wanna leave right now, okay?

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:02.164
SHINPEI: <i>It's pretty amazing,</i>
<i>Ms. Nagumo really hasn't changed a bit.</i>

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.332
AKEMI: Sure thing.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.460
-Uh...
-Ugh!

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:10.423
Happy tenth anniversary, Bistro Kofune!

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:11.882
You should just leave.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:15.553
Oh, look. Hizuru.
You look so darn happy to see me.

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:16.762
I'm flattered.

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:20.391
Ah, Toru and Masahito, thanks so much.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.476
KARIKIRI: Wow.
Those ten years just flew by.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.649
Alain, your food is always fantastic.
Here's to ten more, don't change a thing.

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.985
Hey, you looked in a mirror recently?

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.321
You haven't shaved, your hair's a mess.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.573
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:36.657
(laughter)

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:40.036
USHIOH: Wow, your dad came, too.
This must've been quite a day.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.998
SHINPEI: <i>Yeah, it's amazing.</i>
<i>They're moving.</i>

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.918
<i>Their voices. Gestures.</i>
<i>That's how they were.</i>

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:51.380
USHIOH: What did your parents do
for a living, Shinpei?

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:55.217
SHINPEI: They were marine archeologists.
They worked underwater.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.013
So, Masahito, are you really
officially a priest now?

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:02.558
Yeah. I have plenty to learn,
but I'm doing my best.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:04.977
How about you, Toru? What's new?

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:09.315
I'm thinking about diving down
to that place I mentioned before.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.777
Hitogashima just has
so much unique history.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.820
I'm so glad I decided to move here.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.530
Food's not half bad, either.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:19.659
(laughter)

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:20.701
Hmm...

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.996
Hey, Ryu, what's up?
Why's Hizuru so grumpy?

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.999
Well, truth is, it's actually my fault.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:30.336
(Hizuru sighs)
I knew I never should have told you.

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:31.379
ASAKO: Huh? What is it?

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:36.592
Well, she... she says she made
a new friend recently.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:37.927
What!?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.263
That's what I said!
So then I told her she was just dreaming.

00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:45.226
And I said it must've been
an imaginary friend, and she got all mad.

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.061
Ryu, come on, that's so mean!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.188
-But I don't believe it, either.
-Hey.

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.233
Kidding, kidding.
Sorry, Hizuru, I believe you, I swear.

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:55.653
You're joking?
I don't need some clown to believe me.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:58.698
RYUNOSUKE: Hey, come on,
she didn't mean it like that, Hizuru.

00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:00.074
ASAKO: Forget it, it's fine, Ryu.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.284
Tell me about your friend.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:05.413
We don't even have 20 kids
in our whole school, though.

00:20:05.496 --> 00:20:07.415
Where did you meet someone new?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.334
-Mt. Takanosu.
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:14.255
SHINPEI: The setting, it changed again.

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:16.340
HISHIGATA CLINIC

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.925
USHIOH: Shinpei. This place Is...

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:21.470
Yeah. It's the Hishigata Clinic.

00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:23.597
RYUNOSUKE:
Are you sure she was really here?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.933
ASAKO: Is she from the island?

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:26.976
HIZURU: I think so.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.060
RYUNOSUKE: You think?

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:32.064
She's probably not exactly
from our time, though.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:36.527
HIZURU: You'll understand.
She usually appears right about now.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.737
-Hm?
-Uh?

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:39.947
HIZURU: Look there.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.908
The light on the second floor
should turn on soon.

00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.453
-It's gotta be a ghost, you guys.
-(Asako gasps)

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:47.621
Ugh, this is too creepy.

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:50.166
People say this whole place
is haunted, you know?

00:20:58.382 --> 00:20:59.800
I don't see anyone.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:03.220
Well, I guess maybe
she isn't coming today.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:06.974
ASAKO: Hizuru, we should head back.
Our parents will get worried.

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.894
RYUNOSUKE: It won't be safe to go back
once it gets dark.

00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:14.523
Look, I promised I would meet her today.
I keep promises.

00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.692
-(sighs)
-Hizuru!

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:22.907
Okay, I'll take you home, Asako.
Sometimes Sis gets all stubborn like this.
