WEBVTT

00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:04.671
(fireworks popping)

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:05.923
(gasps)

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.675
SHINPEI: Ushio...

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:15.474
Ushio.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.353
(gasps)

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.192
-(Shinpei groans)
-Shinpei!

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.109
(giggles)

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.571
USHIOH: What the heck are you doing here?
Did you come back?

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:30.489
(Ushioh chuckles)

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.532
SHINPEI: I could ask you
the same question.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.368
Huh?

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:39.206
SHINPEI: <i>That necklace,</i>
<i>it's the only one in the world,</i>

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.999
<i>and Ushio's shadow is wearing it.</i>

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:46.922
Ushio is dead.
We had a funeral two days ago.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:50.884
Funeral?

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.846
No, you're not her.
There's no way you're Ushio!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.308
USHIOH: Huh? What are you talking about?

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.646
Of course, I'm alive. Look at me.
You see? I'm right here, silly!

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:08.652
SHINPEI: <i>What's it talking about?</i>
<i>Oh, god. It's a shadow. No doubt about it.</i>

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.615
You... You really don't remember
what happened to you?

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:14.908
Huh?

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.328
Wait.

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:20.289
USHIOH: Why am I...

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.419
I don't know what I'm doing here.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.088
(Shinpei gasps)

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.008
I don't know... Did I...

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.135
That's so weird.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.680
You don't remember
how you ended up here at all?

00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:41.310
(breathes sharply)
I can't breathe.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.394
SHINPEI: Oh...

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:47.941
All I can remember
is that I couldn't breathe at all.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:54.906
USHIOH: <i>When I was down there,</i>
<i>underwater, everything suddenly got dark.</i>

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.535
What? No way! What the...

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:02.748
Uh, hold on. I think I get it now. I died?

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:07.419
Then what am I? Am I a... a ghost?

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.630
Wait a second.
I do have real feet, though.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:16.595
SHINPEI: <i>Does it really believe</i>
<i>that it's the real Ushio? There's no way.</i>

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:22.184
USHIOH: I remember one thing for sure.

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:27.773
In the dark at the very end,
I wished I could see you one last time.

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:29.941
I just wanted to see your face again.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:31.485
(Ushioh sobs)

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.572
Maybe that's why I'm here with you
right now. I'm glad.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:36.990
(soft chuckle)

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.411
SHINPEI: <i>Her voice. Her gestures.</i>

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.997
<i>Calm down. What is this?</i>

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.626
<i>It's crazy, but it feels</i>
<i>like Ushio really came back</i>

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.002
<i>and is standing in front of me.</i>

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.258
USHIOH: Hey, Shinpei. You listening?

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.553
There was something I wanted to tell you
if I ever saw you again.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:01.181
I like you.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:02.891
Huh?

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:05.852
USHIOH: I want to say...
(chuckles)

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:08.146
Shinpei, I love you!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.982
(theme music)

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:46.119
(gasps)
SHINPEI: <i>What did... did it just say?</i>

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:49.456
(stutters)
<i>Love? What did it mean by that?</i>

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.378
Uh, what... what are you saying?
Did dying make you lose your mind?

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.422
(chuckles)

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.340
I don't know.

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.509
-Mm...
-Oh, man.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:03.512
My head feels a little bit cloudy.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.222
(exhales sharply)

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.934
SHINPEI: <i>Don't be fooled.</i>
<i>See the big picture!</i>

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.273
<i>Just two days ago, they put Ushio</i>
<i>in a coffin and cremated her.</i>

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.442
<i>She's no longer with us.</i>

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.197
<i>But it's acting just like the real Ushio.</i>
<i>I wonder what it wants.</i>

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.617
Why? Why did you come here?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.786
I wish I knew the answer to all of that.

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:32.999
Don't you go to...
to heaven right after you pass away?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:37.587
Why are you here? What do you guys want?

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.590
Um, what do I want?

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:47.472
USHIOH: Shinpei. Those fireworks.
Is today the 24th of July?

00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:49.099
SHINPEI: Uh, yeah.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.350
USHIOH: No way!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.854
Oh, there's... there's something
I wanted to do!

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:57.357
I want to go
to the summer festival with you!

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:58.900
(giggles)

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:00.944
Uh... Hey!

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.823
Shinpei! Hurry up!

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.034
SHINPEI: <i>I don't think it realizes</i>
<i>it's a shadow.</i>

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.288
(background chatter)

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:15.208
SHINPEI: <i>Has it really convinced itself</i>
<i>that it's Ushio and not a shadow?</i>

00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:17.043
(indistinct chatter)

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.086
(Ushioh humming)

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.589
(grunts)

00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:24.009
Shinpei, hey! I wanna try this!

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.721
SHINPEI: <i>What the...</i>
<i>Why is she wearing her swimsuit?</i>

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.349
(grunts)
Idiot! You stick out like a sore thumb!

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.978
Man, that smells so incredible!
Let's get some takoyaki!

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.024
There's no time for that!
And what if someone recognizes you?

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:42.652
SHINPEI: <i>How could I ever manage</i>
<i>to explain this?</i>

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.281
Come on over! Step right up!

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.825
You won't find a better bargain
for octopus this huge!

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.287
VENDOR: Fresh and delicious!
Come and get it! Try some!

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.247
You won't regret it!

00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:58.501
(Ushioh shouting in distance)

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.506
WOMAN: Hey guys! Wait for me!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.924
(indistinct chatter)

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:09.596
Hey, Shinpei. I don't understand
why we need to hide like this.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.141
I'm getting really hungry.
Aren't Mio and the others here?

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.352
I wanna see them. Hmm...

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.354
You can't! Absolutely not!

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.899
Think about this, just think
about the situation for a second.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.195
Listen, you just died, okay?
Your funeral was two days ago.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:27.113
-But I--
-Don't give me that!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.907
-Whoa.
-You're a shadow.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.159
You're a... You're a ghost or whatever.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.330
But everyone can see you!
What am I supposed to do?

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.749
Are you saying you don't want me
to see everyone?

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:39.125
Of course I don't!

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.712
Just hide right here until the festival
is over and everyone's gone.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.630
(Ushioh grunts)

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.841
-Shinpei, you're such a jerk!
-(groans)

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.469
Why do you keep going on
about all this bullcrap?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.471
Stop acting like this or else...

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.015
SHINPEI: <i>Or else? She already hit me.</i>
(groaning)

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:57.811
<i>She really is just like Ushio. Seriously.</i>

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.485
SHINPEI: <i>I had a long conversation</i>
<i>with Ushio's shadow,</i>

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.321
<i>about how it's been two years</i>
<i>since I left this place,</i>

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.156
<i>and about our childhood.</i>

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.159
<i>It had all of Ushio's memories.</i>

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.454
Do you know who my favorite author is?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.123
Ryunosuke Nagumo, right?

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.875
We saw a movie based
on one of his books. Remember?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.795
SHINPEI: <i>It was so strange.</i>

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:27.924
<i>It was talking to me</i>
<i>like it knew nothing about shadows.</i>

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.261
<i>And it didn't seem to remember</i>
<i>how Ushio died.</i>

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.222
So you're not worried about Shiori?
About what happened?

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.433
Hm? What's going on with Shiori?

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.935
SHINPEI: <i>It didn't seem like</i>
<i>she was acting at all.</i>

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.395
Nothing. Never mind.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.897
(cell phone buzzing)

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:44.357
Oh.

00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:49.779
-A call?
-Hang on.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.490
-SHINPEI: It's Mio.
-(Ushioh chuckles)

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:53.700
-Gimme.
-Hey! Stop!

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:56.286
(chuckles)
Oh, hey, is this Mio?

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.372
Well?

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.124
(both grunting)

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.168
MIO: Uh, hey, Sis?

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:09.299
Hi, it's me! Hey, are you... Mio?
It's just me, yeah.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.802
MIO: <i>I swear,</i>
<i>I thought I heard Sis' voice.</i>

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:13.970
(gasps)

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:17.891
SHINPEI: <i>Of course not.</i>
<i>Are you kidding? Are you okay?</i>

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.934
Right. Uh, right, of course.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.520
-I'm sorry. It was just my imagination.
-Mm-mm.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.442
MIO: Shin-chan, where are you, anyway?
The fireworks are over already.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:31.654
We're over by the shrine now.
The Farewell Ceremony is starting.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:37.118
I'm close by. Yeah, I'm coming.
Be there right away.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.330
Okay, so?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.332
(grunting)

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:45.210
You need to just stay put right here!

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.586
Hey! Stop it!

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.173
SHINPEI: Ugh,
I'll come get you later. Okay?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.132
(grunts)

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:55.428
You might not realize it right now,
but something really crazy is going on.

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:57.680
(both grunt)

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:01.142
Aren't you the one who said,
"Take care of Mio. Look after her"?

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.062
Regret is the last thing I need.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:08.108
What is he talking about? Hm!

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:13.113
USHIOH: <i>I never said that to him.</i>
<i>"Take care of Mio"?</i>

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.782
-(Shinpei panting)
-Huh?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.993
-Look. He's finally here. Hi, Shin-chan.
-(Shinpei panting)

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:22.122
What took you so long?
I was really worried about you.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:23.206
"Mountain."

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:28.628
Sorry, I just had terrible stomach issues.
"Me... Mesopotamia," right?

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.839
Told you guys, he was just pooping.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.340
TOKIKO: So, what's with the smirk?

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.425
(awkward chuckle)

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.346
SHINPEI: <i>In Hitogashima,</i>

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.516
<i>they say that God lives in things</i>
<i>that come from the sea.</i>

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.852
<i>This belief is deeply rooted</i>
<i>on the island.</i>

00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.021
<i>That's the legend of Hiruko-no-Mikoto.</i>

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.818
<i>Around here, people call it Hiruko,</i>
<i>after the god of fishing and luck.</i>

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.655
<i>This time of year,</i>
<i>people collect driftwood from the beach,</i>

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:59.242
<i>and burn it all up,</i>
<i>it's known as the Farewell Ceremony,</i>

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.327
<i>sending off the gods.</i>

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.289
<i>Every year, it brings</i>
<i>quite an impressive crowd to the island.</i>

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:06.499
<i>Around a thousand people are here.</i>

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:10.587
It's been so long since we all came out
to the Farewell Ceremony together.

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.338
That's true.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.508
-Ushio is watching, too!
-Huh?

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:17.218
Watching from heaven.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:20.221
-Oh, that's what you mean. Of course.
-(sobbing)

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.560
MIO: I wonder if it's okay to be here
at the summer festival

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.978
since Sis just died.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.898
I really wish she could be here
with us tonight.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:31.858
Right.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.069
-Oh, hey, Sou, uh...
-Mm...

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.030
You wanted to talk?

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:42.076
My brother is planning on telling Mio
how he feels tonight.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.330
SHINPEI: Huh? He... He can't be serious.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:49.167
TOKIKO: I love my brother, I do,
but he can be crazy.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.047
Well, crazy things have been known
to happen sometimes, right?

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:56.883
Yes.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.011
But this time, he has no chance.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.638
Uh? Why not?

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:07.227
Because Mio... Mio has...
has her eye on someone else.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.439
Oh. Who?

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:15.526
Ah! You know, I'm really not supposed
to say anything.

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.861
-SOU: Shinpei!
-Oh.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.572
Tokiko. Come here. Both of you.

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:23.534
Uh, so listen, Mio. Okay, Mio.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:27.330
SOU: I don't know
if now is the right time for this.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.918
But hear this. I wanna say something,
and I need you to know.

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:32.835
Uh...

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:36.089
I just wanna say
I'm in love with you, Mio!

00:12:36.172 --> 00:12:37.006
(Sou grunts)

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:43.471
Please. Please let me... let me protect...
Please let me... let me protect you!

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.806
(gasps)

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.477
-Whoa. He actually said it.
-TOKIKO: He said it.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.981
Wait! Sou, wait a second.
What are you saying?

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:57.110
Uh, I... I don't want to...
Everyone is listening.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:58.194
(sighs)

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.823
(soft music)

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.743
MIO: I don't understand.
Why do you like me?

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:07.537
(grunts)

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.247
MIO: I'm really flattered, but I...

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.042
Uh, but I'm sorry that I can't say yes.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:16.921
I think we're better off
if we just stay really good friends.

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:21.301
-Oh, dang!
-Totally saw that one coming.

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.511
USHIOH: Hey, I'm just here in time!

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:24.554
BOTH: Huh?

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:27.015
(Ushioh snickers)

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.224
Hmm?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.642
USHIOH: Hey, Sou.

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.685
Huh?

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.646
-Don't worry.
-Huh?

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.107
SHINPEI: <i>I thought I told you</i>
<i>not to come out!</i>

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:39.193
Oh...

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.403
(gasps)

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:42.864
SHINPEI: <i>That idiot!</i>

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.365
(snickers)

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.872
Ah, that beautiful blonde hair.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:54.459
And is that... voice...

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.627
-SOU: Ushio?
-What?

00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:02.133
What... Huh? That... That... Whoa!

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.928
Uh, I... I'm... I'm not Ushio, guys!

00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:09.307
I'm the fighter of love from...

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.184
-Pretty Cure!
-Hey.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.728
USHIOH: Shinpei, they knew it was me.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.106
You idiot! You really call
that mask a disguise?

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:21.444
Shin... Shinpei. Are... Are you tell me...

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:25.990
USHIOH: I'm sorry.
I just wanted to see all of you.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.950
Did Tokiko dress you?

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:32.371
Mio, the <i>yukata</i> looks fantastic on you.

00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:35.583
Oh, no.

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.627
(foreboding music)

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.214
USHIOH: Mio?

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.301
What are you doing, Shin-chan?
Get away from it! Be careful!

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:49.055
MIO: That's not actually my real sister!

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:50.014
USHIOH: Huh?

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.100
It's a monster!

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.310
(gasps)

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.233
Mio.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.692
(breathes heavily)

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.823
-I'm not going to let her go.
-(groans)

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.491
(Mio gasps)

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.284
(Ushioh grunts)

00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:13.162
USHIOH: Hey, that hurts. Shinpei?

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.164
(Ushioh whimpering)

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.207
Hold on, Mio.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.294
SOU: Shinpei! Explain yourself, now!

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.255
What's wrong with you?

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.090
(Ushioh grunting)

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.218
SHADOW SHINPEI: You can't switch places
with someone who's dead and buried.

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:28.177
(Ushioh grunts)

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.180
You never really wanted
to do this in the first place.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.850
(gasps)

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:39.105
You're supposed to obey me.
And don't tell me you can't hear my voice.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.693
Who are you? Everybody, run! Go now!

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:44.861
Run away!

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:49.031
(screams)

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.116
SHADOW SHINPEI: Too late.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.576
USHIOH: Shinpei!

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.161
Th-This guy...

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:54.620
That isn't Shin-chan!

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.706
(suspenseful music)

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.376
(grunts)

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.962
(static)

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.297
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>It's time.</i>

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.261
(panting)

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:13.055
SHINPEI: <i>Mio, sorry I had</i>
<i>to leave so suddenly.</i>

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:16.100
<i>I don't want Mio worrying about me.</i>

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.311
<i>I need to apologize.</i>

00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:23.191
(Shinpei panting)

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.151
(zaps)

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.988
(gasps)

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.240
(Shinpei panting)

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:36.078
Shin-chan. I wanted to ask you something.
Do you have a minute?

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.747
(panting)

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.707
(static)

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:46.255
(groaning)

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.882
(choking)

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:51.677
SHINPEI: <i>What?</i>
<i>I never even saw it make a move.</i>

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:55.389
<i>It happened that fast.</i>
<i>And no human could be this strong.</i>

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.516
By the way, Shin-Chan,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.852
I heard you managed
to get me on video, huh?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.562
(choking)

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.065
I don't know how you pulled that off.

00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.568
Unless you knew
I was going to be there somehow.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:13.032
(groans, coughs)

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.700
How did you know?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.077
(grunts)

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.037
SHINPEI: <i>How does it know?</i>

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.582
(gasps)

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.126
(groans)

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:29.215
<i>This can't be real.</i>

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.675
(grunts)

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:34.262
<i>This is crazy.</i>
<i>Did it actually do all this?</i>

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.014
<i>How many people did it kill?</i>

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:41.269
(groaning)

00:17:41.352 --> 00:17:45.398
Who told you where I was?
It was the traitor, wasn't it?

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:46.899
(gasps)

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.109
SHINPEI: <i>Who's the traitor?</i>

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.986
MIOH: I can't just ignore that.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.614
It would be a shame
if we let it mess up our plans.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:57.243
Go find out how much he knows about us.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:02.582
SHADOW SHINPEI: It's pretty patchy.
It just repeats and repeats.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:03.541
(gasps)

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.587
There's something strange about my memory.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:14.010
How many times
have you been killed before?

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.511
SHINPEI: <i>This thing...</i>

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.723
<i>It has to be my shadow.</i>

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.767
<i>It copied me at that moment.</i>

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.438
<i>It has all my memories</i>
<i>up until that point.</i>

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:30.234
<i>Oh, no! If its memory gets updated,</i>
<i>it will find out!</i>

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:33.029
<i>It'll know that we've been</i>
<i>investigating shadows,</i>

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.406
<i>and it'll find out about "Mesopotamia."</i>

00:18:35.489 --> 00:18:37.825
<i>Ushio... I don't know</i>
<i>why they come out like this.</i>

00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.619
<i>I thought crowds would make things safer.</i>

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:40.536
<i>Just think, Shinpei!</i>

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.038
<i>It's over. It's over. It's over.</i>

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:44.165
(groaning)
<i>Focus and take the bird's-eye view!</i>

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.292
All done?

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.251
Hold on.

00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:48.711
We don't need him anymore.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.421
-SHINPEI: <i>Run away.</i>
-No.

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:52.131
-SHINPEI: <i>Run away or you're dead!</i>
-No!

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.091
<i>They'll kill everyone!</i>

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.724
Wait a second. Don't kill him, Mio.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.185
MIOH: Why not, Shin-chan?

00:19:04.268 --> 00:19:08.773
Try to take the bird's-eye view.
Mom used to say that.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.984
He'll die, but he can come back
and redo the day.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.027
(gasps)

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.864
So he's in a loop, then?
Think your memories are accurate?

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:18.366
This isn't some video game.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:21.535
He still doesn't have control
over any of it himself,

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.788
but all of this
would make a lot more sense

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.373
if he was in a time loop.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.042
SHADOW SHINPEI: Let's brush up
on malleable space-time

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.210
and the fourth dimension.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.254
Anything that would let someone
move easily through time.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.841
I'm guessing he probably can't do
anything like that now,

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.511
but he could learn how in the future.

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.472
MIOH: Oh, god.
You read too many weird books.

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:46.352
If he can find his way back to the 22nd
with everything he knows,

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.313
he could cause problems,
he'll get in our way eventually.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.942
So just don't kill him
until everything is done.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.486
(Shinpei breathes shakily)

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:03.327
I'm gonna go up. Give me his phone.
It's in his left back pocket.

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:05.955
Oh, send some people down to get Ushio.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:09.041
She's at the storage area,
over by the big tent.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:11.585
MIOH: All right. Fine.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.925
You should get going.

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.511
You-know-who
is a stickler for punctuality.

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:21.470
Right.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:25.391
(grunts)
Dammit. Wait.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:26.726
SHINPEI: Stop.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.144
(Shadow Shinpei sighs)

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.062
SHADOW SHINPEI: Oh, man.
You're so pathetic.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:34.692
As it turns out,
you really can't protect anyone, can you?

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:35.943
(grunts)

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:38.612
Wait. Wait. Stop!

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.573
(Shinpei grunts)

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.534
Don't even think about touching Mio!

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.452
(grunts)

00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.872
(groans)

00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:50.666
(chuckles)
Come on. Cut it out, Shin-chan.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.711
Stop trying to be a hero.

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:55.504
You know it's too late.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:59.216
In no time, Mom will be waking up.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.678
(grunting)

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.973
MIOH: Come on, stay still. Come on.

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.768
Wow, who knew
you were so stubborn, Shin-chan?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.352
(Shinpei grunts)

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:13.147
SHINPEI: Mio!

00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:16.025
MIOH: I'll break this side, too.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.777
-(squeaking)
-(Shinpei grunting)

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.111
(gunshot)

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.655
-(blood splatters)
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.616

(Shinpei whimpering)

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:44.303
Narezushi isn't all that common
in Hitogashima.

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:45.346
(gasps)

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:50.768
I haven't had a chance to try it just yet.
And what about yourself, huh?

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:52.812
Huh? What?

00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.021
SHINPEI: <i>I know that woman.</i>

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:57.441
