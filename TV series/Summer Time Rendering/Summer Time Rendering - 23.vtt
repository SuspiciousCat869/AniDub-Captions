WEBVTT

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.462
(Shide laughs)

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:07.549
I actually thought I was dead, Shinpei.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.222
Shide...

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:14.348
(cooing)

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:18.352
Heine...

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.938
No, Hiruko.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:24.316
You're worthless now.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.317
(gasps)

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.819
SHIDE: You've shrunken so much.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.864
-There's no way you'll recover.
-(whimpers)

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.117
Your eyes are broken now, too.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:37.079
What a disappointment.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.457
But look at your right eye!

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:44.419
That's the observer's right eye.
You must be the egg.

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:46.213
You've just awakened.

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:50.092
But why?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.680
<i>When Heine looked,</i>
<i>most of your data was corrupt.</i>

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:02.020
<i>I didn't realize that had become</i>
<i>what you developed into.</i>

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:05.899
I guess only someone like you
would be able to recreate that.

00:01:05.983 --> 00:01:07.442
(laughs)

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:10.404
So that's the power of love!

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.866
If I can take your eye,
I am going to get what I want.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:21.665
MASAHITO: <i>I couldn't take it from Shinpei</i>
<i>who had it in the fourth loop,</i>

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:26.461
but I can take it from the egg
who still has it.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:32.175
USHIOH: If what he wants is really
what I saw in his mind at that moment...

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:36.221
I'm not letting him get it!

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.766
BABY HEINE: Shide, wait.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:43.395
I can still do it.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.650
If I eat enough humans, I'll get better.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:52.321
So please come home with me.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:53.822
(sighs)

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:59.786
Maybe you can take Ushioh's eye
and give it to me.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.913
SHIDE: I don't need you anymore.

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:06.168
What do you mean?
But isn't Heine your mother?

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:10.255
So? I don't care about the past.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.715
(Ushioh grunts)

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.302
Shide!

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.806
And you call yourself human?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.143
SHIDE: I do need Hiruko alive, though,

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.813
because my armor
would disappear without her.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.027
I'll take you home, as you wish.

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:37.658
(sobbing)
BABY HEINE: No, I'm not going like this.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:40.827
-(Baby Heine screams)
-(grunts)

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.122
SHIDE: Come, observer.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:49.878
Let's settle the matter there. Shall we?

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.088
(Shinpei grunts)

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.674
SHINPEI: Ushioh! Give me Nezu's gun!

00:02:55.217 --> 00:02:56.176
(static)

00:02:58.762 --> 00:02:59.763
(gunshot)

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.224
(gunshot)

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.268
(grunting)

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.354
(groans)

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.899
-SHINPEI: Shide!
-(Shide laughing)

00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.611
(Shinpei groaning)

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:16.822
Shinpei!

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.990
(suspenseful music)

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.243
(wind swooshing)

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.913
(whimpering)

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:28.834
Ugh! Thanks.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.380
USHIOH: No, Shinpei,
you're being drawn in!

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.883
SHINPEI: <i>I'm weak. Too weak.</i>

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:42.264
Mortals can't go past this point.
If you do, you can't leave or die.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:43.515
You'll end up lost.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.808
(grunts)

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.268
But...

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.978
I can go alone from here.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.231
No! I'm not leaving you again!
You hear me?

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.943
Don't be stubborn, you dummy!
Weren't you listening to me?

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.905
Ryu, can you hear me? Take Shinpei and go!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:05.287
If I leave you now,
my sister will never forgive me.

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:06.997
Ryu.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.915
SHINPEI: She promised you something.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.669
RYUNOSUKE:
And I'm going to keep it for her.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:18.300
I will be Shinpei's support.
I promise, I won't let him get lost.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.885
(Ushioh gasps)

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:24.806
I'll follow your presence. Always!

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.226
SHINPEI: I'll be by your side.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.731
I love you, Ushioh,
and I want to be with you forever.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.691
Do you have a problem with that?

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.115
USHIOH: Dummy.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.075
(wind swooshing)

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.285
(grunting)

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.246
SOU: Shinpei!

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:52.626
(gasps)

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.797
Sou! Take care of everyone.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.389
-(static)
-(overlapping chatter)

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.808
(silence)

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.729
(cicadas chirping)

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.905
(Shinpei groaning)

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:25.659
Ushioh!

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.925
(grunts)

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.387
SHINPEI: This is Heine's home.

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:55.647
(gasps)
<i>Where's Ushioh?</i>

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.659
SHINPEI: The flow of time ends here.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.121
It's just like what Dr. Hishigata said.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.163
Huh?

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:16.042
SHINPEI: Time doesn't flow here.
It's stagnant.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:19.129
I don't think I can go back by looping.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.465
If I die, that's probably it.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.175
This isn't good.
(Shinpei grunts)

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:31.850
Ushioh!

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:37.355
(voice echoing)
Ushioh!

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:41.610
SHINPEI: <i>I just had her!</i>
<i>I was holding her hand!</i>

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.613
I know she's here.

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:49.034
The shotgun she printed is still here.

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:51.578
SHINPEI: So she's within 50 meters.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.124
I can sense her, too.
But she's on the move.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.126
Let's go after her!
(grunts)

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.377
(groans)

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:02.422
RYUNOSUKE: Shinpei! I'm sorry.
It's because I jumped.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:06.843
SHINPEI: No, I told you to go after Shide
with everything I've got.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.723
This is nothing compared
to what Ms. Nagumo went through.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.766
Mm.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.852
RYUNOSUKE: Let me control your body.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.438
I'll take on the pain.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.316
But then you'll be hurting.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.943
I'll be okay. Since I'm a shadow.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.655
I can definitely make it hurt a lot less.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.824
RYUNOSUKE:
Besides, it's not just your leg injury.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.536
Your entire body is starting to give out.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.917
If I don't support you internally,
you won't have a chance here.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:44.714
(chimes)

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.388
How does it feel?
I'm gonna move your body now.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:56.893
SHINPEI: <i>It feels weird.</i>
<i>My body is numb, but I'm still conscious.</i>

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.688
It's usually like that for me, too.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.732
Being just a conscience
is weird, isn't it?

00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:08.196
<i>Yes, but it's kind of like stepping back.</i>
<i>I can get used to it.</i>

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.785
Ms. Ushio!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.622
Can you hear me?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.208
Ms. Ushioh!

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.335
(grunts)

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.549
<i>Ryunosuke, is this Hitogashima?</i>

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:33.388
<i>It does look similar with the sea</i>
<i>and the Wakayama mainland.</i>

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.098
It does.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:39.018
RYUNOSUKE: Hey, Shinpei?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:42.188
I meant to tell you this earlier.

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:43.273
SHINPEI: What is it?

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.276
You don't have to be so proper with me.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.193
Huh?

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.988
RYUNOSUKE:
After all, you are older than me.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.158
SHINPEI: No, no, you're the same age
as Ms. Nagumo,

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.367
so you're way older!

00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:57.620
RYUNOSUKE: Oh, no. I'm in middle school.
When I died, that is.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:01.332
Ushioh started calling me Ryu immediately.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.294
Yeah. Well, she's really friendly
with everyone.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.213
SHINPEI: I'm not the type
who's super casual

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.882
just 'cause you're younger.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.635
RYUNOSUKE: Are you always so proper
with everyone?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:17.265
Yeah. I'm more casual
with people my age, but...

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:22.437
Oh. Then what about Mio?
You're super casual with her.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.940
That actually took a while to get used to.

00:09:26.024 --> 00:09:29.402
Hmm... I'm a little bit jealous.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.033
Well, then. I'm gonna be casual with you!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.078
-What?
-So totally be casual with me! Okay?

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:43.208
The way I speak is how I show respect.
It doesn't mean we're not close.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.378
No, how we talk to each other
is super important!

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:49.964
So please just do it!

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:50.924
Uh...

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:52.425
(chuckles)

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.719
What... What's so funny?

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.888
(chuckles)

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:01.101
It makes me want to get
to know you more, Ryunosuke.

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.436
Oh, wow!

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.646
-Really?
-(Heine singing)

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.647
(Shinpei gasps)

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.731
Hold on.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.400
SHINPEI: Look.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.820
(Heine singing)

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:12.862
(cocks gun)

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.199
(foreboding music)

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:18.952
A ball?

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.040
I've seen it before.

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.876
SHINPEI: <i>It's Heine's ball.</i>

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.379
(gasps)
Let's go after it.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.463
RYUNOSUKE: Right.

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:40.056
(Heine singing)

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.818
SHINPEI: Ryunosuke, you see that sign?

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:52.819
KOBAYAKAWA STORE

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:57.740
Uh, Kobayakawa Store?
(gasps)

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.534
SHINPEI: What...

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.871
What are these things?

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.123
(mumbling)

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.584
(shadows giggling)

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:08.459
KOBAYAKAWA STORE

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.503
(Heine singing)

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.630
Do you think they're shadows?

00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:16.968
Not sure, but the good thing
is they're not attacking us.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:21.389
(bells clinking)

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.354
(gasps)

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.647
SHINPEI: Ushioh!

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.107
(static)

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.568
(Ushioh sobbing)

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:38.239
Ushioh, are you okay?
Tell me what happened!

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.240
(Ushioh groans)

00:11:39.324 --> 00:11:41.201
USHIOH: Shinpei...

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.828
My head...

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.706
-(Ushioh groaning)
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.044
RYUNOSUKE: This... This presence...

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.296
-(static)
-RYUNOSUKE: It's Heine!

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:55.965
(Ryunosuke gasps)

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.801
I promised Ushioh.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.138
HIZURU: <i>Her body is a part of Heine's.</i>

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:08.645
If Ushioh loses herself
and Heine ever appears again,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:10.855
I'll kill her.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:15.610
HIZURU: If I'm no longer around,
Ryunosuke...

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.363
(screaming)

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.698
HIZURU: <i>You need to keep that promise.</i>

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.326
-(Ushioh screaming)
-(static)

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:27.372
RYUNOSUKE:
Shinpei, I'm gonna shoot! I will!

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:28.957
Okay?

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.335
Shinpei?

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.214
Hold it, Ryunosuke. It's saying something.

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:41.719
(whimpering)
It's okay, Ryu. It's fine now.

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.680
USHIOH: She's different.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:47.141
She's not the evil Heine who killed you.

00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:48.601
(panting)

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.688
<i>Her consciousness split at that moment,</i>

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.692
<i>into the human Heine and Hiruko.</i>

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.443
(Ushioh breathes heavily)

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.655
So then who's inside you, Ushioh?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:05.827
USHIOH: <i>She's the girl who loved sweets,</i>
<i>Ms. Nagumo's friend.</i>

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:07.870
Her friend?

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.749
Right. And she's also...

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:13.960
me.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.337
This Heine wants to talk to you.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.131
-RYUNOSUKE: Oh.
-Will you listen to her?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.509
-Uh...
-Mm.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:26.723
Thank you.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.851
(static)

00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:39.193
Nice to meet you.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.282
So you're...

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.701
-(whimpers)
-Huh?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.497
Oh, you don't have to be shy.
They're Hizuru's friends, Heine.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:52.790
Okay.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:59.756
HEINE: I was in a long dream,
in Ushioh's memory.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:03.009
I'm sorry, Shinpei, Ryunosuke.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:08.139
I got everyone involved,
you, and Hizuru, and Ushio.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.307
(sobs)

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.517
Everyone died because of me.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.561
SHINPEI:
You don't have to apologize, Heine.

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.479
HEINE: Huh?

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:19.233
Hiruko was the one who ate me,
and that's what Hiruko always does.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.612
RYUNOSUKE: Blame Shide
for taking advantage of that.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:28.701
You're going to fight Shide?

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.830
(Heine sighs)

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.419
We're in the Everlasting Night.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:41.297
It exists above our real world.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.301
Over here, time doesn't move.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:50.556
Shinpei and Ushioh,
can you see how amazing that is?

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.475
Mm-hm.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:55.394
Now, look at Ryunosuke with those eyes.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.980
Ah! He isn't ahead of us.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.274
-Oh, you're right.
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.443
I've been talking without any lapse.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:04.737
That's why he brought us here.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:09.659
Because time stands still,
I can't loop, and we can't see the future.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.870
HEINE: He's trying
to steal Ushioh's eye here.

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:19.585
The one with the awakened eye
sees beyond the current world.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:25.216
He'll have control
of the current life, time, and space.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:28.803
It's like in the 3D world,
we're able to pick up a comic book

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:29.846
without difficulty,

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.598
and easily throw it away
or burn it at will.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:34.600
-Wow!
-What? You can't be serious!

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:36.435
It doesn't feel like I can do that at all!

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:42.608
It just awakened, so it seems unstable.
You're in the Everlasting Night, too.

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.696
You should know
that the eye functions best in this world.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.156
The ending.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:49.115
(gasps)

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.702
USHIOH: <i>It's the thought that I saw</i>
<i>when I scanned Shide.</i>

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.831
<i>He wants to destroy the world,</i>

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.960
<i>as if he's turning off</i>
<i>the power after a game.</i>

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.421
<i>There's nothing after that.</i>

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:05.840
<i>It's really the end.</i>

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.471
(blasts)

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.018
(alarm blaring)

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:19.520
Oh, my. This sound is familiar.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.731
(static)

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:26.569
REPORTER:
<i>Central military district information.</i>

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:30.239
<i>B29s are headed North from Kii Channel.</i>

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:36.370
<i>Two hundred fifty enemy bombers</i>
<i>are bound North in five squadrons.</i>

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:40.458
<i>One has circled over Awajishima,</i>

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:42.460
<i>and headed Southeast.</i>

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:47.006
<i>May you Wakayama citizens live.</i>

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.342
It's the air raid siren!

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:52.595
(whistling)

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.352
(grunting)

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.775
SHINPEI: Ushioh!

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.360
USHIOH: Stay down, Ryu!

00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.820
Ushioh, don't make a shadow on the ground.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.364
SHINPEI: The fire is dangerous.

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.574
Try to make your body
as small as possible!

00:17:13.908 --> 00:17:18.287
I'm okay! Shadows don't die here.
This doesn't hurt one bit.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:21.749
(Shide laughs)

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.668
Shide!

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:30.633
SHIDE: Nothing can touch me,
no matter what you do.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.718
You look like slugs down there!

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:40.059
Ushioh, first I'm gonna burn up your body,
then I will easily take your eye.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.521
SHINPEI: <i>So about what you were saying...</i>

00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:48.818
<i>Shide wants to return to our world</i>
<i>after taking your eye, right?</i>

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.613
<i>Then that means</i>
<i>there must be a way to get back.</i>

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.323
Shinpei, you're right!

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:59.662
We kill Hiruko. You'll still be able
to do that in the Everlasting Night.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.582
HEINE: The Everlasting Night
disappears with Hiruko.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:04.125
We can go back to the current world.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.459
You got it.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.338
SHINPEI: But how?
Shide is way up in the sky.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:11.549
Leave that to me.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.052
HEINE: This air raid is Hiruko's memory.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.930
BABY HEINE: It's hot. I'm burning.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:22.893
Don't make me relive

00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:26.564
something like this.

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.608
(suspenseful music)

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:29.859
It's a memory?

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:33.070
The Everlasting Night is linked
to Hiruko's memory,

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:37.533
although I doubt this is
a past Hiruko wants to remember.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:42.246
Calm down, little one.
Even if it hurts, it won't kill you.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.293
Your pain gives them pain.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.129
-(Masahito giggling)
-(Baby Heine shrieking)

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.840
It's Shide! He's forcing the memory!

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:55.259
HEINE: Ushioh, jump at my signal.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:58.054
-USHIOH: What?
-HEINE: I have this memory, too.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:02.058
I can push it back for a little while.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.019
But beware of Shide's armor.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:10.358
Just like an echo,
it reflects any attacks directed at it

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:11.901
back to the opponent.

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:16.989
SHINPEI: <i>To beat Shide, you have</i>
<i>to hack him and erase the armor first.</i>

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:20.201
<i>Then we kill the inside.</i>
<i>It's a two-step process.</i>

00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:23.454
<i>But after the first step,</i>
<i>he'll get to Ushioh.</i>

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:25.956
No, I won't die.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.959
-USHIOH: Mioh gave me something.
-(gasps)

00:19:29.043 --> 00:19:30.836
USHIOH: Finish him off in two steps.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.924
No matter what happens,
before all of my hair burns off.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.802
All right. I can hold it for a few seconds

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.512
to create a path for you, Ushio.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.597
(tense music)

00:19:45.476 --> 00:19:48.062
Do you trust me?

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.897
-RYUNOSUKE: We do.
-(gasps)

00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:53.609
If my sister befriended you,
you're my friend, too.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.778
Ryunosuke.

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:58.030
Right, Shinpei?

00:19:58.739 --> 00:19:59.657
Yeah.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:01.575
Thank you.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.623
-I'm ready.
-(static)

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.125
HEINE: Right.

00:20:12.086 --> 00:20:13.587
(grunting softly)

00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:16.424
(missiles whistling)

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:18.050
(Heine grunting)

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.721
(grunting continues)

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:23.597
Go, now!

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:26.600
(grunts)

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:30.730
(epic music)

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:35.901
MASAHITO: <i>So I see,</i>
<i>you got Heine on your side.</i>

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:41.949
HEINE: <i>I'm counting on you, Ushioh.</i>
<i>Please stop Shide.</i>

00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:48.289
<i>Let Hiruko rest in peace.</i>

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.666
(suspenseful music)

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.253
Leave it to me!

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.339
MASAHITO: <i>At this height,</i>
<i>I can't get to Ushioh's body.</i>

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:03.929
USHIOH: <i>Ugh! They're fast and massive!</i>
<i>I can't avoid them with my hair.</i>

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.439
I'll kill you
even if I have to die for it!

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.322
USHIOH: <i>Huh?</i>
(gasps)

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.866
<i>What is he...</i>

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.202
SHIDE: Even if you have to die?

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.412
USHIOH: <i>There's nothing inside.</i>

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.920
<i>That means I can't even cross-counter.</i>

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.756
So you read my mind. Did you?

00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:41.842
He hacked...

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.766
(scoffs)

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.686
(flash squeals)

00:21:55.773 --> 00:22:00.152
MASAHITO: <i>She revived? Did she eat</i>
<i>a part of the original Ushio?</i>

00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:03.322
USHIOH: <i>Then take this!</i>

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:14.959
MASAHITO: <i>What did she do?</i>

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:17.127
(Masahito grunts)

00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.172
The air raid stopped.

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.050
What... What happened?

00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:27.263
MASAHITO: <i>She touched me</i>
<i>to erase the memory of the air raid.</i>

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.723
-USHIOH: <i>Shinpei, can you hear me?</i>
-SHINPEI: <i>Ushioh!</i>

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.392
USHIOH: <i>I know now.</i>

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:33.561
<i>Shide's body is in the current world.</i>

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.145
SHINPEI: <i>Current world?</i>

00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:38.691
USHIOH: <i>He's remotely controlling</i>
<i>his armor using Hiruko.</i>

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:43.070
<i>If there's nothing inside,</i>
<i>there's not much we can do.</i>

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:44.738
(soft grunt)

00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:47.032
What does Shide's armor look like now?

00:22:47.116 --> 00:22:47.992
(grunts)

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.953
USHIOH: <i>The left half disappeared</i>
<i>after I erased it.</i>

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:54.456
SHINPEI: <i>Then erase the rest</i>
<i>and go for the win.</i>

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.041
<i>Uh, Ushioh?</i>

00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:57.710
<i>Ushioh!</i>

00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.755
(closing theme music)
