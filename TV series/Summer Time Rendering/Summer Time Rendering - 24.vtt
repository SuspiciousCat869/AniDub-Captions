WEBVTT

00:00:02.044 --> 00:00:02.878
Oh, my gosh!

00:00:03.587 --> 00:00:04.421
(grunts)

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:09.468
(groans)

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.680
(panting)

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:18.310
The few strands we have of her hair
aren't enough for her to recover.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.147
She is turning into a child.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.816
HEINE: She's in bad shape.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:28.779
Shide.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.906
(thrilling music)

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.290
Her nerves and muscles
are pretty worn out, Shinpei.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.001
Ushioh can't fight anymore.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.755
Damn it. If only I had
the strength to erase it.

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:51.218
SHINPEI: Ryunosuke.
Can you posses Shide's armor?

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.095
RYUNOSUKE: Huh?

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.680
SHINPEI: Sorry, that too risky.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.725
But it's the only thing
I can think of doing.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.186
USHIOH: <i>Don't turn around, Ryu.</i>

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.275
<i>Don't worry, Shide can't read our minds.</i>

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.236
<i>Both of you, listen to me.</i>

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:13.115
<i>I'm gonna put all my energy</i>
<i>into turning the shots</i>

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.575
<i>into hacking bullets.</i>

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:17.160
<i>But it'll take two minutes to do that.</i>

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.872
<i>So I'll need you to buy me that time.</i>

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:24.042
Having a secret strategy meeting, Shinpei?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.920
Please, won't you let me join you?

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:33.343
It's fine. Shide doesn't have
the power to read memories.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:38.890
He only has weapons,
because Hiruko is always by his side.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:41.977
MASAHITO: You've changed, Heine.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.064
I didn't expect you to betray me.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.860
HEINE: You're the one
who's changed, Shide!

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.987
I remember everyting went wrong

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.948
after that awful day the whale drifted
on the shore of the island!

00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.868
MASAHITO: I haven't changed at all.

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.662
If anything, I became enlightened.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:06.084
I realized I must be faithful
to my own desire to live.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.545
(Heine sobbing)

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.800
HEINE: <i>Right from the start,</i>
<i>I just wanted us to be together.</i>

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.762
<i>That was all.</i>

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.057
RYUNOSUKE: <i>Two minutes, Shinpei.</i>

00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:23.393
<i>Give it your all for just two minutes.</i>

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.484
(yelling)

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.571
SHINPEI: <i>There's no going back.</i>
<i>I'll give him everything I've got.</i>

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.826
<i>He's just rushing us.</i>

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:42.746
<i>But that's fine.</i>

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.832
<i>Let him think the shotgun's worthless.</i>

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.503
(thrilling music)

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:56.760
Damn it! The shotgun won't stop him!

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.804
SHINPEI: Ushioh! Change weapons!

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.265
(blasts)

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.354
(groaning)

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:09.856
USHIOH: <i>Good thing I like</i>
<i>to copy everything.</i>

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.567
<i>Even Hizuru's sledgehammer!</i>

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:13.902
Thank you.

00:03:14.403 --> 00:03:16.196
Now I can keep fighting.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.453
MASAHITO: Everything ends if you die.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:25.414
(panting)

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.125
You can't loop or see ahead.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.668
(giggles)

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.797
After all, you have to give
the last boss a chance.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.883
-(static)
-(Baby Heine cooing)

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.012
SHINPEI: <i>One more minute.</i>

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.892
MASAHITO: <i>I see.</i>
<i>Both of them are right-handed.</i>

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:47.394
<i>That's hard to use.</i>

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.563
SHINPEI: <i>The first attack</i>
<i>was reflected back.</i>

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:50.939
<i>Just like an echo.</i>

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.274
(gasps)

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.283
Shide's left arm...

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.367
It grew back!

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.829
USHIOH: <i>He just copied his right arm</i>
<i>to make his left.</i>

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.039
<i>My erasing is working.</i>

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.000
<i>Keep it up, Ryu.</i>

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.042
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I will!</i>

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.463
<i>If I attack it, it reflects that back.</i>

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.591
<i>But if I stop, Shide will go for Ushioh.</i>

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:24.264
<i>Keep at it! Attack! Keep attacking!</i>
<i>Don't even give him room to breathe!</i>

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.392
(thrilling music)

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.528
<i>Dann it! I could only punch him.</i>

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.032
(gunshot)

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.993
<i>A bullet out of all things?</i>

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.286
USHIOH: <i>Ryu, no!</i>

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.705
<i>Behind you!</i>

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.043
RYUNOSUKE: <i>This is bad. Dodge it!</i>

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:55.962
(Ushioh gasps)

00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:00.258
(eerie music)

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.426
SHINPEI: <i>Step back.</i>

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.386
<i>Take the bird's-eye view.</i>

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:07.140
<i>Those shell casings.</i>

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.101
<i>Not a single one has hit the ground.</i>

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.021
<i>Is this how shadows see time?</i>

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.105
(clinks)

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:17.526
<i>A second is so long.</i>
<i>It feels like forever.</i>

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:20.362
<i>How many more blows can I take?</i>

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.031
<i>Once she finishes the hacking bullet,</i>

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.534
<i>will I be in good enough condition</i>
<i>to shoot it?</i>

00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:29.496
Damn it. He's just too good.
Way stronger than any other shadow.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.917
Even after Ushioh cut off
half of both his arms.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.796
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I'm the only one who can shoot.</i>

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.217
<i>I'm... the only one!</i>

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.263
MASAHITO: We can both fight like shadows,

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.099
but the advantage of age, Ryunosuke,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.394
-I've got years on you.
-(Shinpei groans)

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:55.272
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I'm sorry, Ushioh.</i>

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.818
<i>Even if you finish the hacking bullet,</i>
<i>no one can shoot it.</i>

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.445
USHIOH: <i>Ryu.</i>
(sobs)

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.992
Don't give up, Ryunosuke.
We can still do this.

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:08.410
Uh...

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.872
Now, it's time
for the comeback of the ages.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.709
Ushioh. I'll shoot the hacking bullet.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.335
(gasps)

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.796
Ryunosuke. Listen to me.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.132
You have the ability
to possess bodies, right?

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:26.344
I need to you to take over Shide's armor
and stop him from attacking us?

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:27.304
Hm?

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:29.723
SHINPEI: <i>We just need ten seconds.</i>

00:06:30.682 --> 00:06:33.059
<i>It should be easy since it's empty inside.</i>

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:37.480
USHIOH: <i>Wait! You can't survive</i>
<i>without Ryu's support.</i>

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:41.484
SHINPEI: <i>I know.</i>

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.156
<i>But even if we keep dodging him,</i>
<i>my body won't last five seconds.</i>

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.243
Yeah, but I'll still need
to touch Shide's armor.

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.829
RYUNOSUKE: Can I get that close
without dying?

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.789
SHINPEI: Be confident in yourself.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.168
I know you can do it, Ryu.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.255
MASAHITO: <i>That's odd.</i>

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.257
RYUNOSUKE: <i>Okay!</i>

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.679
MASAHITO: <i>Even without any foresight,</i>
<i>he can escape a fatal blow.</i>

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:12.766
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I'll try it, Shinpei!</i>

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:18.605
Listen. You can replicate
any movement that you see.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.359
Nezu will show you how to shoot shadows.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.948
HIZURU: <i>I'm counting on you, Ryunosuke.</i>

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.159
(thrilling music)

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.203
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I'll see everything!</i>

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:36.998
<i>I'll weave past a fatal attack.</i>

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:43.963
<i>I can do it!</i>

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.260
(groans)

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.720
He's in.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.681
(groaning)

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.225
Good work, Ryunosuke.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:59.354
(Shide grunting)

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.106
(Shide screaming)

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.857
(Ryunosuke grunting)

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:04.109
(Shide grumbles)

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.486
SHIDE: Are you trying to control my armor?

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.698
Not at all, you bastard.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.742
I'm not going to let go of you!

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.537
But I hate you
with every fiber of my being!

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.663
(Shide grunts)

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:22.168
Good. Just stop him from moving.

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.170
(groaning)

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.927
SHINPEI: <i>This is bad. I almost passed out.</i>

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.265
<i>Ryunosuke was supressing this amount pain?</i>

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:40.103
USHIOH: <i>Hang in there, Shinpei!</i>
<i>Just a while more!</i>

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.772
SHINPEI: <i>Yeah, Ushioh.</i>

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.109
<i>I feel better just hearing your voice.</i>

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.528
(static)

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.822
<i>I think I have</i>
<i>a little more fight left in me.</i>

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.782
SHIDE: Well, well.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:58.288
Your hatred makes me sad. I like you.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.289
(gasps)

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.790
Ryunosuke.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.752
-(Shinpei gasps)
-(squelches)

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.380
USHIOH: <i>Ryu!</i>

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.677
MASAHITO: Were you trying
to get Ryunosuke to break my armor?

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.722
Not a terrible idea.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:17.640
However...

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.436
I took it upon myself
to break Ryunosuke apart.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.898
You can prepare if you know beforehand.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.026
You often did that yourself, Shinpei.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.903
RYUNOSUKE: <i>What?</i>

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.447
(panting)

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.991
What do you mean you knew?

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.285
(giggling)

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.705
You didn't see the battle on Torajima.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.917
You made it like it never existed,

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:48.546
but Hizuru tried the exact same thing,

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.340
(grunts)

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:56.471
Yeah, I admit, I do love loops!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.434
SHINPEI: <i>The shotgun is two meters away.</i>

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.229
<i>Just three steps,</i>

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.064
<i>but can I reach it?</i>

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.983
<i>A human like me move faster than Shide?</i>

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:09.901
(cracks)

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:11.736
(groans)

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:17.033
Your body is starting to break! Damn it!

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:21.246
MASAHITO: It is nice
to just watch you fall apart.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.291
But before I take the eye from Ushioh,

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.545
I should kill you with my own hands.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.382
That sounds so much more satisfying.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:34.551
(Shinpei grunts)

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:38.221
SHINPEI: Ushioh's eye will never be yours.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.139
Hm...

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.851
-SHINPEI: She'll give it to me.
-(panting)

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:47.480
The fact that I still have mine
proves the ending is decided.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.441
In the end, Ushioh will win!

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:52.902
Ending? Really?

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.364
I just want to live forever.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.241
That's all there is.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.619
MASAHITO: I want to see this world.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.497
The future. The end of man.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.541
The end of everything.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:11.087
That was possible with Heine.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:15.884
Fact is, I lived 326 years and 24 days

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:18.970
by continuing to switch bodies.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.473
<i>However, Heine got weaker.</i>

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:27.896
<i>When I learned</i>
<i>my life would end with Masahito,</i>

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:30.648
<i>I was filled with despair.</i>

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.528
You just can't imagine.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:41.743
But I changed my thinking
a few months ago.

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:48.791
If I can't see the end,
then I should just end the world with me.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:55.298
If the world ended, that means
I could see the ending of this world!

00:11:55.381 --> 00:12:00.386
If I could revive Hiruko's eye
even just temporarily,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.556
I could steal that and erase the world.

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:10.230
I know how to turn off the power
from the game console.

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.316
After all, I'm the final boss, Shinpei.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.527
Even if you know that,
you can't change the ending!

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.074
I'll steal that eye
and overwrite the future.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:24.661
The one who reaches the ending is me!

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.746
(suspenseful music)

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.462
USHIOH: <i>It's done!</i>

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:39.467
<i>The bullet is loaded! Come on, Shinpei!</i>

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:43.388
SHINPEI: <i>Wait for me, Ushioh. Here I come!</i>

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.141
Don't waste your effort, Shinpei!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:53.356
Everything you have done is in vain!

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.317
SHINPEI: <i>It's no use?</i>

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.903
Shinpei, you won't make it.

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:00.655
USHIOH: Move.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:02.490
Come on!

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:05.076
Move! Move!

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.661
Please!

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:11.416
Just a little! Get closer to Shinpei!

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.461
Huh?

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:16.963
He reached it!

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.966
(panting)

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.261
Heine! You're the best!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.598
RYUNOSUKE: <i>Shinpei's right eye</i>
<i>has Shide on sight.</i>

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:32.103
<i>When he steps back,</i>
<i>he syncs with shadow movements.</i>

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.441
<i>Since I've been moving him,</i>
<i>his nervous system is active.</i>

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.569
He just needs to move his body!

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:46.075
<i>You can do it, Shinpei!</i>
<i>You've come this far, you can do it!</i>

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.580
SHINPEI: <i>That's right, Ryunosuke.</i>
<i>Nothing is in vain.</i>

00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.082
<i>Everyone helped get me here.</i>

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.335
<i>Everyone's actions weren't meaningless.</i>

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.129
<i>I won't let that happen.</i>

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.261
MASAHITO: <i>He fell. No... He evaded me!</i>

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.764
SHINPEI:
<i>If it wasn't for everyone's sacrifices...</i>

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:10.349
(gasps)

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.268
...I wouldn't be here now!

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:15.772
It's... It's like Sis said.

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.775
RYUNOSUKE:
The person who's gonna save us...

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.319
It's Shinpei!

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.955
(groaning)

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.126
MASAHITO: That bullet...

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.091
You're too stubborn, Ushioh.

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.176
(snarls)

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.929
This is the end, Shide.

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:52.141
The rest of us will live on.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:54.894
(groans)
Stop...

00:14:55.645 --> 00:15:00.274
SHINPEI: After you disappear,
the world will continue as always.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.778
(growling)

00:15:04.612 --> 00:15:09.909
MASAHITO: <i>If Hiruko gets erased,</i>
<i>my armor will disappear.</i>

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:13.746
<i>I can't move. I can't see.</i>

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:16.207
<i>No!</i>

00:15:16.707 --> 00:15:20.086
<i>No!</i>

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.632
Heine...

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.677
(groans)

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:32.849
This is my ending.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.787
(breathing shakily)

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:56.164
Shinpei...

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.290
(panting)

00:15:58.457 --> 00:15:59.625
USHIOH: You did it.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:05.882
Yeah. Everyone will survive now.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.093
(cooing)

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.105
Ow. Ow. It hurts.

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:23.691
I'll end it, Hiruko.

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.568
(whimpering)

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:28.070
-(static)
-Huh?

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:36.495
(Shinpei gasps)

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.499
Huh?

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.169
(cicadas chirping)

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:45.922
(gasps)

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.507
My body...

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.428
Shinpei, behind you.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:54.639
Uh...

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:10.029
(gasps)
I recognize this...

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.490
(cooing)

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.161
-Huh?
-HEINE: This place...

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.080
-Uh?
-It's the real world.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.498
Huh?

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.877
HEINE: But... 300 years ago.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.504
Three hundred years?

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:30.383
Hiruko connected the exit
of the Everlasting Night with this beach.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.221
Our bodies are far away.
It's just our data here.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.768
SHINPEI: <i>During loops,</i>
<i>I could sometimes see the past.</i>

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:43.271
<i>Is this what's happening now?</i>

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:44.689
(all gasp)

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:46.983
(calm music)

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.276
Oh?

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:51.404
That kid.

00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.699
It's me. The real me.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:01.038
I see. Ushioh, erase Hiruko now.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.749
RYUNOSUKE: That whale is Hiruko
in the past.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:08.421
It wants to move its data back
and starts everything all over again.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:15.553
Wait! Stay away from the whale!
You'll be killed!

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.222
(gasps)
I can't touch her.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.643
(gasps)
Huh?

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:27.148
Don't approach the god.
You should go get a grown-up.

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.400
(whimpering)

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.069
(screaming)

00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:33.738
PAST HEINE: It's a ghost!

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.115
I guess I scared her off.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:38.451
(gasps)
You touched the past.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:44.040
The awakened power in that eye managed
to change the past.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:48.711
(whimpering)

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.422
USHIOH: Oh, okay.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:53.633
Please take her.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.927
Huh? Ushioh? What are you doing?

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.520
USHIOH: As long as this one
drifts ashore here,

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.608
the same thing will happen
even if I erase her.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.488
-I need to erase this Hiruko.
-(static)

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.697
(Shinpei gasps)

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.449
USHIOH: She didn't want to redo it.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:20.910
She wanted to end it.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.662
That's why she called me here.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:26.123
(sobbing)
Thank you.

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.167
(uplifting music)

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.631
USHIOH: Good night. Bye-bye.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:34.965
(trilling)

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:45.518
-Thank you.
-(static)

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:52.692
Mm. Thank you, Ushioh. Thank you, Shinpei.

00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:53.776
Heine.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.695
Um, Ryunosuke.

00:19:56.696 --> 00:20:01.409
If I get reborn, can we be friends?

00:20:03.077 --> 00:20:07.498
Yeah! Of course!
I'll bring lots of snacks!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.168
-I'm sure Sis would do that too.
-(giggling)

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.424
(uplifting music)

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:38.696
Ushioh.

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:43.868
Well, then, I guess
this is goodbye, Shinpei.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.620
Uh... Hold on!

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:50.499
SHINPEI: I'll come with you.
We can be together.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.713
With Hiruko gone, shadows will disappear.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:59.175
Even my right eye
will revert back to normal.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.928
I'll die once I return to my body.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:08.976
I would rather just disappear
along with you.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.605
Dummy.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.942
USHIOH: You're giving me second thoughts.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.822
But you need to go back!

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.284
Everyone's waiting. Don't worry.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.746
I'll send you back to 2018.

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:30.998
(sobs)

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.128
USHIOH: These three days
were really scary and stressful.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.926
But more than that,
I was happy to spend time with you!

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:48.766
Well? How about you?

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:52.937
(sobs)

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.608
I.. I was, too!
Seeing you again made me really...

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.824
(waves crashing)

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:08.410
(sobbing)

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:12.248
...really happy, Ushioh.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.712
(closing theme music)

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:23.634
USHIOH: <i>The power to cross time.</i>
<i>I finally figured it out.</i>

00:22:24.802 --> 00:22:26.846
<i>This wasn't a coincidence.</i>

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:31.809
<i>That strong desire to see someone again</i>
<i>linked Heine and me.</i>

00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:37.982
<i>With the power given to me,</i>
<i>I'll jump back and rewrite that summer.</i>

00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:42.194
<i>I need to hurry!</i>
<i>Before this body disappears!</i>

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:59.545
RECORDING

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.640
Make sure you find me. Promise me, okay?

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.018
USHIOH: Take good care of Mio.

00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.439
All right. I have to go.

00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:04.443
Come to this ending.

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.199
<i>Everyone's waiting for you at the end.</i>

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:14.620
I am waiting for you!

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:21.460
SHINPEI: Ushio!

00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:25.089
Uh...

00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:27.841
(Shinpei mumbles)
