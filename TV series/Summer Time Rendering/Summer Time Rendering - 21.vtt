WEBVTT

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:03.795
(raindrops pattering)

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.380
(thunder rumbles)

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.928
You'll catch a cold.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:17.643
The body is in the morgue.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.353
Did you contact her parents?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.270
SHINPEI: Not yet.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.439
DR. HISHIGATA: Mm.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:26.902
She was a famous author,
the press is going to flood this island.

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:29.988
And I can't hide the stab wound.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:31.782
You don't have to.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.869
Because she was murdered,
and we know who killed her.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.791
SHINPEI: But...
Please just give me one more day.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:43.418
-Okay. Fine.
-Thank you so much.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:44.378
Ah...

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:49.007
I'm sorry, you were saying?
Hard to focus with all that's happened.

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:49.925
(Dr. Hishigata sighs)

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.471
Oh, also, it's what you said
about there being two Shides.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:59.351
He lived for over 300 years
by transferring bodies.

00:00:59.935 --> 00:01:03.146
I wouldn't be surprised
if he had spares for emergencies.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.399
So, Heine gave birth to multiple Shides?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.318
DR. HISHIGATA: <i>No, that's not it.</i>

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:14.199
Shide preserved his past bodies,
but they all burned during the war.

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:16.493
My father once told me that
a long time ago.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:17.786
So, Iwao.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.831
SHINPEI: <i>Does that body</i>
<i>in the photo still exist?</i>

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:26.044
Iwao Karikiri died 40 years ago,
after the war.

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:27.462
It's a mystery.

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:31.675
We don't know how he preserves
or mobilizes the body.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.844
A second account?
(Shinpei gasps)

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.346
-Please cover your ears.
-What's that?

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.432
(lightning crackles)

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.978
It struck the ocean, didn't it?

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.023
How did... How did you know?

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.984
(thunder rumbles)

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.363
(theme music)

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:24.121
That's what you think now, Sou.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:27.833
NEZU: But it would have probably taken
a long time to find shadows

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:28.959
if we were together.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.045
We probably wouldn't have been able
to save those three kids.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.757
Hizuru also died in order
to save you and Mio,

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.093
and Shinpei made that choice.

00:03:38.844 --> 00:03:41.263
He said it was all his responsibility.

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:46.309
SOU: He always tries
to carry all the weight.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.647
(Sou grunts)
It's not just his fault!

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:53.942
I just want...

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.278
(sobbing)

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.488
I just wanna help him.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:06.288
SHINPEI: <i>We've lost Ushioh,</i>
<i>Ms. Nagumo, and Rose.</i>

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:11.126
<i>Now, we don't have Nezu's rifle,</i>
<i>Ushioh's shotgun copy,</i>

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.003
<i>or Totsumura's gun.</i>

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.174
But Shide's still alive.
What should we do?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.509
Can we still beat him without Ushioh?

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:20.719
Actually, about that.

00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:25.140
Your pocket, what's in your pocket?

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.184
Oh, this?

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.728
SHINPEI: It won't respond to me.

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.106
It's probably a fragment of Ushioh.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:39.696
I knew it.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.200
MIOH: <i>It's why Heine escaped.</i>

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.159
Huh?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:49.039
MIOH: <i>It does respond, Shin-chan.</i>
<i>We shadows can sense it.</i>

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.541
<i>Sis was super mad.</i>

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.876
When?

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.837
When Shide threw a knife at you,
do you remember?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.964
MIOH: She's in here.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:02.260
All her memories, they're all in here.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.723
I think she transferred her memories
into it before disappearing.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.185
MIOH: But she has no body.
This thing can't move around.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:14.940
Really? That's explains
why Heine thought Ushioh was still alive.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:18.527
She's just memories now,
but she protected you.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.779
Her memories. Did you scan them?

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.449
No, they're made, so no one can read them,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.618
just like Mother's.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.664
Maybe it's 'cause she didn't want
the enemy to access it.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.834
So only Sis can read that data.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:35.836
(gasps)

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.840
Except, she's already...

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.227
(waves crashing)

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:54.479
She'll be back.

00:05:54.563 --> 00:05:55.605
(chimes)

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:56.815
Huh?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.275
Yeah, that's right!

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.945
Tomorrow, during the fireworks,
on that beach!

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.656
SHINPEI: <i>The version of her</i>
<i>that doesn't know anything</i>

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.157
<i>will show up on that beach!</i>

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.743
(fireworks popping)

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:12.789
MIOH: I see.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.751
We can get her
to scan this shell tomorrow.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.714
SHINPEI: Yes, it'll work.
That's why she left this with me.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:22.674
Ushioh...

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.012
will be reborn!

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:32.642
SOU: Ushio?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.435
(Sou sighs)

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:38.148
We'd been pseudo-looping
with your memories.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.945
So that means, Mio saw that scene.

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.988
(gasps)

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:46.489
(sighs)

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.699
-Sou.
-Whoa!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.409
Oh, Mio.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:51.036
Do you know where Shin-chan is?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:52.704
Uh, no. No.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.664
-Okay. Hm?
-Wait! Wait!

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.625
What is it?

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:58.460
(sighs)

00:06:59.002 --> 00:06:59.878
I, uh...

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.715
-I'm still in love with--
-I'm shadow Mio.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:04.799
(muffled grunting)

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:09.137
You really won't give up.
You already know my answer.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.599
So, you won't change your mind?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:14.768
Mm.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.354
SOU: I see.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.691
You like Shinpei, don't you?

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.152
Ah! Why... Why do you say that?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.863
It's obvious. You're not the shadow.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.406
(Mio whines)

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.451
Still won't change your mind?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.828
Hmm...

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.916
Are we still friends?

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:41.169
Mm-hm.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:42.879
That won't change?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.840
Mm-hm.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.635
SOU: I see. Good.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.263
Shinpei said he was going to the roof.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:56.893
Shin-chan.

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.104
Huh?

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.522
MIO: What are you doing?

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.981
SHINPEI: Just practicing.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:06.277
MIO: Do you remember what I said
when you left this morning?

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.655
SHINPEI: You wanted to tell me something.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:11.866
MIO: Will she really come back tomorrow?

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.412
It's hard to believe Ushioh
would store her data in that shell

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.329
for no reason.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.165
There's a good chance
she may have scanned Shide

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.000
before she disappeared.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.713
Well, it looks like you've come up
with another good strategy.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.298
We'll see. I'll tell everyone later.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.467
Was that... What you wanted to discuss?

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:32.721
Huh? Uh, yeah, well...

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:41.646
I like you.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.734
Really.
(gasps)

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.571
I am in love you.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:51.823
SHINPEI: Oh.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:53.992
Okay.

00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:56.369
Is that it?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.456
No. Thanks.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.417
(gasps)
Did you know already?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.003
Mm-hm.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.174
Oh, well, don't be weird about it
or anything, okay?

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.176
I just wanted to get it out there.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.970
We might die tomorrow, you know?

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:19.642
And I didn't want to go
without telling you how I really felt.

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:23.605
I just wanted to get it off my chest.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.857
I see.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.942
(soft music)

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.319
Mm.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.699
SHINPEI: I'm sorry, Mio.

00:09:37.869 --> 00:09:40.413
I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same way.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.749
It's Ushio that I'm in love with.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.460
(Mio whimpers)

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.880
You'll always be
my precious little sister.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.424
Mm.

00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:55.220
Thanks for being honest.

00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:59.557
Ah! I feel so relieved!

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.393
(breathing deeply)

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.355
Now I can die without any regrets.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.360
(Mio crying)

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.278
Don't cry, don't cry.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.323
You were brave, Mio. I'm so proud of you.

00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:18.034
If it were me,
I'd be too scared to say anything.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.662
(Mio sobs)
Tokiko...

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:21.996
It's okay.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.833
But you know,
Sis might come back tomorrow,

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:27.001
but she's still a shadow.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:32.382
She'll disappear once we destroy Heine.
Can't Shinpei get with you then?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.925
I can't hope for that!

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.636
Shin-chan doesn't just change
his mind like that!

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.348
I need to focus! Tomorrow's the big day!

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:46.771
No matter what happens,
tomorrow, July 24th, is the last day.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.940
CAUTION: GASOLINE SPILLAGE

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:59.826
SHINPEI: <i>Shide said I had the power</i>
<i>to observe parallel worlds.</i>

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.536
NEZU: Parallel worlds?

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:05.582
There's a theory that when a time traveler
goes back in time changing the future,

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.377
the timeline changes and splits off
giving birth to a world parallel

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.212
to the time traveler's original world.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:15.258
So there's a world where Mio and I die,
and another where we live?

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.176
Exactly.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:22.098
TOKIKO: So when Shinpei dies,
the world gets copied,

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:26.394
and only his consciousness
is able to move to one of them.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.106
Then the past world will be gone, right?

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:36.571
Okay, I get that, but what about Ushioh?
How do you know she'll appear?

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.697
Right.

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:45.163
SHINPEI: I met Ushioh in the third loop,
and she somehow latched on to me.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.710
She came to the fourth-loop world
with both consciousness and body.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:52.754
NEZU: That's right.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:56.799
So, the fourth loop world
probably had its own Ushioh,

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.344
which means two Ushiohs existed
at this point.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.803
Exactly.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:06.309
Right now, at this time,
Ushioh is floating in the sea.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.479
SHINPEI: <i>She's recovering from the damage</i>
<i>from trying to save Shiori.</i>

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.023
<i>If she were like Heine or me,</i>

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.777
<i>her consciousness would transfer</i>
<i>to her body in the sea</i>

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.111
<i>during a loop.</i>

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:22.742
<i>So two Ushiohs exist right now,</i>
<i>the ninth-loop Ushioh in the sea,</i>

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.454
and the third-loop Ushioh
who traveled with me.

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:29.749
I bet Shide and Heine already know this.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.671
<i>Ushioh read this in Shide's mind,</i>
<i>so she thought of a way to revive herself.</i>

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.383
That's exactly the reason
why she left her memories,

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.843
hoping we could figure it all out.

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:45.306
Wait, wait, these are all just theories.
It's all wishful thinking.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.894
Well, this is the first 24th
since we started looping with Ushioh.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.729
It's possible. We can't know for sure.

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:53.064
NEZU: Hmm...

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.775
Yeah, but I think Ushioh probably knew.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.986
How can you be so sure?

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:02.115
It was wishful thinking before,
but right now, I'm sure of it.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:04.742
SHINPEI: Watch.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.163
(rattles)

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.081
(both gasp)

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.124
It's moving.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:14.669
It's very slight, but no matter
where I put it, it tries to move south.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.296
Since when did it...

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.007
The movement was strongest
at three o'clock this morning,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.883
but it's gotten much weaker now.

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.844
Oh? The tides!

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:26.764
SOU: <i>So right now,</i>
<i>she's neither in Osaka Bay nor Setonaikai.</i>

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.808
<i>Ushioh must be in the Kii Channel.</i>

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.478
Yeah. This shell is reacting to her.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.814
So she was close by earlier.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:38.026
Low tide and high tide occur twice a day.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.863
NEZU: The second high tide
is around six in the evening.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.199
<i>That's when she'll drift closer</i>
<i>to this island again.</i>

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:51.164
One is already a threat to Shide,
now there may be two Ushiohs.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.082
Something is really bothering me.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:56.836
I think that Shide will come at us
with everything he's got.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:00.298
But they don't know Ushioh's
exact location or if she'll appear.

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.383
Heine said that Ushioh was defective,

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.761
and she couldn't sense
her presence anymore.

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.846
SHINPEI: But we know where she is.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.015
That is how we beat them.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.978
SHINPEI: <i>If we miss this chance,</i>
<i>we'll lose her forever.</i>

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.022
Let's go get her.

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:16.939
Mm-hm.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.150
I see a glimmer of hope now.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:20.860
(groans)

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.571
Okay, everyone. Let's get moving.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.239
SHINPEI: <i>We can do this.</i>

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.911
MASAHITO (on speaker): <i>This</i> mikoshi <i>shrine</i>
<i>will be carried to Omotohama.</i>

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.414
<i>Load any collected garbage on it.</i>

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:37.919
It may be garbage,
but it's still divine, right?

00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.755
So we need to bring it
right back over here.

00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:41.964
BOY: Look, it's whale!

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.174
-GIRL: A whale!
-MASAHITO: You can walk along

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:45.927
this <i>mikoshi</i> then enjoy the Oumiokuri.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.305
Hiruko will bring you good health.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:52.558
And at night, we can enjoy the fireworks.

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:56.354
Longevity to all of us, you and me!

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.980
-(crowd murmuring)
-(applause)

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.775
NEZU: It's quiet.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.445
Yeah. It's been like that for a while,
which means Shinpei's plan

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.280
is probably be working, right?

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.365
Mm.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.494
I didn't think we'd get
to talk again, Ryunosuke.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.706
My sister was extremely grateful
to you, Nezu.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.916
NEZU: Huh?

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.043
SHINPEI: <i>You saved her 14 years ago.</i>

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:25.258
Ah, Hizuru wrote to me sometimes.

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:29.220
I was shocked when she said
her novel became a movie, you know?

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:30.221
(laughs)

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:33.057
I had no idea
that she was a published author.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.601
You were really the only person
who knew that.

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.437
Why was that? Was she shy?

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.064
That's not it at all.

00:15:40.148 --> 00:15:43.067
Actually, you were the only adult
who believed in her stories

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:44.610
-about the shadows.
-Ah.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:46.946
People thought I was crazy 'cause of that.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.117
Oh, well, I guess
I'm used to that, though. Hm?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.580
We trust you, Nezu. My sister and me.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.373
(breathes sharply)
Mm.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.251
Ryunoske, you don't need to say that.

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:01.210
(rattles)

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.171
It's time.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.925
A festival without Ushio feels so somber.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:11.095
She was always the one
to lead the <i>mikoshi.</i>

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.890
I'll carry it for the both of us.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:17.018
MASAHITO:
Stay until the end this year, Alain.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:22.231
You know I'd love to,
but I have to prep for tomorrow.

00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:23.357
Tomorrow?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.318
Is something wrong?

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:30.114
Nothing. I just had not planned
for tomorrow.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.494
In your search of the Kii Channel,
did you happen to notice

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.496
any strays ignoring my signal?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.332
MASAHITO: Why do you ask?

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.419
SHADOW SHINPEI: It's been two hours
since I lost Shinpei's location.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.129
What do you think this means?

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.340
Do you think he erased the mark?

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:50.343
No. The handprint can't be erased.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.804
I specifically made sure I burned it
onto his very existence.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.641
SHADOW SHINPEI:
He can block his presence, however.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.518
Just like you in the mud.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.272
That Shinpei, I guess I gave him
way too many ideas.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:06.859
MASAHITO: <i>Most strays</i>
<i>were sent to find Ushioh.</i>

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.237
<i>If Hiruko's grotto is invaded now...</i>

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.697
No. That won't happen yet.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:13.407
SHADOW SHINPEI:
<i>They came to my burrow once,</i>

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:15.284
<i>and nearly got destroyed.</i>

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.453
<i>They won't do it again,</i>

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.998
unless they're sure.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.793
MASAHITO: Then why hide?

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.504
SHADOW SHINPEI: Here is my theory.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.924
It's the version of Ushioh
he has with him.

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:33.261
It can sense Ushioh's location
in the Kii Channel.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.889
He's hiding his own location,

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.850
so he can get to Ushioh first
without revealing exactly

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:41.894
where she is to us, 'cause if it were me,

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.646
I would do the same thing.

00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:50.278
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>Find the original Ushioh</i>
<i>before they do and get rid of her.</i>

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:52.363
(thrilling music)

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:56.576
MASAHITO (chanting): <i>♪ Oh, be fruitful ♪</i>

00:17:56.659 --> 00:18:00.204

MASAHITO (chanting): <i>♪ Cast away</i>
<i>the disaster, famine, and destruction ♪</i>

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.769
-<i>♪ Cast away, purify, light the way... ♪</i>
-Step back! Step back!

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:28.899
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>Shide, the forest</i>
<i>is the best place to hide a leaf.</i>

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:30.860
(gasps)

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.864
<i>Shinpei will be hiding among the strays.</i>

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.826
<i>I told the strays to gather by your side.</i>

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:43.372
<i>Look around. Find the stray separated</i>
<i>from the flock, you find Shinpei.</i>

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:44.332
SHIDE: Oh?

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:46.083
I found you.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:49.420
MASAHITO: <i>One stray is drifting away</i>
<i>into the sea.</i>

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:56.302
She's close. Real close.
I'm getting a stronger response.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.303
(grunts)

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.475
SHINPEI: <i>He found me.</i>

00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:03.893
<i>Hurry, Gil.</i>

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:04.935
(shrieks)

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:08.648
(suspenseful music)

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:12.568
<i>There.</i>

00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:19.033
<i>I found her!</i>

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:25.623
I'm coming for you, Ushioh!

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.546
(static)

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:37.385
USHIOH: <i>It's so dark. I can't see a thing.</i>

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.388
<i>Where am I?</i>

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.849
<i>What was I doing?</i>

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:46.352
(gasps)

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:49.146
<i>Shinpei?</i>

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.986
MIO: You really won't go to say goodbye?

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.571
Shin-chan is leaving soon.

00:19:57.655 --> 00:19:58.948
So? Let him!

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:01.659
I don't care. He can go wherever.

00:20:02.493 --> 00:20:03.703

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:07.289

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:14.839
SHINPEI: <i>Ushioh!</i>

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.345
USHIOH: <i>Huh? Who's that?</i>

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.684
<i>Is someone calling me?</i>

00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:29.103
-Ushioh!
-(gasps)

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.563
Shinpei?

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:36.152
Whoa! What is that?
(screaming)

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.905
(suspenseful music)

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:52.501
Whoa! A baby? What are you?
Where'd you come from?

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.087
-I got you.
-(gasps)

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:59.467
What are you doing here?
Shinpei? You came back?

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:01.635
Yeah, I did.

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:06.515
Huh?

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.353
I came back... to get you.

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:13.355
What?

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.441
(action music)

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.818

-(squelches)
-Huh?

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:39.256
I remember now. I knew you'd come through!

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:42.009
Yeah. You're back.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.469
USHIOH: Yep.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.892
Ushioh! Don't let them get us!

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:53.354
Don't worry! It's a piece of cake!

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:57.608
I'm back and better than ever!

00:21:57.691 --> 00:21:58.859
(Ushioh laughs)

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.821
