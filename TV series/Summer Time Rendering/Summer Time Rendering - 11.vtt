WEBVTT

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.297
It's really starting
to come down out here.

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:08.133
NEZU: Looks like the forecast
was a little off.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:13.472
Forecasts and predictions,
warnings, expectations, plans, prophecies.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.392
There is nothing that tries to guess
the events of the future that's reliable.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.728
You sure it's under here?

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:22.689
HIZURU: Yep. And I've got
a bad feeling about it.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.901
Let's hope that's just as unreliable.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:28.111
(thunder rumbles)

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.613
-(Sou panting)
-Keep running!

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.031
Don't stop!

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.116
(thrilling music)

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.911
-(screeching)
-(Sou grunts)

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.287
Damn it.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.498
(panting)

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.791
(grunts)

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.303
Looks like they're only
going after Ushioh.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.807
SHINPEI: They're ignoring me,
they aren't attacking me at all.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.309
(gasps)

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.145
Ushioh!

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.522
(whimpering)

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.440
Does your arm hurt?

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.279
SHINPEI: <i>Crap, we can't go any further.</i>

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:14.241
Get out of here! Get back!

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:15.200
Sou!

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.660
(screeching)

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.746
Whoa, nice! Is this why
you brought the pesticide?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.873
Oh, yeah! Just like I thought.

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:26.336
They're afraid of fire, it scatters them.
Are you okay, Ushioh?

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.255
We can still go back if you want.

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.257
USHIOH: Forget that, I'm fine.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.428
Let's just keep going. I've never been
one to leave things unfinished!

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:35.887
That's what I thought.

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:40.475
Shinpei! I'll open up a path for you.
Just take care of Ushioh.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:42.811
You got it. Here we go!

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.313
(water sloshing)

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:54.614
Whoa, Ryunosuke! Will you warn me
next time you're 'bout to shoot!

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:56.033
Right in my damn ear!

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.619
Sorry about that. But another second,
and you would be dead.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:00.954
(groans)

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:04.791
NEZU: Can't believe all these shadows
are just lurking around down here,

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.335
under the island.

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.296
Right, we need to be careful.
There are more of them.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.881
Their nest is close.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.966
(theme music)

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:46.059
FEMALE VOICE: <i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is disconnected</i>

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:47.644
<i>-or out of your coverage area.</i>
-Uh... Huh?

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:48.562
<i>Please hang up...</i>

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:49.479
#11 FEEDING TIME

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:50.856
MIO: <i>Where is Shin-chan?</i>

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.525
<i>Last time I saw him,</i>
<i>he went out to see Sou.</i>

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.820
<i>And now I can't reach Sou,</i>
<i>or Tokiko, either.</i>

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.533
Shin-chan. Just please come home soon.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:07.414
MIO: <i>The shadow sickness took</i>
<i>my big sister, just like it took Shiori.</i>

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:09.332
<i>It can't happen to Shin-chan, too.</i>

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:12.878
Huh?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.338
Hmm?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.892
Isn't this one of Shiori's hair ties?

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.644
-SHADOW SHIORI: Over here.
-MIO: Huh?

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.355
SHADOW SHIORI:
Shinpei's down here. Come on.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.108
Huh? Wait! Hang on!

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.068
(whimpers)

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.822
Hey, watch out! Mi... Mio that you?

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:42.949
Oh, Tetsu, hi. So sorry about that.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.245
You can't just jump out like that.
What's going on? You look pale.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:51.291
I... It was Shiori, I swear.
Didn't you see her? She was right there.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.545
What? So you found her?
Where is she? Huh, where?

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.590
She ran away in the direction
you came from.

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.677
What, no way, all I saw
was you running right toward me.

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:03.637
(Mio gasps)

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.097
(ominous music)

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:14.815
That's Shiori!

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.107
Huh!?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.443
(Mio gasps)

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.904
She... disappeared.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:23.448
Hey wait up.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.495
-TETSU: That's weird. The lid is loose.
-(gasps)

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.581
SHADOW SHIORI:
Shinpei's down here. Come on.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:35.293
MIO: <i>What does that mean?</i>
<i>Is Shin-chan really down there?</i>

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:36.920
BOTH: Hmm...

00:05:37.254 --> 00:05:38.380
Um...

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:43.385
Hm? No! Not a chance!
No, no, no! No way she's down there.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.720
There's no way a little girl
would open this up

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.347
and climb down on her own.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.099
Normally, I'd say you're right.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.143
MIO: <i>But what if it was Shiori's shadow?</i>

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:54.521
-Tetsu...
-TETSU: Hell, no.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.439
MIO: But I haven't even said anything yet!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.233
I know what you're thinking.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.570
You want me to go down there,
that's it, isn't it?

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.905
Well, you can forget it, I'm a busy man.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.074
I was just on my way
to the city for drinks.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.535
I don't wanna smell
like a sewer for Erika.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.871
You'd rather go to a bar
than save someone?

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:14.332
TETSU: Ugh, no, but does it have
to be this person?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.501
-MIO: You'd be a hero, though.
-TETSU: Huh?

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:19.796
MIO: If you found the missing girl,
you'd be all over the news.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.925
Everyone would know your name.
You'd become famous overnight.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.553
Erika would totally fall in love with you.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.889
But that's up to you, I guess.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:32.142
I'm going in there with you
or without you, okay?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.602
-I'll go first, follow me.
-(gasps)

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.273
Look, I'm not doing this to be
a hero and get girls, don't get me wrong.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.026
I'm a humble public servant
in pursuit of justice.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.986
And I won't rest until we find Shiori.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.447
Mm. Great, glad you're on board.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.033
MIO: I guess being superficial
beats doing nothing.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.910
TETSU:
Hey, that's a little harsh, Mio-chan.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.996
(all panting)

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.671
SHINPEI: Do you think we lost them?

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.216
Yeah, but what...
what the hell is this place?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.761
It looks even weirder than where we were.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:11.264
Yeah, look at this. That's so strange.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.182
Huh?

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.643
SHINPEI: There's coral down here.

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.937
What's that much coral
doing so far from the water?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.356
They're shadows.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.273
Wait, what?

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:25.111
The coral reefs, the sea anemone,
the barnacles, they're all shadows.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.073
(gasps)
Who would do something like this?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:32.202
I don't know, but someone decided
to copy the ocean here.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:40.126
It's saltwater. This must be connected
to the ocean somehow.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.421
Shinpei, we need to start looking
for another way out.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.883
This is getting too dangerous. Shinpei?

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.802
Look, I'm out of gas, too.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:52.138
-(Ushioh breathing heavily)
-If we get attacked again, it's over.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.473
-(gasps)
-(stomach rumbling)

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.808
(Ushioh groaning)

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.643
Hey... Hey, Ushioh?

00:07:56.768 --> 00:08:00.522
I... I'm okay.
I think I'm just hungry, actually.

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.859
What? Are you serious right now?
Didn't we just eat like an hour ago?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.571
That's not the hunger she means.
She struggling with something else.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:12.033
SHINPEI: It's your right arm.
It isn't healed, is it?

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.203
USHIOH: <i>This is damage from my real body.</i>

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:19.457
And I need to eat
if it's ever going to fully heal.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.252
SOU: Then Shinpei can just give you
another rice ball.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.088
No, that's not...
I don't mean normal food.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:29.551
In order to repair this,
I'd have to rescan the original first.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:32.387
But Ushio's body was cremated.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.265
I'll never be able
to fully recover from this.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.476
SOU: Are... Are you serious?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.772
SHINPEI: So you've been dealing
with this pain in your arm the whole time?

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.482
Ever since Mioh stabbed you?

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.444
I guess I wasn't sure. Till now.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.530
Why didn't you tell us? This is important!

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:54.242
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll just erase
my right arm for now.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.119
I think that'll stop the pain.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.538
SHINPEI:
<i>Is there really no way to heal it?</i>

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.081
<i>That can't be right.</i>

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:05.628
<i>She's getting weaker.</i>
<i>Damn it, I just can't let her die again.</i>

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:10.091
<i>What if I loop back?</i>
<i>But how would that heal the wound?</i>

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.760
<i>Would that work?</i>

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.803
-WOMAN: Stay right there.
-(gasps)

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.889
TOKIKO: Now, turn around slowly.

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.850
If you turn away
or make any sudden movements,

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.394
Ushioh won't make it out of here alive.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.814
What... Uh... What the hell
are you doing here?

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:27.734
SOU: Tokiko!

00:09:30.195 --> 00:09:31.321
HIZURU: It's a dead end.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:35.825
Looks like shadows went through here.
Only they could get through this way.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.286
Well, now we know one thing.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.289
Shadows have been using
these sewers and tunnels

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.083
to make their way around the island.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.419
Mm. No doubt about that at this point.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:49.339
The army dug a lot
of these tunnels in this area.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.717
So many that no one knows
the entire layout anymore.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:56.262
God only knows how many
of these passages there are down here.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.223
So what do we do now?

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.976
We don't have any way
to cut these bars, do we?

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.854
Should we go back up
and find another way in?

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:08.817
HIZURU: Based on the map,
we're right in the center of the island.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.987
No. There probably isn't
a single entrance a human can use.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.448
This place wasn't made with us in mind.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:20.286
NEZU: I mean, just look.
This isn't a sewer. It's a natural cave.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.707
I'm sure it was always here.
It can't be man-made.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:28.336
Guess it seems
like Hiruko's grotto really existed.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.379
Huh?

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.298
My gramps first told me about it
when I was a kid.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:36.553
NEZU: He said there was this
massive underground cave in Hitogashima.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.513
They call it Hiruko's grotto.

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.307
Up until the middle of the Meiji era,

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:45.603
there was a single entrance to the grotto
that only appeared during low tide,

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.398
but the army blocked it off
as a defensive measure,

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.484
sometime during
the First Sino-Japanese War.

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.653
Hiruko's grotto is an island legend.

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.114
Until now, I thought it was just a myth.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:11:00.535
But they say,
it's where our guardian god Hiruko lived

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:04.455
after his parents pushed him out to sea
and he drifted to Hitogashima.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:09.085
We should talk to my sister.
She knows all about Hiruko's Lore.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.336
Should we switch?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.881
No, not right now. That's all right.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.092
NEZU: We can always ask
that Karikiri boy first.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.720
I just wish his old man was still alive.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.805
He might've known something.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.684
Anyway, let's start heading back now,
grab the tools and...

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.394
Wait. Be quiet.

00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:30.231
Come on! Why don't we just go back?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.734
There's no way in hell
she'll be down here.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:36.946
Come on, you know it was Shiori up there.
Don't pretend you didn't see her.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.325
Ugh, god, but now I smell
like some kinda sewer rat.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:43.161
Ugh, I'm gonna have to take a bath
before I go out.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.164
Don't worry,
I'll fill Erika in on the whole thing.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.374
I'll tell her how manly
and brave you were.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.585
Wait, really? You will?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.879
-BOTH: Uh...
-MIO: It's Shiori!

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.256
(sighs)
Wait a sec. What the...

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.092
How did she get
on the other side like that?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.260
(zapping)

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.390
(groans, gasps)

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:07.977
Nah-nah!

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.730
Whoa. Wait, stop!

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:13.858
What is this?
Are we dreaming or something?

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.402
-Hm!
-Wait, you're going?

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:20.907
TETSU: Mio, wait. Hold on. I...
My new loafers are really expensive!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.617
Hey, I think that was...

00:12:22.784 --> 00:12:25.870
Mio Kofune and that cop,
Officer Tetsu Totsumura.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.832
My sister might've been right
about that feeling she had.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.879
I wouldn't follow them. It's a trap.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.757
Yeah, you're right.
At least we know that Mio's human.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.217
She's immune.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.929
(scoffs)
Who knows? I guess we'll find out.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.722
NEZU: <i>Won't be long now.</i>

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:47.850
Tokiko.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.813
I'm surprised you made it this far,
trespassing like this, brother.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.441
What is this? What...
What's going on? Tokiko!

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.279
SHINPEI: <i>She's too far.</i>
<i>The nailgun won't reach her.</i>

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.448
SOU: What the hell
are you doing down here, Tokiko?

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.368
-TOKIKO: Dumb question.
-What do you mean?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.912
TOKIKO: I'm recovering damaged goods.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:11.332
And you brought Ushioh right to me.
Thanks for that.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.962
Now that she's hurt like that,
she's been tough to find.

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:20.300
SHINPEI: <i>She's getting closer and closer.</i>
<i>Three more steps and I got her.</i>

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.219
Don't worry,
we'll take care of her from here.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:26.389
SHINPEI: <i>I won't let you touch Ushioh!</i>
<i>Get away from her!</i>

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.604
<i>Come on. Just stay put.</i>

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.402
(giggling)

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.361
(gasps)

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.321
Oh, my god! Do you see this, Shinpei?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.282
USHIOH: Tokiko...

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:48.244
That's just too bad. Huh, Shinpei?

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.162
(gasps)

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:51.539
Turns out I'm human.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.460
You can kill shadows,
but not other humans, right?

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.130
Are you... Are you really Tokiko?

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:05.428
How about we chat for a little bit?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.392
Sorry for the delay. Apologies, Negoro.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.103
SHADOW NEGORO: How may I help, doctor?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.231
DR. HISHIGATA: You can go ahead
and add this to today's feed.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.736
It's almost nine o'clock.
Just hurry up and take it over there.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:25.364
SHADOW NEGORO: Yes, doctor. I understand.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.783
Hmm...

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.622
(grunting)

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.794
(breathing sharply)

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.797
SHINPEI: We surrender.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.799
Wait, no, Shinpei!

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:43.883
USHIOH: Sou!

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:45.718
Listen, Shinpei's right, okay?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:49.597
It sucks, I know,
but we just can't win this time.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.101
Now, don't do anything stupid,
okay, brother?

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:55.353
-(grunts)
-Go grab her.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:57.605
(grunting)

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:02.276
Ushioh! Damn it! Stop it, Tokiko!

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.945
Sou. Calm down.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:04.862
Huh?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:07.448
If she wanted to kill her,
she'd already be dead.

00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:12.036
She just wants to take Ushioh with her.
Am I right, Tokiko?

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.040
SHINPEI: <i>I haven't figured this out.</i>
<i>Not yet, anyway.</i>

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:22.547
<i>If I can take her silence as a "yes,"</i>
<i>then I think we still have a chance.</i>

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.423
<i>-I'm sorry, Ushioh.</i>
-(groaning)

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:28.010
<i>You just gotta hang in there</i>
<i>a little longer.</i>

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.347
What're you doing? Taking her to your dad?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:36.310
Oh! I get it, Tokiko.
Is Dad making you do all this?

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.021
TOKIKO: You're so clueless, big brother.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.190
That was inevitable.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.110
Dad didn't choose you, after all.
Sorry about that.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:45.695
What?
(mutters)

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:50.408
If you've already seen this much,
there's no point in hiding it anymore.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:53.244
TOKIKO: Guess this is a chance
to show you everything.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.245
(gasps)

00:15:57.039 --> 00:16:00.126
For starters,
please put all your weapons down.

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:02.086
I'll show you if you cooperate.

00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.214
TOKIKO: I don't want to have
to do anything drastic.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.925
Don't put up a fight,
just come along with me.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:11.137
Hiruko is waiting for all of us.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.353
Five degrees to the right.
You're gonna miss. To your right.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.271
Put a sock in it!

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.815
-(yelling)
-Don't worry about me.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:23.774
Okay, forget it.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.610
Just focus on your own targets, will ya?

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.822
Well, we definitely lost track of Mio.
Think she's okay?

00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:33.117
NEZU: Now's not the time
to be worried about other people.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.912
Just look around.
What the hell is this place?

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.915
Looks like the bottom of the sea.

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:43.085
I think that's a Doflein sea anemone.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:45.755
Dofle... What was it?

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.134
They live deep underwater.
I saw one on some nature show once.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:55.056
They're not adapted to survive on land.
I guess these are all shadows.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.599
-NEZU: Mm. Whoa!
-HIZURU: Look out!

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.310
Got a bad feeling about this.

00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.728
(pants)

00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:05.608
NEZU: For god's sake. Haven't you killed
that thing twice already?

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:06.859
Why's it still here?

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.320
Will it ever die?

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:12.281
And you? Are you not surprised at all?

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.619
Sorry to disappoint, but it makes sense
that you didn't really die.

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.038
HIZURU: <i>You must've just decided</i>
<i>to play dead,</i>

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:22.208
<i>and then dove underground, is that right?</i>

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.211
<i>My sister was suspicious of the sewers.</i>

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:29.966
I'd expect that from Hizuru.
Did you come back just to get in my way?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.677
I told you I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:37.723
I guess you wouldn't know,
would you, Ryunosuke Minakata?

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:39.684
-NEZU: Wait a minute.
-No.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.185
NEZU: How do you know that name?

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.647
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>Remember that one time</i>
<i>when we talked in the kid's room?</i>

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.733
<i>Well, I figured that you</i>
<i>just hid inside Hizuru.</i>

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:50.695
No way. Heine?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.447
(gasps)

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:56.450
FOUR-ARM: It's been 14 years
since we last saw each other.

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:59.036
But I'm not interested in you.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.664
You're just a personhood
and a series of memories.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.875
Your body, on the other hand, where is it?

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.044
-(gasps)
-Tell me, where is the body

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:10.339
that stole Mother's right eye?

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:15.469
HIZURU: Heine, are you really doing this?
Are you playing these games again?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:18.681
This time, you're using
Shiori Kobayakawa's memory.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:20.766
(zapping)

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:23.728
HIZURU: <i>He blocked it.</i>

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:26.939
<i>That shot should've hit.</i>

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:28.941
I just read her memory.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.528
Neither Hizuru nor Ryunosuke
knows where the body is.

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.363
But I can't read the old man.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:35.906
FOUR-ARM: Can I kill him?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.824
Go ahead.

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:40.036
Let's get outta here, Ryunosuke.
We can't take them.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.871
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.583
Don't you understand!?
They're here for us, we're being hunted!

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.793
NEZU: They're not shadows of human beings.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.754
They're something much, much worse.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:51.380
We gotta get out of here!

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.633
Watch it, be careful.
(coughs)

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:55.968
He's off by just a little bit.

00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.305
I think he's about two full seconds ahead.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:02.475
Yes. I can see that now.

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.809
Ryunosuke!

00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.019
-(groans)
-(gasps)

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:07.146
(dramatic music)

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.194
There. One down.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.450
(explosions)

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.661
-(Nezu groans)
-HIZURU: No, Nezu!

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.705
-Goddamn you!
-(gunshots)

00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:25.915
Oh?

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.043
-(Hizuru grunts)
-Over there, huh?

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.171
-(gunshot)
-(groans)

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.173
(retches)

00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:37.718
Ah, so close.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:42.181
Not easy to hit something
when it's a full two seconds ahead.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:46.102
You going after him?

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:51.440
There's no need for that.
Look at this. The blood is thick and dark.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:55.486
He'll be dead soon.
I hit him right in the liver.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.863
Where are Ushio and Shinpei?

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.658
I can feel them getting close,
but don't worry.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.202
I sent two stray shadows with Tokiko.

00:20:03.786 --> 00:20:06.872
But more importantly,
I'm starting to get really hungry.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:09.291
I don't think I can wait
till nine o'clock.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.544
(water churning)

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.844
USHIOH: <i>Damn it,</i>
<i>I feel so weak and helpless.</i>

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.055
<i>Shinpei gave up his weapon</i>
<i>and surrendered to her.</i>

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:28.352
<i>He must've decided not to loop back again</i>
<i>before getting to the truth.</i>

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:33.190
<i>He's trying to go as far</i>
<i>as he can this time. Right, Shinpei?</i>

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:36.986
(rumbling)

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.865
Ugh! That wasn't me, okay?

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:44.702
That was Hiruko. She must be very hungry.

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:48.122
(rumbling)

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:51.500
TOKIKO: I've accepted who I am
and what I've done. That's the truth.

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.919
I won't ask for forgiveness.

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:59.049
All I want is for all of you
to see for yourselves and understand.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.763
You know, brother, Dad doesn't want you
to know anything about this.

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.055
(quivers)

00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:08.225
TOKIKO: I'm not going to make you swear
not to tell anyone,

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:10.436
you couldn't, even if you wanted to.

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:15.900
But please, listen, Shinpei.
Whatever you do, don't tell Mio.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:21.155
I don't want her to find out
about what you saw here.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:25.701
I swear I won't get Mio involved in this.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:30.080
Okay, thank you. You're so kind, Shinpei.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.042
(gasps)

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:39.048
SHINPEI: <i>A long, looming shadow</i>
<i>stretches to the ceiling.</i>

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:42.426
<i>At the foot of that shadow...</i>

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.386
(rumbling)

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.854
Finally, it's nine o'clock sharp.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:57.650
That means it's time for me to eat.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.986
(closing theme music)
