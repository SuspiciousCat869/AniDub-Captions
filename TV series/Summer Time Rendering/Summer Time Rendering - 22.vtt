00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.754
(theme music)

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:14.306
SUMMER TIME RENDERING

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.344
Ushioh! Don't let them get us!

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.806
Don't worry! It's a piece of cake!

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.103
I'm back and better than ever!
(laughs)

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:46.273
Thanks, Gil.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:48.859
Oh.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.820
(waves crashing)

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.905
(tense music)

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:59.703
MASAHITO: <i>My armor won't come back.</i>
<i>They blasted it off of me.</i>

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.168
<i>She got rid of the strays in an instant</i>
<i>by hacking them with a touch of her hair.</i>

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:10.130
Looks like you've grown Irregular.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:11.256
(scoffs)

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.217
You snuck up behind me last time too,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.346
-but this time, I won't lose!
-Hold on!

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.514
(static)

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:24.478
USHIOH: <i>My hacking can destroy the armor.</i>
<i>Shide's just a human inside.</i>

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.690
<i>If I can break his armor,</i>
<i>I'll finish him this time!</i>

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.194
HEINE: That's what you think.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:36.156
MASAHITO: These events
are slightly unexpected.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.160
They just transferred her memories
in order to revive her.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:43.288
HEINE: <i>We should have killed her then.</i>

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.626
No point in looking back.
Let's focus on the present.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.046
We avoided the worst case scenario
fighting two Ushiohs.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.172
Mm.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.465
(static)

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.804
Ushioh, your growth
has been disrupting our progress.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.224
But now it's an opportune time
to kill you.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.017
(grunts)

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:09.022
Her blade is definitely threatening.
Isn't it?

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:14.695
MASAHITO: <i>If I use my echo, then I would</i>
<i>only be risking losing my armor.</i>

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.614
(yelling)

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.783
However, my blade...

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.827
Can take your life!

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.037
-(static)
-MIOH: Stop it.

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:24.955
Huh?

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:26.248
(yelps)

00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:30.669
Why? Mioh? Mioh... Huh? What? Hey!

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.879
USHIOH: Why are you getting in my way?
(grunts)

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:34.256
Calm down, Sis, will ya?

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.716
No, let me punch him at least!

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.552
Aah!

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.847
Seriously? That's your strategy?

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:44.224
Wow, Shinpei.

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.686
Welcome back. I'm glad you're all right.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.647
(grunts)

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.857
(gasps)

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.608
USHIOH: Shinpei, your leg...

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.069
SHINPEI: I fell hard on it just now.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.282
It's nothing, really. It's just a leg.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:03.452
Take care of her, okay, Shin-chan?

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.536
Yeah.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.872
Shide!

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:07.873
SHIDE: Yes?

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.293
Where do you think I came from?
Wanna guess?

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:14.504
Uh...

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.215
What did you say?

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.176
As expected, looks like you don't know.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:21.636
That means I can hide
the handprints location

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.096
when I'm inside Gil.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.890
(gasps)

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:26.600
SHINPEI: Later.

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.227
Don't let him shoot!

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.645
(gunshot)

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:33.899
(gasps)

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.859
(gunshot)

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.612
Huh?

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.988
No way.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.365
(gunshot)

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.373
TOKIKO: Gil is usually
in the form of this pacifier.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.375
Toss it for him to appear.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.128
Can I try?

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.379
Go ahead.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.215
Here.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.385
Hm? Huh?
(whimpers)

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:03.553
(thuds)

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.641
Sorry! Are you okay there, Sou?

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.601
(Shinpei gasps)
SHINPEI: Is he dead?

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.811
TOKIKO: No.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.771
SHINPEI: What's it like inside?

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.900
It's pretty creepy, and it's pitch black,
and you can't see a thing,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.277
but I could hear sounds from outside.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.614
TOKIKO: It's pitch black,
'cause Gil has no eyes.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.118
But he's got good hearing,
so you can leave the fighting to him.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.790
SHINPEI:
<i>With Ryunosuke's two second foresight,</i>

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.292
<i>Gil might give me a chance against Shide.</i>

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.213
You'll feel it, if Gil takes any damage
or hurt in anyway

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.798
while you're synced together.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.758
So you have to be really careful.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:46.763
We just need to confirm if we can disable
the handprint signal that inside of Gil.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:47.764
That's right.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.685
Heine would be able to detect
if the signal is gone.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.895
I don't wanna give her too much time.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.775
SHINPEI: Yeah, I want at least two hours.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.236
Okay, but won't they notice Gil?

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.406
Gil's presence is just
like any other stray,

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.784
so even if he shouldn't be there,
they won't spot him among others.

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.328
SOU: Hide leaves in a forest, right?

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.539
NEZU: What if they find out?

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.958
SOU: Is there a Plan B or C?

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:16.626
We'll play it by ear.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.711
Huh?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.422
SHINPEI: Let's just be ready
for any possibility.

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.550
Hmm, I like it.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.636
No matter what happens,
I'm bringing her back.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:31.725
(gasps)

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.645
-SHINPEI: I'm back.
-NEZU: Hm?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:40.066
Shinpei. You're back.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.610
SOU: Really? Shinpei?

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.820
How did it go? Ushioh?

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.030
(gasps)

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.074
Huh, Shinpei?

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:55.498
I would've thought Shinpei was hiding
in a stray to search and find Ushioh

00:06:56.124 --> 00:07:00.211
and take two Ushiohs with him
to attack Hiruko's Grotto.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.172
SHADOW SHINPEI: But that's not it.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.758
So you looped, Heine.

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:07.636
Do you mind sharing what you saw?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.096
SHADOW SHINPEI: He found his answer.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.057
(static)

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.224
(both gasp)

00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:15.685
SOU: Ushioh!

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.980
Everyone, I'm back.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.315
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.358
Hmm.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.786
Where do you think I came from?
Wanna guess?

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.664
It's Hiruko's Grotto. That's it.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.249
That bastard must have set
the restart point there.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:42.170
SHADOW SHINPEI: That's why he was hiding
in the stray for two hours.

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:47.133
He used the loop to bring Ushioh back,
to go for my throat.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.721
This is the right moment,
let's destroy Hiruko's body.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:00.063
-(cicadas chirping)
-(faint festive music playing)

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.440
-SHADOW MAKI: Karikiri.
-Mm-hm?

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.609
The portable shrine is almost ready.

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.277
MASAHITO: Ah! Wait a second!

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.278
-(Masahito groans)
-Huh?

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:11.741
Oh, this hurts! It hurts.
Kogaito, I have the worst stomach ache!

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:13.952
-(Masahito grumbling)
-SHADOW MAKI: Are you okay?

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:16.246
MASAHITO: No, no, no.
I can't do this! I got the runs!

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.706
I need to go to the bathroom.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.126
Oh, my. Want some waka-med?

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.586
-(static)
-(gasps)

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.463
SHINPEI: <i>Take care of the rest.</i>

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:30.343
I hope he'll be all right.

00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:37.934
It's flat outside, but normal inside.
It feels weird.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.146
I wonder if they figured out our plans.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.189
Maybe, and that's what we want.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:47.527
They'll have no choice
but to focus on dealing with us first.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.946
And until we're dealt with,
they can't proceed

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.531
with their planned massacre.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.618
-(rumbles)
-(gasps)

00:08:55.702 --> 00:09:00.457
Gil feels the presence of a shadow.
At two o'clock, 65 feet ahead.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.334
TOKIKO: <i>They did figure it out.</i>

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:04.794
(grunts)

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.254
TOKIKO: <i>Something shot at us!</i>

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.715
<i>Something like needles. Teeth?</i>

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.675
<i>They're trying to pin the shadow!</i>

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:14.929
(both gasp)

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.806
Tokiko! I'll go out and fight.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.809
It's fine. I have it under control.

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:23.688
(rumbling)

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.524
TOKIKO: Now, you all go ahead.

00:09:26.608 --> 00:09:29.444
I can handle this by myself.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:31.738
SOU: What? We can't just leave you here!

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:36.367
I told you to go already!
Quit wasting your time here!

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:38.369
-(gasps)
-Hmm...

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.329
Got it.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.790
Thanks, Tokiko.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.459
TOKIKO: No. I should thank you.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:50.924
Thank you very much, dear Shinpei.
You forgave me, of all people.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.597
Tokiko.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.683
Don't die.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.854
You too, brother. And Sou,
try not to get in anyone's way now.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:13.613
(snarling)

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:17.534
Heine forced you to wake up and fight.

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:19.577
Let's go, Gil.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:24.582
We'll let this baby
rest in peace for good.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.668
SHINPEI: A dead end!

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.420
SOU: No, Hiruko's burrow
was on the other side.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.840
SHINPEI: Yeah, this wall is new.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:36.511
This is extremely strange, guys.
I can't sense anything through it.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:37.804
It's a stray mud wall.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.013
(gasps)

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.767
SHINPEI: <i>They're fast approaching</i>
<i>from the sea and shrine grounds.</i>

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:43.726
(screeching)

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:45.854
-Move.
-Huh?

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.438
(gunshot)

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:48.439
Huh?

00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:49.649
There's blood.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.442
NEZU: It heals itself.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.611
I'll give it a try.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.071
(static)

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.948
(gasps)
Don't touch it!

00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:58.199
-Huh?
-(electricity crackles)

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.576
(groans)

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.370
SHINPEI; Ushioh. Your hand.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:06.291
That was close.
It almost managed to hack me back.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.794
USHIOH: This wall is made
of Hiruko's flesh.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:15.425
SOU: Damn it! We've come so far!
Hiruko is right there, too!

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:18.178
We can bomb the wall.

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.555
Bomb it? But we don't have one.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.932
MIOH: Sure we do.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:27.896
SOU: Mioh.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:32.317
I had Mioh steal something.
Specifically for this occasion.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.568
(chuckles)

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.777
Those are...

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.571
SOU AND USHIOH: Fireworks!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.870
SHIDE: Where's Shinpei now?

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:47.165
SHADOW SHINPEI: The barrier.
They just made contact.

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.460
He chose such a sweet spot.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:55.089
If his restart point was too far,
his attack wouldn't have been a surprise.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:59.093
But if he was too close,
he knew you would have sensed him.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:04.307
Let's hurry. My long life
has taught me something.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:10.021
There is not one that hadn't been broken.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.482
MASAHITO: That's how a wall goes.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.568
(fireworks popping)

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.155
(explosion)

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.159
Did it work?

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:25.745
Mm.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:26.955
Let's go.

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:33.169
It smells like gunpowder
and grilled steak.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.713
Don't say that.
Now I can't eat steak again.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:38.758
SHINPEI: I also smell raspberry and rum.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.843
It doesn't smell that good!

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.805
-(gasps)
-(yelps)

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:45.431
SHINPEI; Nezu! Get down!

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.017
-Hm?
-(gunshots)

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.103
(thrilling music)

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:54.315
-(gunshots)
-(squelches)

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.118
-SHIDE: Give me a break!
-(gunshot)

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.830
Don't you worry about me.
Go before the hole closes.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:10.790
You wanna die, old man?

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:16.754
Whenever you feel any doubt,
do what your future self would do.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.465
NEZU: Then you won't have any regrets.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.218
Please hold him here.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:25.513
Mm. Say hi to Ryunosuke.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.269
NEZU: You're so pathetic.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:34.897
Masahito? Or is it Iwao?
Which one are you?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.984
SHIDE: Doesn't matter which version.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:38.943
NEZU: Hm?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:43.990
SHIDE: Move aside. I don't want
my childhood friend to die.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.825
NEZU: Don't underestimate me.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.787
If you wanna keep going,
you're gonna have to kill me first!

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.252
(squishing)

00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.298
(grunts)

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:04.552
(approaching footsteps)

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:06.512
-(squealing)
-(groaning)

00:14:06.596 --> 00:14:07.805
-USHIOH: Shinpei?
-SHINPEI: Aah!

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:12.852
Ugh! My head is going to split.
It's Hiruko's presence.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.981
I see, you must be feeling
the shadows presence now,

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.191
aren't you, Shinpei?

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:22.862
Mother continuously emits a signal
to control the shadows.

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.784
MIOH: Once Sis tweaked me,
it couldn't control me anymore.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:32.455
Then Mother's comforting sound
became an unbearable screech.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:37.085
We shadows have the ability
to completely erase the sound,

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.128
but Shin-chan can't.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.129
No way.

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.297
MIOH: Let's make this quick.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.343
Ushioh, are you okay?

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.677
(Shinpei grunts)

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:50.264
I'm fine. Just try to focus
on my presence.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.350
(Shinpei grunts)

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:56.187
-(chiming)
-(squealing)

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.315
(gasps)
SHINPEI: <i>The ringing stopped.</i>

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:03.027
Looks like Mother's signal
is getting weaker.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.613
SHINPEI: It stopped.

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:06.697
Right?

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:07.907
SHINPEI: Thanks.

00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:12.829
MIOH: <i>Sis emitted the same frequency</i>
<i>to neutralize it.</i>

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.372
<i>How can she do that?</i>

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.415
SHINPEI: Ushioh.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.584
USHIOH: Right. Let's finish this.

00:15:19.961 --> 00:15:21.587
We used up all the fireworks.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.131
It's okay.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.009
No problem. We've still got my fists,

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.095
and they're not about to run out of amo.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:34.142
Sounds like a plan.
One more thing. Listen up.

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:35.434
Huh?

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:40.106
Ryunosuke can see two seconds ahead.
So follow my line of sight.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.527
(suspenseful music)

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.200
Shide! We'll finish this right now!

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:57.206
MASAHIRO: She moved her hair
so fast it broke the barrier.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.584
(grunts)
USHIOH: <i>Too shallow.</i>

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:04.255
SHINPEI: <i>He can detect Ushioh's movements.</i>

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:05.256
(grunts)

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:09.343
<i>Heine's back from the shrine.</i>

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:15.641
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>Just like I thought.</i>
<i>He is two seconds ahead.</i>

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.561
<i>When Shinpei has his left eye closed,</i>

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.355
<i>I can sense Ryunosuke inside him.</i>

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:25.651
<i>That's how he dodged Shide's attacks</i>
<i>in the last loop.</i>

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:30.781
<i>If he wanted, he could strengthen</i>
<i>his body, too, just like Hizuru.</i>

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.368
<i>Shinpei gained the power to fight us.</i>

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.454
<i>That's what gave him such confidence.</i>

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:39.707
<i>You really never quit, Hizuru, do you?</i>

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.792
(tense music)

00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:47.089
SHINPEI: <i>As long as Heine's watching me,</i>
<i>Ryunosuke's foresight isn't an advantage.</i>

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:53.638
<i>If I foresee and tell Ushioh,</i>
<i>Heine can observe that.</i>

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.598
<i>But that's fine.</i>

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.018
<i>They know how powerful Ushioh is.</i>

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.189
<i>Shide knows that one hit from her</i>
<i>would be fatal.</i>

00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.691
<i>That's why they have to focus on her.</i>

00:17:07.568 --> 00:17:11.364
<i>That's when we get Heine to the kill zone.</i>

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:13.699
(grunts)

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.077
SHINPEI: <i>We'll trap Heine there.</i>

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.537
SHADOW SHINPEI:
<i>I can almost smell your bloodlust, Mioh.</i>

00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:21.624
(grunts)

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.502
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>I can detect all shadows</i>
<i>from this distance.</i>

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:27.255
For instance, there's a nail gun copy
behind the rocks.

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:30.341
-Which means someone is hiding back there.
-(gunshot)

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.677
Sou!

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.970
(nails rattle)

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:36.430
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>What?</i>

00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:38.349
This is the kill zone!

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:41.018
(squelches)

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.478
SHINPEI: <i>Yes!</i>

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.439
(groaning)
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>I can't move.</i>

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.484
<i>Sou? I didn't sense him.</i>

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:54.490
<i>Of course. He's human.</i>
<i>His nail gun must be Nezu's original.</i>

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:59.453
<i>The gun I sensed was Ushioh's copy.</i>

00:18:00.371 --> 00:18:01.455
<i>A decoy.</i>

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.710
<i>No, this isn't the time</i>
<i>to analyze things.</i>

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:09.547
<i>It hurts. It hurts. Bird's-eye view.</i>

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.923
<i>Where did I go wrong?</i>

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.425
<i>Stop.</i>

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:22.602
<i>What's important now</i>
<i>is what's happening in two seconds.</i>

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:26.439
<i>I need to warn Shide.</i>

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:34.196
I told you. You can't keep
taking us lightly forever, Shide.

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.073
(giggles)

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.534
You pathetic human.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.620
This is so much fun!

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.832
(yells)

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:03.434
(snarling)

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:08.689
USHIOH: <i>I can sense it all.</i>

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:15.529
<i>Heine's pain. Thirst. Sadness. Loneliness.</i>

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.365
(Sou shouts)

00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:18.532
(Sou grunts)

00:19:19.283 --> 00:19:20.242
(whimpers)

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.330
(gunshots)

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:31.212
USHIOH: <i>You want to go home,</i>
<i>where time and death don't exist.</i>

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:37.927
<i>You'll be with your family,</i>
<i>the people you love, forever.</i>

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.429
-(yelling)
-<i>It would be so nice.</i>

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:45.059
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>I'll never understand you.</i>

00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:48.562
No! No!

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:52.858
These hands of yours
are not made to hurt people.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:58.030
HITOBUCHI: I want you to use them
to hold hands and to hug.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:01.826
USHIOH: <i>We...</i>

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:14.839
MASAHITO: <i>It's disappearing.</i>
<i>The mud, the armor Heine gave me.</i>

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:19.093
<i>They got Heine.</i>

00:20:22.012 --> 00:20:23.097
Heine!

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.181
(knife pierces)

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:30.938
I will disappear when Mother dies.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.944
-Bye-bye, Shin-chan.
-(static)

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:38.696
Ushioh!

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:40.614
(gasps)

00:20:40.698 --> 00:20:41.657
SHINPEI: Ushioh!

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.203
USHIOH: Why is it, Shinpei?

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.830
Huh?

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:54.462
USHIOH: I killed the bad guy.
It's all over.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:58.215
But I can't stop crying.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.718
Ushioh. Your right eye...

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:01.677
(gasps)

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.262
(groaning)

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:05.806
SOU: Shinpei!

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.724
MIOH: Wait.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:10.561
Sis and I, it's obvious,
we haven't disappeared.

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.688
Mother is still alive.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.148
Wait, what?

00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:17.610
You went easy on her, Sister.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.029
It's hot. My right eye.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.114
USHIOH: Shinpei!

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:27.161
SHINPEI: <i>From my right eye</i>
<i>and Ushioh's right eye,</i>

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.247
<i>-I can feel the presence.</i>
-(gasps)

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.214
SHIDE: How wonderful.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:40.966
-(gasps)
-Shide.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:43.385
It... It can't be.

00:21:43.677 --> 00:21:45.262
Why is he still moving?

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:50.100
MIOH: <i>We killed both of him.</i>

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.439
(gasps)

00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.609
Is he immortal?

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.904
(closing theme music)
