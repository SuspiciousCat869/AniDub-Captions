WEBVTT

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.712
(panting)

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.633
You think you can win? Hilarious.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.092
(gunshots)

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:11.929
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>She's quick.</i>

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.473
(thrilling music)

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.978
<i>She's as fast as Ushioh.</i>

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.231
<i>No...</i>

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.025
<i>Even faster.</i>

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.285
<i>Pulling out all the stops</i>
<i>for the final battle, huh, Hizuru?</i>

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.788
(theme music)

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.878
(rumbling)

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.299
(static)

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.094
That was real close.

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.264
Come on, Shide.
How long are you gonna sleep?

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:26.938
SHIDE: Huh? Okay, here we go. All right.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:32.903
You're pretty good at handling
my sacred treasure, Amenonuboko.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.113
Ryunosuke is a shadow, after all.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:39.368
Can't copy, but apparently,
very skilled when it comes to imitating.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.996
I'm shocked by the wrath
in each and every strike.

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:46.958
I've known you since you were a baby.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.628
SHIDE: Do you really hate me that much?

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:55.050
Why are you even going this far?
Why risk your life to fight?

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.720
What I hate are your words.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.180
My words?

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:06.144
HIZURU: Humans have language.
Human nature determines how we use words.

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:10.649
But you'll never understand,
no matter how long you live.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.152
SHADOW SHINPEI: Of course.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.571
I have one question
for you, though, Hizuru.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.783
Knowing you'd die, why did you come back?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.578
Only an idiot would come back here
just to die. It's not like you.

00:03:23.662 --> 00:03:28.333
Well, you should know.
You scanned my mind last time.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:34.047
Or maybe, scanning is all you can do.
You can't understand it?

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:37.134
So why don't you scan me again?

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.138
Create my shadow, and then you can
have it answer your questions.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.472
(scoffs)

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.349
I'm not falling for that.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:46.685
I bet you're immune.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.479
Mioh could've done that.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:53.650
SHADOW SHINPEI: You just wanna destroy
this body the moment I flash.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.193
HIZURU: <i>Is it that obvious?</i>

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.655
You think you can beat Shide
if it weren't for my eye.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.159
I'll bet you're thinking it would be easy
to destroy my real body,

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.827
the one underground, isn't that right?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.744
Heine.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.790
Give me a minute. Answer me!
Why did you come back here?

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:13.086
-Was it because of the message?
-That's typical of Shinpei Ajiro.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.049
When he takes a step back calmly
and logically, he's pretty persistent

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.427
in his search for the right answers.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.304
RYUNOSUKE: What's with all the talking?

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.264
HIZURU: I'm buying us some time.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.391
Let me handle it.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.478
At first, I was curious.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:33.607
Now I'm pretty sure
I'd been waiting for this.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.400
HIZURU: It's my chance
to make it up to him.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:37.778
Make it up to who?

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:42.240
Shide was absolutely right.
My brother died because of me.

00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.241
Hm?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.870
HIZURU: <i>Ryunosuke's death</i>
<i>was treated as an accident.</i>

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:52.083
<i>No one blamed me.</i>
<i>My friends and parents consoled me.</i>

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:57.714
<i>I turned into this sad kid,</i>
<i>who lost her twin in an accident.</i>

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:02.594
The truth is,
I might as well have killed him myself.

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:07.557
It was a miracle that I met his shadow
and I got to apologize.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.477
HIZURU: <i>But he's still dead.</i>

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.105
There's only one thing I can do now.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:19.569
I can at least save the lives
that would otherwise be lost.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:20.946
Mm.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.698
So I'll save them. I have to.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.619
So that's why?
You wanna make it up to him?

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:33.208
SHIDE: Pathetic.
You're risking your life for strangers?

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.919
That's the type of people I hate the most,

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.505
those who think
they're doing the right thing.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.048
(scoffs)

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.091
The right thing?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.970
HIZURU: Right.
(laughs)

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.263
Me?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.809
(laughing)

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.109
You need to step back more, Heine.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.864
Do you actually think
he's acting for your benefit?

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:04.906
What?

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.492
HIZURU: Your goal of going home,

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:11.538
and his words in the third loop
contradict each other.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.417
You said that it was your ending,
didn't you?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.793
Mm.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:19.296
What did you mean by that, Shide?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.006
Your ending?

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:26.970
Well, this guy only thinks of himself.
He can't see past his own perspective.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:31.433
Ending, huh? I'm lost.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:37.272
SHIDE: It's nonsense, Heine.
She's trying to trick us with words.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:38.607
Yeah.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.485
SHIDE: And that means
she has nothing left.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.072
Enough of this pleasant conversation.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:51.036
HIZURU: <i>I didn't want Heine to see this,</i>
<i>but I can't ask for much.</i>

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.039
<i>The rest is up to you, Tokiko.</i>

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:58.209
<i>Shide's armor isn't made up of anyone.</i>
<i>It's empty inside.</i>

00:06:58.293 --> 00:06:59.836
(gasps)

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:00.962
<i>So...</i>

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.469
<i>You can get inside it.</i>

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:10.639
<i>Ryunosuke, you know well</i>
<i>how to possess people.</i>

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.140
(grunts)

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.476
<i>Get into his armor</i>
<i>and destroy it from the inside.</i>

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:17.312
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>What...</i>

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:21.608
(panting)

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.694
(groaning)

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:28.156
(squelches)

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.616
(grunting)

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.784
You... You...

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.622
(Ryunosuke grunting)

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.625
SHADOW SHINPEI:
<i>So you had this up your sleeve.</i>

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.045
<i>Copying Ryunosuke's data</i>
<i>into Shide's armor.</i>

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:45.215
MASAHITO: <i>It's born?</i>

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.510
(Hizuru panting)

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.179
(Hizuru grunting)

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.139
(quivering)

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.601
RYUNOSUKE: We... We really did it.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.272
Oh!

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.233
Sis!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.991
(crickets chirping)

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.414
MIOH: Stand back, Shin-chan.
It's dangerous.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:21.584
Hi. I was waiting for you.

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.545
Mio and Sou? Where are they?

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:28.258
You did come to see Mio first, Shinpei.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.136
MIOH: Stand back, Shin-chan,

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.388
I got him.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:39.894
You should kill Shinpei instead of me,
don't you think, Mio-chan?

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:44.315
I sent Mio and Sou to Hiruko's Grotto.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.277
I bet Mother is probably eating them now.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.194
(gasps)

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.698
You were just a bit too late, Shinpei.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:55.618
SHINPEI: You got some guts, Shide.
You didn't run away.

00:08:56.745 --> 00:08:58.747
I can't leave this to other shadows.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.875
I don't want to lose
any more allies, you know?

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.586
A human being like me
just can't be hacked.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.962
What?

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.547
SHINPEI: <i>He's afraid of being hacked?</i>

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.008
<i>He must think Ushioh is still alive.</i>

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:11.718
MASAHITO: Oh?

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:16.181
SHINPEI: <i>Wait. If he thinks she's alive,</i>
<i>I can use this.</i>

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.142
Oh, you got us.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:25.899
Mioh, kill Shinpei and make him loop,
or it'll be too late.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:26.858
(squelches)

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:31.446
All right. Well, I'll be reborn
in the next loop, anyway.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.823
(blood splatters)

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:35.283
He doesn't shut up.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:46.377
Shin-chan, he wasn't lying. Mio just died.

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.587
SHINPEI: You can tell?

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.757
If my original dies, yeah. I can feel it.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.176
Go back?

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.054
SHINPEI: <i>No. Not yet.</i>

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.433
We need a handle on the situation.
Search his memories.

00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:01.351
MIOH: Okay.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.312
(flash squeals)

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:11.277
That's strange. He has no memories.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.987
Wait, what do you mean?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:18.827
It's empty. There's no memory at all,
not even the conversation we just had.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.286
What is this?

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:23.998
What moved him around?

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.792
Shide had two bodies.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.338
Not shadows, but two, like, cloned humans.

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:34.801
MIOH: He didn't have that burn on his arm.
There must be another.

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:37.262
Then he must be with Ms. Nagumo.

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:42.225
SHINPEI: <i>She could be in danger.</i>
<i>Heine called me from her cell phone.</i>

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.601
(Mioh gasps)

00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:46.938
Shin-chan. This way.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.572
(panting)

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.198
(gasps)
Tokiko!

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:03.288
Thank goodness you're alive, Shinpei.
(groaning)

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:09.043
I came this far searching
for Mio's presence.

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.421
Tokiko. What happened?

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:18.011
Nezu and Totsumura let me escape.
(breathing sharply)

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:23.641
Please go to Torajima.
Please go to Torajima.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.645
TOKIKO: Ryunosuke's fighting Shide.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:33.026
(Tokiko panting)
Save him, please.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.819
(Tokiko groans)

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.196
(gasps)

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.080
(flash squeals)

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.665
MIOH: She's dead.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.752
These are her memories.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.087
(gasps)

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.256
(inaudible)

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.761
Quickly. Let's go to Torajima.

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:03.973
Huh?

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:07.685
SHINPEI: <i>It's Dr. Hishigata's Derringer.</i>
<i>Tokiko had it.</i>

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.896
<i>Still one bullet left.</i>

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.815
MIOH: Shin-chan.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.610
Sorry. I'm not going.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:20.823
Ryunosuke and Ms. Nagumo
might be dead already.

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.952
I wasn't really able to tell
from Tokiko's memories.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.871
I don't have time to go and confirm it.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:32.669
SHINPEI: <i>We know Mio's dead.</i>
<i>The event horizon is coming closer.</i>

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:35.797
If we don't hurry,
her death will be irreversible.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.675
We still have a chance to save everyone.

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:42.845
If I loop now, it'll be around 10:10 a. m.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.309
Oh, I was leaving Mt. Takanosu
with the kids.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:49.227
MIOH: You can see it?

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.688
Yeah, but very vaguely.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.566
But I can't stop Heine's call
at 10:10 a. m.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.654
-Okay, first, I'll hurry back to Kofune.
-(gasps)

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.614
So I will meet you there.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.492
Then I'll go after Mio and Sou
to stop them.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.578
Once we loop, we have to move quickly.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.247
SHINPEI: Follow me.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.751
We will save both Mio and Ms. Nagumo.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.045
MIOH: It's a battle against time.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.756
(grunts)

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.635
(breathing heavily)

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.555
SHINPEI: All right, I'm going.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.391
(gunshot)

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.655
(Sou and Mio panting)

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.283
(both gasp)

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.493
Oh! You guys.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:49.829
What are you doing here, Shin-chan?

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.415
Oh! I made it just in time.
Thank goodness.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.542
Mioh ran us through the sewers
to get us here.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.045
SOU: Oh, you... saved her?

00:13:57.128 --> 00:13:58.212
She's all right.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.132
SHINPEI: More importantly,
why are your phones off?

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.425
SOU: Wait, what?

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:07.013
But you told us to turn them off,
'cause a shadow might call.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.850
Idiot. That was a shadow telling you that.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.226
(Mio gasps)

00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.236
SOU: Right, sorry, Shinpei.
Ugh! I should've known.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.200
It's fine. Look. We don't have time.
I'll head to Torajima with Mioh.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:32.121
I'm sorry I shot you. I, um...

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.083
It hurt, but it's okay.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:38.169
MIOH: I just copied you,
and healed my wounds, so it's fine.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:39.754
It did hurt a lot, though.

00:14:40.338 --> 00:14:41.464
I'm so sorry!

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.426
Don't worry.
I would've done the same thing.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.847
SHINPEI: Sou and Mio, go back to Kofune,
and watch the kids.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.057
SOU: Leave them to us!

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:57.355
Shin-chan.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:58.356
Oh?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.568
Save Tokiko and the others, please.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.071
Mm, got this.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.909
SHINPEI: Let's go, Mioh. To Torajima.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.787
(suspenseful music)

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.708
SHINPEI: <i>According to Tokiko's memories,</i>
<i>Ms. Nagumo signals at 10:45.</i>

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.254
SHINPEI: <i>Let me get there in time.</i>
<i>Please, let me get there in time!</i>

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.172
(gasps)

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.886
Mioh. We don't have time to fight.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.930
I'll jump. Don't bite your tongue.

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:34.892
(Shinpei grunts)

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.728
(suspenseful music)

00:15:40.314 --> 00:15:42.608
-(thuds)
-(Tokiko grunts)

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.322
We made it.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.535
(gasps)

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:53.870
-(gasps)
-Hm?

00:15:54.912 --> 00:15:58.833
SHINPEI: <i>I saw that exact same attack</i>
<i>from Shide in Tokiko's memories.</i>

00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:00.418
<i>What did it do?</i>

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.795
<i>Rose was gone in an instant.</i>

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:10.678
I see. So this is how things can change.

00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:11.971
Oh! Rose!

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:19.395
He's here. Quicker than I thought, yeah.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:22.523
Whoa!

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.566
Shinpei!

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.067
Stand back, Tokiko.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:27.278
You'll die.

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:32.700
Hmm, you looped,
so I'm sure you know how this battle ends.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.161
SHADOW SHINPEI:
Tokiko must've told you after she escaped.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.078
(gasps)

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:40.082
SHIDE: Oh, why so surprised, Shinpei?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.501
(whimpers)

00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:47.340
Because you looped, we got to fight again.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.928
SHINPEI: No...

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.431
-(static)
-Thanks to you, it was an easy win.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.976
Ms. Nagumo!

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:03.272
You're way too far.
Don't waste bullets, Totsumura!

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.774
What?
(whimpers)

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:11.280
NEZU: <i>Is that Heine?</i>
<i>Second time fighting this battle?</i>

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:15.576
<i>After the loop,</i>
<i>it knew my attack position. Damn it.</i>

00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:20.164
<i>All we've got is my machete,</i>
<i>Totsumura's Derringer,</i>

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:23.459
<i>Gil, and Mioh.</i>

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:28.881
<i>This isn't going to end well</i>
<i>if we fight now, Shinpei.</i>

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.301
-We'll all die. Shinpei. Mioh.
-(Tetsu whimpers)

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.594
Pull back.

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:34.845
NEZU: Get on Gil.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:37.098
Are you deaf, Shinpei?

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:40.560
SHINPEI: But what about Ms. Nagumo?
We can't just leave her!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:46.524
You moron! We need to pull back!
Don't waste her sacrifice!

00:17:46.607 --> 00:17:47.525
(grunts)

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.362
-(static)
-SHINPEI: <i>This is...</i>

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.072
Mm.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.032
(static)

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.668
-SHADOW SHINPEI: Let's go, Shide.
-Hm?

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.796
We're outnumbered. This is enough for now.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:10.006
BOTH: Huh?

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.550
I understand.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.470
(gasps)

00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.020
(sighs)
That was close.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:27.982
Ms. Nagumo! Stay with me!

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.818
(Hizuru quivering)

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:33.446
HIZURU: Shinpei...

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:35.448
Ms. Nagumo!

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:42.330
I'm sorry. I said I'd save you.

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.583
I promised that...

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:49.879
But I don't think I can keep it.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.548
That's not true! Not at all!

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.343
Totsumura! Give me the gun!

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:56.927
TETSU: Oh, here!

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:00.890
I'm going back right now.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:01.932
No, don't.

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.810
I promise, I'll save you next time.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.313
Just stop. It's too late.

00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:08.648
(gunshot)

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.693
(groaning)

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:18.157
I'm sure you know more than anyone.
The loop ability is reaching the limit.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.869
MIOH: You can't save us both.

00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:23.746
(Shinpei grunting)

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:26.791
-(Shinpei sobbing)
-(Hizuru groans)

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:30.503
We need to get her to the hospital.
I'm sure Mioh can...

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.507
Listen closely.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:41.138
Remember, Heine is just a child.

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:43.641
HIZURU: <i>She may be a monster, but...</i>

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:50.981
<i>her original personality</i>
<i>is shy and wants to be loved.</i>

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.359
<i>She's just a child.</i>

00:19:54.485 --> 00:19:58.864
Shide doesn't want
the same thing... Heine.

00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:04.620
He's probably just using her.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.332
He's the one in charge.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.459
(Hizuru breathes sharply)

00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.378
(coughing)

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:18.592
Shinpei... please free Heine.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.263
Yes. I promise.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:26.726
Enough. Don't speak anymore, Hizuru.

00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.520
-(sobbing)
-(Hizuru groaning)

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:32.648
HIZURU: It's not a bad way to end.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.358
(Hizuru breathes heavily)

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:37.361
Stop being so gloomy.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.366
It doesn't matter how long I've lived,

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:48.205
but how I used my life to the full...

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.792
(sobbing)

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:55.463
(gasps)

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.049
(somber music)

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.385
Aah!

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.098
(somber music)

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:15.441
I'm putting my brother in your care.

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:20.362
What a comeback story this will be.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.998
(somber music)

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.266
(Shinpei sobbing)

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.936
NEZU: Oh. Hey, Hizuru?

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.941
Hizuru!

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.904
(closing theme music)
