WEBVTT

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.215
HIZURU: This is not the first time
you're living through the same July 22nd.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:08.926
I think you must have repeated
this day many times.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:13.764
So in other words, you're a time traveler.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.015
(sucks teeth)

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:15.974
That's right.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:20.771
I understand. But I doubt that it was me
who told you my real name.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.813
(Shinpei gasps)

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.440
I guess maybe you met my brother?

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.693
(insects chirping)

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:35.035
WOMAN 1 (on TV): <i>And next up,</i>
<i>we have a report from Kinokawa City.</i>

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.079
<i>It's time to hear</i>
<i>all about the delicious treats</i>

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.332
<i>and offerings</i>
<i>that await Wakayama's summer visitors.</i>

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.417
<i>Hi there. Tell us all about it. Go ahead!</i>

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.131
KOBA MART
YOMOGIMOCHI

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.260
HIZURU: It's time, Ryunosuke.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.600
(theme music)

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:28.940
(insects chirping)

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:29.900
THIRD LOOP
JULY 24 (TUESDAY)

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.151
HIZURU: Mm-hm.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.445
I have to say that's very interesting.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.614
It could even be
the plot of my next novel.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:38.659
That crazy thing confused
the hell out of me.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.327
It just went right over my head.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.622
This book is actually a good proof
of my theory.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.582
<i>Swampman</i> isn't fiction.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.419
SHINPEI: The Swamp Man in this story
is just like the shadows,

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.339
and the protagonist
has the same name as you.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.681
About 14 years ago,
I met a shadow on this island,

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.432
and it killed my entire family.

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:03.684
(gasps)

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.564
HIZURU: That's why it's not hard for me
to believe what you're saying.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.733
SHINPEI: But... That's, uh...

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.570
I won't say any more. If I'm not careful,
I'll reveal who I really am.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.407
If I did tell you
and you were copied somehow,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.034
a shadow could find out who I really am.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.912
Shadows always go after people's families.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.499
And since Hizuru returned to the island,
they'll be after her too.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.459
(Shinpei gasps)
SHINPEI: <i>Family...</i>

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.340
Is that why they targeted Ushio
and Mio and I? No. Wait a sec.

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:36.425
What about Alain?

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:40.220
Don't worry about it,
I already took care of Alain's shadow.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.138
(gasps)

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.682
There won't be any more shadows of him.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.935
It's a lot like getting measles,
you're immune afterward.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:51.273
If someone manages to kill your shadow,
you'll never get this sickness again.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.649
It's always been that way.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:57.612
So... So if you kill your own shadow,
then you can't be copied again.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.657
Mm. That's exactly how I got immunity.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.410
Now my shadow can never come back again.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:06.079
And, frankly, I don't care
whether you believe me or not.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.332
But you don't have immunity,
do you, Ms. Nagumo?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.877
So why did you risk coming back
to the island, then?

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:14.337
I can't tell you that. But...

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.966
I'll tell you one thing,
I came to save you.

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.802
Although you probably
don't trust me much right now.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.763
No, I, uh... I just...

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:27.684
What's your plan?

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.103
We have a total of 54 hours

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.689
until the shadows kill everyone
at the festival.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.025
SHINPEI: That four-armed shadow,

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.195
it seemed like it was controlling
all the other shadows.

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.739
My younger sister, Mio, is in danger.

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.825
Will you help me keep her safe
and get rid of her shadow creature?

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:47.329
Your notes said that Mio's shadow
will appear tonight

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.373
at Bistro Kofune
at nine o'clock, is that right?

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.291
SHINPEI: Yes.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:55.212
Okay, then. But I just need
to handle one thing before that.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.173
-The Kobayakawa family?
-Mm?

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.635
You're going to fail, okay?
That's how it happened.

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.345
What do you mean?

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.641
SHINPEI: <i>On the 24th,</i>
<i>I saw something on the ground.</i>

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.309
<i>It was Shiori's shadow.</i>

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:14.064
So you're saying that I won't be able
to kill Shiori today no matter what.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:19.569
Yes. So please just let me come with you.
These shadows are my enemies too.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.489
SHINPEI: <i>Just remember,</i>
<i>even if we fail again,</i>

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.032
<i>this time, I can find out why.</i>

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:31.998
All right, then. But I'm going to be
the only one who goes inside.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.377
KOBA MART

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.339
What is Ms. Nagumo doing?
She's been listening to something.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.342
That person there doesn't have
any memory

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.302
-of being the Hizuru we know.
-Huh?

00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:46.471
HIZURU: Roger that, big Sis.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.936
WOMAN 2 (on TV): <i>Arakawa peaches,</i>
<i>famously grown right here in Momoyama,</i>

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.939
<i>are a tender summer treat beloved</i>
<i>by people all across Japan,</i>

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.524
<i>and guess what!? They're in season now!</i>

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:58.483
-(doorbell dings)
-Huh?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:01.570
Hi! Oh, Hizuru!

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.781
Hey, did I catch you at dinner...
I mean, excuse me.

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:07.033
I had some souvenirs
from Tokyo I wanted to give you.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.995
SHADOW ASAKO: Aw!
You really didn't have to do that!

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.204
SHADOW SHIORI: <i>You can let her in.</i>

00:06:11.288 --> 00:06:13.957
Ah. Oh, please, uh, come on in.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.125
Thanks a lot.

00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.795
SHADOW ASAKO:
My husband Tatsuo, my daughter Shiori.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.964
Come in, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:24.676
HIZURU: Don't mean to intrude.
Do you mind if I open my luggage?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.722
SHADOW ASKAKO: Mm! You know, Hizuru,
why don't you join us for dinner?

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.849
We have so much catching up to do.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.393
SHINPEI: I was wondering about something.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.311
NEZU: What is it?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.314
Does Ms. Nagumo have a split personality?

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.694
No thanks, I can't stick around very long.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:44.779
(suspenseful music)

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.997
HIZURU: <i>The shadow itself is flat,</i>
<i>so a blow to the body isn't effective.</i>

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.207
Mama?

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.628
HIZURU: <i>In the midst of all this,</i>
<i>they keep their eyes fixed on me.</i>

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.713
<i>And once they find out</i>
<i>that I can kill them,</i>

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.341
<i>-they'll be careful and start avoiding me.</i>
-(yelling)

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.217
HIZURU: <i>So I kill both at the same time.</i>

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:09.220
Asako!
(groaning)

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.181
HIZURU: <i>Guess I only reeled in one.</i>

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.101
A split personality? Why do you say that?

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.062
She asked me if I met her brother.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.106
And if she's not making him up,
that has to mean...

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.568
Hm... Well, you ain't too far off,
but that ain't it.

00:07:23.652 --> 00:07:24.694
Uh...

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.782
SHINPEI: Can she really handle this
all by herself?

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.784
NEZU: We wait here, trust me on that.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.704
Ryunosuke's got the power
to do battle with shadows.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.873
(Shinpei gasps)
Ryunosuke?

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.834
That's right. Ryunosuke's a tough one.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.631
Let me make myself clear.

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:47.217
I don't understand
your time loop or whatever.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.135
But if you decided to go inside,

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.556
that might change the reason
she's gonna let Shiori's shadow escape.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.017
(growls)

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.185
(shrieks)

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.981
Right now, Ryunosuke is probably trying
to find out why her plan failed.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.320
(growls)

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:14.244
Listen up. You should know
she trusts you, okay?

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.081
NEZU: <i>And you told her</i>
<i>she ain't dying today.</i>

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.668
<i>And if you were lying about that,</i>
<i>I swear I'll make you pay.</i>

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:23.420
Yes.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.714
SHINPEI: <i>Ms. Nagumo was definitely strong.</i>

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.468
<i>That was Ryunosuke.</i>

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.431
SHINPEI: Mr. Nezu,
can you tell me about Ryunosuke?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.099
What do you know about them?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.183
Huh?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.894
I guess it wouldn't take much
for you to find out.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:45.275
NEZU: <i>Hizuru had a...</i>
<i>a twin brother, younger than her.</i>

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.235
His name was Ryunosuke.

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:51.990
Fourteen years ago, he was found dead
somewhere up on Mount Takanosu.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.785
<i>I heard Hizuru's scream nearby,</i>
<i>so I ran over to her.</i>

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.455
<i>It was a horrible thing to see.</i>

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.915
Papa! Mama!

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:07.297
This can't be... Why did...
Why did you kill them?

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:08.882
(thuds)

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.343
-NEZU: He had been eaten.
-(gasps)

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:16.181
Chunks of his body were bitten off,
muscle and bone was gone.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.808
People figured it must've been wild dogs.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:22.562
But Hizuru kept saying
that she knew he was murdered.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.942
Along with all the bite wounds,
on his neck by his windpipe,

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.819
he had strangulation marks.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:30.737
(gasps)

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:32.655
HIZURU: <i>I missed.</i>

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:36.076
<i>No. It was a hit.</i>

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.911
Ugh!

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:41.289
NEZU: But no matter how many times
she said it, no one believed Hizuru.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.541
And the body was cremated the same day.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:46.753
(gasps)
Hold on, that's just like Ushio.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:51.758
Yeah, wasn't too far off.
I bet you all this might just be related.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.802
NEZU: <i>There are monsters on this island.</i>

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:58.640
<i>And I swore I'd kill every single shadow</i>
<i>I could find in this damn place,</i>

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.642
even if it costs me my life.

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:04.521
You ready to join the fight
the same way I did, Shinpei?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.231
Yes.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.692
(choking)

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:14.405
You're really dangerous.
You know how to kill us, don't you?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.866
Is that little traitor on your side?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:20.578
I see you can follow Mommy
and Daddy's movements.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.956
And you move quicker than shadows.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.457
So are you really human?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:31.381
Just copy me, create a shadow of me,
then you can tell it do what you want.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:36.094
SHADOW SHIORI: You cocky little...
Okay, fine, then. I'll do just that.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.055
-(Hizuru choking)
-But first I have to end your life.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.142
-(grunts)
-Huh? Ugh.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:47.605
Ugh! You old hag!
You're hurting yourself, too, you know?

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.190
(groaning)

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.900
(grunts)

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.031
HIZURU: <i>What happened?</i>
<i>Was it not deep enough?</i>

00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.118
<i>That's weird, the first hammer strike</i>
<i>should've been fatal.</i>

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.953
<i>Something's different about this shadow.</i>

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:07.125
<i>Sorry about that, Sis,</i>
<i>I know you must've felt that.</i>

00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:10.044
<i>It went to the third floor.</i>

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:12.839
<i>It happened exactly like Sis said.</i>

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:14.591
(cell phone buzzes)

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:15.925
SHINPEI: Look. It's from her.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.010
Really?

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:18.553
CHANGE TO PLAN B

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:19.596
SHINPEI: Plan B.

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.642
-That means it's our turn now. Take it.
-Oh.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:27.312
This is where the rubber meets the road.

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:30.315
Let's find out
how serious you are about this.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:45.747
BEDROOM 2 (KIDS' ROOM)
NORTH BALCONY

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.709
HIZURU: <i>Third floor, north side window.</i>

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:57.050
DIARY
SHIORI KOBAYAKAWA

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.557
-It's useless.
-(Shadow Shiori gasps)

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.559
After you release the light to copy me,

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.978
you won't be able to move
for a few seconds.

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.230
(Shadow Shiori gasps)

00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:13.566
So I guess it really must take
a whole lot of effort

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.194
just to scan a single human
and get the info you need.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.239
Do you think I'll waste those few seconds?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.617
Get ready,
because the moment you try to copy me,

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.369
I'm going to kill you.

00:12:24.452 --> 00:12:25.328
(gasps)

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.497
HIZURU: For sure this time.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:29.791
You're no fun.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.834
(ominous music)

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.176
SHADOW SHIORI: Bye-bye.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.262
(thrilling music)

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.106
This is Plan B!

00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:59.904
(yells)
The third shot...

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.285
Bring it on! Ahh!

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:10.707
Huh? You're running away now?
Get back here!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.376
Damn it!

00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:22.593
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:25.013
Shinpei!

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:27.307
(both groaning)

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.434
No, please stop.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:32.228
SHINPEI: You little...
Was it you? Did you do it!?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.147
Get the hell off me, you disgusting rat.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.607
Did you do it? Did you kill Ushio?

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.152
(Shinpei groans)

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.198
-(Shadow Shiori grunting)
-That's enough. You can let go, Shinpei.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:47.660
NEZU: We've got it now.
It can't move an inch from here on out.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:52.582
One or two isn't gonna cut it, though.
We'll nail it down in three spots.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.333
That'll guarantee it doesn't move.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.252
(grunting)

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:59.213
And once a shadow gets stuck
in place like this,

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.758
it becomes a hell
of a lot easier to capture it.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.385
SHINPEI: Huh? Uh... You say capture?

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.597
Wait, so that was your plan
from the start?

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.514
That's right.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.058
Uh... Well, I didn't know that!

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:13.352
'Cause I didn't tell you.
I didn't expect you to be useful.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.981
SHINPEI: <i>This is a big deal.</i>
<i>We actually captured Shiori.</i>

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:18.858
<i>It'll change the future.</i>

00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.904
Once the shadow's body
is completely pinned down like this,

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.614
I guess it has no way to escape.

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:29.327
Neither of us knew this before, Shinpei.
Thanks to you we didn't lose it.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.369
(gasps)

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.457
If it were just the two of us,
we would have failed for sure.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.750
(chuckles)

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.628
Well, damn, you've got some real guts
for a youngin', don't you?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.463
NEZU: Good job.

00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:45.885
(Shadow Shiori giggling)

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.845
HIZURU: What's so funny?

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.933
This shadow is different from the others.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.602
I chose plan B, so we can examine it.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.521
SHINPEI: Uh, what do you mean, different?

00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:01.109
Hang on, first, we need to get it
to answer the question Shinpei asked.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:05.530
Was it you who killed Ushio Kofune,
and created her shadow afterward?

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:12.662
Ahh. My big Sis Ushio, huh.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.373
SHADOW SHIORI: Yep. I killed her.

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.292
It was me who strangled her to death.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.628
(grunts)

00:15:22.672 --> 00:15:28.427
So you killed her... Why did you...
Why did you kill her?

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.347
So you just go around the island,

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.975
and you kill people and take their places?

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:35.935
What the hell do you want?

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.193
It's the end.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.156
SHADOW SHIORI: After this summer,
it's all going to be over.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:49.490
(gasps)

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:54.871
All of us are going to go home.
Our whole family is going home.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.958
What'd you say?
What are you talking about?

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.294
(Shadow Shiori giggling)

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:04.005
SHADOW SHIORI: Come on,
don't be so afraid, Shinpei.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.717
Listen, Shinpei, you don't understand me.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.262
My human self was killed off
by one of the shadows,

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:14.432
but before I died,
the shadow made a perfect copy of me,

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:16.184
my body and mind, and my memories.

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:21.189
So, yes, I am Shiori Kobayakawa.
I was just born into the world again.

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.275
I know you're lying!
You're not the real Shiori!

00:16:24.358 --> 00:16:27.820
It was you who killed her,
along with her entire family!

00:16:31.908 --> 00:16:33.534
(soft chuckle)

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.496
SHADOW SHIORI: I really hope you become
a shadow soon, too, Shinpei.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.956
Just come with us.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:43.336
Please? You could become my big brother.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.339
-(grunting)
-(Shadow Shiori chuckling)

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:50.551
(thuds)

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.267
That's enough chatting for now.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.354
You can get confused
if you talk to a shadow too long.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:04.899
(panting)

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.861
(Shinpei sucks teeth)
SHINPEI: Damn it!

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.323
NEZU: That sure was a tough one.

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:15.451
How did you kill Asako
and Tatsuo's shadows?

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.787
The usual method,
one blow with the hammer.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:20.957
If you manage to hit
a large enough portion

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.417
of the flat shadow
with the hammer, it's fatal.

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:27.713
We just don't have enough samples yet
to prove my sister's theory correct.

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:32.885
It was saying some pretty strange things
about its family going home and whatnot.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:33.970
(Hizuru sighs)

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.268
SHINPEI: Copies,
so the copies are acting exactly

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:41.852
like the humans themselves?

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:44.605
NEZU: It said it was born
into the world again.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:48.568
How is an exact copy different
from the original person?

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.405
That was a major theme in <i>Swampman.</i>
Right, Ryunosuke?

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.282
-Uh... Huh?
-What are you thinking?

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:58.995
NEZU: I told him
about that so-called split personality.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.916
Oh, is that right?
Hi there, it's nice to meet you.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.254
I'm Ryunosuke Minakata.
I was Hizuru Minakata's brother.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.841
So, are you the author
of all those mystery novels,

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.134
or is it your sister?

00:18:13.217 --> 00:18:18.180
Oh, no, all of those were my sister.
I'm not a good writer at all.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.684
I'm really just here for support,
I come out in her interviews,

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.644
or when she has to socialize at a party.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:27.231
You've read all of her books,
haven't you, Shinpei?

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.983
Oh, well, I, uh, actually I've read, uh...

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.152
He's a huge nerd, a total Nagumo nerd.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.738
Oh, no kidding, you're a super-fan.

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:36.782
Honestly, I'm a little surprised
that wasn't on the recording.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.534
I guess she was embarrassed...

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.077
(groaning)

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.622
What the... What the hell are you doing?

00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:43.789
(grunts)

00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:48.753
HIZURU: We need to set
a few things straight, okay?

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:49.670
(gasps)

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:53.299
I am not embarrassed about anything,
and I have nothing to hide.

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:54.592
I just have a tendency

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:57.887
-to omit unnecessary info.
-SHINPEI: Ms. Nagumo, your're bleeding!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.430
Are you all right?

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:01.849
No, and you need to be careful
what you say!

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.810
SHINPEI: <i>Does letting down</i>
<i>her hair turn her into Hizuru?</i>

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:08.272
Don't let the shadows trick you
with their outward appearance, Shinpei.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.942
They might appear to you as a friend
or a member of your family,

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.819
but you can't afford to hesitate.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:16.030
Save your contemplation
about the similarity

00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.574
of copies and originals,
that's for when everything's over.

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:23.245
HIZURU: It was too late
for the Kobayakawas.

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.707
However, there is still time for you.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.459
(exhales deeply)

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.546
HIZURU: Is it true
that you can kill Mio's shadow?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.426
NEZU: All right, Shinpei,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.553
I'll wait outside on the street here
until it's time.

00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:42.223
HIZURU:
We should probably exchange numbers.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.767
So you can tell me
if something unexpected happens.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.186
All you have to do is try to act

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:50.147
the exact same you did before,
assess the situation.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.525
You'll be the observer.

00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.152
Right.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.447
SHINPEI: Hi, I'm home!

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:01.784
Sorry I'm so late. Mio?

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.953
-(Shinpei gasps)
-Huh?

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.330
Welcome home, Shin-chan.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.836
(gasps)
SHINPEI: No way.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.839
Ah, it really stings!

00:20:14.922 --> 00:20:19.051
God, what's with these onions?
My eyes feel like they're on fire!

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:22.596
-SHINPEI: Huh?
-I can't see anything! It really hurts!

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.181
Wait a sec. What are you cooking?

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.975
Duh, what does it look like?

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.145
I wanted to do a stir fry
with white onions, vegetables

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.731
-and some chicken breast.
-Hey, be careful with that!

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:36.444
SHINPEI: <i>That's weird, Mio never cooked</i>
<i>in any of the loops before.</i>

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:37.903
Why are you cooking?

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:41.532
Shin-chan. You didn't look
so good in the morning,

00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:46.203
so I just thought that I'd make
something special just for you.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.540
SHINPEI: Oh. I see. Thanks a lot.

00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:51.584
But leave the rest to me, okay?

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.878
I'd hate to see
you cut yourself, you know?

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:56.464
Hey, don't worry. I'm feeling just fine.

00:20:57.423 --> 00:20:59.258
MIO: I'll wash my face.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.012
SHINPEI: <i>Thank goodness,</i>
<i>Mio isn't a shadow,</i>

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.639
<i>and I can still make curry with this.</i>

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.351
<i>-Sometimes she can just be so cute.</i>
-(tap water running)

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:13.147
<i>What am I thinking?</i>
<i>I can't change anything else.</i>

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:18.235
<i>Ugh, I screwed up. The way I acted</i>
<i>already changed Mio's behavior tonight.</i>

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:22.072
<i>I'll just make curry,</i>
<i>and everything will be the same as before.</i>

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:26.452
<i>Yeah. As if Ms. Nagumo and Nezu</i>
<i>weren't waiting outside,</i>

00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:28.537
<i>armed and ready to rush in at any moment.</i>

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:33.793
<i>Apart from finding</i>
<i>and killing the shadows,</i>

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.669
<i>I need to do exactly the same things.</i>

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:39.507
<i>Any changes I make</i>
<i>will affect other events, like dominoes.</i>

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.716
<i>It's all connected.</i>

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.177
<i>Then the future I saw</i>
<i>will be useless to me.</i>

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.637

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.016

00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.851
Wow. Are you really that...

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:54.146

00:21:57.817 --> 00:21:58.901
USHIOH: Yeah.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.986
