HITOGASHIMA

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.506
MAN: <i>We hope you enjoyed</i>
<i>traveling with us.</i>

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.090
<i>Please watch your step. Have a nice day.</i>

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:10.219
Mm.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.393
HIZURU: <i>That man is a shadow.</i>

00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.648
<i>Which definitely adds</i>
<i>some credibility to that message.</i>

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:24.441
(insects chirping)

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.277
(gasps)

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.239
(panting)

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.035
(theme music)

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:09.838
MIO: Welcome home, Shin-chan!
(Mio chuckling)

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.256
Hey!

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.174
MIO: You have a nice trip?

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.675
-"Shin-chan"?
-MIO: I wanna hear everything!

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.428
-Shin... Shinpei?
-SHINPEI: Leave it to me!

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:17.971
HIZURU: Shinpei Ajiro.

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:19.389
(water splashes)

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.183
Shinpei Ajiro.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.685
-HIZURU: That boy on the ferry.
-Shin-chan!

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.773
-MIO: Shin-chan!
-HIZURU: <i>No, it can't be him.</i>

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:28.899
Oh.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.151
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:37.324
HIZURU: <i>Funeral? Kofune? Ushio.</i>

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.076
SHINPEI: Ushio!

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.578
(pensive music)

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:46.291
HIZURU: <i>It's currently 11:45 a. m.</i>
<i>I'm at the funeral parlor.</i>

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:48.210
<i>The deceased is Ushio Kofune.</i>

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.921
<i>I know her from around the island.</i>

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.640
-MASAHITO: Hizuru-chan?
-Huh?

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.267
MASAHITO: Ah, I thought that was you!

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:08.063
Hizuru Minakata. That right?

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:11.942
You have a good memory, Masahito Karikiri.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.487
No way, you look fantastic.
How long has it been?

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.448
Uh, about 14 years, I think.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.158
HIZURU: <i>I'm in his shadow, seems fine.</i>

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.369
MASAHITO: No.
Has it really been that long?

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:23.870
HIZURU: <i>He's not one of them.</i>

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:28.208
Is Ushio related to the family
that owns Bistro Kofune?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.212
Yeah, she is. She passed
in an accident yesterday.

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.590
Are you here
because you heard about Ushio?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.217
No.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.471
MASAHITO: Oh, then what are you here for?
You're not back for good, are you?

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.223
No, I live in Tokyo and--

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.686
Wait! Stop, stop! Just let me guess!
You were always smart, so I'm gonna say...

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.230
-you must be a big corporate attorney...
-Oh, god, now it's all coming back to me.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.524
-or maybe a doctor?
-I could never stand being around you

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.900
for five minutes.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:56.194
Turns out I still can't.
Guess nothing's changed.

00:03:56.278 --> 00:03:58.029
(laughs)

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.781
-You were always such a jokester!
-Ugh!

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.324
-It's not a joke, you windbag!
-Oh.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.951
MASAHITO: Hey, Alain.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.704
-You remember who this is?
-(grunts)

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.247
You'll be shocked when I tell you.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.375
-Ready for this? Her name is--
-I'm Hizuru Minakata.

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.503
-Come on! You totally blew the big reveal!
-Huh? Hizuru?

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.422
Hizuru, that you?

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.176
It's been a long time, Alain.

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.137
HIZURU: <i>It was my second year</i>
<i>of Junior High.</i>

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.390
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.896
HIZURU: <i>I went to Bistro Kofune</i>
<i>a lot back then.</i>

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:36.151
<i>Alain had two little daughters,</i>
<i>Ushio and Mio.</i>

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.404
<i>Alain's wife died</i>
<i>soon after she gave birth to Mio.</i>

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:44.618
<i>And when Alain went to work,</i>
<i>customers usually looked after the girls.</i>

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:46.661
Read me this picture book!

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:51.958
-HIZURU: This isn't a picture book.
-Hey, you can't read her that!

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:57.172
Not fair! Read it! Read it to me!
Read it! Read it! Read it!

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:02.636
You know, maybe you'd rather hear
one of my epic original stories instead?

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.597
Huh? Or… Original?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.974
Oh! Lucky you, Ushio.

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:09.810
Hizuru's newest masterpiece.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.980
HIZURU: "A very long time ago,
on an island..."

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.945
HIZURU: <i>Death is inevitable,</i>
<i>it comes for us all.</i>

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.948
(gloomy music)

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.701
HIZURU: <i>Ryunosuke, it's been 14 years.</i>

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:31.456
<i>Clearly enough time has passed</i>
<i>for another one to have died.</i>

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.167
What happened? Did you say you fell?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.961
What's the matter?

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.255
It sounds like Mio and Shinpei

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.881
-fell into the ocean.
-(Hizuru gasps)

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.508
ALAIN: Needless to say,
they'll be a little late.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:45.095
I'm sorry to hear that.
Let's wait a while, then.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.348
HIZURU: Alain, who's this Shinpei
you mentioned?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.435
Shinpei? You don't know him.
He came here after you left the island.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.855
He's a young man named Shinpei Ajiro.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.608
He's actually my friend's son,
but I took him in a long time ago.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.029
HIZURU: <i>Shinpei Ajiro.</i>

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:05.115
Was it ten years ago now?

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.368
He lost his parents
in a tragic boating accident.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.745
After that, he was all alone,
he didn't have any relatives--

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:11.830
Excuse me.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.165
ALAIN: Oh, Hizuru.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:16.960
What the...

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.385
HIZURU: <i>The boy who was sitting</i>
<i>in front of me on the ferry,</i>

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.638
<i>that was the Shinpei Ajiro</i>
<i>Alain's talking about.</i>

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:34.311
<i>I should avoid meeting him.</i>
<i>I can't, right now.</i>

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.355
<i>I can't afford to trust anyone yet.</i>

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.107
Wait a minute, Hizuru!

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.568
HIZURU: Uh... Ligature marks?

00:06:42.152 --> 00:06:47.198
ALAIN: Yes. They said it looked like
someone was trying to strangle her,

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:48.783
and she put up a fight.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:52.495
Wait a second, Alain.
Are the police idiots, or what?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.373
The attacker's DNA, like blood or skin,

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.792
is still on the victim's
fingernails sometimes.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.837
So did they bother to check
her fingernails?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.714
ALAIN: Hm, no.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:04.591
HIZURU: Unbelievable.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.804
Doesn't this remind you
of that time a while back?

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:10.805
HIZURU: Oh...

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.602
ALAIN: It was around 14 years ago
when Ryunosuke died.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.689
(crying)
No, Ryunosuke!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.150
HIZURU: Heine!

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.111
-HIZURU: Move!
-(crowd gasps)

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.237
MAN 1: Why?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.492
-(grunts)
-MAN 2: Whoa!

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.206
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.832
(grunts)
Don't touch me!

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.251
TETSU: What the hell is this?
Don't think I won't arrest you.

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:43.296
HIZURU: <i>Nothing seems unusual</i>
<i>at first, but...</i>

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.801
(ominous music)

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.305
Who did the makeup for this body?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:57.352
I think it was...
It was a nurse at the Hishigata Clinic.

00:07:57.936 --> 00:08:00.855
What is this? The dead deserve respect.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:05.068
It's okay, doctor. Don't worry.
She's a friend of the family.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.779
Who's really being disrespectful here?

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.780
HISHIGATA: Hm?

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:11.866
Hizuru.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:14.953
ALAIN: Hizuru.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.957
Sorry about that. I'll get going.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.335
It was because I said
all that nonsense before.

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.212
Just forget about it.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.716
HIZURU: Before I go,
I have one last question for you, Alain.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:28.717
ALAIN: Hm?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.471
Did Ushio ever mention her doppelgänger
before she passed away?

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.182
-ALAIN: Doppel...
-ASAKO: Hizuru?

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.025
Isokone... Asako Isokone.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.944
I always wanted to get in touch with you,

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.865
but, you know, you never gave me
your address or your phone number.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.075
Are you doing okay?

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:56.369
Depends on how you define "okay,"

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.456
but at least my heart
is still beating, I guess.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.457
(Asako chuckles)

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.542
You haven't changed at all.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.420
ASAKO: <i>Do you remember much about Ushio?</i>

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.337
HIZURU: <i>Yeah.</i>

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:10.550
At the wake yesterday, we got together
and shared a lot of stories about her,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.677
like how I always changed her diapers.

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:17.640
(Asako sobs)
Why did... Why did this happen to her?

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:21.603
Ushio saved my daughter's life, you know?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.857
ALAIN: It's all right, that's just
the kind of person Ushio was.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.069
All that matters now
is that your Shiori is safe.

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:33.990
HIZURU: <i>Give me a break.</i>
<i>What's it crying about? Stop it.</i>

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:38.453
This disgusting, phony charade
makes me sick.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.496
(Asako sobbing)

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.914
HIZURU: <i>Damn shadow.</i>

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.875
-TATSUO: Asako.
-HIZURU: Hm?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:52.258
HIZURU: <i>My guess is Asako</i>
<i>is probably already dead.</i>

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.887
<i>"Ushio saved my daughter's life?"</i>

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.390
<i>"Why did this happen to her?" What a lie.</i>

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.813
<i>How dare you come in here</i>
<i>pretending to be Asako,</i>

00:10:05.647 --> 00:10:07.816
<i>mocking Alain and Ushio in the process?</i>

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.912
NEZU: So you're telling me
all three Kobayakawas are shadows?

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:25.667
Yes. No doubt about it.
Believe me, I confirmed it myself.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.211
The shadows are multiplying.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.588
NEZU: Seems to me like
it only takes one of them

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.842
-to propagate and make more shadows.
-HIZURU: Hmm...

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.804
The shadows I know
aren't capable of something like that.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.140
HIZURU: What is happening on this island?

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.601
Who knows? I have no idea about that.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.603
HIZURU: How about this theory?

00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:50.984
One day a shadow attacks Shiori Kobayakawa
while she's in the water.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.947
<i>It kills and erases the real Shiori,</i>
<i>deciding to pose</i>

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.908
<i>as the vulnerable</i>
<i>and aggrieved little girl.</i>

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:01.369
<i>But then Mio saves the shadow Shiori.</i>

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.499
After that,
it mercilessly kills Shiori's parents

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:09.502
-and replaces them with shadows.
-(Hizuru sobbing)

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:14.507
NEZU: Are you... Are you crying?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.136
Looks like it's gonna snow tomorrow.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.139
-HIZURL: It never snows this time of year.
-NEZU: Ow!

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:23.391
(Nezu grunts)

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.059
HIZURU: If anything, it'll rain,

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:29.647
but the forecast for tomorrow
is sunny and clear.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.066
Get your facts straight.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:34.527
NEZU: What is this?

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:39.782
HIZURI: That's my secondary cell phone.
Please let me know if it rings at all.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.995
I need you to do something for me.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.386
HITOGASHIMA HALL

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.473
SHINPEI: <i>I'm gonna follow</i>
<i>my memory like last time,</i>

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.350
<i>and repeat the funeral again.</i>

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.645
<i>Same movements. Same conversations.</i>

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:13.441
(inaudible)

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:20.990
Listen, Shiori. I heard you saw
someone who looked like you.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:25.495
Be careful. That could be
a monster called a shadow.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:32.168
If you see her again,
just try to stay away from her, okay?

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:34.921
SHINPEI: <i>I'm repeating everything I did,</i>

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:38.883
<i>but this version of Shiori</i>
<i>isn't doing anything to me.</i>

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.888
<i>Coffin comes in at one.</i>

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.016
<i>Good. It's all going well.</i>

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.227
SHADOW ASAKO: Hey, Shinpei.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.311
SHINPEI: Oh.

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:55.984
Did Mio tell you
that Shiori maybe saw something...

00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.236
a look-alike or a shadow?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.656
Oh, yeah. When she was...
she was little...

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:02.865
(gasps)

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.618
SHINPEI: <i>Huh? Both of them.</i>

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.247
Shinpei, you okay?

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.793
Ah, yep. So when Mio was a little girl,
her grandma told her about it.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.670
Sorry that probably sounded weird.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.172
-SHADOW TATSUO: Asako, let's go.
-SHADOW ASAKO: Okay.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:20.967
SHINPEI: <i>It can't be.</i>

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:26.597
<i>Are all three of them shadows?</i>

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.310
<i>So then the real three are already...</i>

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.313
<i>Come on. Where are you, Ms. Nagumo?</i>

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.273
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.276
Hey, Shin-chan.

00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:40.111
-Uh...
-Hey. Are you okay?

00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.487
(Shinpei sighs)

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:44.615
SHINPEI: Mio, can I ask you something?

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:50.496
Were you wearing
white underwear yesterday?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.497
(Mio gasps)

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.792
That's really the first thing you ask me
after being away for two years?

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.296
Mio, it's very important I know
what color your underwear were.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.673
MIO: What happened to you, Shin-chan?

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.801
SHINPEI: <i>Right before Mio's</i>
<i>shadow killed me the last time,</i>

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.262
<i>I accidentally saw up her dress,</i>

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:08.973
<i>and the shadow's underwear were white.</i>

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.184
<i>But the ones Mio had on weren't.</i>

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.229
Well, yesterday I went home
after the wake, and I changed.

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:19.150
Yeah, the... the new pair
I changed into were white,

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.943
so what does that matter?

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.446
SHINPEI: <i>That means Mio</i>
<i>was copied yesterday.</i>

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.990
<i>I don't think there's any way</i>
<i>to prevent that.</i>

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:29.702
<i>I have to kill it. I have to protect Mio.</i>

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:31.079
(metal creaks)

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.295
MIOH: So you don't know, either, Dad?

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.546
(static)

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.674
Do you have any idea where Sis went?

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.302
MIOH: Didn't think so.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:52.642
SHINPEI: <i>It's 1:30.</i>
<i>Ushio is cremated in her coffin.</i>

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.729
<i>After that, we have lunch</i>
<i>before we pick up the ashes.</i>

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.356
(indistinct chatter)

00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.275
SHINPEI: <i>There are really two questions</i>
<i>I want to ask people.</i>

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:08.574
Huh? Oh. The ghost story?

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.786
You know, it's funny,
someone just asked me something similar.

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.205
Well, of course, I know about it.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:18.543
Actually, my great-grandfather named it.
He called it "shadow sickness."

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:22.046
It is true that a peculiar type
of mental illness did occur

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.923
among certain isolated groups.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:32.348
(Tetsu laughs)
I saw her! She's a G cup.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.351
Are you talking about Hizuru, by chance?

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.311
Don't know who you mean.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:41.190
Shinpei, I'm pretty sure
you know Hizuru, don't you?

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:44.777
She used to come over
to our place all the time, remember?

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.404
Huh? To our place?

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:48.406
SHINPEI: <i>How did we never meet?</i>

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:51.492
ALAIN: By the way, Shinpei.
Can you take a quick look at this?

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:55.413
I asked Hizuru for her number,
but she just gave me this instead.

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.374
I can't seem to figure it out.
Maybe you can.

00:15:58.457 --> 00:15:59.417
(gasps)

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.336
SHINPEI: <i>Ms. Nagumo's contact info.</i>

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.005
This... This is...

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:06.299
Excuse me, Shinpei. Nature calls.

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:11.971
SHINPEI: <i>Hmm... I think this is</i>
<i>the unbreakable code from that case</i>

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.224
<i>in her novel,</i> Drifting Ashore.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.934
(door opens)

00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:26.861
(door opens)

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:28.738
(door closes)

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.240
(approaching footsteps)

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.412
(line ringing)

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:45.171
-Hi there. Is this Ms. Nagumo?
-NEZU: Hmm? Who the hell is this?

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.423
(Shinpei gasps)
Uh... This is...

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.217
SHINPEI: <i>It's not Ms. Nagumo.</i>

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.261
My name is Shinpei Ajiro. Who is this?

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:55.765
NEZU: <i>I see.</i>
<i>That was faster than I thought.</i>

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.602
My name is Nezu. Ginjiro Nezu.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:03.606
But Ms. Nagumo is, uh,
an acquaintance of mine.

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:08.027
Now, how exactly did you get this number?

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.322
SHINPEI: <i>Well, Ms. Nagumo</i>
<i>gave Alain this number in code.</i>

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.866
NEZU: <i>And you cracked it, didn't you?</i>

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.871
Uh, yes. There was actually
a similar code in one of her books.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.500
NEZU: <i>Ah, are you</i>
<i>at the crematorium right now?</i>

00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.043
SHINPEI: Uh, yes.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:29.257
NEZU: Leave when I hang up,
and go to the funeral hall. Go alone.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.217
(Nezu clears throat)

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.885
I'll contact you later.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.263
Uh, excuse me! Hello...

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:38.182
(line beeping)

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.478
(door opens)

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.859
(static)

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.612
OUT OF ORDER

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:55.575
(toilet flushing)

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:05.001
Hmm... It's open.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.752
-What the...
-(metal clanks)

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:09.380
(phone buzzing)

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:13.843
Oh. Hello? Mr. Nezu? I... I made it.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.846
SHINPEI: <i>So, what should I do now?</i>

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:20.266
Don't move a muscle.
Just stay where you are.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.269
Like you're a scarecrow
standing in a field.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:24.854
NEZU: It will be over soon.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.771
Huh?

00:18:26.397 --> 00:18:27.315
NEZU: There.

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.316
(gunshot)

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.862
Huh?

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:40.161
HIZURU: Time and place. Of course,
you'd attack when Alain is alone.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:43.789
But I predicted 17 different patterns.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.875
You chose the bathroom.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:50.296
Why are you here? This is the men's...

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.345
Normal, huh?

00:18:57.428 --> 00:19:01.015
ALAIN: <i>What the... What was</i>
<i>all that racket in the next stall?</i>

00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.850
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.445
SHINPEI: <i>Ms. Nagumo.</i>
<i>I can finally meet her.</i>

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:21.118
HIZURU: <i>If you really can,</i>
<i>go back in time to the 22nd,</i>

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:25.331
<i>just remember to tell me your name,</i>
<i>and I'll save you.</i>

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:28.334
SHINPEI: <i>If we work together</i>
<i>from the beginning,</i>

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:30.252
<i>we can kill Mio's shadow.</i>

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:35.216
<i>How does she even know</i>
<i>about shadows in the first place?</i>

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.218
<i>I have so many questions.</i>

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:39.303
(Shinpei gasps)

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.600
-SHINPEI: Hello, Mr. Nezu. Right?
-Hmm...

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:49.188
NEZU: Huh? This is the first time
we've met, right?

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:54.610
Oh, of course! You, uh, found out...
found out about shadows, too?

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.446
If you have a bunch of questions,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.949
I'm going to need you
to answer mine first, all right?

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.954
NEZU: To break the code you saw
from Ms. Nagumo's novel,

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:08.666
you need to know Ryunosuke Nagumo
and her real name.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.460
But Hizuru has been careful
not to tell anyone

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:14.672
that she is, in fact,
the real Ryunosuke Nagumo.

00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:18.968
So, really, the only one out there
who could possibly know enough

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.721
to call this number is Hizuru's shadow.

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:25.057
-HIZURU: But it turns out you're human.
-Oh.

00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:26.851
(gasps)

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.894
SHINPEI: Ms. Nagumo.

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:34.775
NEZU: <i>So...</i>

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:39.905
SHINPEI: It's...
It's S-H-I-N-P-E-I A-J-I-R-O.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:44.702
Please make it out to Shinpei Ajiro!
I'd... I'd love your autograph.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:48.497
I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.250
I have all of your books!
I read them over and over.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.043
SHINPEI: <i>I told you my name</i>
<i>like you asked.</i>

00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:56.046
<i>Even with the bird's-eye view,</i>
<i>I sound like such an idiot.</i>

00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:58.507
<i>Okay. What next?</i>

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:03.721
Even with the current situation,
you aren't normal.

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:08.184
Lord Byron said,
"Truth is stranger than fiction."

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:10.895
Honestly, I'm not big on fantasy,

00:21:10.978 --> 00:21:13.189
but when I see
what's possible in the world,

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:15.483
I come to the same conclusion.

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:16.400
TO SHINPEI AJIRO
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:18.152
(gasps)

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.864
Wow. Thank you so much.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:25.785
Feel free to correct me if I have
the wrong impression about things.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.996
On the ferry this morning,
you didn't know who I was.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:33.667
No one knows who I am unless I choose
to tell them the truth about myself.

00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.212
But I never told you who I am.

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:42.259
HIZURU: This is not the first time
you're living through the same July 22nd.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:45.596
I think you must have repeated
this day many times.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.097
(Shinpei gasps softly)

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:53.437
So in other words, you're a time traveler.

00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:55.856
(sucks teeth)

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:58.400
That's right.

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:02.029
(closing theme music)
