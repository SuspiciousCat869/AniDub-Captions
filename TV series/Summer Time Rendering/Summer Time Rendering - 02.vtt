SOU: Hurry! Call an ambulance!

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.393
Oh, Sis. No.

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:20.103
-(Mio panting)
-Huh?

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:21.730
(Sou grunting)

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:25.108
Ushio! Tokiko, go to the school
and get the AED!

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.610
It's on the pillar by the entrance!

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.611
SHINPEI: <i>Sou...</i>

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.029

-SHINPEI: <i>What are...</i>
-SOU: Come on!

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.743

-SOU: Ushio! Open your eyes!

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:36.328
-(Sou grunting)
-Sis, don't...

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.622

-(gasps)
-SOU: Come back! Please! Come back!

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.753
Ushio!

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.715
(grunting)

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.301
What the...

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:58.016
(whimpers)
I didn't mean to! I'm so sorry!

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.143
SHINPEI: I'm sorry I didn't mean to!

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:02.354
I'm sorry, really, I...

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:03.313
(slaps)

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.857
HITOGASHIMA

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.318
SHINPEI: I... I'm so, so sorry!

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.779
HIZURU: Are you okay?

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.614
Huh?

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:17.077
Seemed like you were having a bad dream.
So how bad was that nightmare?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.037
Uh, my dream?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.249
(gasps)

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.420
SHINPEI: <i>This woman...</i>

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:27.963
(gasps)

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:35.345
Have... Have you ever, by any chance,
been shot before?

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.597
Huh?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.766
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.727
Uh, actually, never mind.

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.063
SHINPEI: <i>It's odd, I feel like</i>
<i>this woman's slapped me</i>.

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:46.732
<i>once or twice before this moment.</i>

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.734
I feel fine, it's nothing, really.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:53.196
I was dreaming about a movie.
(awkward chuckle)

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.156
(gasps)

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:57.117
SHINPEI: <i>Wait, it's July 22nd?</i>

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.329
Wait. What in the world is going on here?

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:03.749
SHINPEI: <i>I went up to Hiruko shrine,</i>
<i>Mio came with me.</i>

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.500
<i>That was on the 23rd.</i>

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:06.793
(inaudible)

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.087
<i>Mio was murdered by her shadow.</i>

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:13.967
<i>No. Don't be ridiculous.</i>
<i>That must have been a dream.</i>

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:24.061
SHINPEI: <i>Ryunosuke Nagumo.</i> Swampman.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.108
<i>A horror mystery novel set in Wakayama.</i>

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:34.780
<i>The story goes like this,</i>

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.866
<i>a young girl becomes paranoid</i>
<i>that her family and friends</i>

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.702
<i>have all been replaced</i>
<i>by evil, look-alike phantoms.</i>

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.500
<i>I was reading it right</i>
<i>before I fell asleep.</i>

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.752
<i>That explains the nightmare.</i>

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.259
That's right.

00:03:07.938 --> 00:03:09.981
(theme music)

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.666
(birds squawking)

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.461
SHINPEI: <i>Just... Wait a second.</i>

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:55.921
<i>Take it easy.</i>

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:57.547
(waves crashing)

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:01.259
<i>In moments like these,</i>
<i>you have to see the big picture.</i>

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.303
<i>Just calm down.</i>

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:08.308
<i>I'm home for the first time</i>
<i>in two whole years,</i>

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.061
<i>because my friend Ushio passed away.</i>

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.232
<i>I don't know why it feel like...</i>

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.193
<i>I just did the exact same thing yesterday?</i>

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.528
Ugh. Uh?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.614
MIO: Hey!

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.991
-Huh?
-Welcome home, Shin-chan!

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:25.992
(laughs)
Hey!

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:26.993
SHINPEI: <i>What is this?</i>

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.329
<i>-Is it deja vu?</i>
-You have a nice trip?

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.832
-I wanna hear everything!
-SHINPEI: <i>Is that what's happening to me?</i>

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:33.917
Ah!

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.335
(yelps)

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:36.795
(Mio yelps)

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.880
SHINPEI: <i>She's even wearing</i>
<i>the same underwear.</i>

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.884
(gasps)

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.511
SHINPEI: Mio, use your brakes next time!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.847
I did use my brakes.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:48.765
SHINPEI: Come on.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.520
MIO: That's really weird.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.982
(gasps)

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.194
(tense music)

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.534
SHINPEI: <i>Everything after that</i>
<i>was the same,</i>

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.953
<i>like watching a movie on repeat.</i>

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.541
FUNERAL OF USHIO KOFUNE

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.042
MIO: Hi, Daddy!

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.170
Guess what? Shin-chan just got back!

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.090
SHINPEI: <i>Everyone acted like in the dream.</i>

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.134
<i>Said the same things.</i>

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.469
ALAIN: Shinpei.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.347
(Alain sobbing)

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.308
You're so tall now.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:34.519
It looks like you lost a little weight.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.109
(somber music)

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.779
SHINPEI: <i>This isn't deja vu</i>
<i>or a dream-turned-real.</i>

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.072
<i>It's more than that.</i>

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:50.243
<i>I am actually reliving July 22nd.</i>

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:55.957
<i>My head hurts like it's splitting in half.</i>
<i>My eyes are spasming.</i>

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.919
<i>What's happening, Ushio?</i>

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:02.631
SOU: <i>Well, here's the thing.</i>

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.884
<i>There was something on her neck,</i>
<i>ligature marks.</i>

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:09.471
<i>It's a sign</i>
<i>that she might have been strangled.</i>

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:23.318
SHINPEI: <i>So what really happened to you?</i>

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:31.785
WOMAN 1: ...about Ushio's body?
Doctor Hishigata did a full-blown autopsy.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.871
WOMAN 2: An autopsy?
Wow, that sounds really serious.

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.373
-(camera shutter clicks)
-Huh?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.166
SHINPEI: <i>That flash again.</i>

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.294
MAN: Excuse me, who was that?
No photos allowed in here!

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:48.551
SHINPEI: <i>And that's Shiori Kobayakawa.</i>

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:53.348
<i>The girl who Ushio sacrificed</i>
<i>her life to save.</i>

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:57.644
<i>If this is real.</i>
<i>If I really went back in time,</i>

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:01.356
<i>then her whole family</i>
<i>will disappear tomorrow.</i>

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.984
<i>And if the exact same thing</i>
<i>keeps happening...</i>

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.946
SOU: Shinpei!
(sobbing)

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.823
So glad you finally came back!

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.493
SHINPEI: <i>...then it would mean</i>
<i>that the shadow really does exist.</i>

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:19.457
(ship honks)

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.876
(birds squawking)

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.344
-(birds squawking)
-(waves crashing)

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.557
MIO: Thank you for this meal.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.518
-SHINPEI: <i>If you see the shadow, you die.</i>
-Mmm.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.894
MIO: So yummy.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.523
SHINPEI: <i>I wonder if Ushio was killed</i>
<i>by the shadow?</i>

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.067
<i>And Mio...</i>

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.363
-Shinpei?
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:52.949
(Mio grunts softly)

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.368
Hey, you look a little pale.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.039
SHINPEI: Sorry. I'm gonna go out
and get some fresh air.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:10.133
SHINPEI: <i>This morning, the brakes</i>
<i>on Mio's bike were totally ruined.</i>

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:15.472
<i>It looked like someone</i>
<i>must have cut them on purpose.</i>

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.475
(gasps)

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.437
<i>If somebody did that deliberately...</i>

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:28.109
(water trickling)

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.153
<i>...they were trying to kill Mio.</i>

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.031
<i>I can't...</i>

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:37.577
<i>I can't seem to see the big picture.</i>
<i>I'm confused.</i>

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.412
<i>I feel kind of sick.</i>

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:41.206
TETSU: Hm? What's the...

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.874
SHINPEI: <i>Totsumura?</i>

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.375
What are you up to, Mio?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:47.253
You're just staring at your own house?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.798
Did you get into... a fight with someone?

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.429
SHINPEI: <i>Mio?</i>

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:02.393
<i>What is she doing outside right now</i>
<i>in her school uniform?</i>

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.395

(flesh squelching)

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.115
-SHINPEI: <i>No.</i>
-(knife slicing)

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:16.241
<i>No.</i>

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.201
<i>No.</i>

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.246
<i>-No. No.</i>
-(body thuds)

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.497
<i>No.</i>

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.624
<i>No. No! No! No! No! No!</i>

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:30.004
<i>That's not... That's not Mio!</i>

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.965
<i>It's a shadow!</i>

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.636
(tense music)

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:46.771

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:15.425
(growling)

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.516
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.312
<i>A shadow?</i>

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.815
Okay. All righty, then.
(grunts)

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.487
(zaps)

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.371
MIOH: You are now the police officer
Tetsu Totsumura.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:49.375
Mm-hm.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.797
Uh, my name is Tetsu Totsumura,
34 years old.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.133
No girlfriend and no promotion in sight.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.010
Mind your own business.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.847
Mio, hey. You're looking cute as usual.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.474
-Give me your gun.
-Uh...

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.936
What? You haven't switched places yet?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.063
MIOH: I missed my chance this morning.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.943
It would have been a lot easier to do it
if she was in the hospital.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.905
(scoffs) Seems unlike you to go
through all that trouble. Mm.

00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.908
SHADOW TETSU: Okay.
Go take care of it right now.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.117
You've got a gun.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.037
MIOH: But a gunshot
on a quiet night like this

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.872
would draw too much attention.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:30.124
This isn't America after all.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.626
Fair enough.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:37.090
I'm just checking things out,
for right now.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:43.930

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:50.645
SHINPEI: <i>No, this can't be.</i>
<i>Is this really happening!?</i>

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:51.813
-(cell phone buzzes)
-(gasps)

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:52.772
<i>My phone.</i>

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.610
<i>It's Sou! Not now!</i>
(gasps)

00:12:58.528 --> 00:12:59.570
Oh, shit.

00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:04.200
(groaning)

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.786
(flesh squelching)

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.331
This is where you were hiding, Shin-chan.

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.792
(gagging)

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:16.004
Know what you get for eavesdropping
around here, Shinpei?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:18.298
-You get the death penalty.
-(Shinpei groaning)

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.966
Do you wanna copy him, too?

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.677
(Shinpei coughing)

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.388
Not him. Not now.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.975
SHINPEI: <i>Is this my blood?</i>

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:35.565
<i>So thick and red. Oh, I must be dying.</i>

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:37.442
(Shinpei exhales heavily)

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.695
<i>I can finally see the big picture.</i>

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.741
<i>Huh?</i>

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.204
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.666
USHIO: Shinpei.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.585
Who is that?

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:56.794
USHIO: Just be careful.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.172
Make sure...

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.590
(voice breaking)

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:01.883
-...always...
-SHINPEI: <i>What?</i>

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:03.551
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.594
USHIO: ...see...

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:06.012
(grunts)

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:10.224
Take care of Mio. Please look after her.

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.434
(gasps)

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:14.604
(panting)

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:20.943
(gulps)

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.029
(panting)

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:36.084
SHINPEI: <i>Somehow, I'm back again.</i>

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.877
(groaning)

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.545
(cicadas chirping)

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.423
<i>Did I die? Am I dead?</i>

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:44.092
(groaning)

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:46.719
<i>I don't know why I came back.</i>

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.680
-(gasps)
-MIO: Hey!

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.308
(panting)
Welcome home, Shin-chan!

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.684
(laughs)
Hey!

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.645
SHINPEI: <i>Try to think of the big picture.</i>

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.898
<i>You heard what she said.</i>

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.608
<i>-It was Ushio's voice.</i>
-Uh...

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:03.069
SHINPEI: <i>She asked me to do something.</i>

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.029
<i>-Take care of Mio.</i>
-(Mio screams)

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.074
-SHINPEI: <i>Look after her.</i>
-I can't stop! I can't stop!

00:15:08.157 --> 00:15:11.119
-(Mio whimpering)
-Leave it to me!

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.411
(screams)

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.038
-What do I do?
-(groans)

00:15:14.664 --> 00:15:15.581
SHINPEI: <i>Oh! Crap!</i>

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.167
Shin-chan!

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.878
SHINPEI: <i>Oh, no. I really can't swim.</i>

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.683
(Mio panting)

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.976
Shin-chan, just breathe!

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:38.479
Mio... Are you okay?

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.273
Uh-huh.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.401
MIO: Thank you, Shin-chan.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.239
RECORDING

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.448
HIZURU: It's me.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.451
It's July 22nd at 1:02 p. m.

00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:56.164
I've been in Hitogashima
for 1 hour and 37 minutes.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.667
I ate <i>narezushi</i>
right before I board the ship.

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.462
It's a traditional dish
made by pickling mackerel with salt

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:06.465
instead of vinegar,
and fermenting it for over a month.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.925
It's just exquisite.

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:11.095
You have to try it
when you come to Wakayama.

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:12.471
Wonder if you'd like it.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:18.060
Oh, by the way, you asked me once
why I like to hang upside down sometimes.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:23.816
It's pretty simple. When the blood rushes
to my head, it helps me think clearly.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.776
(grunts)

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.404
You should definitely give it a try.

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.699
You never know, it might finally clear up
that clouded brain of yours.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.371
Everything else is in the report.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.714
Oh man, they're everywhere.
You're kidding me.

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.675
For now, I'll just observe. That's all.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:59.310
(phone rings)

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.064
<i>GAME PLAYBOY</i>

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:05.524
TETSU: Hi, ally of justice here.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.528
Huh? What'd you say?

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.656
TETSU: <i>Did you say a brawl?</i>

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:12.740
SHINPEI: Yes.

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.408
TETSU: <i>Hang on, is this Shinpei?</i>

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.702
-SHINPEI: Uh, yeah.
-TETSU: <i>Are you okay?</i>

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.288
-Yeah. It's by all the shops.
-<i>By all the shops?</i>

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.624
-Pretty sure it's a bar fight.
<i>-Oh, so, at the bar?</i>

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.875
Please come right away.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:25.294
(sighs)

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:34.178
SHINPEI: <i>Try to see</i>
<i>the bird's-eye-view right now.</i>

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.597
<i>I just have to survive today.</i>

00:17:42.103 --> 00:17:43.479
SHINPEI: Think I'll get in trouble?

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:48.568
That fake report should help
keep Totsumura away from here for now.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.905
I bet he'd be pretty pissed
if he knew it was fake,

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:56.492
but the important thing
is that he's safe, right, Ushio?

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.078
SHINPEI: <i>As for Sou,</i>

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.372
<i>I texted and told him</i>
<i>that I would call him tomorrow.</i>

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.503
<i>Also, I should delete unused apps</i>
<i>and photos.</i>

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.716
<i>There we go. Now I have a full seven gigs</i>
<i>of storage to spare.</i>

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.176
<i>Should be plenty of space</i>
<i>to record videos.</i>

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.722
<i>Time to silence incoming calls,</i>
<i>airplane mode.</i>

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.181
<i>Charge it up.</i>

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.142
<i>I should connect my mobile battery, too.</i>

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:27.565
<i>Thankfully, I know what time</i>
<i>it will come around.</i>

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.401
<i>Start recording.</i>

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.866
<i>If I can film Mio's shadow,</i>
<i>then I'll have proof.</i>

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.038
<i>And I... I'll make sure</i>
<i>I don't go outside,</i>

00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:43.456
<i>no matter how sick I feel.</i>

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.999
<i>Then I'll be okay.</i>

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.380
<i>I wasn't killed on the 22nd,</i>
<i>not the first time around.</i>

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:53.841
(gasps)

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:57.470
<i>My right eye is a different color.</i>

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.305
<i>Since when?</i>

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:01.641
(groans)

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:07.647
(water trickling)

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.689
(gasps)

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.194
SHINPEI: Mio is in there, right?

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.573
Mio...

00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.870
(water trickling)

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:26.707
(shaky breathing)

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.584
Mio!

00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:30.961
Huh?

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.589
(screams)

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.466
(groans)

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:36.926
MIO: Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.595
-SHINPEI: <i>Think about the big picture.</i>
-MIO: Ew! You big pervert!

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.097
What were you looking at, Shin-chan?

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:43.891
SHINPEI: <i>Mio is safe. Good!</i>

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.518
What are you doing?

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:46.727
(burbles)

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.323
SHINPEI: <i>Perfect.</i>

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.077
<i>I definitely got it on video.</i>

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.705
JULY 23

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:10.835
Huh?

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.796
Good morning. Hi, Shin-chan.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:15.923
Mio. Can I talk to you?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:18.259
Huh?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.597
SHINPEI: It showed up
in front of our house last night.

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.266
-(Mio gasps)
-Right around nine o'clock.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:30.271
It was looking upstairs, for five minutes,
then it walked off into the mountains.

00:20:30.688 --> 00:20:31.689
(gasps)

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:37.194
MIO: Who is... I... Is this...
Uh... Is this me?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:41.365
No, it's not. You were taking a bath
when I saw it outside.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.037
SHINPEI: Uh, I think
they call it a shadow.

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.998
(gasps)

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.377
Listen, Mio, you've heard
of the shadow sickness.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.422
It came 'cause it wanted...

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:59.133
-to kill you.
-(Mio gasps)

00:20:59.216 --> 00:21:02.094
MIO: I... I came to...
I came to... kill myself?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.139
Zoom in. On the hand. Take a look.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.059
(gasps)
MIO: It can't be.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.982
The shadow sickness wasn't a superstition.
I knew it wasn't.

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:19.445
Ushio saw a shadow, too, didn't she?

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:22.823
-(gasps)
-Three days before she died.

00:21:23.491 --> 00:21:29.413
MIO: Right. I guess Sis must have said
something to you about the shadow, right?

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:32.875
SHINPEI: <i>Hm? Well, I actually heard</i>
<i>about the shadow from you.</i>

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:38.172
<i>And I saw it with my own eyes.</i>
<i>I saw your shadow yesterday.</i>

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:39.298
(Shinpei groans)

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.598
Hey, Shin-chan.

00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:54.396
I think Sis... Sis might have been
killed by a shadow.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:00.027
(closing theme music)
