WEBVTT

00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:03.295
(gun clinks)

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.344
HIZURU: <i>Narezushi</i> isn't all that common
in Hitogashima.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.429
(Shinpei gasps)

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:17.893
I haven't had a chance to try it just yet.
What about yourself, huh?

00:00:18.477 --> 00:00:19.937
Huh? What?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.146
SHINPEI: <i>I know that woman.</i>

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.148
<i>From the ferry!</i>

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.943
(groaning)

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:26.860
(gasps)

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.321
The... The shadow?

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.657
SHINPEI: <i>It's gone!</i>

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.825
(thrilling music)

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.211
(blade clinks)

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:47.839
(gunshot)

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.261
(whimpers)

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:56.223
That's impressive. Do you have eyes
on the back of your head?

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:01.144
(hissing)

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.277
-(static)
-Why did you...

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:18.870
SHINPEI: <i>This... This can't be happening.</i>
<i>Did she just kill a shadow?</i>

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:21.790
(breathing heavily)

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.751
It's nice to meet you, I guess.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.004
(festival music in distance)

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:29.965
(groaning)

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.883
You know, I used to live here
when I was a kid.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.554
But I never got around
to trying <i>narezushi.</i>

00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:39.099
I'm really curious what it tastes like.

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:41.393
(Shinpei groans)

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.978
SHINPEI: Who are you?

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.023
Oh, my god. That's so rude of me.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:50.736
(static)

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.780
My name's Ryunosuke Nagumo.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:57.784
Nagu... Huh? Ryunosuke?

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:00.412
I arrived here just in time to save you.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:04.124
HIZURU: I'm sorry it took
as long as it did...

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.959
Shinpei Ajiro.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.252
(gasps)

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.963
(theme music)

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.388
Na... Nagumo...

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.349
HIZURU: Oh. This way!

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.851
(Shinpei yelps)

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:48.687
What... What is it?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.021
(shushes)

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:53.316
-A shadow.
-(gasps)

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.196
(panting)

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.993
SHINPEI: <i>Ushio!</i>

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.872
<i>I told it to just stay put inside!</i>

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:11.751
Hold on. It's dangerous up there.
The shadows are gathering.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.631
So... So you can...
So you can tell humans and shadows apart?

00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:21.511
HIZURU:
Shadows are pretty easy to identify,

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.973
they hide inside a lump of skin and bone
shaped like a human.

00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:28.643
For starters, always look at the ground.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:31.313
You can see their true form
in the flat shadow

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:32.397
they cast on the ground.

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.776
And they hate
when people walk on their shadows.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.153
If you try to step on them on purpose,

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.946
you'll notice
that only the shadow will move.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.783
(Shinpei inhales sharply)

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.620
HIZURU: I don't know this for sure,
but it seems like

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.372
shadows use light to scan
and analyze humans,

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.082
and absorb the information.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.627
My theory is that they process the info,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.755
and somehow use it to determine
who'll they'll feed on next.

00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.217
Shadows consume information
about us to survive.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:04.721
However, they have an insatiable craving
for the taste of real flesh.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:10.101
See that? That stain there
is from a shadow devouring a human body.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:11.937
(gasps)

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:16.399
These shadows
just keep targeting people on the island.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.860
HIZURU: And that goes for you, too.

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:22.489
It seems like
there are more and more every day,

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.574
no matter how many of them I take down.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.787
It feels like they're all
being controlled somehow.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.123
Like they're all working and moving
in the service of a single goal.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.042
(gasps)

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.294
SHINPEI: <i>A single goal.</i>

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.924
<i>"Mother will... will be awake soon."</i>

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.260
-(zaps)
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.387
SHINPEI: What was that light?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.722
(Shinpei grunts)

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:52.811
You can kill shadows with that gun,
right, Miss Nagumo?

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.233
That's... That's your name, right?
You're the writer.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.902
Ah... Ah, yeah, I am.

00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:05.073
Yes, I knew it! Please help me, okay?
I'm desperate here.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.909
I have a lot... I wanna ask you
but that's for another time.

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:08.994
SHINPEI: But right now...

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.413
Mio and all my friends

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.248
are just standing
out in the open up there.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:14.791
(grunts)

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:16.376
(panting)

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:21.756
HIZURU: Shinpei Ajiro.

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.720
Does he really think he's
going to save everyone, huh, Sis?

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.932
(panting)

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:35.520
SHINPEI: Toki!

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.273
Huh? Shinpei, that you?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.191
(panting)

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:43.904
Oh, thank god. Where's everyone? And Mio?

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:45.822
Toki...
(grunts)

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.532
(gasps)

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.621
TOKIKO: I'm so sorry.

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.539
-(Shinpei gasps)
-(Tokiko sobs)

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:57.083
No, not... not this...

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:01.880
I didn't get my hands dirty for this.
I... I never thought this would happen.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.423
-(knife pierces flesh)
-(groans)

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.134
(whimpers)

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.594
SHINPEI: Toki...

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.055
(Tokiko whimpers)

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:13.933
(gasps)

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.477
Stop there. Step back.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.651
(gasping)

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.528
(ominous music)

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.912
SHADOW: It is almost nine o'clock.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.372
(gun clicks)

00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:41.544
The festival is finished. And it's time
for me to bring this final day to an end.

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.550
(whimpers)

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:52.722
SHINPEI: <i>The shrine grounds</i>
<i>were thick with the humid evening air</i>

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.601
<i>and the sickening,</i>
<i>half-sweet stench of blood.</i>

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:01.189
<i>There was a mountain of corpses,</i>
<i>villagers and tourists.</i>

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.817
SHADOW: You shall not impede me.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.737
SHINPEI: <i>One... three...</i>

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.950
<i>Five... seven... nine...</i>

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:13.993
<i>Eleven...</i>

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:16.788
<i>I just couldn't help but count them.</i>

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.334
<i>Even totally frozen with terror,</i>
<i>I was trying to make sense of things.</i>

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.297
(both gasp)

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:27.215
SHINPEI: <i>And then...</i>

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.887
(groaning)

00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:35.724
Sou!

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.894
Mio, run.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.647
Well, now, ain't this touching!

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:44.524
-(blood squelches)
-(Mio whimpers)

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.526
SHADOW SOU: Sacrificing his life
for you like that.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.988
Clearly, I wasn't kidding
when I said I was in love with you!

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.449
(sobbing)
No.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:57.620
But it always was the same with you.
Shinpei this and Shinpei that.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.081
MIO: Sou, please.

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.292
(whooshes)

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.921
-(gun clicks)
-(bullet clatters)

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.800
(soft grunt)

00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:16.389
(suspenseful music)

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.683
Mio!

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.394
(static)

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:24.856
What the...

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.276
(gasps)

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:31.988
(gunshot)

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:35.742
(groans)

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.329
(gasps)

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.040
(Hizuru groans)

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.249
(static)

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.959
SHADOW: Dangerous, isn't it?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:49.672
Since you're intruding so blithely
upon this holy ritual of ours,

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.218
I take it you must have defeated
the other Mio.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.303
(groans)

00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:58.681
So you're... you're the boss, then, huh?

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.810
What... Who are you?

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:04.187
Who the hell are you? Answer me!

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:06.231
(gasps)

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:12.570
(groaning)

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:16.574
Let me see your right eye.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.287
SHADOW: I knew it. It's the same right eye
Mother lost long ago!

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:24.833
What are you doing with it?
Why do you have the original?

00:10:26.835 --> 00:10:30.296
Using that eye makes it possible
to manipulate time.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.506
(Shinpei gasps)

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.883
(grunts)
Let me go!

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:38.138
Hey, hey, come on now. What're you doing?
Just stop struggling, okay?

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.140
SHADOW SHINPEI: After all,
you're one of us, too.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.853
No! You're wrong, I'm human!
I'm Ushio Kofune!

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:47.355
You fool. You're not a human.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:51.067
You know, humans don't instantly recover
from something like a broken arm.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.278
(sobbing)

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.948
(groaning)

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.744
SHADOW: Since the hero can always restart
the game from a save point,

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.455
the only way for a final boss
to defeat him

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:07.000
is to pull the plug,
disconnecting the console

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.293
from the power source.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.504
Imagine if you faced a boss
in a video game

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:15.884
who understood a concrete,
real-world concept like electrical power.

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:17.969
(panting)

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:22.056
Watch closely, I'll show you.
Look, Shinpei.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.729
You're about to see the moment
where I cut off the power.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:32.025
(gasps)
No, stop! Let me go!

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.235
I know I'm not one of you!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:38.156
Shinpei! Mio! Take care of her!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.491
USHIOH: Mio!

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.785
(sobbing)

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:43.786
(grunts)

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.663
(Mio sobbing)

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.959
Mio...

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:52.420
(groaning)

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:55.965
Mi...

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.762
Shin-chan.

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.389
(grunts)

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.516
Wait for me. I'll...

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.851
(Shinpie grunts)

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.938
-MIO: Oh, Shin-chan.
-SHINPEI: I'll save you.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.941
-(Shinpei grunting)
-(sobbing)

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.947
(Shinpei grunting)

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.037
(whimpers)

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:31.793
(fire crackling)

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.463
No way! Mio!

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:40.134
Mio! No!

00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:43.221
(Ushio wailing)

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:48.559
USHIOH: No! Mio!

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:53.606
No! No! Get away! Leave Mio alone!

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.733
Your last meal is before you.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.862
SHADOW: Please eat
to your heart's content.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.367
(Shinpei sobs)

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.830
HIZURU: <i>That gigantic shadow.</i>

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.751
It swallowed up the others
after it touched them.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:21.175
You were the one who was totally useless
in the end, Ryunosuke.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.135
(gasps)

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.846
-It turns out I was too late to stop this.
-(static)

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:25.888
(gasps)

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.017
(ominous music)

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.226
Uh...

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:36.983
Now then, look down
and grant me the last of your strength.

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.485
(power surge)

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:41.029
(sobbing)

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:42.238
SHADOW: Mother.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.328
(rumbling)

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.752
Nothingness lies ahead.

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.431
-Do you see that? What is it?
-What is that up there, mama?

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.099
(people clamoring)

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:16.814
Huh? What is that? What the...

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.620
Hm?

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:39.462
HISHIGATA: She must have eaten
a thousand humans, and that revived her.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.297
She's here.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.050
(sighs)

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.470
Look.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.930
(static)

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.433
HISHIGATA: The shadows
will swallow up the island.

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:07.698
Heine.

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.868
(slurps)

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:16.165
HEINE: Ah. Delicious.

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:22.463
SHADOW: This is it.
This will be my ending.

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.924
(Shinpei sobbing)

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:27.969
SHINPEI: I'm sorry.

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.597
(sobbing)

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:36.394
SHINPEI: <i>Mio, everyone...</i>

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.815
(sobbing)

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.111
I'm so sorry. Shinpei, I'm sorry.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:47.947
HIZURU: <i>Why didn't I believe...</i>

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.825
<i>Why did it take me so long</i>
<i>to believe the message?</i>

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.953
(groans)
I guess I was too late.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:56.372
Way too late.

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.332
(breathing heavily)

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.252
-SHINPEI: No!
-(groans)

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.591
SHINPEI: I should have done that
when I had the chance.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.136
Why didn't I say
what I was really thinking?

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:16.017
All I had were regrets.
Nothing but regrets.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:21.772
Right now I don't feel
even the slightest sense of regret!

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.151
It isn't too late to change things yet!

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.820
-Miss Nagumo!
-Huh?

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.155
SHADOW: Hm?

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:34.493
You have to shoot me right now!
Please, I'm begging you! Just kill me.

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:37.955
No matter how many times I die,
I'll just keep coming back!

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.207
(gasps)

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.667
Shoot me! Aim for my head, okay?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.546
(soft chuckle)

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:51.260
You really say some pretty crazy stuff,
don't you? Here goes nothing.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.972
Just do it, all right!?
I can go back to the 22nd.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.934
Your efforts are futile.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.230
I think this... this is going to be
my last shot.

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.900
SHINPEI: Please.
You have to trust me! Do it!

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:08.611
The shadows will swallow you up as well.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.491
Come here!

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:18.037
You monster!

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:27.129
HIZURU: If you really can go back
in time to the 22nd,

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:31.384
just remember to tell me your name,
and I'll save you.

00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:33.511
(gunshot)

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:41.185
(static)

00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:43.020
SHINPEI: <i>It's dark.</i>

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.275
<i>Nothing. No one's here.</i>

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:50.736
<i>They're gone.</i>

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.322
<i>This scene right here...</i>

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:59.370
<i>Am I looking from the bird's-eye view?</i>

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:06.419
<i>Stop this. Stop it. Stop right now!</i>

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.215
(tranquil music)

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.301
(wind gusting)

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.055
SHINPEI: <i>The island...</i>

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.519
<i>What is that red light?</i>

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.439
<i>It's a girl?</i>

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.526
Just now... our eyes met.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.821
USHIO: <i>Shinpei.</i>

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:37.700
Huh? Ushio? Ushio!

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:42.913
USHIO: <i>Be careful, okay?</i>
<i>There's a limit to this power, Shinpei.</i>

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.750
<i>Everyone will die at the festival.</i>

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:50.087
I can hear you clearly this time.
Ushio! Where are you?

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:54.300
You are the only one
who can stop them now.

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:59.555
Take care of Mio. Please look after her.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.311
(gasps)

00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:08.439
MIO: So what's Tokyo like?
Been to Shibuya? Shibuya!

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.983
(Shinpei panting)

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.448
Ah. Hey, Shin-chan?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.867
(gasps)

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.994
SHINPEI (in hoarse voice): I'm back.

00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:25.539
(retches)

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.333
MIO: Shin... Shin-chan?

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.668
(Shinpei gags)

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:31.379
SHINPEI: <i>I did it.</i>

00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.547
Did you get chills
from falling into the water before?

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.841
-SHINPEI: <i>Mio, she's alive.</i>
-Did you hit your head or something?

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:41.972
Uh... Uh, Shin... Uh, Shin-chan?

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.558
Oh, thank goodness.
(sobs)

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:48.020
SHINPEI: I'm okay.
Just a little seasick from the ferry.

00:19:51.565 --> 00:19:53.776
SHINPEI: <i>What the...</i>
<i>My clothes are soaked.</i>

00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.153
<i>Ah. Of course.</i>

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:00.658
<i>I fell into the sea</i>
<i>when I tried to stop Mio's bike.</i>

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:02.952
<i>She had to jump in and save me.</i>

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.788
MIO: Hey, you look really pale.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:09.041
Why don't we take a nice long rest
after we get changed?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.960
Thank goodness
our phones still work, though.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:14.714
We can't show up at the funeral
with soaking wet clothes, you know.

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:16.340
Plus, I should probably take a shower.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:21.303
SHINPEI: <i>Remember what Ushio told me,</i>
<i>there's a limit to this power.</i>

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:25.558
<i>Take a step back</i>
<i>and look at the big picture.</i>

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.984
<i>First time was on the ferry.</i>
<i>Second time was after landing.</i>

00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.195
<i>This time around, it's after I met Mio.</i>

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:42.742
<i>I think the starting point of the loop</i>
<i>is getting later and later.</i>

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.828
<i>Anything that happens before I wake up</i>

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.247
<i>seems to become fixed</i>
<i>every time I come back.</i>

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.290
THIRD TIME

00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:52.960
<i>In other words, now I'm guaranteed</i>
<i>to fall into the sea. Every time.</i>

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.044
<i>SWAMP MAN</i>
BY RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO

00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:58.883
<i>And if I die and wake up again,</i>
<i>it'll be even later than it was this time.</i>

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.969
<i>I can't just fail forever.</i>

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:08.350
<i>And if eventually I wake up after Mio</i>
<i>and everyone else is already dead,</i>

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:13.230
<i>I won't be able to save them</i>
<i>even if I try to restart the loop.</i>

00:21:15.566 --> 00:21:16.400
<i>Three days.</i>

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.945
<i>Three days until the summer festival.</i>

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.115
<i>Can I really solve this</i>
<i>in just three days?</i>

00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:28.412
<i>No. What am I saying?</i>
(grunts)

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.790
USHIO: <i>You are the only one</i>
<i>who can stop them now.</i>

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.210
SHINPEI: <i>I'm going to do this!</i>

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:46.597
(moans)

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.602
(waves crashing)

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:58.859
What the...

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.945
(closing theme music)
