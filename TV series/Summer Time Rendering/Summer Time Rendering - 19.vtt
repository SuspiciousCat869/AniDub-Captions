00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.294
(wings flapping)

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:05.130
(cicadas chirping)

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.591
HEINE: You came back.

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.305
But Ushioh's presence disappeared.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:17.184
I bet you're glad
that pest is finally gone.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.521
(theme music)

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.197
(grunts)

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:55.574
Heine.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.118
-(flash squeals)
-(kids gasp)

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.579
(static)

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.039
Damn it.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.040
Uh...
(gasps)

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:05.751
(static)

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.670
(chuckling)

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.130
Akari!

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:12.549
(Heine scoffs)

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:18.889
You can take the boy away.
He doesn't taste that good, anyway.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:19.973
SHINPEI: <i>Immunity?</i>

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:25.937
The thing is, considering
that you only just came back, Shinpei.

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:27.939
You're right on the edge.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.399
(gasps)

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:30.859
(rumbles)

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:34.905
SHINPEI: <i>Event horizon.</i>
<i>I'm right on the edge after looping.</i>

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:35.906
<i>This is bad.</i>

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.326
<i>It's over if I die here.</i>
<i>She aimed for this.</i>

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.204
<i>Did she turn into a crow</i>
<i>and watch me the entire time?</i>

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.414
-(squealing)
-(all grunt)

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.754
(foreboding music)

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.631
(squawking)

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.842
(panting)

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:01.765
-(static)
-SHINPEI: <i>It's pointless.</i>

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.185
<i>I can't do this alone.</i>
<i>I can't beat even one.</i>

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:07.229
AKARI: Brother!

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:11.817
It's okay, Akari. Don't worry.
I will protect you.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.860
SHINPEI: <i>This is not good.</i>

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.947
(panting)
<i>Don't give up. It's over if I die.</i>

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.449
<i>Look at the situation.</i>

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.620
Wait. Stop, please!

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.334
If you make me loop now,
you won't have copied Akari, either.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:30.752
You sure about that?

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:37.676
Or can you bring data you copied
from another loop, too?

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:42.597
SHINPEI: So that day at the festival,
you ate all of those people?

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.600
It's all your fault.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:51.398
HEINE: <i>During that time,</i>
<i>I used my power to go after you.</i>

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.483
(stomach rumbles)

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.779
HEINE: Your life ends here.

00:03:57.863 --> 00:03:59.239
Damn it.

00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:01.158
(Shinpei gasps)

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:03.118
Bye-bye.

00:04:04.161 --> 00:04:06.496
-(shadows snarl)
-(whimpers)

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.000
Wait.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.170
(silence)

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:17.299
SHINPEI: <i>It stopped?</i>

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:19.676
(in demonic voice)
How dare you?

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:23.638
(gasps)

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.933
(squawking)

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.606
It flew away.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:38.361
Does... Does this mean that...
Are we safe now, Shinpei?

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.782
SHINPEI: <i>They're all gone?</i>
<i>The stray shadows, too?</i>

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.742
<i>Why was I saved?</i>

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:44.993
(grunts)

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.372
<i>This is...</i>

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.960
(sobbing)
Damn it!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.128
What's the matter?

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.588
Nothing.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.717
SHINPEI: <i>I gotta call everyone.</i>

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.803
(cell phone rings)

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:06.723
Are you sure?

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.768
Ushioh is really dead?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:15.941
SHINPEI: Yes. The situation's changed.
Let's meet and rework our strategy.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.028
Okay, then. Where do you want to meet?

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.823
(Shinpei quivering)

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.991
(cell phone blaring)

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:30.413
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>How about Torajima,</i>
<i>northwest of the island?</i>

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:33.667
HIZURU: <i>The one you can only reach</i>
<i>during low tide?</i>

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.628
SHADOW SHINPEI:
Yeah. Low tide starts in 30 minutes.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.463
I already told Mio and Sou.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.842
I'll meet them at Bistro Kofune
before we head out.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.387
HIZURU: <i>Understood.</i>
<i>Torajima in 30 minutes.</i>

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.724
Yeah. All right. I'll see you in 30.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.228
RYUNOSUKE NAGUMO
UNSTABLE CONNECTION. FIND BETTER SIGNAL

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.480
Damn it. I can't connect.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:58.275
All right, let's get going.
This place is dangerous.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.192
Okay.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.530
<i>I need to tell everyone</i>
<i>that Ushioh disappeared.</i>

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.701
MASAHITO: Heine.
When did you copy that body?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.996
SHADOW SHINPEI: We should look at it
from a bird's-eye view.

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:13.331
Ushioh has no memory of it.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.126
It's a hole in their pseudo-loop
that we can exploit.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.336
That's wonderful.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.549
Exactly. Shinpei won't survive
to tomorrow's ceremony.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.260
So let's get going. Right now.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:26.761
MASAHITO: <i>Leave it to me.</i>

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.096
BISTRO KOFUNE

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:29.222
(bell chimes)

00:06:29.306 --> 00:06:30.682
(panting)
We're back!

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:31.766
Hm?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.436
(all panting)

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.478
Where's Mio?

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.400
She went somewhere together with Sou.
She said they were gonna meet you.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.777
That was probably at least 30 minutes ago.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.280
What'd they say? Go where?

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.781
ALAIN: I didn't hear.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.827
-Shinpei! Did something happen?
-SHINPEI: Please look after those kids!

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:51.911
Hmm...

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:54.289
Are you kids hungry?

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.999
Umm... I, uh...

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:59.544
(chuckles)
I would like some juice, please.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.254
-<i>The number you are trying to reach...</i>
-SHINPEI: <i>Meeting me.</i>

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.049
<i>-...is out of coverage area or unattended.</i>
-SHINPEI: <i>Is there a shadow me?</i>

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.053
<i>Why? I wasn't copied this time.</i>

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.807
<i>I reversed being copied</i>
<i>at the funeral and Koba Mart.</i>

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.479
<i>Wait. No! That's not it!</i>

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:18.980
SHADOW TETSU: You wanna copy him, too?

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.524
-MIOH: No. I don't. Not him.
-(Shinpei choking)

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.318
MIOH: Mother already copied him.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.530
SHINPEI: <i>So the one</i>
<i>who copied me was Heine.</i>

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:32.285
<i>She came from the end of the festival</i>
<i>in the third loop.</i>

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:37.666
<i>That's when she copied me,</i>
<i>and then she started using my shadow form!</i>

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.543
<i>But how did she call them from my phone?</i>

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:45.715
<i>Even if she copied it,</i>
<i>she had to get rid of the original one.</i>

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.969
-MIOH: Shin-chan?
-(gasps)

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.930
SHINPEI: <i>Was that from my room?</i>

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.265
(gasps)

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.811
What are you doing here?

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.730
Mioh! What happened?

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.692
It can't be. That call just now...

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.488
(groaning)

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.241
Please take them out gently.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.450
Uh... sorry.

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.994
-MIOH: Huh?
-(Shinpei gasps)

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.038
I'll share my memories with you.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.749
SOU: Mioh.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.961
My sister's dead.
What if the hacking gets reversed.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.337
It'll be dangerous.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.839
Shin-chan said it could happen!

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.092
It might become
an enemy again at any time!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.303
No way. Mio did this to you?

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:37.016
Mio had gotten a call from you,
and you told her that sis died.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.059
Is that true?

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:43.648
Yeah. But that wasn't me,
my shadow was the one who made the call.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.316
Does it hurt?

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.905
I'm fine. I'm sorry, though.
I wasn't able to protect Mio.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:56.286
MIOH: <i>I knew there was a shadow of you.</i>
<i>I saw it in sis's pseudo-loop.</i>

00:08:57.454 --> 00:09:00.832
That, and I also heard you say
Heine copied you

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.959
and created your shadow, isn't that right?

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.505
Right. But I can't believe
that two copies of my phone

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.632
can exist and work at the same time.

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:11.134
I was careless.

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.802
SHINPEI: <i>I just remembered.</i>

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.682
<i>During the third loop,</i>
<i>it also copied my phone.</i>

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.978
<i>It was sucked into Heine's body</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:26.983
MIOH: <i>I see. So Heine brought it over</i>
<i>to this eighth loop.</i>

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.611
This is bad.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:33.656
Heine knows Ms. Nagumo's memories
as well as her contact information.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.241
Do you know where Mio and Sou went?

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.951
-(cell phone buzzes)
-(gasps)

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.204
Ms. Nagumo.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.121
Hello?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.957
-SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>Yo. It's me.</i>
-(gasps)

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:43.958
SHINPEI: <i>It's my voice.</i>

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.254
So how does it feel
to get a call from yourself?

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.964
(gasps)

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:55.011
Heine? How... You have Ms. Nagumo's phone?
What did you do?

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:58.723
SHADOW SHINPEI:
<i>Come see for yourself, observer.</i>

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.935
<i>Hizuru and the others are in Torajima.</i>

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.938
<i>Mio and Sou are in Alain's garden.</i>

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.357
<i>Figure out who you're going to save.</i>

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.029
Wait! Don't go! Hello? Hello?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.656
They hung up.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:18.201
Calm down, Shin-chan.
Just think about what you can do now.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.369
I know!

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:22.914
Heine is thinking the same way
as you are now.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:24.916
Just take a step back, and think.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.000
(grunts)

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.168
SHINPEI: <i>Think.</i>

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:32.924
<i>Why would Heine put in all this effort?</i>
<i>Do I save Mio or Ms. Nagumo?</i>

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:36.636
She could be lying
and everyone's already dead.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:39.264
But I can't... I can't just do nothing.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:44.102
I'd rather regret doing something
than regret doing nothing at all.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:51.025
SHINPEI: Gather everything
that can be a weapon! Everything!

00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.910
Why are you here, Mr. Karikiri?

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.454
MASAHITO: These cucumbers are impressive.

00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.791
Alain is so good at growing vegetables.

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:08.835
Isn't that right, Mio?

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.170
Mio, get back.

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:14.007
I personally prefer rice-bran pickles,
but I just got the taste

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.885
for vinegar pickles
after eating them here.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.263
MASAHITO:
Nothing like the taste of France.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.723
What did you do with Shinpei?

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:26.186
Although, Mother hates both kinds.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.272
MASAHITO: Isn't that a pickle?

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.401
People have such different tastes.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:35.987
(gasps)

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.746
-What happened, Ms. Nagumo?
-Hm...

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.082
This terrain is very dangerous.

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.210
What... Wait, what do you mean?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:54.130
Hizuru. It really was Shinpei
on the phone, right?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:58.635
HIZURU: Even Ryunosuke can't tell
if it's a human or shadow on the phone.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.263
But it definitely came
from Shinpei Ajiro's phone.

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:04.766
Ushioh was killed, right?

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.187
Don't you think Shinpei
might be already dead, too?

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.314
HIZURU: Yeah. That's possible.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.233
Shinpei's loop may have cut off,

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.569
and we've entered the world
observed by Heine.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.364
That doesn't change anything.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:22.742
We kill Heine. That's all.

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:24.577
Can you call Mio?

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.997
No. We don't have any signal here.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.751
If I understood Alain correctly,
then Mio and Sou went out

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.836
in order to meet up with Shinpei.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.506
Hopefully, they're headed this way.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:38.883
TOKIKO: <i>Mio.</i>

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.679
HIZURU: I'll cross
to Torajima alone first.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.681
Can you target it from here, Nezu?

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:47.350
NEZU: Just the south side of the island.

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:51.312
HIZURU: That's enough. I'll send you
a signal if Shinpei's a shadow.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:55.942
Tokiko, charge in with Gil and Rose
if that happens.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:57.527
TOKIKO: I understand.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.070
And, Totsumura...

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.072
(grunts)

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.365
HIZURU: Why are you here again?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.616
Hm?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.327
-HIZURU: Whatever. Just don't die.
-TETSU: Huh?

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:11.541
Uh... Oh. But what about your weapon?

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.459
(suspenseful music)

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.170
Don't worry, I have this.

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:18.589
HIZURU: Don't let your guard down.

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:21.301
We'll come back here
if it's really Shinpei.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.136
NEZU: Got it!

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.723
Don't get yourself killed
out there, Hizuru.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:27.640
(scoffs)

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:32.729
You have no delicacy, old man.
Don't plan my funeral just yet.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.355
NEZU: Funeral? No way.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.650
HIZURU: I'll write a novel
about my experience here

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:39.694
once this is all finished.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:43.740
It's probably a good time
to start writing non-fiction.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:04.802
RYUNOSUKE: <i>Lightly, but surely,</i>
<i>it echoes in my head.</i>

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.597
<i>A sound that grinds on the nerves,</i>

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.309
<i>like nails on a chalkboard.</i>

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.564
(waves crashing)

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.152
<i>I feel it. A shadow?</i>

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.280
<i>No. This is Heine.</i>

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.785
<i>I need to draw it toward me</i>
<i>so Nezu can have a shot.</i>

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.287
<i>Can it read my mind?</i>

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.249
Ms. Nagumo! I'm glad you're okay.
Where's everybody else?

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.710
RYUNOSUKE: I don't need
your lousy acting, Heine.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:39.796
I can see you transformed.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.715
Where is Shinpei?

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.550
(scoffs)

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:51.474
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>Fourteen years ago,</i>
<i>I said I'd kill you the next time we met.</i>

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:53.810
That was right here.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.020
(foreboding music)

00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.023
Goodbye, Ryunosuke.

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:07.740
(thuds)

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:12.370
(grunts)

00:15:13.663 --> 00:15:14.497
(grunts)

00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.707
Hm...

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.710
Impressive.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:24.048
Are you Shide? Masahito Karikiri.

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.509
But you're human.

00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:30.096
I don't sense a shadow in you.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.141
RYUNOSUKE: Like you just did now,
did you sneak up behind Ushioh

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.183
-and kill her like that?
-(Masahito scoffs)

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:40.273
Oh, my. This trick didn't work, did it?

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:44.569
You've got good senses,
Ryunosuke Minakata.

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:49.240
So you did know my... my secret.

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:54.078
You know it was 14 years ago
when I copied Ryunosuke Minakata.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.540
SHADOW SHINPEI: <i>My personality at the time</i>
<i>couldn't face the guilt</i>

00:15:58.124 --> 00:16:00.126
<i>of eating my friend's brother.</i>

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:04.714
<i>So Ryunosuke's data exploded from me.</i>

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.384
That was a serious accident indeed.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.722
The coordinates were slightly off
when they got printed.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.516
MASAHITO: Coordinates? Ow.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.977
SHADOW SHINPEI: Coordinates of time.

00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:22.106
There is a two-second gap, to be precise.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.316
MASAHITO: Oh, my.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.610
SHADOW SHINPEI:
So, he's moving Hizuru's body

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.486
from two seconds in the future.

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:32.450
-Isn't that right, Hizuru-chan?
-(gasps)

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:36.704
MASAHITO: I know you can hear me,
right, Hizuru-chan?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.666
You approached Heine and confused her.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.253
<i>It's your fault that Heine</i>
<i>was deeply hurt.</i>

00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:46.088
She got weaker.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:50.092
Now, she can only survive here
for a few more months.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.472
This is all your fault, Hizuru-chan.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:59.769
Your precious brother's death
is the whole reason Heine has to leave.

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:04.315
This is all your fault, Hizuru-chan!

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.151
-RYUNOSUKE: What did you say?
-(cracking)

00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:10.238
I won't let you hurt my sister anymore!

00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:14.075
MASAHITO: You can't beat me, Ryunosuke.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:15.284
(gasps)

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.788
Heine's eye can observe
the next two seconds,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.831
and then tell it to me.

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:24.961
This means your two-second advantage
is meaningless.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.296
MASAHITO: This is mud.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:32.051
Formerly shadows, but now they're nothing.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.136
(suspenseful music)

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:41.352
I'll tell you about all my abilities.
Games have to be fair to be interesting.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:45.523
This will change shape at will.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:50.194
RYUNOSUKE: <i>How disgusting.</i>
<i>How many people are in that?</i>

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.322
<i>What would sis call that?</i>

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.784
<i>Globs of death? No.</i>

00:17:56.867 --> 00:18:00.871
SHIDE: Because it's no one,
it has no weakness.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:04.834
RYUNOSUKE: <i>An armor of corpses!</i>

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.464
SHIDE: It's time to take this seriously.

00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:17.972
-(grunts)
-(thuds)

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.851
RYUNOSUKE: <i>I knew it.</i>

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.312
<i>Sis was right.</i>

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:28.232
<i>You want to make me dodge,</i>
<i>and then strike me after.</i>

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:33.112
<i>But Shide can't see</i>
<i>where I am two seconds ahead.</i>

00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:37.158
<i>Heine sees it</i>
<i>and tells him telepathically.</i>

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:39.327
<i>There is a minor time lag.</i>

00:18:40.328 --> 00:18:41.704
<i>I need to move faster.</i>

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:43.998
(gunshot)

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:45.791
<i>Faster!</i>

00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.712
<i>I just need to move faster!</i>

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.797
(suspenseful music)

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.015
-(thuds)
-(crows squawking)

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:08.773
Huh?

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.861
(squelches)

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.030
Huh?

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:26.832
(mutters)

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:41.305
SHIDE: Amazing. You can move like that
with a human body.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.601
But it looks like
you pushed yourself too far.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.604
You opened your wound.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.523
(panting)

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.692
SHIDE: I gave you that last night...

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.947
<i>when you had to cover for Shinpei.</i>

00:19:58.614 --> 00:19:59.949
(panting)

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.492
RYUNOSUKE: <i>That's not it.</i>

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.704
<i>There was a fracture in my right arm,</i>

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:07.832
<i>and my muscles are also torn.</i>

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.627
<i>Sis' body can't take any more than this.</i>

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:16.966
<i>As much as it pains me,</i>
<i>I need to run away. I sent the signal.</i>

00:20:17.591 --> 00:20:20.177
<i>If I can get into Nezu's range,</i>

00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:22.346
<i>he can give me cover, so I can...</i>

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.931
-HIZURU: <i>Escape.</i>
-RYUNOSUKE: <i>Wait. Huh?</i>

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:25.891
(gasps)

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.228
Hm?

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.063
Wait, Sis!

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:35.609
Don't do it. Don't run away, Ryunosuke.

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.820
Is that Hizuru?

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:38.821
HIZURU AND RYUNOSUKE: Huh?

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.324
Why am I awake
while sis is taking over this body?

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.661
I'm talking with her in real-time
for the first time!

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:47.621
No way. Is this a dream?

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:49.749
Hey! Why? Why?

00:20:49.832 --> 00:20:52.001
-(laughing)
-Ugh! Just shut up!

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:55.337
HIZURU: This is an emergency.
We've got to do this.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:59.049
Hey, Sis. I'm so glad.

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.927
HIZURU: Listen closely, Ryunosuke.

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:04.013
We can win.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.223
-RYUNOSUKE: Oh.
-SHIDE: Oh?

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.936
As long as Shinpei Ajiro is alive,
we need to fight.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.355
We'll just die tomorrow if we run.

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:14.273
But--

00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:15.316
Don't think.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.319
Let me do the thinking.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:23.949
HIZURU: You saw it. That material
goes beyond common sense.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.995
But he's just a human
if we can get rid of that armor.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:33.167
Listen. You're the only one
who can pull this off.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.128
I will give you full control
over this body.

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.213
Oh.

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.802
Stay focused, Ryunosuke.

00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:45.304
(static)

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:49.266
HIZURU: You're holding back
to avoid harming me, aren't you?

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:55.773
If my body's destroyed,
I don't care. Use it fully!

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:01.946
(closing theme music)
