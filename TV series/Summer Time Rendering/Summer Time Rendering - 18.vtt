00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:05.380
HIZURU: <i>In the year 1732,</i>
<i>thousands starved to death</i>

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.467
<i>on Hitogashima</i>
<i>during the Great Kyoho Famine.</i>

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.722
<i>Just as the island was dying off,</i>
<i>a whale washed up on Omotohama Beach.</i>

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.434
<i>The islanders were overjoyed</i>
<i>with this gift from god,</i>

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.436
<i>and gathered to devour it.</i>

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.481
<i>During this time,</i>
<i>a fisherman's daughter came,</i>

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.317
<i>and the whale's body suddenly flashed.</i>

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.112
<i>In a blink of an eye,</i>
<i>it took the form of that girl,</i>

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.657
and then consumed her.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.410
Fearing to be cursed by her,
people started to worship it,

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:37.955
as the living goddess Hiruko.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.416
This is Hiruko's Lore,
a Hitogashima legend.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.628
(theme music)

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.220
Sense any shadows, Ushioh?

00:02:17.346 --> 00:02:18.347
USHIOH: No.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.060
Ms. Nagumo was right.
Sure enough, Karikiri isn't one.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.188
All right, just don't let your guard down.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:27.564
USHIOH: Got it.

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:32.069
Man, it's been so hot lately.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:32.986
SHINPEI: It has.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.615
So is Tokyo hot? Hotter than Wakayama?

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.950
No, it's more or less the same.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:42.162
-MASAHITO: Have some cold barley tea.
-SHINPEI: Oh, thank you.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.917
But you... you came
to Tokyo last year, right?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:47.834
Huh?

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:52.297
Yesterday, weren't you telling me
that you went to a game event in Tokyo?

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.760
Ah! That's right. It was near the ocean,
in Makuhari.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:03:02.099
MASAHITO: Makuhari is in Chiba,
but, yeah, Tokyo really was hot!

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.227
There were so many people, too.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.231
You really like games, huh?
What type do you play?

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.401
Oh, I used to love RPGs,

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:16.571
but now it's like FPS or
like simulation games.

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.532
Are you going to go again this year?

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:22.494
I'm not, I probably
won't make it this year.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:27.082
Although, when I heard
about the FF7 remake, I was so excited.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.919
Is FF7 really any good?
I hear a lot about it.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.589
What? So you've never played it before?

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:37.092
I mean, it did come out
before I was even born.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.138
MASAHITO: Well, its worldview is unique,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.433
maybe because it came out
at the end of the century.

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.602
Both its art and music
have a mood of decadence.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:51.523
The whole thing makes you think
about the end of life.

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.024
Wow, life, really?

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:57.863
I guess your passion for video games
is similar to mine for novels.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.741
Do you know the novel <i>Swamp Man</i>
by Ryunosuke Nagumo?

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:05.412
I really like it,
it feels a lot like it was about me,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.582
as if it was written about my own life.
Art imitating life, I guess.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.711
MASAHITO: I don't know that story,
I've never heard of that book,

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.505
but I do know about the Swamp Man theory.

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.924
Is that what it's about?

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:22.345
SHINPEI: Yeah, one day,
a copy of the protagonist shows up

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.431
and starts living in his place.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.643
No one at home or at school notices
that he's actually a copy.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:33.315
It perfectly copied
all the memories, personality,

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.358
and DNA of the original person.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.779
But if that really happened,
do you think that it would be

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.864
the same person as the original?

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.410
I would. Yes, I would think he is.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.123
Human cells are replaced every day,
because of our metabolism.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.627
Our cells continuously divide
and copy themselves.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.464
Whether it was done in a flash
or slowly, doesn't make a difference.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.009
SHINPEI: So you believe a copy
is the same as the original?

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.720
MASAHITO: Yes, I guess I do.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.267
Is this always what you think about?

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.521
It was the shadow sickness yesterday.

00:05:13.438 --> 00:05:15.982
SHINPEI: I also looked into Hiruko's Lore.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.068
At first, I was going to ask you,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.154
however, Hizuru told me all about it.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.992
About 300 years ago, in the Edo period,

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.829
a god appeared on this island,
that god was Hiruko.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.834
SHINPEI: <i>In the distant past,</i>
<i>it arrived from outside this realm,</i>

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.753
<i>or we can just call it "space."</i>

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:42.843
<i>It was an organism that lived out there,</i>
<i>and copied nearby objects,</i>

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:47.639
<i>transformed, and consumed the copied data.</i>

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.977
<i>But it had a limited choice of objects</i>
<i>to transform into, out in space.</i>

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:56.565
<i>So it most likely came down to Earth</i>
<i>in the form of a meteorite,</i>

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:02.279
<i>fell into the ocean,</i>
<i>and probably copied a lot of things.</i>

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.408
(ominous music)

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.702
This part is just Hizuru's theory,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.247
but the rest of the story is
in the written records of Hiruko's Lore.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.167
SHINPEI: <i>Three hundred years ago,</i>
<i>it transformed into a whale,</i>

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.880
<i>and for some reason,</i>
<i>washed up on this island.</i>

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:24.259
<i>It copied a fisherman's daughter</i>
<i>who came to see the whale washed ashore.</i>

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.013
That was the beginning
of the shadow sickness.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.558
Well, that's what they say
in Hiruko's Lore.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.977
Are you saying that it's true?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.022
Yeah. Shadows do exist.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.483
They're the ones responsible
for killing Ushio,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.110
as well as killing my parents,

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:46.781
and they'll do the same to everyone
who shows up tomorrow for the festival.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.910
MASAHITO (laughs): Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:52.287
You've read way too many stories.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:57.959
I know you're upset about Ushio's death.
You should get some rest.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.337
SHINPEI: I already know everything.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:04.424
Karikiri, you know it's true.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.762
After all, you watched it all unfold.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:10.847
Wow.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.349
What in the world is it?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.558
I think it's a whale.

00:07:13.642 --> 00:07:16.519
-(indistinct chatter)
-(whimpers)

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.317
(tense music)

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:27.197
I didn't notice it at first,
but Dr. Hishigata pointed you out to me.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:31.951
Do you see the man on your right?
He is Dr. Hishigata's grandfather.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.830
What are you doing in a photo
from 70 years ago,

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:41.127
Masahito Karikiri,
or should I say, Shidehiko Hishigata?

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:44.089
I know you are Shide.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.133
Heine!

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.218
(static)

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.761
(indistinct chatter)

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.222
Come back here, Heine!

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.306
(gasps)

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:56.976
WOMAN: Where did it go?
What happened to the whale?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.062
(foreboding music)

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:08.238
Heine? Heine. Come here.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.448
Ah, Mr. Shide.

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:15.120
(Shadow growls)

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.416
SUMMER TIME RENDERING

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.503
-Shinpei.
-(gunshots)

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.677
Don't move. Move, and I'll kill you.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.638
What has Dr. Hishigata told you exactly?

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:39.602
I'm the one asking questions here.
Not you. Look at the other photo.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:48.862
That picture was taken 40 years ago.
Dr. Hishigata's father took that picture.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:53.783
You aren't a shadow,
but you're definitely not human, either.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.996
HIZURU: <i>Swamp Man.</i>

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.338
Hiruko? What the heck is it doing here?

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:10.300
I don't know. It's just a guess.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:15.930
<i>If so, the Hishigata Clinic</i>
<i>and Hito Shrine must be connected somehow.</i>

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.768
Four-arms could be Masahito Karikiri.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:22.562
Uh, huh? Are you sure? The Karikiri boy?

00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.023
Don't you think so, too, Ushioh?

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.275
-Yeah.
-Heine.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.570
It sounds pretty suspicious
for the shrine to worship her

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.614
if she's the mother of all shadows.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.324
Since Karikiri is the priest there.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.535
Yeah, maybe. But isn't Karikiri human?

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.954
HIZURU: Why would Four-arms hide its face?

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:44.042
If it were a shadow, it could just
transform itself into anything.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.962
What if it's human and just isn't able
to copy anything at all?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:53.176
I've never seen it scan anything,
but it did print.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.221
Well, if Four-arms is actually human

00:09:56.304 --> 00:10:00.725
but he is wearing all that sludge
of shadows as some sort of armor.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:05.271
He's hiding his face,
because he knows if he didn't,

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.649
we would easily recognize him.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:10.652
Ah!

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.741
Ugh! How could it do that to Ryunosuke?

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.369
Four-arms must be Masahito Karikiri.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.872
After seeing it in your memories,
I'm sure.

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.083
But how can you tell?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.128
I never liked that priest.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.881
HIZURU: Four-arms disgusts me
the same way.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:32.799
NEZU: What do you mean?

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:37.053
He can hide his face,
but not what's inside.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.016
And the fact that Nezu's shots didn't work
makes sense if it's human.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.478
If I remember correctly,
Karikiri was at the funeral.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:47.981
SHINPEI: Maybe he sent a shadow
in his place.

00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:53.194
I think we can easily assassinate him
if there really is a human inside.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.322
It would be easy if he is human.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:01.244
I'll just casually visit the shrine,
and shoot him while we chat.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.288
What? That's murder!

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.915
We still need more evidence, Ms. Nagumo.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:09.043
And besides, if he's human,
we might be able to negotiate

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.461
a truce with him.

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:15.925
Shide burned his left hand.
It will help us know for sure.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.887
DR. HISHIGATA: Look at this.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.224
Shide is Heine's guardian,
and the first child Heine bore.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:28.563
Its original form is Shidehiko Hishigata,
founder of the Hishigata Clinic.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.606
(gasps)

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:32.275
What? What is this picture?

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.652
DR. HISHIGATA: The Hishigata family
was in charge

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.197
of religious ceremonies on the island,

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:42.160
until Shidehiko's father
began playing doctor in the Edo period.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:46.873
But that can't be. Hishigata?
The Karikiris have the shrine.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:50.210
The Karikiris
and the Hishigatas are related.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:53.296
They branched off from the Hishigatas.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.547
(both gasp)

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.759
Do you know Hiruko's Lore?

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:01.054
The day Hiruko drifted here,
Hiruko became Heine,

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.723
and then Heine became a god
to the islanders.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.683
DR. HISHIGATA: That's right.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:09.938
In time, Shidehiko had a child
with this god.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.147
(both gasp)

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:14.609
The child wasn't born
from a scanned shadow.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:19.113
He got Heine's body pregnant,
and she gave birth to a child.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.448
(both gasp)

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.158
DR. HISHIGATA:
He called himself a god's husband,

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:24.577
and took Heine's surname, Karikiri.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.038
Shidehiko had a brother.

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:30.041
<i>After Heine gave birth,</i>
<i>the Hishigata family split,</i>

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.213
<i>the Karikiris became priests,</i>
<i>and the Hishigatas became doctors.</i>

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.591
TOKIKO: In other words,
we're related to Shide?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.426
I can't believe it.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.887
So who did Heine give birth to?

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:48.101
DR. HISHIGATA: <i>When the child grew up,</i>
<i>it was the spitting image of Shidehiko.</i>

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.436
That must be the nature of shadows.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:54.148
A child from Heine's pregnancy
is the father's clone.

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:55.566
(both gasp)

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.280
Shidehiko noticed this,
and it kindled a certain desire.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.490
It can't be.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:06.119
He made Heine copy
and implant his personality

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.413
and memory in the clone.

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.874
DR. HISHIGATA: <i>That way, he was reborn.</i>

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.293
(gasps)

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.754
That's sick. No wonder I hated him.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:21.217
My father helped to deliver the baby,
and he took that photograph.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:24.721
DR. HISHIGATA:
His current body was born that day.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.806
Shide repeated this technique,

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:30.643
and made Heine give birth
to his new body over and over,

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:35.356
and that's how he's lived for 300 years.

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:44.032
You're a hybrid of human and shadow.

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:49.245
Well, well, Shinpei.
You don't play fair. You loop.

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:52.206
You can't possibly know so much
in just one day.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.128
Well, take a seat and have some tea.
It's not poisoned.

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.088
So you admit it.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.633
(ice clinking)

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:05.344
(gulping)

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.388
(sighs)

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:09.307
(grunts)

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:14.479
I was 40 years old then,
long, long time ago.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:21.235
MASAHITO: <i>It was the summer of 1732,</i>
<i>the year of the Great Kyoho Famine.</i>

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:25.031
Do you know about it?
It's in the textbooks.

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:31.871
We had a terrible harvest that year.
Fishermen died, so we had no fish, either.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.582
And that's when Heine showed up
on the shore.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:39.545
SHINPEI: <i>The islanders believed that god</i>
<i>was in the things that washed ashore,</i>

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:42.757
<i>so they believed Heine was a god.</i>

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:47.220
And in exchange for eating the people,
Heine blessed the fishing.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:51.182
No, that's not it at all.
You are sorely mistaken, Shinpei.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.685
She just turned a few hundred people
on the island into shadows,

00:14:54.977 --> 00:15:00.691
because shadows can easily catch fish
and save people from starving.

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:03.402
MASAHITO: So Hitogashima still exists,
thanks to me.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:04.654
USHIOH: Shut up!

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.157
Are you actually justifying
yourself right now?

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.493
Why did you kill Shinpei's parents?

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.580
MASAHITO: Same as you, I'm sure.
They got in the way.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:18.584
They found Hiruko's grotto
and tried to make it public.

00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:22.046
They weren't smart for that,
but Mother enjoyed her meal.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.507
USHIOH: Unforgivable.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:29.971
Oh, I guess you would have
preferred them as shadows, huh?

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.639
(grunting)

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:44.402
I'm not... I'm nothing like you.

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:50.575
I don't want to kill people.
You don't want to die, do you?

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:54.745
Why go so far to protect Heine?

00:15:55.329 --> 00:16:00.543
SHINPEI: You're human,
so you can't go with her to her home.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:05.256
Give up Heine, and then you must end
this bloody massacre.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:10.469
That is not how it ends.
My mission is to fulfill Mother's wish.

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.223
SHINPEI: <i>Shit. Shit.</i>

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:18.811
And you never know, you know?
I might have a shadow, too.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.314
SHINPEI: <i>Something's off.</i>

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.775
Pull the trigger!
There aren't any shadows here!

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.486
SHINPEI: <i>Why? Why is he...</i>

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.949
Shoot, Shinpei!
Now is our only chance! Hurry up!

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.912
I know exactly
what you're thinking right now.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.665
"Why isn't his left hand burned? Strange."

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:40.708
MASAHITO: Right?

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:46.088
By the way, Shinpei. Can I move now?

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.091
USHIOH: That's it.
I can't take it anymore!

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:50.593
Ushioh! Hold on!

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:54.096
(foreboding music)

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.269
(gasps)

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.479
(grunts)

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:13.115
(blood splatters)

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.534
(both sigh)

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:20.957
(Shinpei panting)

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.054
He's dead. Is that it?

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.932
I said I was going to do it.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.685
I didn't want you to have
to do something like this.

00:17:40.768 --> 00:17:41.686
(sighs)

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.981
I can't let you murder someone.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.693
Why not? It was my duty. My revenge.

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:51.654
You're kind, so you would've regretted it.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:56.742
USHIOH: You see everyone as people,
even me, and even him.

00:17:57.952 --> 00:18:01.122
Leave all the dirty work to me, okay?

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:02.873
Ushioh.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.044
Can I?

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.716
Did you hear? I killed Shide.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:14.302
(thuds)

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.731
(squeaks)

00:18:28.816 --> 00:18:30.443
-(blood sloshes)
-Shin...

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.612
(blade pierces flesh)

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.865
Okay. One down.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.950
(suspenseful music)

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:43.289
USHIOH: <i>Shide... Why?</i>

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:51.130
<i>No, it can't be. I'm sorry, Shinpei.</i>
<i>I didn't notice...</i>

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.215
(static)

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:59.055
-(shouting)
-(gunshots)

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:02.516
-(shouting)
-(gun clicking)

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.517
MASAHITO: Well...

00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:06.270
That was close, Shinpei.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:10.524
I guess you didn't step back enough

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:13.736
to look at the situation.

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.072
-(blade pierces flesh)
-(groaning)

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.661
HIZURU: <i>You're going alone?</i>

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.245
NEZU: <i>Persuade him?</i>

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.455
(grunts)

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.208
NEZU: <i>No, I say we kill him</i>

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:30.127
<i>the moment we see him in his skin.</i>

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:32.088
(grunts)

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.339
NEZU: <i>I'll kill him.</i>

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.300
SHINPEI: <i>No, please wait, let me try once.</i>

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:44.225
<i>If I don't know what he's thinking,</i>
<i>then there's no way I can kill him.</i>

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.231
<i>I want him to tell me</i>
<i>why he killed my parents himself.</i>

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:53.984
<i>I'll never accept it if I don't.</i>

00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.986
-NEZU: <i>But...</i>
-SHINPEI: <i>I have to.</i>

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.156
SHINPEI: <i>I'll even die once</i>
<i>just so I can hear it.</i>

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.743
USHIOH: <i>Fine,</i>
<i>but I'm still going with you.</i>

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:06.664
<i>You won't even stand a chance</i>
<i>if the shrine's full of shadows.</i>

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:14.630
HIZURU: <i>She's right. If you go alone,</i>
<i>they might try to capture you.</i>

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:20.386
NEZU: <i>We'll be on the grounds, too.</i>

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:21.554
SHINPEI: <i>I understand.</i>

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:24.265
NEZU: <i>Can we somehow listen in</i>
<i>on their conversation?</i>

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.728
USHIOH: <i>What if we put a phone</i>
<i>in your pocket with a multi-way call?</i>

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:31.856
SHINPEI: <i>But you won't be able</i>
<i>to really hear anything.</i>

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:34.233
NEZU: <i>We just need to hear gunshots.</i>

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:40.322
SHINPEI: <i>All right.</i>
<i>I'll shoot twice into his shadow.</i>

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:44.201
<i>If you hear three shots,</i>
<i>come in and check if it's human.</i>

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.621
-(gunshot)
-(glass shatters)

00:20:51.709 --> 00:20:53.961
I wonder how you're feeling right now.

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:57.798
Like a kid who forgot to save
at the end of the game?

00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:00.760
Ushio is dead.

00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:03.971
(groaning)

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.556
MASAHITO: Brat.

00:21:05.639 --> 00:21:07.600
(retches)

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.061
MASAHITO: You thought you could mess
with my ending?

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:15.191
USHIOH: <i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'm with you, no matter what.</i>

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:19.779
The only loop you're going to get
will be of despair and regret.

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:21.113
(grunting)

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.740
MASAHITO: Take care now.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.331
(gasps)

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:34.376
Shinpei really gets led around
by the nose.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.796
Mm-hm! They're like a couple.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.130
Oh?

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.802
-Huh?
-Huh? Wait.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.094
Where'd she go?

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:47.640
AKARI: She was just there.

00:21:47.723 --> 00:21:50.726
(Shinpei sobbing)

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.686
Uh, Shinpei?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:58.859
(sobbing)

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.862
(closing theme music)
