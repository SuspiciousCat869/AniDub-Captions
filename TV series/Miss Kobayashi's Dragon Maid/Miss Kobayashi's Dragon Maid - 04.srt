1
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:20,205
She's been watching school kids a lot lately.

2
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,199
You think she might be wanting to go?

3
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,533
Who, Kanna?

4
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:29,730
Yes, I would assume so. It's only natural, after all.
Eventually, every dragon wrestles with ideas like death.

5
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:31,070
Oh, youth!

6
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:32,971
Uh. What are you talking about?

7
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:35,483
Kanna's journey to eliminate humanity?

8
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,953
No, jeez. I meant "think she
might be wanting to go to school"?

9
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,122
Oh, right.

10
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:44,220
I see stuff about school on the Internet all the time.

11
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,397
The Internet? Sure got a hold of you fast.

12
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:50,965
Hmm.

13
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,131
Hey, Kanna?

14
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:56,306
Hmm?

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,557
Hey, Kobayashi. Did you need something?

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,657
No, I was just wondering... Do you want to go to school?

17
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:42,049
Kobayashi! Hurry up! Come on!

18
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,533
Kanna, stop!

19
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:46,295
You should treat Miss Kobayashi with more respect!

20
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:49,663
I don't understand why you need
all this just to go to school.

21
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:52,580
There's nothing to understand once you recognize the

22
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,661
obvious conspiracy between the
schools and the manufacturer.

23
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,788
Total conspiracy.

24
00:02:57,872 --> 00:03:00,347
That's doubtful on many levels, Tohru.

25
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:02,077
Not according to the Internet!

26
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:04,709
So dragons fall for online BS, too.

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,288
How about we pick up the basics first?

28
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,291
Okay!

29
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,842
Hello, welcome!

30
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,837
Yep. This is it.

31
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,047
How funny, these school supplies haven't
changed, like, even a little since I was a kid.

32
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,710
No.

33
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,739
What, why no?

34
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:21,055
They're not very cute.

35
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,854
They're wha...?

36
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,055
Wow, Miss Kobayashi. You're so clueless.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,666
Hmm?

38
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,207
Don't worry 'bout it, though. I've got this!

39
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:30,726
Why are we here?

40
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:35,423
Because feathers that have been plucked from living
birds during this time of year produce the best pens!

41
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:36,708
That's creepy.

42
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:38,114
No...

43
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:40,099
Looks like you're clueless, too.

44
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,554
This doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,385
Back in our world, practically everybody uses quill pens.

46
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,169
I want a cute one, though. A cute one!

47
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:51,249
Uhh. I think she wants a cute one.

48
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,635
Hmm... I heard about a new store that just opened
outside the shopping district. It should have cute stuff!

49
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:06,388
Hello, glitter. I'm blinded with sparkling.

50
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,868
Kobayashi, look!

51
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:11,334
What's this? How am I supposta use it?

52
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,384
You write with it like this.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
You'll be using a pencil, though, Kanna.

54
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,776
Miss Kobayashi! How'd I do?!

55
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:20,477
Uh.

56
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:21,842
Kobayashi, look.

57
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:25,702
What's this thing? It looks like a dragons mouth to me.

58
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,797
It's a stapler.

59
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,976
Or it's a torture device...

60
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,269
How'd you jump to that?

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,785
And what about this?

62
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:36,943
C'mon, it's obvious. That is a tool for slave branding.

63
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,009
You use it to mark your property.

64
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,631
Oh, Miss Kobayashi!

65
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,622
Will you please brand me as yours?

66
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:45,456
No way.

67
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:50,557
Ah. Look, Lady Tohru. A unicorn.

68
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:52,725
Mine!

69
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:55,365
If that unicorn knew about this,

70
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,153
I think it would be very happy.

71
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,805
Part of me wants to ask,

72
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,800
but the other part knows better.

73
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:14,320
Thanks so much!

74
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,003
Not much left to get, now.

75
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:22,458
Onward, ho!

76
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,132
Ho!

77
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:29,328
Do we really have to go here, of all places?

78
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:32,849
Sorry, there's nowhere else
close to us that sells backpacks.

79
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,224
I can appreciate our situation, but I don't like it.

80
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,819
I can't help but remember back when...

81
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,347
Whatever. We can go by ourselves.

82
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,134
I didn't say I wouldn't go!

83
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,468
Well, Kanna? You decide yet?

84
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,852
Uh-huh.

85
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,885
Surprisingly normal, considering.

86
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:03,235
Great choice, Kanna.

87
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:06,962
I had a feeling you'd go with a cursed
backpack soaked in the blood of humans.

88
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,081
Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,607
That was her reason?!

90
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:19,263
That'll be 38,000 yen.

91
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:22,670
It's not made out of gold, is it?

92
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,930
Is that too much?

93
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,289
No, it's fine...

94
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,751
I'm gonna use my card to pay for this.

95
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:30,939
Of course. We take all forms of payment.

96
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:44,372
Hi, how're you?

97
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:49,090
Miss Kobayashi, Kanna's gonna pout
again if we go in another store like this.

98
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:50,852
We don't have a choice.

99
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,287
This is where the school said we have to go.

100
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,788
Conspiracy.

101
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:55,882
Let it go.

102
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,564
I think these are the ones on our list.

103
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:03,018
They all seem the same to me.

104
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,391
That's the point.

105
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:07,638
They want the kids to all wear the
same thing so they'll all look the same.

106
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:09,158
Why would they want that?

107
00:07:09,183 --> 00:07:11,989
Hmm. So no one feels different.

108
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,199
Boys, girls, new students.

109
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:18,487
Everyone is supposed to be exactly the
same as everyone else. It's a big deal.

110
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,395
And what happens when you're different from everyone else?

111
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:25,129
They eliminate you. It sucks.

112
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,388
I know it might be different for dragons,

113
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,966
but humans aren't that accepting of
people who are different from them.

114
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,809
That's ludicrous.

115
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,765
Yeah. I completely agree with you.

116
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:40,806
The truth is, people are just terrified.

117
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,933
They fear anything different.

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,714
I kind of understand.

119
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:02,009
Hmm. I'm sorry.

120
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:03,995
Didn't mean to bring the room down.

121
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,997
You're sweet to worry about me.

122
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,776
Well, Kanna. Looking forward to school?

123
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:21,672
Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,384
All right, once we get home,

125
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,781
we prepare for tomorrow!

126
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:35,281
Yay!

127
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:37,411
Miss Kobayashi, that's not fair!

128
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:39,138
You should be holding my hand, too!

129
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:40,352
Fine, whatever.

130
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,571
Kobayashi!

131
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:51,500
Look at me!

132
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,176
Whoa! You look amazing!

133
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,605
Super-cute deluxe.

134
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:58,683
Lady Tohru.

135
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,494
Look! What do you think?

136
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,195
Kanna. Hey, can I borrow that for just a second?

137
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:05,988
Hmm?

138
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,165
Miss Kobayashi!

139
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:09,357
Check it out!

140
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,575
What do you think of me?

141
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,786
I think jealousy is not your best look.

142
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,744
I can't believe she wore that
backpack for the rest of the day.

143
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,128
She must be really excited.

144
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:27,505
I get that she's excited, but this seems a bit excessive.

145
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:34,527
She may be a dragon, but she's also still a child.

146
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,747
Any idea what Kanna's doing?

147
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,596
She's practicing her writing.

148
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,024
Oh!

149
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,731
So... how's it going?

150
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:05,902
Huh...?

151
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,784
Maybe it's time to stop practicing.

152
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,955
Good morning!

153
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:22,034
Yes, yes, good morning, children.

154
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:25,816
Today, I have a brand-new student
and friend to introduce to you.

155
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,419
This is Kanna Kobayashi.

156
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:32,217
I'm Kanna, and it's a pleasure to meet you.

157
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,615
She's adorable!

158
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,211
Where are you from, Kanna?

159
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:36,747
Ushishir Island.

160
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,919
Overseas?

161
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,728
No surprise that Kanna's classroom
introduction is going over so well.

162
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:45,470
Make sure you watch over Kanna today, okay?

163
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:48,506
Don't worry. Tohru is on the job!

164
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:52,163
Good. Let's try this one, now.

165
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:54,438
Kanna? Do you think you can solve it?

166
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,996
That problem is so lame.

167
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,992
I don't get what she finds so fascinating about school.

168
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,795
Correct. Very good, Kanna.

169
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,022
Such an inefficient way to learn.

170
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:12,918
Putting those kids in different classes based on
their abilities would help all of them develop faster.

171
00:11:19,943 --> 00:11:22,955
Their game seems to be simply
hitting each other with a ball.

172
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,917
Fitting pastime for barbarians.

173
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:25,797
Kya!

174
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,330
Yes! Very good, Kanna!

175
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,259
She's showing them no mercy.

176
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,872
Kanna, you're incredible!

177
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,566
You can do anything, huh?

178
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,834
Kanna, do you think we could be friends?

179
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,699
Mm.

180
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,442
Oh, can I be your friend, too?

181
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:51,767
Hmm.

182
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,680
The truth is people are just terrified.

183
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:57,687
They fear anything different.

184
00:11:58,288 --> 00:12:01,859
Maybe so, but they clearly try
to ally themselves with the strong.

185
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,887
They may be young, but they're still only human.

186
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,513
Goodbye, have a good evening!

187
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,705
Thank you, kids. You, too!

188
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,933
Yo, Kanna. Kanna Kobayashi.

189
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:13,983
Hmm?

190
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,420
You are getting way too much attention!

191
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:19,122
Ugh. Saikawa's acting like a queen again.

192
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,428
Great, thank you for making things so clear!

193
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:23,613
Now, shut up, no one asked your opinion!

194
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:24,830
You were saying?

195
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:27,306
You bet I was! You really piss me off!

196
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,706
You're so cute I just want to hug you forever!

197
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:36,122
I challenge you, Kanna Kobayashi!

198
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:38,872
I'll prove to the class that
I'm better than you'll ever be!

199
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,122
Don't fall for it, Kanna!

200
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,886
Saikawa plays dirty and she's a big ol' cheater!

201
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:46,388
Not to mention she's a sad meanie
who'll never admit she lost anyway.

202
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:48,153
You shut your stupid, lying mouth!

203
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,097
You wanna try arm-wrestling me?!

204
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:54,790
I look weak, but I've won karate
tournaments, so I... Oh, uh...

205
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:59,937
I just... I just wanted to be friends...

206
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,847
Oh, gahwd! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

207
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:04,263
I didn't mean to make you sad!

208
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,055
The truth is, I just wanna be friends with you, too!

209
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,683
I swear it! Oh, shoot, Saikawa, look what you did!

210
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,372
She is so messed up...

211
00:13:10,562 --> 00:13:13,305
Please don't cry! I have candy! Want some candy?

212
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:16,180
Uh-oh! We're not allowed to
bring candy to school, Saikawa!

213
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,663
I said, shut up!

214
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,742
Fake crying, huh?

215
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,973
Seems kind of a devious way
to settle things, doncha think?

216
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,841
I would've obliterated them and been done with it.

217
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:29,698
Hmm.

218
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:34,037
Why did you decide you wanted to go to school?

219
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,224
I thought it would be fun to watch the kids.

220
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,755
Was it fun, though?

221
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:39,565
Mm-hmm.

222
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,535
Keep in mind some aspects might not be too fun.

223
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:43,934
Hmm.

224
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:47,872
There's no reason for us to try
and be exactly like the humans.

225
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,803
Living among them doesn't mean we have to live as them.

226
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,768
You know what I mean?

227
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:52,641
I do.

228
00:13:53,442 --> 00:13:57,525
But they're so close by, and we
share our lives with the humans.

229
00:14:00,203 --> 00:14:03,486
Embracing them just feels a lot better than hating them.

230
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,486
Embracing them...

231
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:10,467
I've seen comrades destroy themselves,
all because acceptance was too foreign,

232
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,455
so they thought hate was their only option.

233
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,497
But there's a choice.

234
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,502
And I think, for now, I'm gonna go with embracing, too.

235
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:24,096
Ah! So how was your first day?

236
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,588
It was really fun.

237
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:26,762
That's good to hear.

238
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:29,974
Miss Kobayashi, I fulfilled my given mission, too!

239
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:31,437
Please praise me!

240
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:34,414
You are now praised. Oh, I almost forgot.

241
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,565
For you, Kanna.

242
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:36,835
Hmm?

243
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:43,830
But how...?

244
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,472
It's a congratulations.

245
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,643
You should be able to hang it on your backpack.

246
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,430
Miss Kobayashi!

247
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:54,940
Hmm?

248
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,218
What'd you get me?!

249
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,622
What about me, Miss Kobayashi?! Me?

250
00:14:58,705 --> 00:14:59,888
Ta-dah.

251
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:00,876
Oh, yay!

252
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,188
So pretty...

253
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,179
What are you doing to your stuff?

254
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,966
I'm labeling it.

255
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,975
They said I was supposed to put nametags on all my things.

256
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,388
Call now for today's special product!

257
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:23,687
That wasn't too hard.

258
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:24,433
Huh...?

259
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,018
Why?

260
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:33,579
How?

261
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:43,559
Why and how did things get like this?

262
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:47,038
The story starts one day ago.

263
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,621
This is real good!

264
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,185
You're the best.

265
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:53,494
No, you are.

266
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:56,340
Sorry I keep dropping by all the time.

267
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:58,765
You're checking up on Tohru, aren't you?

268
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,173
Yeah. How'd you know?

269
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:02,013
Well. You're not alone.

270
00:16:03,122 --> 00:16:05,319
Uh. I'm bored with this game.

271
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,101
I would like to play something else, if you don't mind.

272
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,375
Come on, be honest. You're here to check up on Tohru, too.

273
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:14,913
I'm home.

274
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,879
Ooh, you survived another day!

275
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:17,953
Oh, no...

276
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,646
What happened?

277
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:22,873
A duel.

278
00:16:23,163 --> 00:16:24,623
A duel?

279
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:26,737
I shall assist you.

280
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:27,926
I shall kill.

281
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,914
Calm down, ya delinquents!

282
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,536
It happened earlier on the way home.

283
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:37,814
Kanna.

284
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,134
I decided that, today, I'll go home with you,

285
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:42,216
so consider yourself honored with my presence.

286
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,075
Hmm. You are very kind, Saikawa.

287
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,123
I like you.

288
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:47,474
I like you.

289
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,302
Hmm?

290
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,915
Today, I'm gonna show you the best place to play!

291
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:53,899
Mm-hmm.

292
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,804
Well? This place is huge, but it's kind
of a hidden spot, so no one ever comes here.

293
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,483
That's the thing you fly with!

294
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,115
What? Fly?

295
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,782
Yeah. In the clouds.

296
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:10,642
Hmm? Sure, sounds fun.

297
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,983
Let's play on the seesaw.

298
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,439
Sorry about that, girls.

299
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,027
Be more careful, you idiots!

300
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,741
What's wong? Widdle baby fwightened by a widdle ball?

301
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:25,213
Don't be a jerk. We're sorry.
Sometimes, dodgeball gets crazy.

302
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:29,955
And? Little kids come here to play, too, so you
should leave if you can't handle your dumb game.

303
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,388
Nowhere else to go.

304
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,597
[We wouldn't leave if there was somewhere else.

305
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,668
It's time for the babies to go home.

306
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,022
For real, dude, who hurt you?

307
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,055
You'll pay.

308
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:39,544
What?

309
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,427
I challenge you to a dodgeball game tomorrow!

310
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,644
If you lose, you can't play here!

311
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:46,033
Uh...

312
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:48,593
You hear that?!

313
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:50,986
The infant thinks she's gonna defeat us!

314
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,555
Yeah, we're not gonna play with you,

315
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,788
but thanks for the offer we appreciate it.

316
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,597
Why, what's wrong? You scared?

317
00:17:56,684 --> 00:18:00,263
Maybe you're afraid you're gonna get embarrassed
in front of all your nerdy, loser friends?

318
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,930
Try not being so chicken!

319
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,288
What did you say?

320
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,805
Don't listen to her, man.

321
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,085
Or don't listen to that mama's boy!

322
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,465
Huh?

323
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:11,359
Wanna call your mom to see if she
thinks you can win against us, mama's boy?

324
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:15,463
Is that what you need? "Help me, Mama, help me!"

325
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:16,887
You are such a brat.

326
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,101
What's wong?

327
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:21,477
Are the big, bad boys fwightened by a widdle, baby girl?

328
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,632
Hmph. Pathetic, much?

329
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,614
Fine, snot nose, bring it on!

330
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,717
Don't throw a fit when you lose!

331
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:34,359
What do I do...?

332
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,153
So you picked a fight and they took you up on it?

333
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,218
How many kids have agreed to help you out?

334
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:44,055
About zero. Saikawa's not very popular.

335
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,553
I know! I'm the worst!

336
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,387
What to do about it...?

337
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:49,359
I bet you could still negotiate with them.

338
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,823
No way! I assure you, they must fight!

339
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:56,233
Under no circumstances shall the
noble and proud dragon be taken lightly!

340
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,747
Do you know how to play?

341
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,344
Yes!

342
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,428
I know, as well. I've played a lot of Explosive Dodgeball.

343
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,269
This isn't that kind of game.

344
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,097
Come on, we can do this!

345
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,099
Yeah!

346
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,801
Don't stress. I'm sure it'll work out.

347
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:10,722
Hmm...

348
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,472
What's this, squirt?! Had to call in friends?!

349
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:21,955
We're not gonna go easy on ya, now!

350
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,334
Tohru.

351
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:28,175
Hmm?

352
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:29,725
No killing.

353
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:30,574
'Kay!

354
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,079
I knew how it would end at the start.

355
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:37,908
From the onset, their abilities... Well, their species.

356
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,663
They were on different levels.

357
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:43,826
This game was above and beyond one-sided.

358
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,050
It wasn't a win.

359
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:47,600
It was a massacre.

360
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:48,967
Damn it!

361
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,445
That's not fair!

362
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,413
You set us up! You're gonna regret this!

363
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,972
Oof, "beat up" is not his color.

364
00:19:53,997 --> 00:19:55,895
Kanna, your friends are incredible!

365
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:58,763
Hmm. You're right, they're the worst scum ever.

366
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,965
Not untrue, but you could be more delicate.

367
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,158
I could play this game all day long.

368
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,872
Well, what a coincidence. Same here.

369
00:20:07,013 --> 00:20:08,179
Yeah, me three.

370
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:09,888
I just remembered...

371
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:14,336
Now, I might be wrong, but have I
yet to win against the two of you?

372
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,536
Think today's the day?

373
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,465
Probably... no.

374
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,619
Huh, this could be real bad.

375
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:21,888
I wanna play!

376
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:22,548
Huh?

377
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:24,777
From that moment forward...

378
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,387
...the playground became a battlefield.

379
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,386
Rah!

380
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,146
So many dragons.

381
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,384
Excellent.

382
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:54,537
Where did my peaceful, boring,
little life run off to? Meh, whatever.

383
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,994
And that brings us to now.

384
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:05,038
Don't stress. I'll restore the playground to normal.

385
00:21:05,174 --> 00:21:07,433
And I'll tweak the memories of anyone who saw us.

386
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,622
You're more and more useful to have around.

387
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:14,985
After that, they took to playing dodgeball on the regular.

388
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,202
Pay more attention to your lower back!

389
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:18,633
Oh. Is this better?

390
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,937
Think "old lady about to be deserted"!

391
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:23,722
Nailed it again.

392
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,341
Look, Kanna!

393
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,978
Isn't it super cute?

394
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,693
Oh... Yeah, that's wicked.

395
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,747
Kanna, over here. These are so cool!

396
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,407
Oh... Yeah, that's wicked.

397
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:40,804
Kanna, hey!

398
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,105
Hello, Saikawa, you're wicked.

399
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:45,674
Okay! Time to start class, kids.

400
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,666
Oh, yeah, that's wicked.

401
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:51,192
Oh, yeah, that's wicked. Oh, yeah, that's wicked.

402
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:54,951
What's wicked? What are they talking about?

403
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,769
Kanna, aren't you glad we won the dodgeball game?

404
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,404
Yes.

405
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,896
We almost lost our right to play at the playground!

406
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:33,023
That's okay.

407
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,587
I'll be happy anywhere if I'm with you, Saikawa.
