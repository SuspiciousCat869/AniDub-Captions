1
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,259
Good morning!

2
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:09,171
Your coffee's ready, Miss Kobayashi.

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,296
Just what I needed. Thanks.

4
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:16,036
Kanna, you'll have to eat faster
than that if you wanna be on time.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,961
'key.

6
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:18,698
I made you some hot milk.

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,917
Oh, Miss Kobayashi?

8
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:25,244
I'm sure you have something
particular you want for dinner, yeah?

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,206
Hmm... Not really.

10
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,102
Anything works for me!

11
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,725
Except for that.

12
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:33,075
Still no tail?

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,658
Tohru, what about you? What would you like to eat?

14
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:37,102
What would I like?

15
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:40,447
Uh... Omurice , I guess.

16
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:41,158
Yummy!

17
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:41,627
For real?

18
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:42,288
Yes, let's do that!

19
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:42,945
Ok!

20
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,583
It's gonna be delicious, right?

21
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:48,327
You betcha! Tohru's on it!

22
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,931
So, what time do you expect
to be getting home this evening?

23
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:54,720
Hopefully not too late.

24
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:57,172
I hope that, too.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,366
See you later, Lady Tohru.

26
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,614
I'm heading out, too.

27
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,623
See ya! Have a good day!

28
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:06,698
All right! Here I go!

29
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:09,401
Time to get my maid on!

30
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:44,492
Cleaning, cleaning, la la la.

31
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:47,796
Beat the dust and de-de-destroy it!

32
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:51,345
No trash or fleck of dust will be left behind!

33
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:54,475
Now clean, now clean clean everything.

34
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,965
Ugh! What?

35
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,088
Oh, no, you did not.

36
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:03,781
Death, death, death to the world!

37
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,643
Oh! Um...

38
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:06,845
Bathroom, check!

39
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:08,132
Bedrooms, check!

40
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:09,326
Entrance, check!

41
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,708
Rooster, check!

42
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,561
Living room, check!

43
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:17,954
Classic Tohru! Perfect timing on the laundry, too!

44
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:22,809
I bet these will dry fairly
quickly with all this sunshine today.

45
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:25,878
Coming!

46
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,479
Just need your stamp, please.

47
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,651
Thank you for all your hard work.

48
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,316
You're welcome. Thank you!

49
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:38,210
Must be that cushion to help with
Miss Kobayashi's lower back pain.

50
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:39,797
Good.

51
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,863
I finished everything I needed to.

52
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:44,942
All that's left now is to make the omurice for dinner.

53
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,946
This is all for Miss Kobayashi.

54
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,235
It's gonna be delicious, right?

55
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,929
Tonight's dinner will be the best omurice ever!

56
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,064
I need to do a trial run.

57
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,282
Not too bad!

58
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,367
Good work, me.

59
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,519
Fluffy, juicy eggs,

60
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,058
hot rice with ketchup,

61
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,259
and all at restaurant quality.

62
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,482
As for the taste?

63
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,445
Average?!

64
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,775
It's not that it tastes bad, it's just that...

65
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:24,450
It's gonna be delicious, right?

66
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:31,364
It's just that I want it to be more special than average.

67
00:04:31,558 --> 00:04:34,391
And she made it clear she didn't want any of my tail.

68
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:37,431
Coming!

69
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:38,991
Hey.

70
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,558
Oh, hi! What are you doing here, Lucoa?

71
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,372
To see you and bring these.

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,850
Want some snacks?

73
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:46,642
Duh. Thank you!

74
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:51,477
What are you wearing that for?

75
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,713
Oh, those pesky patriarchal societal
demands were getting on my nerves,

76
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:56,854
so I changed clothes.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,584
Give it a week, they'll be begging you to change back.

78
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,109
Huh?

79
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,463
You can come on in if you want.

80
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,607
Okay, I think I will. Thank you!

81
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:11,898
No wonder that little shop had such awesome reviews.

82
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:13,740
Would you like me to make you some more tea?

83
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:16,216
Oh. No, I gotta go, thanks, though.

84
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,141
Sure! I was just...

85
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:22,608
I was in the middle of making trial batches
of omurice for Miss Kobayashi for dinner, and...

86
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:26,160
Well, do you know any cooking techniques
that might make it taste a bit better?

87
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,690
Huh. Making omurice better?

88
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:35,166
The simplest thing I can think of to do
is to use the best ingredients you can find.

89
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,808
Yes, that's brilliant!

90
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:37,888
See ya later!

91
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,889
Thanks for the tea, it was heavenly.

92
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:42,265
I'm sure you meant that as a compliment.

93
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,354
The best ingredients.

94
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:54,689
It's so expensive.

95
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,511
Let's see. That plus...

96
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:59,116
...the best rice, vegetables, and eggs.

97
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,934
Uh! Wait. I'm over budget?!

98
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,058
Are you shopping for dinner tonight, Tohru?

99
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:06,867
Oh. Mister Tatsuta.

100
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,616
Yes, but this chicken is expensive, don't you think?

101
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:14,418
Well, that's because it's locally
raised, free-range, and organic.

102
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,934
I don't suppose you could give me a discount?

103
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,511
Sorry, it's already priced as low as I can go.

104
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:21,420
Not even a little discount?

105
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,761
I can't. If I go any lower
than this, I'll be losing money.

106
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,395
I understand.

107
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,803
But I do want to thank you
for doing the Christmas show.

108
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,812
So I could give you some off on these cuts.

109
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,026
Average?!

110
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,875
Average cuts would defeat the point.

111
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,984
The point of what?

112
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,587
It's gonna be delicious, right?

113
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,416
I have no other options.

114
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,338
Hereabouts should be good.

115
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,721
I'm back from school!

116
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,069
Welcome home, Kanna!

117
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,772
Lady Tohru. What'd you do?

118
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,831
I picked up ingredients for omurice .

119
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,672
And you had to go back to do that?

120
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:24,932
Just for a second.

121
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:28,528
Goodness. So, whose eggs are these?

122
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:31,399
Oh, those? I got them from Gullinkambi's nest.

123
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:34,308
Really? The rooster who is Valhalla's alarm clock?

124
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:34,718
Yep.

125
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,551
Doo-a-doodle-cock!

126
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,391
They're unbelievably good!

127
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:39,470
They are?

128
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:43,083
An Einhairjar told me they were the
best quality eggs in anywhere ever.

129
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,333
And this?

130
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,380
That's uh.

131
00:07:45,594 --> 00:07:47,859
That's fresh spring water from an elven village.

132
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,154
I plan to use it to boil the rice.

133
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,240
It's pure!

134
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:54,341
Only problem is I've fought with the elves before.

135
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,631
So I kinda snuck in and took it.

136
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:59,439
Wow. They have every right to kill you over that.

137
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,075
I also grabbed some meat from bull demons.

138
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,700
As well as fruits that are in season over there.

139
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,415
Where did you get the rice and vegetables?

140
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:10,673
I thought it would be best to just
use the ones they already have here.

141
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,753
Good call. The rice in this world is out of this world.

142
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,607
Yeah, because they're using magic.

143
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,904
Apparently, it's what's known as "selective breeding."

144
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:21,699
I should see if I could get someone
to teach me that incantation sometime.

145
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,579
Now, then.

146
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,641
Time to get this cooking party started!

147
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,600
Will you help me get this perfect, Kanna?

148
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:28,466
Yeah!

149
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,433
Growl!

150
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,963
Out with bad demon,

151
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:38,796
and in with good blessings!

152
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,709
Roar!

153
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:42,735
Out with bad demon,

154
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,059
and in with good blessings!

155
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,442
Lucoa!

156
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:03,235
What's wrong?

157
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,581
Was Shouta-baby worried about me?

158
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,517
No, he wasn't! Shut up!

159
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,794
Aw...

160
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,568
Ugh, I'm so exhausted.

161
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,567
Oh. That's right.

162
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,817
Tonight's dinner is omurice .

163
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,697
That was the first normal meal Tohru
cooked me, now that I think about it.

164
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,221
Dinner's ready, Miss Kobayashi.

165
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,395
She presented it to me with such confidence.

166
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,231
And it was pretty good, too.

167
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:38,070
Before that, everything she made was so weird.

168
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:40,631
Either way, it's been nice.

169
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:44,791
I honestly can't remember the last time
someone was willing to cook for me at all,

170
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,419
much less with that level of excitement.

171
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:51,396
I remember telling her the omurice was just okay.

172
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:54,429
Today, I won't.

173
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:58,266
I'll tell her... that it's good.

174
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,950
Hey, hurry up and get it to me!

175
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,898
Forget about that, you need to fix this error!

176
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:06,518
Kobayashi! It's almost deadline time!

177
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:07,198
I know!

178
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,651
Kobayashi! Error alert!

179
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,685
Fixing them now, sir.

180
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,562
Kobayashi! Help over here.

181
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,283
On my way, sir!

182
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,885
Kobayashi! Kobayashi! Kobayashi!

183
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,736
Shut up!

184
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,369
Gimme another one!

185
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,060
Coming up.

186
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,452
There goes my stop!

187
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,396
I don't know where I'm going to!

188
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,121
The mountain sounds good. Air's clear here.

189
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,644
What? Bears! Bring it on!

190
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,123
Tasty beary bears!

191
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,612
Oh man! It's pitch dark black! Can't see!

192
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,891
You shall not pass!

193
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,627
Human. Out of what hole dids't thou crawl?

194
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:16,222
Whoa! A dragon, ooh, hug me!

195
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:21,212
Depart, insolent human!

196
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:23,749
Otherwise, I shall eat you!

197
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:31,825
Alas. I am going to die, as well.

198
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,173
How tragic it is the last
being I meet is a pathetic human.

199
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,927
Hey, do you ever get bored listening to yourself talk?

200
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:43,209
Is froufrou lingo like, your thing?

201
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:44,602
How dare you?

202
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,143
You want me to pull that out?

203
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:48,052
Huh? Well...

204
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,558
No! You fool!

205
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,485
If a mere human touches God's sword, their mind shall be torn.

206
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,946
I dunno about all that.

207
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,152
But if God exists, then...

208
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,553
...he should exteeeend...

209
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,069
...my stupid deadline......right now!

210
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,337
Aaah!

211
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,433
I know this is just my dream, but...

212
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,543
...why does a dragon gotta be such a big, jerk-baby?!

213
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:23,252
Apologies. You saved me regardless, and it is appreciated.

214
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:27,556
I was defeated in battle with the
gods, and barely escaped to this world.

215
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:32,048
I imagine you only managed to remove
that sword because you lack faith.

216
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,061
I am truly grateful.

217
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:37,001
Don't judge on prejudices- yours!

218
00:12:37,512 --> 00:12:38,450
Boop, boop, boop.

219
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,220
Wanna drink?

220
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,122
Sure you do! Drink with me, dragon!

221
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:44,417
Drink with me, and listen to my story!

222
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,824
Why won't you drink?

223
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,164
So you're a lady dragon, then?

224
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:10,133
Yes. I am female.

225
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:13,209
To be honest, I detest using this spell, but...

226
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,555
Ooh! You're down to drank!

227
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:18,135
Yay! Just us girls, let's go!

228
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,019
You're a girl?

229
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:20,333
Yes, Rude Dragon!

230
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,108
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:21,870
...to let me fondle your tits.

232
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:25,258
It's okay to be curious even though
society pressures me to say I'm not!

233
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,047
I can?

234
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:31,384
For real! I work hard and for what?

235
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,855
I'm telling ya, this whole world is unfair, man!

236
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,769
Yeah, keep preaching sister!

237
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:37,975
Let me bring an end to this place for you!

238
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,362
And what the hell?

239
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,002
Your subordinate, your problem!

240
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,385
Do not assume all dragons are really lolicons

241
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,832
who randomly demand villages' virgin daughters!

242
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:03,775
Nights like this are when I wonder why I'm all alone.

243
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:07,579
Me, too.

244
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,400
But I truly am alone here. There's no one.

245
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:13,875
Just me.

246
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:19,963
Do you have anywhere to go?

247
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,084
No.

248
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:24,574
But to be fair, I have been alone from the start.

249
00:14:25,287 --> 00:14:28,534
Huh. So, wanna stay with me, dragon?

250
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,506
Yes, I do!

251
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:48,074
You can be my maid!

252
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:49,026
Your what?

253
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:52,374
Listen! We're not talking about just a simple servant here!

254
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,084
Seriously, you can have house maids,
laundry maids, all kinds of maids.

255
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,808
And it takes major training it's
not all those posers at maid cafés!

256
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:00,345
Oh.

257
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,552
My name's Kobayashi.

258
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:05,398
My name's Tohru.

259
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,022
Hello, Tohru!

260
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,248
Look, I don't mean to shade maid
cafés, they're fine for what they are,

261
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,272
but they help  contribute to the
maid profession being taken lightly.

262
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,582
Oborozuka. Oborozuka.

263
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,183
Crazy.

264
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,779
I feel like I dreamt about something important.

265
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:27,740
I'm home.

266
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:28,554
Kobayashi!

267
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,676
Yay! Welcome back home!

268
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,472
We just finished the omurice !

269
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:34,866
I helped make it!

270
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,930
Oh!

271
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,499
It's gonna be great!

272
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,016
The omurice was delicious.

273
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,821
But I was so busy pointing out all the obvious issues.

274
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,146
I sorta forgot to tell her how good it was.

275
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,755
Thanks for coming out of nowhere, rain!

276
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:03,607
I'm back!

277
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,867
Remember this morning when they said, "No chance of rain."

278
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,536
Takiya, help me.

279
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,295
It's guerrilla warfare.

280
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,039
Time to ambush.

281
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,261
Yeah, sure.

282
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,992
I guess we'll be having this for lunch for a while.

283
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,558
He's so cute! Is it okay if I pet him?

284
00:16:30,232 --> 00:16:30,934
Of course!

285
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,866
Good grief, that's ridiculous.

286
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,345
Come on. You're squishing us!

287
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,104
What simple pets, giving such affection to their humans.

288
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,274
Yeah, you're one to talk.

289
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:40,443
Kanna.

290
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:40,838
No.

291
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,622
Speaking of the nearness of me,

292
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,658
were there any humans in your old
world you were particularly close to?

293
00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:49,641
Humans in my world? I guess so, kinda.

294
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,569
There is one human I can think of.

295
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,183
You could say I associated with
them, if only for a little while.

296
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,141
Really? What were they like?

297
00:16:57,337 --> 00:17:00,114
Heh. If you'll excuse me.

298
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:02,746
I'm going to have to talk a lot about myself now.

299
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:11,016
I first met that human in a
deserted village that was in ruins.

300
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,551
This should work as my home for a while.

301
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,874
It's rare to encounter a dragon in a place like this!

302
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:29,116
I'm actually only here to hide out, myself.

303
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:30,914
Do you mind if I stay a short time?

304
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:32,879
You're a bandit?

305
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:37,033
Yes, that's right. I mistook a noble
for a merchant and attacked their party.

306
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:38,481
Now, I'm on the run!

307
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,937
My comrades have been captured, leaving me alone.

308
00:17:40,962 --> 00:17:44,209
So I'm currently debating my
options on where I should go next.

309
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,248
Do you believe I care?

310
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,660
I could save you time and kill you.

311
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,546
How dare you laugh at me!

312
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,308
Oh, I'm sorry!

313
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:58,310
I mean no offense, Dragon, but you're not
very used to threatening people, are you?

314
00:17:58,382 --> 00:17:59,444
Excuse me?

315
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:01,918
It's just not very convincing, sorry!

316
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:03,778
'Tis not just a threat, human!

317
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:07,612
See what I mean?

318
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,102
So. It's okay, then?

319
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:13,879
You'll let me stay for a while?

320
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:17,407
Do as you please.

321
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:18,535
Thank you!

322
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:22,542
Thinking back on it now, I could've
just left and found somewhere else.

323
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,850
But in that moment... I guess...

324
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:27,597
I couldn't allow myself to yield to a human.

325
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,160
Hey, so... you're a dragon, right?

326
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:32,733
What's that kind of life like?

327
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,417
What do you mean?

328
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,741
You know, like how you can fly.

329
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:40,828
And you possess so much power
you'll pretty much never lose a fight.

330
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:43,528
I wish I knew what it was like to live so freely.

331
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:45,187
Must be wondrous.

332
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,351
Uh! Hey! I'm talking!

333
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,164
At the time, I found myself thinking.

334
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,481
What was my freedom like?

335
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,564
I had never thought of myself as "free" before then.

336
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,917
I was born with the chaos faction.

337
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:02,069
I lived with chaos, and I fought the divine.

338
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:05,418
If that all ended, would I be free?

339
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,149
Would it ever end?

340
00:19:08,133 --> 00:19:11,128
Even if it did end, and I was free, what would I do?

341
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:15,609
What would you do if you had my freedom?

342
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:18,140
I'd be a maid!

343
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:19,321
A maid?

344
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,082
Yes! A maid.

345
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,162
I'd wear the cutest maid outfit.

346
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,308
I'd greet every single guest with my very best smile,

347
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,017
and I would totally fall in love with my master.

348
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,240
You would willingly enslave yourself?

349
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:34,116
Yep! But that's kinda the point!

350
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,901
I'd get to have a choice!

351
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,067
Mine!

352
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,266
Had I chosen it, my life would be so different, y'know?

353
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,683
Even now, if I could make my own
decision between the two options.

354
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:47,098
At least I could choose to stay
a bandit or choose to be a slave.

355
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:48,805
I see.

356
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:49,483
Right?

357
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:53,884
I realized that I had never made my own choice, either.

358
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,204
But I hadn't been as bothered by it as she was.

359
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,346
Since there wasn't anyone else I wanted to see,

360
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,712
I allowed the girl to stay and chatted with her for a while.

361
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,707
I'm probably good to go.

362
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:08,938
You are leaving?

363
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,766
I think I'll cross over the mountains and see
if I can get into a nation bordering this one.

364
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,891
I'm sure something'll work out for me.

365
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,390
Oh, do you mind? Can I ride you real quick?

366
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:21,116
Of course not! I shall never let a human ride me!

367
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:22,516
Selfish! Selfish!

368
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,787
Say what you will. I would die first!

369
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:28,596
I hope to see you again.

370
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,849
Goodbye, Dragon! And thank you.

371
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,516
For what?

372
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,307
For spending time with me.

373
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,998
She left after that.

374
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,967
The annoying human was finally gone.

375
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,221
At least, that's how I should have felt.

376
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:47,132
But instead, I felt a little sad.

377
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:50,771
I'm sure. Do you think that person
might have something to do with

378
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,533
why you decided to become my maid?

379
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,432
Probably.

380
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:56,203
I don't say this sort of thing often, but

381
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,573
I don't think I'd mind seeing that human again.

382
00:20:59,167 --> 00:20:59,999
I get that.

383
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:00,722
Yeah?

384
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,523
Oh, by the way, Tohru.

385
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:03,948
Yeah?

386
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:07,307
The way you used to talk sounds like an old man.

387
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,450
Huh? Well, I think it's fancy!

388
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,141
Whatever.

389
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:14,210
How nice.

390
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,167
The weather's perfect.

391
00:21:27,476 --> 00:21:30,313
Oooh. I think I get that.

392
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:37,216
I've thoroughly blended in to this world.

393
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,861
Meh. Is what it is.

394
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:29,305
Tohru, do you think that bandit girl is still alive?

395
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,265
Who knows?

396
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,516
But if she is, I bet she's serving as a maid.

397
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,542
Same as you, then.

398
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:34,638
Exactly.

399
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,619
Either way, I hope she's well.

400
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,952
I hope so, too.
