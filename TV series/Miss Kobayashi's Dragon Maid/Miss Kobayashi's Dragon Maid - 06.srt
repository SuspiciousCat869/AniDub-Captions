1
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:08,738
Hey, so, um, Kanna...

2
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:11,327
Do you wanna come play with me at my house?

3
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,253
You want me to play at your house?

4
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:14,164
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,330
Will it be fun?

6
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:16,785
Are you kidding me?!

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,408
We have tons of games and all the toys and snacks!

8
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,257
Oh, yeah! We have a maid, too!

9
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,805
A maid?

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,577
Yeah, you could bring your maid with you if you wanted to!

11
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,119
You know, the one who played dodge ball with us?

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,989
After I told my maid about it, she
said she would really love to meet her.

13
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,332
She wants to talk maid shop and that kinda stuff.

14
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:36,387
So does that sound okay to you?

15
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:37,887
Yeah, sure.

16
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,073
This is it?

17
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:19,332
So the loser who dares to challenge
my maid-dom lives in this house?

18
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,737
I'll crush her!

19
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,530
Sorry, why am I here, too?

20
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:24,844
Because you're the one who knows the most about maids.

21
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,753
Hello and welcome to my lovely home!

22
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,216
I see you brought your maid and your, uh...?

23
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:33,885
This is Kobayashi. She's my guardian.

24
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh, it's very nice to meet you, Kanna's mother.

25
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:39,829
What? Do I look old enough to be her mom?

26
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,022
Don't let that bug you, Miss Kobayashi.

27
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:45,805
After all, if you were my age, you'd
be old enough to be every human's mom.

28
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:48,762
Young Lady, I believe introductions are due.

29
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,944
If you say so.

30
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:53,639
Introducing... our, um, our family's maid.

31
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,155
Pleasure to meet you.

32
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:59,381
My name is Georgie, and I am
proud to serve this wonderful family.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,711
What's that outfit about, Georgie?

34
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,959
You don't look like much of a maid to me.

35
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,638
Where's the basic black and white?

36
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:10,726
No. There's actually not a set
uniform for the maids in this world.

37
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:15,503
Unfortunately, as the role of servant grew
larger and more formal over long periods of history,

38
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,486
their outfits evolved into
what is commonly thought of today.

39
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:19,306
Thank you.

40
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,591
This maid outfit is a simple one created with the
wages of a girl who's recently entered the service.

41
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,461
I am humbled. You have a discerning eye.

42
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:28,286
You mean...

43
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,050
That's right. We are...

44
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,457
Allies!

45
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,201
Please, Miss Kobayashi, you can't let yourself
be influenced by this maid and her ugly outfit!

46
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:39,419
Oh, yes, you must be Tohru.

47
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:41,944
I've heard rumors about you in the shopping district.

48
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,132
Honestly...

49
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:46,544
I've wanted to discuss maids and,
well, anything with you for a while, now.

50
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,733
We're so ready!

51
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,211
Please, come this way!

52
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:52,754
Oh, god!

53
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:56,458
This is the first time Miss Kobayashi's
pulled me along with such passion!

54
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:00,224
Okay, so, um...

55
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:02,254
You wanna go play in my room, Kanna?

56
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:02,947
Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:10,742
So, what should we play? Any ideas?

58
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,037
What is that game?

59
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,882
Oh, yeah, this is Twister.

60
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,644
It's a kid's game.

61
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:18,535
I wanna try it.

62
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:21,252
Sounds good to me. Let's give her a go.

63
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:24,352
Player one, left hand, yellow.

64
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,086
You just gotta follow the directions.

65
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,819
So I put my left hand on yellow.

66
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:29,954
Player two, right hand, blue.

67
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:31,711
You'll be player two, Kanna.

68
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:32,536
Mm.

69
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,695
Player one, left foot, red.

70
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,930
Oh, red. Here I go.

71
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,297
Player two, right hand, blue.

72
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,496
Blue.

73
00:04:41,856 --> 00:04:43,093
Right foot, red.

74
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,069
Okay.

75
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:46,634
Left foot...

76
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:47,256
Green.

77
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:52,168
Ah, K-Kanna's so... So soft!

78
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,044
I'd like to play a video game.

79
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:59,090
Yeah, totally. I have a ton of those!

80
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,749
A fun one, please.

81
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,257
Sure thing! A fun one!

82
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,079
Mm! Smells so good.

83
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,651
Is it a first flush?

84
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:09,526
Impressive.

85
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:13,444
Interestingly, I've recently
acquired some first flush Darjeeling.

86
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:16,962
Yes, I've heard about that! It's a good, fresh tea, right?

87
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,444
You see... there are a few things I know, too!

88
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:22,206
Wow. This is beautiful. Must be antique.

89
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:24,478
From the Victorian era, obviously.

90
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,044
Can you believe I picked it up at a flea market?

91
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,919
Georgie, mind if I ask what made you such a fan of maids?

92
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,628
It was a children's book I read that told
the story of a young girl becoming a maid.

93
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:35,336
I know that book! I read it, too!

94
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,153
Really? You did, Kobayashi?

95
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,939
They were professionals entrusted
with taking care of the home.

96
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,653
The pride they had along with such dignified
character moved me on a different level!

97
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,361
What about all those costume changes?

98
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:49,387
Loved them and loved how they had to pay attention
to their appearance even when they were working!

99
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,787
Oh, my god, I died over their posture!

100
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:53,486
How about this game?

101
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,019
Sure.

102
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:55,225
All right.

103
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:57,832
Here you go.

104
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,081
You sit there.

105
00:05:59,315 --> 00:05:59,969
What?

106
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:03,281
Right here?

107
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,275
Wait, um...

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,693
That's perfect. You're comfortable. Thanks.

109
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,028
Yes! You're welcome!

110
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,653
Saikawa, I can't breathe.

111
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:15,919
Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:17,258
I couldn't help myself.

113
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,319
Hey, I have a question.

114
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:21,429
Okay?

115
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,441
Do you think I'm getting along with the kids in our class?

116
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,278
Well, of course you are!

117
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,590
You can do everything, and
everyone praises you because of it.

118
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,286
I guess it just feels different to me.

119
00:06:33,696 --> 00:06:35,363
I can't explain this well,

120
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:37,938
but I want what Kobayashi and Tohru have.

121
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,694
It's special, and I like that.

122
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,316
Listen, Kanna.

123
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:45,099
I think you know by now that I like you a lot.

124
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:47,648
But I want to be even closer to you than this.

125
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,342
Like married. Oh, gosh. I said it.

126
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,265
Fine.

127
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:56,063
I'm fine with that kind of close. Ready?

128
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:57,736
Um... Yeah, but...

129
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,153
First... I need to prepare my heart!

130
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:01,090
Saikawa.

131
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,221
No! No more!

132
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,725
Help!

133
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:05,444
Don't run!

134
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:07,446
Join us in our maid conversation!

135
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:10,544
Save me, Kanna!

136
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,471
So Georgie is Saikawa's older sister, then?

137
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:27,253
Huh. I wonder if Georgie is her real name or
just what she uses when she's dressed up like a maid.

138
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:30,620
She wasn't actually a maid, merely a maid fanatic.

139
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,727
I'm confused... So confused...

140
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,145
What was Kanna gonna do to me earlier?

141
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,787
...dragon style.

142
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,841
Ugh. Will it ever stop raining?

143
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,694
Say no more!

144
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:58,517
Please don't do that.

145
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:07,039
Hold up, you mean you also decided
to move from your world to this one?

146
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,110
Mm-hmm!

147
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:09,819
But why would you do that?

148
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:15,403
Well, lately I've been hanging out with you guys
more regularly, and travel can be such a beast, you know?

149
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,590
I dunno, I guess I just like being closer.

150
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:19,036
What? Closer?

151
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:23,350
Yeah, I'm staying at someone's house not
too far away, just like Tohru's doing with you!

152
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,944
Hey, do you maybe wanna swing by and see it?

153
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:28,482
As long as it's okay, yes! Definitely.

154
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,786
Great, you can help with the misunderstanding.

155
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:31,690
The what?

156
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,987
So funny.

157
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,288
But our silly little mix-up is partly why I
thought staying in this world would be a good idea.

158
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:42,942
It all started one day while I was on my way
home from here, mostly minding my own business.

159
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,101
Wait, it feels like someone is performing a ritual nearby.

160
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:47,946
What? A kiddo?

161
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:52,940
Might as well.

162
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:04,319
So you seriously let yourself get summoned
by a ritual performed by a curious child.

163
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,337
And then you said,

164
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,153
"Sure, I'll be your servant, kid."

165
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:08,552
Don't be so judgy.

166
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:13,343
Besides, this family is apparently part of a long
line of mages, so it could all wind up for the best.

167
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:16,402
Mind clarifying the misunderstanding
that needs clearing up?

168
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:19,065
Yeah, so he got it into his head that I'm a demon.

169
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,985
I was hoping you might be willing to talk
some sense into him and make my life easier.

170
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:28,027
Yay! We're here, guys! Welcome to Shouta's house!

171
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:29,461
Well, come on in.

172
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,697
Uh, sure it's okay?

173
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,898
No one's at home, now. I swear, you're so paranoid.

174
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:37,537
Just follow me. I'm crashing in one of the
rooms upstairs, so we can chill out in there.

175
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:38,961
You want some tea?

176
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,447
I'd offer something else, but I don't have that.

177
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:42,326
Hey.

178
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:43,076
Yeah?

179
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,928
I wanna ask something, but I'm afraid it might sound rude.

180
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,474
Hmm?

181
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,509
What the hell are you, Lucoa?

182
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:49,789
Yeah. Sounds rude.

183
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:50,550
Sorry.

184
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:54,628
It's just I thought you were a dragon like Tohru,
but now I'm thinking that might not be the case.

185
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,374
My bad. Talk about rude! I didn't tell you!

186
00:09:57,569 --> 00:09:59,294
I don't have a category, per se,

187
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,069
but I guess you could call me an ex-goddess.

188
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:02,751
Yeah, I like ex-goddess.

189
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,712
Why ex?

190
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,566
Because she was served that cursed liquor,
and then while she was drunk, she got all...

191
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,375
Oh, yeah. You've mentioned that before.

192
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:13,361
Long story short: She was forced out of being a goddess.

193
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:15,029
Then you might as well be a demon.

194
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:20,321
Well, I'm still responsible for spreading civilization
far and wide, so it's hard to call myself a demon.

195
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:22,361
Plus, I'm like a really good being, so...

196
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:25,502
I prefer, "ex-goddess," or "feathered serpent,"

197
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,319
or "Venusian," even!

198
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:29,890
Okay, ex-goddess is gonna work for me, too.

199
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,995
Oh, sounds like someone's home, now.

200
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,336
It's Shouta.

201
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:35,733
He's the one who summoned me.

202
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,978
Poor kid seems super fidgety.

203
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:43,838
Right? He's always like that when I'm home.

204
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:49,361
Well, when he's with an older woman whose body is
an agitator of lust, it's gotta be kinda unsettling.

205
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:52,250
I know, and that's why I've tried to steady his nerves.

206
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:55,889
I've snuggled with him. I've taken warm baths with him.

207
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:57,986
But none of it seems to work.

208
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:03,771
She invited people!

209
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,678
Welcome home, Shouta, baby!

210
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:09,111
Bad demon, I know you know a
familiar can't act on their own!

211
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:10,579
You're gathering allies!

212
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,412
Are you planning to take over our home, because no, ma'am!

213
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:16,520
Fancy. He really wants to be the strong guy, huh?

214
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,592
I know, he's adorable!

215
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:22,153
Sorry. Can you forgive me?

216
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:25,069
Yes. As long as you behave.

217
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,936
Look, I get it's scary to have
people at your house you don't know,

218
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,605
but I invited them here to help you understand me better.

219
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,017
What do you mean?

220
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:36,583
I want you to know I'm not a
demon. I'm a dragon, isn't that fun?

221
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,969
Stop lying! I used a demon summoning circle.

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,337
Which I noticed and thought it might be
a little dangerous for someone your age,

223
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:47,134
so before a mean ol' demon could show
up, I decided to answer the call first!

224
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,579
What? No way.

225
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:51,886
I-I don't have enough magical
power to summon a dragon, yet.

226
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:56,544
No, you're just bluffing to make
yourself seem more powerful and trustworthy!

227
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,795
Bad demon! You won't fool me!

228
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:01,999
Literally does this every time I try. It's so cute.

229
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:03,182
Womb crippling.

230
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:04,474
Hey, Shouta?

231
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:05,419
Yes?

232
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:09,831
I've heard about how you're from a family of
mages, so... why perform a summoning ritual?

233
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,070
Um... It's 'cause...

234
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:15,973
I wanted to be accepted, now... To be a full-grown mage.

235
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,067
Mages live pretty quietly here.

236
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:21,919
But we maintain our power for when we return to our world.

237
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:24,528
My father's been in charge of that all by himself.

238
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:29,307
He's working hard to pass down his knowledge and
strength to me, but it seems like it's taking forever.

239
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,213
I just want to be better faster.

240
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,812
Ah, so you summoned Lucoa in order to prove that
you have your own power because of daddy issues.

241
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,796
Wow, kinda makes me feel bad for Lucoa.

242
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,548
I never thought about it like that.

243
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,091
Let's say she was a demon, sure
would suck to be summoned for no reason,

244
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:52,439
and what exactly were you planning to
do after she materialized in front of you?

245
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,836
Take her along to elementary school?

246
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,697
Why would any demon stay with you?

247
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,821
You're right! Everything you say is the truth!

248
00:12:58,222 --> 00:12:58,980
For real?

249
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,978
She's right, Lucoa, and I'm sorry.

250
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,208
Wait, does this mean he's gonna want me to leave?

251
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:05,742
Please, don't send me away! I don't want to go home!

252
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:07,593
You wanna stay?

253
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,294
But you can't just live at someone's
house and do nothing in return, Lucoa.

254
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:13,628
I mean, take a look at me and Miss Kobayashi.

255
00:13:13,653 --> 00:13:16,022
I'm working as a splendid maid to help her.

256
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,611
Uh, "splendid"?

257
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,730
Don't be mean!

258
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,861
My mom takes care of all the
housework and stuff like that.

259
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:25,381
Huh... In other words, what
you're saying is that I need to do

260
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:28,461
something specific for Shouta
if I want to live in his house?

261
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:32,279
How would you feel about me giving
you more gold than you could ever use!

262
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:35,383
I don't need it because my dad is really good at alchemy.

263
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:38,142
Does agricultural technology sound like fun?

264
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:40,349
No way. I don't wanna be a farmer.

265
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,758
Everyone could use some crazy strong charisma, am I right?

266
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,547
I think that would just cause
more problems than it's worth.

267
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:49,296
How about vast magical powers, then?

268
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:52,188
Hmm... Now that one is kind of appealing.

269
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:53,958
Consider it settled.

270
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,128
But no, thanks.

271
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:56,628
No? But why?

272
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:00,798
I don't believe there's a point in having vast
power if you haven't worked hard to earn it for yourself.

273
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:02,131
Wha...?

274
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,113
Gotta admire the integrity.

275
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:08,085
Lucoa, it doesn't look like
you're gonna be any help to him.

276
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,517
There's one more thing. And it's all I have left.

277
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:13,738
My body.

278
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:17,368
I knew it! You're a demonic succubus!

279
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,932
What? Oh, no...

280
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,345
Yeah, you basically tied your own noose with that move.

281
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,745
That was awesome.

282
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,773
It's nice to see Lucoa get flustered every once in awhile.

283
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:32,651
All that effort, and she's just
gonna be treated like a succubus.

284
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:34,810
By the way.

285
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:35,691
By the what?

286
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,037
I noticed something that struck
me as unnerving about that house.

287
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,554
Oh. Really? Do tell!

288
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,913
From what I could see, it was pretty ordinary.

289
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:46,213
It's about who Shouta's father is.

290
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,326
I saw some pictures of him around the house.

291
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,313
I think he's the director of my company.

292
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,490
What? Small world, huh?

293
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,284
Hey, Shouta!

294
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,139
Stay back! Get out of here, demon!

295
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,125
Come on. I told you I'm not a demon.

296
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:03,741
Look at me.

297
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:04,594
Go away, succubus!

298
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:05,651
Bad girl!

299
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:06,632
Just look at me.

300
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,907
Don't come near me!

301
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,693
It's still pouring.

302
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,086
This must be what "rainy season" means.

303
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:21,856
Let's hang these up.

304
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:26,336
What is that? A ghost?

305
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,769
A teru teru bouzu.

306
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,811
Teru teru bouzu?

307
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,012
Will something that simple really make the rain stop?

308
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:34,528
Eventually, yeah.

309
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,619
I'm off, Kobayashi. Have a good evening.

310
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,175
Yeah, same to you.

311
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,865
Guess I should head home, too. I'm hungry, anyway.

312
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:02,518
Looks like someone didn't put in overtime today.

313
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:05,341
I gotta admit, I'm happy you came home early!

314
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:07,087
I come home when I can.

315
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,268
Takiya went home at the regular time, too.

316
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:10,760
Stultus...

317
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:15,311
Y'know, I haven't heard anything from Takiya
about Fafnir. I hope they've been getting along okay.

318
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,576
Now that you mention it, I
haven't seen Fafnir much lately.

319
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,917
I saw him today.

320
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:21,194
What? Where?

321
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,853
On the way home from school.

322
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,174
He was in the park jumping in circles over and over.

323
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,049
He was mumbling something, too.

324
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,730
That cursed dragon, what on earth could he be up to? Jeez.

325
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:35,525
Yeah, no way that's innocent.

326
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:37,055
What do kings do?!

327
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:37,765
They rule.

328
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:38,531
Citizens!

329
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:39,138
They suck.

330
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:40,144
Nyami-nyami.

331
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:40,918
Rules.

332
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,563
Kaboom.

333
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,108
Nice! You're really nailing this.

334
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,984
You've improved so much, Faf-kun!

335
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,684
That's great, but who's Faf-kun?

336
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:56,426
Not you if you don't want it to be. My apologies, Fafnir.

337
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:02,171
How do you feel knowing you're ready for
the call and respond part of tomorrow's event?

338
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,311
I can now obtain a limited-edition
item at said event, yes?

339
00:17:06,412 --> 00:17:07,121
Indeed!

340
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,323
We're having curry for dinner tonight.

341
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:11,179
Mild?

342
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,672
As requested.

343
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,059
Thank you for everything.

344
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:17,440
Let's roll.

345
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,373
I will not lose.

346
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,566
Damn it, traps!

347
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,264
What are you doing?

348
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,114
What'd you hide?

349
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,269
You idiot, you can't go that way!

350
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,689
Boom, got the weapon!

351
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:31,280
I fainted.

352
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,949
Victory is mine anew.

353
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:34,187
I know.

354
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:37,915
I'll win next time.

355
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,061
Bring it on anytime, man.

356
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:52,256
Hey, uh, Fafnir, I've got this game I'd
like you to try playing for just a little bit.

357
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,311
The one you're selling at Comiket again?

358
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,173
Yep, that's the one.

359
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,731
I'm about to the 80% mark, now.

360
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,842
Where is that?

361
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:02,035
About there, give or take. Yeah?

362
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,166
Can you not... add something here?

363
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:12,308
Gotcha.

364
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,734
You know, I thought this felt slow, too.

365
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:22,013
I've been wondering.

366
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:24,568
Do you know how many hours a day you're logged in roughly?

367
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,016
Somehwere around 21 hours.

368
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:29,232
And what level are you at the moment?

369
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:30,716
Level 280.

370
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:33,699
I've cleared all the limited
time events, so I'm free, now.

371
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,167
On the fast track to game addiction, huh?

372
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,088
Hmm.

373
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh, right, I've got a surprise for ya.

374
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,563
What is it?

375
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:01,369
I grabbed some shampoo-conditioner
on my way home from work for you.

376
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:03,927
And that will help me with my hair?

377
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,420
It should, yeah.

378
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,615
You shooting for another all-nighter?

379
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,922
Wish I could, but I gotta sleep.

380
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,685
Good night, Fafnir. Stay strong, man.

381
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:30,328
Morning, Fafnir...

382
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:31,900
I knew you could do it.

383
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,539
We're having natto for breakfast, 'kay?

384
00:19:34,932 --> 00:19:35,857
Is it mild?

385
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:37,071
Sure, why not?

386
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,360
Rain, rain, rain.

387
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,145
Rain, rain, rain!

388
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,748
I can't not love how happy
Kanna is about her new umbrella!

389
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:51,566
Mm-hmm.

390
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,361
What are you doing?

391
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,278
You really don't know, Miss Kobayashi?

392
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:00,433
This is called sharing a lover's umbrella.

393
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,277
I know that's what you think this is,

394
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:04,078
but you have your own umbrella.

395
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:06,565
Yes, but I prefer yours!

396
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:07,359
Hmm...

397
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:16,299
Hmm?

398
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:22,948
Good, it seems they're getting along okay.

399
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:25,810
I shouldn't say this after recommending him,

400
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,691
but Mister Takiya's incredible.

401
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,695
Being able to live with Fafnir is no easy feat.

402
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:36,431
Humans are either hits or misses.

403
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,496
The misses make themselves known quickly,

404
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,442
but it takes time to know if you've found a hit.

405
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:45,383
Spending that much time on every
person would be too aggravating.

406
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:51,962
As far as I'm concerned, the misses that trespass on
my home to steal my treasure are my favorite humans.

407
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:55,228
Why did you wait outside?

408
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,530
And yet...

409
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,881
I can't wait for today's event, can you?

410
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,342
Faf-ku, Oh...

411
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:01,799
I don't mind.

412
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:02,695
Huh?

413
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,333
You're a hit, Takiya.

414
00:21:04,903 --> 00:21:05,579
I am?

415
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,468
Hurry up.

416
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,107
Oh! Right behind ya!

417
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:26,984
Our teru teru bouzu ghosts aren't working at all.

418
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,859
Nope. Rain, rain, go away.

419
00:21:30,357 --> 00:21:32,639
I love rain. I love it so much.

420
00:21:40,653 --> 00:21:41,618
Yeah, you're right.

421
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:44,472
Rain's not all that bad.

422
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:30,236
Lucoa, you're forbidden from approaching
me naked from now on! That's an order!

423
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:32,888
But my clothes are my scales, so I'm always naked.

424
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:34,378
I'm naked right this minute!

425
00:23:34,403 --> 00:23:36,492
What? No! Bad demon!
