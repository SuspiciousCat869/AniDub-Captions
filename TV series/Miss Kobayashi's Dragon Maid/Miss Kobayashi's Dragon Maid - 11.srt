1
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:16,979
This place is completely packed today.

2
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:20,071
Leaving the house between Christmas
and New Year's is a nightmare.

3
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:22,343
What's that?

4
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:23,963
It's a lottery.

5
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,813
I wanna do lottery.

6
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,217
We'd need to have tickets.

7
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:29,908
You mean like these?

8
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,908
How'd you get those? With magic?

9
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:32,657
Magic?

10
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:37,092
No, I got them during my daily trips here to
the shopping district. They just gave them to me.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,492
Assimilated much?

12
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,920
Okay, with these, you'll get three turns.

13
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,020
Ooh, the grand prize is a hot springs vacation!

14
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:47,158
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,856
Hot springs would be nice.

16
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:51,055
I'm getting that prize!

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,928
As long as you don't use magic.

18
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:54,487
Duh! I know!

19
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,075
Here's your consolation prize: Pocket tissues.

20
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:05,133
Pocket tissues.

21
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:07,790
Last chance, but this time I'm gonna win or else!

22
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,450
Congratulations!

23
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,175
I won!

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,342
Third prize!

25
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,277
You'll be set for the winter, now!

26
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:19,992
Enjoy your new warm kotatsu.

27
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:23,658
Ko-what?

28
00:02:58,255 --> 00:02:59,987
Traveling anywhere, Yamashita?

29
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,322
Yeah, going to Hokkaido to see family.

30
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:05,682
If you want I'll pick up some nama
chocolates for you as a souvenir.

31
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:08,874
Nama chocolates.

32
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:09,927
So, what about you?

33
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:11,530
You gonna go visit family?

34
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:12,457
Nope.

35
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:13,762
You got plans?

36
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,683
Well, winter Comiket, obviously. Did you forget?

37
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,283
The train's leaving now.

38
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,468
Oh, you're right!

39
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:26,908
Happy New Year!

40
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
Happy New Year!

41
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,713
I can't believe how much has happened this year.

42
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,593
I'm here.

43
00:03:37,903 --> 00:03:39,747
Hey, welcome home.

44
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:41,332
Glad you're back.

45
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:44,688
Done with work this year, finally.

46
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,075
Congrats, Miss Kobayashi.

47
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:48,330
Quick question.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,800
That means you don't have to go to the office anymore?

49
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,349
Yep.

50
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,837
I'm off through the third.

51
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:59,217
You're always so busy. I hope you'll try to
take it easy over the rest of the holidays.

52
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,737
That is my plan.

53
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:03,725
This is heaven.

54
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,367
I'm glad you won the kotatsu for us.

55
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,621
Yeah, me, too.

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,486
I need to move soon so I can start
preparing the New Year's dishes.

57
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:15,919
I even borrowed the tools I need to pound mochi and soba!

58
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,907
You realize you don't have to
go all-out like that, don't you?

59
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,438
It's a maid's responsibility to make sure
any and all seasonal events are carried out!

60
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:29,626
Uh-oh. Do you need to use the restroom?

61
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:31,100
Don't wanna get up.

62
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:33,037
Tohru, will you go?

63
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:34,561
You can do it for me.

64
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:37,383
Okay, fine.

65
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,550
I'll go take care of it.

66
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:42,068
Hey, uh, since you're up, you mind
hitting the switch on the rice cooker?

67
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,080
Hey, grab me the remote, too.

68
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:54,836
What are you doing?

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,783
This is New Year's curry.

70
00:04:58,913 --> 00:04:59,567
Is it...

71
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,288
Don't worry, it's mild.

72
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,908
The New Year's parlor trick
tournament will be on January third.

73
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:24,159
You can look forward to several
outstanding guests performing in our comp...

74
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,300
Ready for our huge New Year's sale?

75
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:31,603
Doors open at 6:30 AM on the first!

76
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,717
According to what I've heard.

77
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,333
I can just pound the soba tomorrow before we eat it.

78
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,213
Tohru, this isn't too much for you?

79
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:52,984
No way. I'm simply fulfilling my specific maid duties.

80
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:57,550
I do feel like we're forgetting
something important, though.

81
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,216
Oh, someone's at the door.

82
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,984
Wonder who it could be.

83
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,276
Looks like we'll never find out.

84
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,911
Tohru! Hello, anyone home?

85
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,783
You better get up. They're calling for you.

86
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,698
Of all the freezing stupid luck. Coming.

87
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:22,691
Yes, hello?

88
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,550
Oh, Miss Sasakibe.

89
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:25,617
Afternoon!

90
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,947
Hungry? I've got extra candied sweet potatoes
with chestnuts! They're yours if you want 'em.

91
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,158
Ooh, I didn't make any of those, they look tasty.

92
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:34,787
Thank you very much!

93
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:37,807
Ah! Can you stay there just a moment, please.

94
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,772
Here, have some mochi we pounded.

95
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,648
It'll stay good for at least a month if you freeze it.

96
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:45,138
Thanks! I adore mochi!

97
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,757
Good work, neighbor.

98
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,199
I know, right?

99
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,873
Yes, hello?

100
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:58,875
Good afternoon, Mister Yana.

101
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,888
I brought back way too many mandarin oranges from home.

102
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,812
You want these? They're sweet.

103
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,177
This is a lot!

104
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:07,092
Thank you for thinking of us.

105
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:10,527
If you don't mind holding on just a
second, I'll grab you some of our mochi!

106
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:11,994
Good work, again.

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,536
I guess so.

108
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:15,727
What's wrong?

109
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,147
It's just, as soon as I get back under there,

110
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,965
I know someone will come.

111
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,387
Maybe not.

112
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:28,755
Mister Sone.

113
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,241
Is that a rooster?

114
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,658
That's right.

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,061
New year, new animal.

116
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,639
Wow, thanks so much.

117
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,217
He's really well made!

118
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:38,325
And I've got the perfect place to put him!

119
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:39,033
Here.

120
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,783
We pounded some extra mochi.

121
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:41,680
Have some!

122
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,796
You're the best neighbor ever.

123
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,828
This time, it was Mister Sone with a rooster for us!

124
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,216
Rooster!

125
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,325
From the zodiac?

126
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,763
What do those words mean?

127
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,367
There are twelve animals in the Chinese zodiac.

128
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:02,557
Rat, Ox, Tiger... Let's see, what else?

129
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:04,950
Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse,

130
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,466
Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.

131
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:09,989
Was that a spell?

132
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,461
I'm surprised you know.

133
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,111
It's because I stumbled across horoscopes online
while I was searching for all things New Year.

134
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,223
I refuse to accept it, though.

135
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,252
Why's that?

136
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:23,882
Because their big origin story is that the order
of all the animals was decided by which ones

137
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,406
reached God the fastest on the morning of the New Year.

138
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,811
Oh, right. I totally forgot about that.

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,128
The Rat stole first place by sneaking a ride on the Ox.

140
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,409
So, what's the part about it you "refuse to accept"?

141
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,931
Pause the story right there!

142
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:44,724
No way a dragon was slower than an ox and
a tiger, let alone a freakin' bunny rabbit!

143
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,158
That is utterly ridiculous.

144
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,043
Right. Well, it's only a story.

145
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,306
Whoa. This mandarin orange thing is sweet!

146
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:57,905
Tohru.

147
00:08:57,984 --> 00:08:58,465
Yes?

148
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:03,600
I just wanna say, y'know, for getting
along with the neighbors and the other stuff.

149
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,113
Thank you.

150
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:09,531
You're welcome, and thank you, too!

151
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,141
Yummy, it tastes like you.

152
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,666
No, it doesn't.

153
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:15,945
Oh, wait a second!

154
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,149
I knew there was something I was forgetting.

155
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:20,574
Here.

156
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,075
New Year's cards?

157
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:26,601
Yes. I bought them for you.

158
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,524
I haven't written one of these in years.

159
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,495
Are you confident about your first performance?

160
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,925
No. I wrote the lyrics down...

161
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,783
The noodle shop owner in the shopping
district taught me how to do that neat-o trick!

162
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,687
Wow.

163
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,315
Kobayashi.

164
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,900
Please put my kimono on.

165
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,047
Kimono?

166
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,911
She promised to join Miss
Saikawa on her first shrine visit.

167
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,981
She lent me a kimono so we could wear them together.

168
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,137
That should be fun.

169
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,328
It's not too tight?

170
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:16,300
No.

171
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,169
All right, you have been kimono-ed.

172
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,839
Incredible, Miss Kobayashi, it was like magic!

173
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:26,658
I was a kid when my mom taught me how to do that trick.

174
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,077
Your mom, really?

175
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:29,340
It's adorable!

176
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,743
Would you like to wear one, too, Tohru?

177
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:32,848
Uh?

178
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:42,819
Glad you like it.

179
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:44,797
What a relief mine fit you!

180
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:47,734
It's a good thing kimonos give
room to adjust for chest size.

181
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:48,825
Whatever.

182
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:53,287
These past few days, we've been losing big
time against the temptation of the kotatsu,

183
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,454
but going outside for a change is nice, huh?

184
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:56,493
Sure is.

185
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,594
Fresh air can be nice.

186
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,967
It's a little cold.

187
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,481
Hi, Kanna!

188
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,923
Saikawa.

189
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:04,741
You look so cute!

190
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,020
Your face is warm.

191
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,492
Hey!

192
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:11,700
You came, too?

193
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,325
Duh! But why is she here?

194
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,586
Should I not be?

195
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:16,834
I ran into Elma not far away.

196
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,775
I only came because I've heard there's
a lot of unusual foods for me to try.

197
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:23,774
Lucoa, so, what's with your kimono?

198
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,807
Well, it is New Year's.

199
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:28,615
I decided to go traditional. Why not, right?

200
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,928
If that's traditional, what's your idea of risqué?

201
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:35,758
Hey! What's up, guys?

202
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,207
Ooh!

203
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,867
Do you realize how good that looks on you, Fafnir?

204
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,212
Yes, he does.

205
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,285
Can we go now?

206
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,918
They'll run out of amazake.

207
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:46,868
Welp. Shall we?

208
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,193
We shall!

209
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:09,383
So sweet.

210
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:10,968
It's a nostalgic flavor.

211
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:12,392
What? Really?

212
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:15,658
Mmhm. I used to drink something like this all the time.

213
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,450
It takes me back, you know?

214
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,753
Oh, when you got drunk, and you and your sister...

215
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,218
It's a pretty charm, huh?

216
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,706
Whaddaya think, Kanna?

217
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:30,343
Wanna buy matching ones?

218
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,156
Matching?

219
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:31,937
Yes.

220
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,476
It's a relationship charm.

221
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,977
Look at the pretty charms!

222
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,593
You want one?

223
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:44,399
An academics charm.

224
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,149
I could make you one if you wanted something that worked.

225
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,161
What do you think, Shouta? Do you need any charms?

226
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:55,726
I'm from a family of mages. I
can achieve my desires myself!

227
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,425
You're my charm, Shouta, baby!

228
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,492
Let me go! Stop!

229
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,063
An evil-banishing arrow?

230
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,734
Purchased because it might be
useful for researching new, fun curses.

231
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,227
How'd Comiket go?

232
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,649
Aw, thanks for asking. We sold out again.

233
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,578
You're as popular as ever, huh?

234
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,921
Fafnir's Curse Anthology Two didn't even sell one, though.

235
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,383
He made a second volume after nobody bought the first?

236
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,490
Kobayashi!

237
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,915
They give fortunes over there?

238
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:27,352
That's a great blessing, Georgie!

239
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,478
Alas, it is too great a blessing for a maid.

240
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:32,675
You should have it instead, little miss.

241
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,781
No, Sis. I mean, um.

242
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,684
No, Georgie, it's your luck!

243
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,847
Miss Kobayashi, look!

244
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,351
It's my fortune.

245
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,632
Nice. What is it?

246
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:43,842
The great curse.

247
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,117
I've never seen this one.

248
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,991
Got any clue what it means?

249
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,867
Your wishes will prove difficult.

250
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,011
The one you wait for will come.

251
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,506
That which you've lost won't be found.

252
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,242
I don't exactly get it.

253
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,191
Sounds like a great curse, though.

254
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:02,508
But uh, silver lining, seems
like things can only get better!

255
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,402
Yay!

256
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,245
I think it's almost time!

257
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:06,842
It's time, for serious?

258
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,128
Seriously time.

259
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,527
I wonder what's going on?

260
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:13,320
Oh, the year is almost over.

261
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:15,912
The time sure flew by.

262
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,382
Guess that means we had fun.

263
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:21,293
13, 12,

264
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,700
11, 10, 9,

265
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:25,658
8...

266
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:26,575
...7...

267
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:27,700
...6...

268
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,658
...5, 4, 3, 2...

269
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:32,982
...1!

270
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,742
Happy New Year!

271
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,393
So, Tohru.

272
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:42,968
Happy New Year.

273
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,476
And a Happy New Year to you, as well!

274
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,867
Little miss, are you feeling all right?

275
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,409
I'm just kinda cold.

276
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:57,453
Kobayashi, may I invite Saikawa over?

277
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,303
It'll be warm under the kotatsu.

278
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,875
Hey, why don't we take this
opportunity to invite everybody over?

279
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:06,053
We have plenty of food to snack on!

280
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:10,092
Sounds good, but we need to ask
people's parents if it's okay, first.

281
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,075
All right!

282
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,632
Let's talk and walk!

283
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,517
The Ozoni soup's ready if you are!

284
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,147
What is this?

285
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:26,033
Don't tell me you made it.

286
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,493
Shut up, you don't have to eat it if you don't want to!

287
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:31,092
Tohru and Kanna made the mochi from scratch.

288
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,379
You went all out.

289
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:35,092
I'll go ahead because it's a new year, and I'm nice.

290
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,348
Thanks, Tohru!

291
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,344
Yum!

292
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:44,075
I learned how to make the right
seasoning from Miss Kobayashi's family.

293
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,631
It is not mild, though.

294
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:48,760
Don't worry. I'll make some sweet red bean soup later.

295
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:51,501
Tohru.

296
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:53,750
What meat is this?

297
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,002
It's a special treat, just for you!

298
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:59,072
How many times do I have to
tell you I don't want your tail?

299
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,323
You'll never know unless you try.

300
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,592
Could you, would you for the new year?

301
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,984
I could not, would not, now let it go.

302
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,966
Just get in here already.

303
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:12,246
'Kay!

304
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,104
Kotatsus are the best.

305
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,352
Yeah, this is pretty great.

306
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:17,877
Maybe we should get one?

307
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,810
Hmph. Do what you want.

308
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,508
I got to see the first sunrise of the year with
Kanna, so this year is bound to be a magical one!

309
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,508
What's so special about sunrise?

310
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,617
This sunrise is the first light of the year.

311
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,438
It's officially here.

312
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,065
Yeah.

313
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,992
As is true every year on January second...

314
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,234
Put on anime.

315
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,809
There're only reruns until the holiday's over.

316
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,928
I totally get how you feel.

317
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,499
You wanna pick that up, Tohru?

318
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,686
Negative. I can't step away right now.

319
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,696
What do you mean?

320
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:34,005
It's closer to you anyway, so can't you do it?

321
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:46,018
Ugh. Okay, fine, whatever, gah.

322
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:56,122
As is true every year on January third, it's day two of...

323
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:59,496
What is happening? Are those people
running the same race as yesterday?

324
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:02,324
Yesterday, they ran to Nagaura,
today they're running back.

325
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:03,658
It's boring.

326
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,422
You wanna play a game, instead?

327
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,050
I have to do my homework.

328
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,674
You have homework?

329
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:12,216
First script of the year?

330
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:14,859
What do you plan on writing?

331
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,395
Anything'll do.

332
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,593
Ko...

333
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:20,250
...ta...

334
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:22,442
...tsu.

335
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,528
Kotatsu!

336
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,675
Wow, that looks super pretty.

337
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,766
You could do it.

338
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,127
You really think so?

339
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,137
Okay!

340
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,935
What kind of thing should I write down?

341
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:43,854
I think a thing you like.

342
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,038
Yes, hello?

343
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,522
Lady Tohru?

344
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,756
Oh, on it!

345
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:53,408
Hey, Mom.

346
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,044
Happy New Year, hon.

347
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,037
Yeah, Happy New Year.

348
00:18:57,707 --> 00:18:59,625
I got the greeting card you sent.

349
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:02,719
Oh, I was hoping it would get there by the first.

350
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,133
You've never sent us a card before.

351
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:06,066
I know.

352
00:19:06,492 --> 00:19:07,517
Everyone doin' all right?

353
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,368
Yes, we're all well.

354
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:12,398
Oh, no! It went out of bounds!

355
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,745
Don't be sad. It looks good.

356
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:16,096
Sounds lively.

357
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:17,734
I have some friends over.

358
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,139
So you're having fun, then?

359
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,819
I am.

360
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,670
I'll call you sometime soon.

361
00:19:25,825 --> 00:19:26,911
Give everyone my love.

362
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,950
I will. Good to hear you.

363
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,283
Thanks. You, too.

364
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:36,682
Look at you go!

365
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:37,509
Yep!

366
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,325
So, um.

367
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,575
Who was on the phone?

368
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:41,674
That was my mom.

369
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:44,929
She said, "everybody's doing all right."

370
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:48,764
That's good.

371
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,870
My vacation is almost over.

372
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:09,242
Miss Kobayashi, you weren't going to
see your family, not even for New Year's?

373
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,480
Well, normally every year, I spend the
holidays sleeping off all my built up fatigue.

374
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:19,044
It's not like I'm on bad terms or
anything like that with my family.

375
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,058
I mean, we occasionally talk on the phone.

376
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,738
That's how it is?

377
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,027
You know, how human families work.

378
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:27,509
I think it's probably different for everyone.

379
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,664
In my case, I moved away from home and just got used

380
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,864
to having a life without any family
nearby to visit or hang out with.

381
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:36,700
Yeah, that kinda makes sense.

382
00:20:36,783 --> 00:20:37,699
What about you?

383
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,255
You could go back if you wanted to, couldn't you?

384
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:41,886
You don't wanna go visit?

385
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:52,441
No, I don't want to go, because living
here with you is my life now, Miss Kobayashi.

386
00:20:59,273 --> 00:21:01,206
See, we score if we get enough chances!

387
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:02,098
Yeah, we do!

388
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:05,564
Score.

389
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,307
New Year's money?

390
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,203
I completely spaced about it.

391
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:15,028
New Year's money?

392
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:17,227
It's my first time receiving any.

393
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:18,757
It's mine, too.

394
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,971
Well, it's my first time giving any.

395
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,125
Okay, I'm off.

396
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,188
Have a good day!

397
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:35,700
Come on, first sweet dream of the year!

398
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,464
Fuji Lucoa!

399
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,471
Hawk Lucoa!

400
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:44,806
Eggplant Lucoa!

401
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:49,298
Bad demon!

402
00:23:25,914 --> 00:23:29,060
Lady Elma, Kobayashi gave me some New Year's money!

403
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,389
Oh, good for you, Kanna.

404
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:33,550
Kobayashi gave me some New Year's money!

405
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:36,127
New Year's money.

406
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,444
Oh, all right! I'll give you some, too.
