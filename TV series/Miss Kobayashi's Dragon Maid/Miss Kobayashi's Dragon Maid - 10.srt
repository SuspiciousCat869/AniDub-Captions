1
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:09,151
Christmas, huh?

2
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:13,459
I do hate the idea of celebrating
the birth of You-Know-Who's son,

3
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,313
but I gotta say, it sounds like a good time.

4
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,111
Tohru, hey!

5
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:19,215
Hey back!

6
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,738
Oh, no!

7
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:22,191
What happened to you?

8
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:26,578
Unfortunately, I was practicing for the local
retirement home's annual Christmas Eve show,

9
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:28,342
but I ended up injuring myself.

10
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:31,929
You must feel so weak and flimsy.

11
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:32,738
Oh, hey!

12
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:36,135
Tohru, do you think you might be
willing to put on the show in my stead?

13
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:41,267
The residents in the home were looking forward
to the event, so I feel like I'm letting them down.

14
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:42,866
Put on a show?

15
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,096
Are you serious?

16
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:46,346
Yes, of course.

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,352
No one could represent our
shopping district better than you!

18
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:53,250
Okay, we'll do it!

19
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:54,966
And don't worry, it'll be super!

20
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,468
And so I'm totally gonna do it!

21
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:31,119
Are you sure?

22
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,579
Sure, I'm sure!

23
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,579
I'd like to help out, too, but I can't.

24
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,261
I have stupid work.

25
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:38,971
That's all right, Miss Kobayashi.

26
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:41,815
You just stay focused on your job,
and I'll take care of everything.

27
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,304
Whatever. If you say so.

28
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:46,721
It'll be easy.

29
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:49,910
All I gotta do is ask my reliable
and free friends to help me out!

30
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,670
Ready, everyone?

31
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,426
Let's put on a show!

32
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah!

33
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:56,419
Um. Yeah.

34
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:57,387
Wait a second!

35
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,621
Jeez, what is it?

36
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:03,022
Have I been lied to? Because I was told I could
eat as much candy as I wanted if I came here.

37
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:06,846
I even made room in my schedule even though
it's one of the busiest times of the year!

38
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,617
Miss Kobayashi told me the truth about you, Elma.

39
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,646
You're completely useless at work.

40
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:16,057
So much so that they've even announced they
didn't need you to be in their way right now.

41
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:18,510
Ah... It doesn't make any sense!

42
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:20,484
Now I can actually type with my fingers!

43
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:24,286
What else can I do when I can't
afford to interfere with this world?

44
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,175
Believe me, you're already interfering plenty.

45
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:29,048
Question.

46
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:31,203
Why isn't Kanna's mom doing this?

47
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:34,579
Unlike Elma, Miss Kobayashi is busy with her work, so,

48
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:37,100
it's up to us to take care of this on our own!

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,635
What do ya say?

50
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:39,673
Boring.

51
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,722
I heard something important was happening.

52
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,362
Turns out it was just something pathetic instead.

53
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,719
Oh, come on, Fafnir!

54
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:49,949
Let's keep an eye on how it goes.

55
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:52,193
Well, then.

56
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,121
What exactly do you want us to do for this show?

57
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:59,311
I think, to start off with, it should probably be
something the elderly would enjoy watching.

58
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,079
That works for me. Any other ideas?

59
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:02,847
I know!

60
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,190
An eating contest!

61
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:06,712
No. You just wanna stuff your face.

62
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:07,769
How 'bout a race?

63
00:04:07,825 --> 00:04:09,387
That might kill them.

64
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:13,183
We should play a VR FPS, FFA, AKA frag fest.

65
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,437
I'm sorry, could you use words?

66
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:19,461
But all of these ideas require
the audience to participate.

67
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:22,448
You can't judge us when you
haven't actually proposed anything!

68
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,976
Do the two of you have any suggestions?

69
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,658
I'm okay with whatever.

70
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,986
Okay, so, what if we put on a play?

71
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:30,340
Wait, a play?

72
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,454
Is that where humans pretend to be different humans

73
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,358
on a globe stage that's not a globe?

74
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:35,804
Globe stage that's what?

75
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,114
A play, huh?

76
00:04:37,704 --> 00:04:38,793
That's perfect!

77
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,444
Let's put on a play!

78
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,040
Fine.

79
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,530
We will put on a play, but what
do you think we should put on?

80
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,874
Since it's Christmas time, why not The Little Match Girl?

81
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:49,197
Ooh, that sounds funny. Is it funny?

82
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:50,741
Um, no.

83
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:56,075
It's about this poor little girl selling
matchsticks on a very cold winter's night.

84
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,958
Sadly, no one will buy any matches from her.

85
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,704
So, in order to warm her chilled body,

86
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:03,871
she lights one of the matches.

87
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:08,869
Then, in the flame, she sees a
warm stove and lots of delicious food.

88
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:11,512
She lights match after match,

89
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,158
and eventually, her beloved and yet
very much dead grandmother appears to her.

90
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:21,824
The little girl continues lighting her matches
to keep her grandmother from disappearing,

91
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:25,675
until finally, the grandmother
gently hugs the little girl.

92
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,261
Then the little girl ascends to Heaven,

93
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,760
embraced in her grandmother's warmth and love.

94
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:36,018
It's kind of a sad story, and gosh, it gets me every time.

95
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:37,672
Yeah, it's pretty famous.

96
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,041
Oh.

97
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:41,736
So, what happens after the girl ascends to Heaven?

98
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,162
Does she sell her matchsticks?

99
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:44,135
Idiot.

100
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:46,523
The girl ascends to Heaven because she's dead.

101
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:47,410
Wow.

102
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,125
That woman strangled her own granddaughter.

103
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,973
Die!

104
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,387
No, that's not it either.

105
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:55,126
You know a lot, Saikawa. It's so cool.

106
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:56,829
Yeah, I guess.

107
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,046
It's no big deal.

108
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,980
I'm good with putting on The
Little Match Girl if you guys are!

109
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,512
Yeah!

110
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,578
Sure hope we don't blow it.

111
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:08,097
Fafnir will obviously be directing.

112
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,124
Keep in mind, Fafnir will not
stand for any sophomoric performances.

113
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,432
Fafnir is the absolute authority.

114
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,100
Challenge him and you will suffer.

115
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,308
Also, keep in mind Fafnir's only
the director because he can't act.

116
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:23,115
Now, come on nepotism!

117
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:26,657
Before anything, Fafnir needs
to cast the lead of this play.

118
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:30,162
He wants each of you to audition
for the role of Little Match Girl.

119
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,064
Yay! I can go first!

120
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,101
Tohru, auditioning for Little Match Girl.

121
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:34,949
Just get started.

122
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,127
Do not disappoint Fafnir.

123
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:38,637
Matchstick.

124
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:40,776
Oh, please, won't anyone buy a match?

125
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,204
Boring. Next.

126
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,412
What? Already?

127
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:45,010
I'll give you one more shot.

128
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:48,929
This time, see those heartless humans
ignoring you like the trash you are.

129
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:50,466
Feel it.

130
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:52,690
Then, allow the lines to flow naturally.

131
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:55,259
Feel it, huh?

132
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:58,262
Why, you foolish, inferior humans!

133
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,787
How dare you ignore me to suffer like this?

134
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:01,574
I'll make you pay for...

135
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,678
Fail. Next.

136
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:03,597
...with your dead!

137
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,377
Hello, my name is Elma, and I'm unrepresented.

138
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:07,678
Matches?

139
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,222
Do you need any matches?

140
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:10,309
I don't.

141
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,341
Please, sir! Please at least hear me out!

142
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,513
I can't go back to the office until I've sold them all.

143
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,678
What are you doing?

144
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,787
The salesmen that come to our company
always put on a performance like that.

145
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,761
Sucks for them.

146
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,569
Next.

147
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,505
Good afternoon!

148
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:26,970
I'm Riko Saikawa.

149
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,349
Thank you for your time.

150
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,592
I... Uh...

151
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,762
Oh, god, why?

152
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,240
I'm so sorry!

153
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,863
To be honest, none of you are any good.

154
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:42,934
To be extra honest, your directing
style is way too sadistic for us.

155
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,835
Ooh, me!

156
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,346
Yeah, you what?

157
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:46,471
Let me direct.

158
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,274
I can be nice and firm!

159
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,305
And I'll make Shouta the lead.

160
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,012
What are you even talking about?

161
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,063
Shouta's a boy, not a little girl.

162
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:57,118
Well, you just leave that to me.

163
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,818
Shouta, baby, come here.

164
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:08,412
He looks just like a girl!

165
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:09,836
So cute.

166
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,454
Yeah, I'll buy it.

167
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:12,262
I dunno.

168
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,754
He's not as cute as Kanna.

169
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:14,819
Wha...

170
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:15,731
"Wha"?

171
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:19,048
What are you all planning to achieve by embarrassing meee?

172
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:21,176
Well, that was to be expected.

173
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,509
C'mon, cheer up, sweetie.

174
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:25,844
What should we do, now?

175
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,471
I can be the director.

176
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,037
I'll at least be better than those two.

177
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:30,883
That's true.

178
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:33,710
Any thoughts on who we should make our lead?

179
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:41,607
Matches.

180
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,206
Matches.

181
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,162
Please buy some matches.

182
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,132
Perfect!

183
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,231
Hey, guys, I'm home.

184
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,084
Matches.

185
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:01,284
Do you wanna buy any matches, please?

186
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,038
Mind filling me in?

187
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:09,340
We decided to perform The Little Match
Girl for our show at the retirement home.

188
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,053
Kanna has been cast as the title character.

189
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:13,709
Oh, I see.

190
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,471
Congratulations, Kanna!

191
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,472
Mm-hm. I'm excited.

192
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:21,340
I promise to come see you.

193
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,032
You sure you'll be okay?

194
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,547
Of course we will!

195
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,063
There's no way a play can take down a dragon.

196
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,253
Right.

197
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,496
Do you want to buy any matches, please?

198
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,577
She's at her most dangerous when she gets like this.

199
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:36,476
If you say so.

200
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:36,840
Match?

201
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:37,857
I'm gonna go take a bath.

202
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:38,643
'Kay!

203
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:41,402
Coming, phone.

204
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:44,162
Hello, Kobayashi residence.

205
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:45,366
It's me.

206
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:47,732
I thought about the script some on my own.

207
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,961
You're still not gonna be the
director, so if it's that, let it go.

208
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,152
Otherwise, what did you come up with?

209
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:56,803
If we stick to the original play,
it won't match the current era.

210
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,033
So, I decided to make the
little match girl into a magical...

211
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:03,810
All right then, time to prepare Miss Kobayashi's dinner.

212
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:06,921
Do you want to buy any matches, please?

213
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:20,213
Lady Tohru, is there a chimney in this house at all?

214
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:21,923
Is there a chimney?

215
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,246
No, why do you ask?

216
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:28,519
Because Saikawa told me that Santa visits
your house by coming down the chimney.

217
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:31,362
Oh, yeah, you mean that old man who's covered in blood?

218
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,662
Do you think Santa will still try to visit us?

219
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:38,423
Yes!

220
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:47,569
What the crap?

221
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,364
What are you doing?!

222
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,904
No, no!

223
00:10:58,977 --> 00:11:00,677
How many times do I have to tell you?

224
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,664
No, where do you think you're going?

225
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,096
Tohru! Why would a rando use Kobayashi
as reason to refuse to buy matches?

226
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,063
Yeah, well, why would I be in a hurry
if I wasn't doing something for her?

227
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,179
Not my problem!

228
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:15,073
Lucoa! The grandmother would not try to
warm the girl up while practically nude.

229
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:15,887
Why not?

230
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,598
It's much warmer this way.

231
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,654
Fafnir, you're completely out of line.

232
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,095
A human father would never
call his daughter a "mere human."

233
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,326
Focus!

234
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,976
Why is accepting this script such an ordeal?

235
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,845
Well, I don't think it translates
that well, culturally speaking.

236
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,371
Not to mention it's slow and
repetitive and might bore the audience.

237
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,335
True, and we don't want that to happen.

238
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,318
Then why don't we try changing things up just a bit?

239
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,013
What are you suggesting we do?

240
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,471
Nothing too extreme.

241
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,162
I mean, I think at the very
least, we should make it more fun.

242
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,632
That sounds good to me!

243
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:51,441
Why don't we mix other myths in
with it, like the Kasa Jizou story!

244
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:54,056
Like we have the old man selling hats next to the girl.

245
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,150
Or we could follow the script.

246
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,025
I like it.

247
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:58,996
The main character should be a magical girl.

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,704
She can obtain power to burn this corrupt world,

249
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,104
burn it to ash.

250
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,842
Now there's nothing from the original left.

251
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:09,932
You know, I've heard 47 Ronin is popular with the elderly.

252
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:13,079
Oh, yes, the one about humans and their quest for revenge.

253
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:14,304
I can appreciate that.

254
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:15,719
Are there any dragons?

255
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,875
We might as well have some while we're at it, right?

256
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:20,429
Hey, Grandma!

257
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:22,146
Stop making it sexy!

258
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,619
Narrator, stop grinning like an idiot!

259
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,400
Kanna.

260
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:36,704
From what I've heard, this Santa guy
won't be coming by for a little while longer.

261
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,462
Does Santa know where we are?

262
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:39,871
Will he really come?

263
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,684
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

264
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,061
I'm exhausted.

265
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:48,088
What the crap?

266
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,379
Merry Christmas!

267
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,881
Still have some cake left!

268
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,604
Are we too late?

269
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:01,904
No, we're good.

270
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,440
It's just about to start.

271
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,212
All right, now the performance of The Little Match Girl

272
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:09,475
brought to you by the wonderful
Oborozuka Shopping District.

273
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:11,287
Please enjoy the show.

274
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:15,928
The City.

275
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:18,004
It was terribly cold that night.

276
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,352
A light shone upon the street corner.

277
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:23,615
Standing in that light was a girl selling matches.

278
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:26,132
Matches.

279
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,413
Do you want to buy any matches?

280
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:31,723
Unfortunately, no one wanted to buy her matches.

281
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:33,485
I can't sell any.

282
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:34,579
Umm.

283
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,162
Excuse me, young girl.

284
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:38,809
Would you like to buy some hats?

285
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,280
Before her appeared an old man selling very strong hats.

286
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:47,612
I'm an old man, and my old wife
made these hats for me to sell.

287
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,519
Oh, they're very strong.

288
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,171
I do not have any money.

289
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,087
Are you all right?

290
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:53,973
I'm cold.

291
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:55,957
That must be difficult.

292
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:58,663
Here, you can burn one of these to get warm!

293
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,592
Burn the hat?

294
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,338
Odd choice since his wife made it!

295
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,076
They're actually setting it on fire!

296
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,572
Then something unexpected happened.

297
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:12,004
A strange smoke appeared, and with it, a suspicious man.

298
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:14,704
Look, pathetic humans.

299
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,996
Who are you, sir?

300
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,100
What do you want?

301
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:19,186
You have been chosen.

302
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:22,329
You will be a magical girl with a duty to bear.

303
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,171
I did not see that one coming.

304
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:28,718
I grant unto you the power to
correct and punish this corrupt world!

305
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:29,887
Okay!

306
00:14:29,946 --> 00:14:31,015
That was quick!

307
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,306
Very good.

308
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:33,172
Let us go.

309
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,408
Wait! Me, too!

310
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:35,579
I want to be...

311
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:37,241
...a magical girl!

312
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,409
Why do you wish to be a magical girl?

313
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:42,746
So I can use my power to commit many nefarious deeds.

314
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,459
I need the money, you see.

315
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,361
My wife is very poor and dying from a terrible sickness!

316
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:49,913
Why wouldn't he just heal her with his magical power?

317
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:53,784
You would dare voice your desires
like that without any shame, old man?

318
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:54,897
Acceptable.

319
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,060
You shall be a magical girl, too.

320
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,758
Oh. This is embarrassing.

321
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:07,999
But, unfortunately,

322
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:11,859
I only have one staff that
will allow you to use your powers.

323
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,107
You will fight, and the survivor shall have the staff.

324
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:15,813
Now!

325
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,938
No, you must not fight!

326
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,027
I am a magic fairy.

327
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:24,676
Do not let yourselves be fooled
by that suspicious man's offer.

328
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,960
I shall not allow you to toy with the hearts of others.

329
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,420
Leave this to me and go, little girl and old man girl!

330
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,067
No, magic fairy, we cannot just leave you here.

331
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,128
That's right!

332
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,471
You are so kind.

333
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:41,746
Our time together was very enjoyable.

334
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,621
I shall never forget you two!

335
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:45,019
It was seconds.

336
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:50,869
No way.

337
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,049
Do you know what we should do now?

338
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:56,721
A magical girl's role is to cleanse
corruption from this world, right?

339
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:57,560
I'm on it!

340
00:16:01,673 --> 00:16:04,435
Where are all the bad and rotten people?

341
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,888
Incredibly, the spell cast by the young girl

342
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:12,968
struck a devastating blow to a nearby mansion.

343
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,925
Let's go look over there.

344
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:21,314
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

345
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:26,051
Are you the two responsible
for setting this place on fire?

346
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,463
No, what? Who would do such a mean thing?

347
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,576
So guilty.

348
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:32,385
I'm very sorry. I meant nothing ill by it.

349
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,787
It's cool. Don't worry.

350
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,792
I am Kuranosuke Oishi.

351
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:38,840
Thanks to this fire, I can
easily sneak into the Kira mansion,

352
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,736
so you have my utmost gratitude.

353
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,530
What are you doing here?

354
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:47,412
I've come to finally avenge my lord and claim
the head of Kira Kouzuke No Suke Yoshinaka!

355
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:49,372
Now it's the 47 Ronin?

356
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:56,668
Avenging your lord? Hilarious!

357
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,541
Prepare yourself, Kira!

358
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,987
If you'd forfeit your life, come!

359
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:03,425
She did not just do that!

360
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,329
That's the source of the corruption.

361
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,911
And the enemy of all magical girls!

362
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,222
No!

363
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:14,075
No one can beat me in this: My final and ultimate form.

364
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:17,365
I'll turn you into dust!

365
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,919
They have to stop before they lose control!

366
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:24,037
That's amazing.

367
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:26,221
This must be that CGI!

368
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:27,735
Ya darn right I'm spry!

369
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,676
No, CGI.

370
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,391
All right.

371
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,371
Then, I'll have to get serious, too!

372
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,542
I dare you!

373
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:08,254
What an incredible show!

374
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,265
Kobayashi!

375
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,096
So, what did you think?

376
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,669
We were amazing, right?

377
00:18:27,496 --> 00:18:28,496
Yes, you were.

378
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:30,774
I'm proud that you did it all on your own, too.

379
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,125
Good job, Tohru.

380
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:33,139
Thank you!

381
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:37,162
Does anybody wanna join me for an after party?

382
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:38,385
Let's do it!

383
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:41,058
We can take this appreciation cake they gave us!

384
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:41,805
Elma.

385
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,580
You just wanna stuff your face again.

386
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,618
What? That is not at all true.

387
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:52,602
Cheers!

388
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,337
Ouchie.

389
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:14,746
Where is everyone?

390
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,887
They just left to head to their homes.

391
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:20,547
Apparently, they're each having
their own, individual parties, too.

392
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,371
What about Kanna?

393
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:24,208
She escorted Miss Saikawa home.

394
00:19:26,829 --> 00:19:27,788
Would you like a bath?

395
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:30,669
Or are you too tired to mess with that tonight?

396
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:32,612
Well.

397
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,773
Since it's Christmas, I have an idea.

398
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:45,812
It's beautiful!

399
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,848
You sure you're not cold?

400
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,176
No, I'm great!

401
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,050
This is unusual.

402
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:54,100
You've never asked me to see the view at night.

403
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:54,974
That's weird.

404
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,186
Oh.

405
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,982
I almost forgot!

406
00:19:59,162 --> 00:19:59,785
Here!

407
00:20:00,211 --> 00:20:00,766
What?

408
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,203
Is this Christmas gift for me?

409
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:06,352
Yes! I got you some medicine
that works well for lower back pain.

410
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,547
For real? That's so sweet!

411
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,981
It's a valuable item in the other world!

412
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:18,160
You grind it down and apply it to your achy areas.

413
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,826
It works exquisitely!

414
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:20,968
Yeah.

415
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:21,703
Right.

416
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:27,062
Ya know, I was worried about you all day today.

417
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:28,329
What for?

418
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:29,444
What do you mean?

419
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:33,363
To be honest, I was super
anxious while watching your play.

420
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,768
Kept worrying if and when I should jump in to stop you.

421
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:41,114
But then, I realized everyone loved it.

422
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,425
You really did a nice job.

423
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:45,879
Thanks!

424
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,461
It's a White Christmas.

425
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,248
Here, I sorta got a Christmas present for you, too!

426
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,780
Uh? What is it?

427
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,960
Merry Christmas, Tohru.

428
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,157
Enjoy!

429
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:18,424
Miss Kobayashi!

430
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:24,679
Tohru, slow down! I'll fall!

431
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,118
I can't!

432
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,403
I suck at this!

433
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:29,375
Fafnir, that was quite the excellent performance!

434
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:31,412
"Look, pathetic humans."

435
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:32,308
Stop it.

436
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:35,082
"Huh? Why do you wish to be a magical girl?"

437
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:35,965
Don't mock me.

438
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,787
"Acceptable.

439
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,528
You shall be a magical girl, too."

440
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,658
I'll kill you all!
