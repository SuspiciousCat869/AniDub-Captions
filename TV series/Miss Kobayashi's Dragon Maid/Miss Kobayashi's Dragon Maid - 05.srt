1
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:05,365
Miss Kobayashi! Kanna!

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,047
Breakfast is ready!

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,230
Your miso soup is killer today.

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,293
Thank you, I'm glad you like it!

5
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:16,154
I decided to try something different
and only use ingredients from this world.

6
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:16,527
Hmph.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,757
We'll see you later.

8
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:20,940
Okay.

9
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,820
Be sure to watch out for those cars!

10
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:24,518
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:27,993
Remember, Kanna, if a car hits
you, you'll smash it to bits.

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,040
I know.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,756
Perfect! Miss Kobayashi didn't get angry or
chastise me about anything I did this morning!

14
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,076
Success, Tohru! Success!

15
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:44,232
I feel like my maid skills are definitely improving!

16
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:48,504
Hey, that could mean I'm finally
getting used to this world. Yay!

17
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:29,082
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you've been a lot happier lately.

18
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,368
What? I have?

19
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:34,538
Yeah, it's not like you were sad, but you
were a bit more stoic. Well, a lot more stoic.

20
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:37,454
I dunno, you just seem a lot
more open, if that makes sense.

21
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,978
See you later!

22
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:47,765
It's been, what? Two months now since she showed up?

23
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:55,243
Two months, and I have no idea
what I was like before then.

24
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:01,072
The secret to this dish is to marinate it in honey.

25
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,301
I should try that.

26
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:06,674
Yeah, maybe then, Miss Kobayashi
will give my tail meat a shot.

27
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:11,679
Our poll reveals how women really want
to be treated by their significant other!

28
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,603
Being knocked back on a wall is number one?!

29
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,804
Okay. So they're like birds. They pursue love with sound.

30
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,703
Pursue... Love...

31
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,169
Miss Kobayashi...

32
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:26,524
Tohru.

33
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:34,374
And now for the evening news. Early this
morning, a fire broke out in Tatsumicho Nishiku.

34
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:40,100
Kobayashi.

35
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:40,680
Hmm?

36
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:44,135
Y'know, I hate asking, but would
you mind helping me out with this?

37
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:45,199
Sure, whatcha got?

38
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,858
Whoa. Looks like I'm not the
only one who takes on too much.

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,561
I've been wanting to see what Miss Kobayashi is
like at work since I first found out she had a job!

40
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:02,369
One of my 48 maid skills: Perception blocking.

41
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:04,990
Now I can walk around without anyone noticing.

42
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,804
Ah! There she is!

43
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,920
Well, looks like I don't have any other choice.

44
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:14,570
Yeah, thanks. You, too.

45
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,207
Uh-oh, that didn't look very good.

46
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:22,349
Takiya?

47
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,848
Yeah, no. Remember that project Yamashita was working on?

48
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,783
Well, there's a big problem with it.

49
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,362
And if it's not fixed today, he'll basically be screwed.

50
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:31,200
Ah...

51
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:32,335
Sorry.

52
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,427
So, as of now, I've gotta prioritize that.

53
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,194
Meaning I can't help you.

54
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,781
At least, not at until that's fixed. I'm sorry.

55
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:41,511
Why're you apologizing?

56
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,854
I totally get it. No worries.

57
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:44,723
Hmph.

58
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,783
Hey. We need to go drinking again.

59
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,233
Hey, can you help me here?

60
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,870
Sure thing. Gimme a minute though.

61
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,455
This schedule sucks. I mean it's just impossible.

62
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,291
There's gotta be a way to push it back.

63
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:02,800
Gotcha. But this still needs to be reevaluated.

64
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:06,909
Humans may gather together, help each
other, and accomplish a lot of things,

65
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,546
but their civilization could
easily be destroyed by dragons.

66
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:14,787
Bottom line, I still think dragons are way better.

67
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:16,596
Kobayashi!

68
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:19,269
Come on, you've gotta be done by now.

69
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,785
No. Not yet.

70
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:24,162
Y... What are you doing?! Are you completely useless?!

71
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:27,721
Did you forget that part when I
told you to finish it "immediately"?!

72
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:29,278
Who's this jerk?!

73
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:33,357
Big shock. The Chief is yet again
pushing his work off onto Kobayashi.

74
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:36,051
It's nuts because his project isn't even that crucial.

75
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:38,202
Listen, honey...

76
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,363
You better quit screwing around
and finish this thing fast, got me?!

77
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,685
Understood, sir.

78
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:44,915
Grr! Christ...

79
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:50,039
Pfft!

80
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:50,884
Cheese it, guys!

81
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,201
Hmph! Serves him right.

82
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,082
That oughta cheer up Miss Kobayashi.

83
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:07,114
Uh! I thought I was blocking perception.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,664
No, there's no way anyone knows I'm here.

85
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,908
Miss Kobayashi sure works hard.

86
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:33,484
And that's on top of everyone
asking for her help all the time.

87
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,897
Miss Kobayashi is just... She's just the best!

88
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,048
Kobayashi!

89
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:42,738
Hmm?

90
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,003
You better be close to done! Why haven't
you given me any work progress updates?!

91
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,204
This jerk again?

92
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:50,369
Yeah, about that. I've had a
lot of other things to do, so...

93
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,874
"Other things"?! You follow my orders first!

94
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,675
I understand, but your work's not my priority.

95
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,415
Don't back talk me!

96
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,983
Focus! And fix that attitude now!

97
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,035
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,985
Christ! Completely useless!

99
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,763
Ow! C'mo... Ow!

100
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,192
Who is doing that...?

101
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:22,655
Ah!

102
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,466
Is that karma? Because it looks like karma.

103
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:28,291
Why me...?

104
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,519
Thanks for your help today!

105
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,014
No problem! See you tomorrow.

106
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,039
I'm heading out too.

107
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:39,311
All right.

108
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,393
I should probably get home before Miss Kobayashi does.

109
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:43,621
Tohru.

110
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,443
You're here, right?

111
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,445
You really were!

112
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,896
Uh. Yes, but how did you know?

113
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:56,909
Uh. I guess I just kinda had a feeling.

114
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,187
But whatever.

115
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,980
I bet my job was a lot more
boring than you expected it to be.

116
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,663
No, it wasn't boring at all!

117
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,670
I wanted to learn more. More about you, I mean.

118
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:11,424
And I did.

119
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:12,670
Hmph.

120
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:16,739
Cool.

121
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:22,452
Ready to go home?

122
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,625
Yes!

123
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,129
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you've been a lot happier lately.

124
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:38,700
I wonder what I was like before.

125
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:42,226
Hmph.

126
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,136
I've already forgotten.

127
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,793
I heard someone got the chief
canned for abusing his power.

128
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:56,349
Apparently, the director got an
anonymous recording proving it.

129
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,318
Whoa, who do you think turned him in?

130
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:05,454
Okay, I'd like everyone to find a friend.

131
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:08,179
When you're paired up, draw a picture of your partner.

132
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:09,538
Okay.

133
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,663
Ah! Hi, Kanna.

134
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,470
Do you wanna draw me, maybe, please?

135
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:17,731
Hmm.

136
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,893
You're my friend.

137
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,105
Asparagus, watercress, and potatoes!

138
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,306
Hooray for vegetables that are in season!

139
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,263
And since they were cheaper than I figured,

140
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:43,769
I can pick up some snacks for Kanna. Huh?

141
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,841
Fafnir?

142
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,429
I'm home from shopping!

143
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:55,262
Welcome back.

144
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:57,312
That was a surprise!

145
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,634
I never expected you to be standing there.

146
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:00,737
Oh, that's for you.

147
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,705
So what's going on?

148
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,578
Hmph.

149
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:09,850
I've made the decision to live in this world for a while.

150
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,255
What? Seriously?

151
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,250
To be honest, I don't recommend it for you at all.

152
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,625
You know you're gonna have to live with humans.

153
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:20,044
Yes, I know that. But if you can do it, then so can I.

154
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:21,814
I guess that's true.

155
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,701
Ooh, maybe you could stay...

156
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:25,870
Somewhere that's not here.

157
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:28,658
Do you have any thoughts on where you want to live?

158
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,567
I imagine a nearby mountain should suffice.

159
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,559
And now for the news.

160
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:39,175
Last night, accounts of a monster spotted in
the mountains were called into emergency services.

161
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,666
Police were dispatched to investigate a
creature that's reportedly 20 meters tall.

162
00:10:43,837 --> 00:10:45,970
What? Don't judge me.

163
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:50,355
Why should I be forced to hide who
I am in order to appease the humans?

164
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:53,515
Perhaps... I should simply destroy them.

165
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,631
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

166
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,840
If you want to live around humans,

167
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,138
you'll have to fit in. That's just the way it is.

168
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,781
I know, restraint sucks.

169
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,997
Hey! You know what?

170
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,927
I don't mind helping you search for a new place to live!

171
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:10,034
Uh. You sure you want to get involved with that Tohru?

172
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,899
Yes! Don't worry I'll be fine.

173
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,657
I can do this! You in, Fafnir?

174
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:15,395
Hmph.

175
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,437
It certainly won't hurt to see what you can do.

176
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,334
Just the other day, I watched Miss Kobayashi
move out, so I've got the process down.

177
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh?

178
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,741
First you create a family registration.

179
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:31,516
Then a proof of citizenship, a
bank account, and a personal seal.

180
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,217
You gather all that stuff and show them to a realtor.

181
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,725
I don't have those things.

182
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:40,165
Nope! So, I created them all for you!

183
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:43,248
Hold on.

184
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:44,384
Holding!

185
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,127
Huh? Is that me?

186
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:51,608
Yes. Your dragon form looked like a
Takeshi Ooyama to me, so I went with it!

187
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,510
You're too much like them.

188
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:55,907
Huh?

189
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,378
You have grown far too close to these humans, Tohru.

190
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,405
What happens when you return to your world?

191
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,156
Will you kill them? Will you even be able to anymore?

192
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:15,236
Doesn't matter, I don't intend to return to my world.

193
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:18,924
Why would I? This is clearly where I belong!

194
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:24,876
Eventually, that human you've
become so attached to will die.

195
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:26,479
What then?

196
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,722
Look, I promise you I'm fine.

197
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:36,117
I know the more I treasure being here and these moments,

198
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:38,857
the sadder I'll be when the time comes.

199
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,691
But I'll embrace it.

200
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:44,133
I never want to confuse those feelings with regret.

201
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:46,421
Because she's worth it!

202
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,237
Come on... green means go.

203
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,947
And you genuinely believe these creatures
are worth such high praise, do you?

204
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,076
Yes, I do.

205
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,350
Miss Kobayashi is one of them.

206
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:04,369
Hmph.

207
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,459
What's the deal, Fafnir? Why so worried about me?

208
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:13,195
I was merely curious about what humans
are like in this world, no more, no less.

209
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,066
Well, if it isn't Miss Kobayashi's maid.

210
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:18,717
That's me! Can you help us?

211
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,966
So. What's your budget?

212
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,815
You mean payment?

213
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:30,127
Heh. Sorry, but we take money, not gold.

214
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,748
That was a bust, huh?

215
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,775
This isn't a problem. I can just go steal a...

216
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,219
Nope. No, you can not.

217
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:43,274
I cannot fathom no currency exchange.

218
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:44,889
This is such a limited world.

219
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,690
Yeah, about that...

220
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:52,656
It seems, I don't know, are you sure it isn't best for you
to live in your own world and just come, like, to visit?

221
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:56,440
It's gotta be hard to live here
without a human you get along with.

222
00:13:58,831 --> 00:13:59,312
Hmm?

223
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,899
Except that there is a human you get along with, Fafnir!

224
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,316
Yes, who is it?

225
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,435
Hey, Tohru!

226
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,623
Oh! What's up, Fafnir? Good to see you.

227
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,792
Kinda weird that you know where I live, though.

228
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,914
I asked Miss Kobayashi.

229
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:19,891
Mister Takiya?

230
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:21,073
How can I help you?

231
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:24,839
It's, um, Fafnir has no home right now.

232
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,503
Would you mind if he stayed with you, please?

233
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,948
You want Fafnir to live here?

234
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,596
Yes. That okay?

235
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:32,936
Sure, it's totally fine.

236
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:34,883
What?! You... You mean it?

237
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,846
Well, it'll be cramped, but I don't mind if you don't.

238
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,561
Are you sure, like, sure?

239
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:42,637
I know I'm one to talk, but
this guy's a very dangerous dragon!

240
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:44,478
Hmm?

241
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,545
The last time we met...

242
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:47,790
You like that game?

243
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,198
Yes, but I'm curious... are there more?

244
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,685
Why don't you come on in?

245
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,905
Tell me about these "games."

246
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:54,889
You got it!

247
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:02,283
Something makes me think maybe Fafnir's decision
to stay here had precisely nothing to do with me.

248
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:06,838
Correct.

249
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:10,517
Let's conduct the experiment according
to the chart located in your textbook.

250
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:11,628
Okay.

251
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:15,248
I forgot to bring my book. Share with me?

252
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:18,492
Ah! Yes. Well, if I have to.

253
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:20,357
Hmm.

254
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,489
Now please give me the spoon.

255
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,160
Physical strength is not necessary.

256
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,741
I'm going to bend it using my mind.

257
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,804
That spoon was not bent with physical strength.

258
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:40,595
I saw it!

259
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:43,336
And as far as I can tell, he didn't use magic.

260
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,005
Like this, right?

261
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,358
I feel like it was something like this.

262
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:50,677
Not that.

263
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,133
Tohru!

264
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:03,281
Guys... You destroyed them.

265
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:05,616
Yeah... We're sorry about that...

266
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:07,157
What were you trying to do?

267
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,310
Over there. Look there. Look there.

268
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,638
Huh? Oh, right.

269
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,757
Of course you were.

270
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,412
I guess you've never heard of psychic powers before.

271
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,467
Psychic powers?!

272
00:16:17,562 --> 00:16:20,638
So are you telling me that
humans really do have hidden powers?

273
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:28,297
I told you Miss Kobayashi was no ordinary human!

274
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:30,163
She's a Kobayashi God!

275
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:31,236
Yes, she is!

276
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,906
Listen up, dragons. This is a trick.

277
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,915
Anyone can do magic tricks... if they learn.

278
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,870
Sorry? Anyone?

279
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:40,902
I've heard of this before.

280
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:43,361
There's a "should be forgettable"
movie that talks about it.

281
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:46,929
About how humans only use approximately
ten percent of their brain capacity.

282
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:50,399
Basically, if humans weren't so lazy,
they would be able to have super powers.

283
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,010
All they have to do is try.

284
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,651
Such potential killed by inherent laziness.

285
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:57,120
I can't forgive that! Damn humans!

286
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:59,290
I have a strong feeling I don't
like what you're thinking right now.

287
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,986
Lady Tohru. I found this book on Kobayashi's shelf.

288
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,327
Well done, Kanna!

289
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,096
Oh, I bought that thing forever ago.

290
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:10,663
According to these instructions, there's a
move that allows power to enter your hand.

291
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,480
It's fictional though, not real.

292
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,608
Ah! That's not true!

293
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,706
This book is clearly instructional!

294
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,146
I'm gonna train with it!

295
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:20,870
Your susceptibility could feed an entire cult.

296
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,618
I know, right? Come with me!

297
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,454
Why not? I got nothing else going on.

298
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,509
Wait, let me fix your spoons real quick.

299
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,633
I don't get this. You don't need psychic powers.

300
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,823
That's great. Very cliché.

301
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:43,019
May the surrounding energy tell me if
I'll actually learn anything this way.

302
00:17:51,448 --> 00:17:51,751
Mm?

303
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,838
It doesn't matter if she can do it, so why?

304
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:00,468
Empty the mind. Right now, I have no desires.

305
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,001
Kobayashi, I'm hungry.

306
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,297
For you are weak!

307
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:06,714
Ah...

308
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:07,475
Hey!

309
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,170
I want some, too!

310
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,337
Here.

311
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:13,987
Ah...

312
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,075
A star!

313
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,047
Incorrect.

314
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,720
Miss Kobayashi! Miss Kobayashi!

315
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,617
Uh... Miss Kobayashi?

316
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:28,820
Nope. Pretty sure that's your horn.

317
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,792
Hyah! Hyah!

318
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,404
Hyah! Hyah!

319
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,759
Miss Kobayashi, please look!

320
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:45,537
Presenting...

321
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,582
Compilation Bear Slayer!

322
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,302
What does she want out of this?

323
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,563
Hup... Chop, chop, chop...

324
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,639
Come on, no fair!

325
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,666
Listen, Tohru.

326
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:02,618
Hmm?

327
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,971
You can do so many things humans can't,

328
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:07,657
so why is this such a big
deal? Maybe you should let it go.

329
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,887
I will not!

330
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,392
I will never, not ever, lose to the disgusting human race!

331
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,957
I refuse to be inferior in any way!

332
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,326
I will not let it go.

333
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,660
I can't let it go... Not ever...

334
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:21,104
Hmm...

335
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:24,722
Not ever, huh? Doesn't sound like that's it.

336
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,799
I think she actually wants to understand humans.

337
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:33,090
That's why she's so desperate to understand
the things about us that make no sense to her.

338
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,287
Hey, Tohru.

339
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:41,376
First, you gotta find the spoon's center of gravity.

340
00:19:41,906 --> 00:19:44,529
Then, you just use the principle of leverage like this.

341
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:45,204
There.

342
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:49,478
Uh?

343
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,142
That's it...?

344
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,851
Once you understand, it seems obvious, huh?

345
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,957
This is fairly simple.

346
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:01,922
But there are some things that
aren't this easy for everyone.

347
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:06,392
If you ask me, I think you should focus
on those special things only you can do.

348
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,601
Heh. Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, Miss Kobayashi.

349
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:18,342
Heh...

350
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,146
I get it now.

351
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:30,863
Tohru...

352
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:39,866
Well then! I'm gonna show you a power only I can use!

353
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,011
Make sure you pay close attention to me!

354
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,761
All right. But no breaking anything, okay?

355
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:50,035
Nevermind. I won't be able to do anything, then.

356
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,583
The avatar of destruction.

357
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,354
I can make electricity.

358
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:54,617
Oh.

359
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:59,742
Now the beautiful assistant has entered the box.

360
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,179
Watch closely!

361
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:03,689
This is the super magic of instant teleportation!

362
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:04,652
Here it comes!

363
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,491
This is the moment of the century, folks.

364
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:15,146
PFFT!!

365
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:15,953
A maid?!

366
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:19,663
What the hell just happened? A
maid has appeared from the box!

367
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:21,440
This isn't what was planned, right?

368
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,506
Hey, will you give me extra, please?

369
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:31,619
Sweet and sour pork with pineapples?

370
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:33,611
I hate when they serve this crap.

371
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,471
No! It's too cute!

372
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,506
We're likely to have leftovers...

373
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,715
...so have some extra.

374
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:50,327
Extra? Extra?! She gave me extra?!

375
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,309
Miss Kobayashi, I learned some new magic!

376
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:29,079
Wow.

377
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,515
Please take a look at this coin on a string.

378
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:32,190
Okay.

379
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:34,865
You will fall deeper and deeper in love with Tohru!

380
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,721
Deep in love with Tohru!

381
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,730
That's not magic and it's not working.
