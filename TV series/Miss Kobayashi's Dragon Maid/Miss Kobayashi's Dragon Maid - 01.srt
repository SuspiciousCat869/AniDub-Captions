1
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:48,842
Oh, my head...

2
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:51,756
Hangovers suck...

3
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,214
Ooh, cold!

4
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:09,011
Come check out Maid Café: Cozy.

5
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,932
Stop by and say hi!

6
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,466
Hope to see you at Maid Café: Cozy!

7
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,702
Man. My lower back hurts, too...

8
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:24,033
Running that new integration test
should be a straight-up blast today.

9
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:46,247
Dragons.

10
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:48,775
The most powerful of all beings.

11
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:55,755
An imaginary creature that has giant wings for
flight, possesses magical powers, and breathes fire.

12
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:00,826
Ah! Ta-dah!

13
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,242
Although, what do I know?

14
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,657
Having a good morning, Miss Kobayashi?

15
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:56,869
I don't know yet.

16
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,408
Do you mind allowing me in to your lovely home?

17
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,873
Oh. Sure, why the heck not?

18
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:08,000
So, you say we met yesterday,
and I offered to let you stay here.

19
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,989
With me. And you're for sure positive that's what I said?

20
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:12,116
Indeed!

21
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:13,966
This is weird.

22
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,000
Why am I not waking up from this dream?

23
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,497
Unless it's not a dream. There's no way.

24
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,670
So, um... Remind me where we met?

25
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:26,743
The mountains! We met in the mountains!

26
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,878
Mountains...

27
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,019
I remember mountains.

28
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,014
Okay, it's coming back.

29
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:38,938
A dragon?

30
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,879
Apparently, a hilarious dragon.

31
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:44,482
Oh, God...

32
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:50,284
So, wanna stay with me, "dragon"?

33
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,070
So, wanna stay with me, "dragon"?

34
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,931
I'll never forget those wondrous words!

35
00:04:56,574 --> 00:04:59,924
I can begin working as your
personal maid immediately if you want!

36
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,603
Oh, that's a big negative.

37
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,080
Huh?

38
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,616
I'm not like a dragon racist or anything.

39
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,086
I'm just not in the market right now to hire a maid.

40
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,281
But! You wouldn't have to pay me!

41
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:11,674
Yeah, no, that's not really...

42
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,872
Listen, I can be super helpful!

43
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:17,390
I can turn this area into a sea
of fire, or curse people to death!

44
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:18,716
No, no, no!

45
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,496
But, why maid instead of that?

46
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:23,000
Because you said a maid would work better for you!

47
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,206
I did, huh?

48
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,008
Yeah, does make sense...

49
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm sorry, Tohru. I shouldn't have made that promise.

50
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,491
No one can change the impossible.

51
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,034
It's not, like, personal.

52
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:47,318
Are you certain...?

53
00:05:47,787 --> 00:05:48,955
It's impossible?

54
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:51,624
Mm-hmm... Sorry.

55
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:56,567
I understand.

56
00:05:56,873 --> 00:06:00,301
My apologies as well, for dropping in so suddenly.

57
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,424
Wanna stay with me, "dragon"?

58
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:20,989
Why won't this stupid guilt go away?

59
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,743
Maybe this dream... is really not a dream.

60
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,610
And if it's not, then...

61
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,972
I'm late?! Tohru!

62
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:36,825
Ah?

63
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:40,968
Can you fly?!

64
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:43,712
Ah!

65
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,841
Dragons are so fast!

66
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,383
Sorry, what did you say?

67
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,812
You're hella fast!

68
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:03,287
I could keep her.

69
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:04,377
Are you serious?!

70
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,822
So, now you can hear me?

71
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:12,487
I guess it wouldn't be the end of the
world to have someone around the house.

72
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:14,322
And if she's there...

73
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:17,705
This is murdering my lower back!

74
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:28,140
Okay. First, let's take a look at what you've decided is
the proper outfit for a maid and why that's totally wrong.

75
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,412
Great idea!

76
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:30,697
Here you go.

77
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:31,196
Huh...?

78
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,050
It's says Maid Café Cozy, see?

79
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:34,932
What is this?

80
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:37,656
I discovered some real life maids while on my way here.

81
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,633
Meaning we'll have to start from scratch.

82
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,366
First thing, as a housemaid... you clean.

83
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:43,766
Oh, I'm good at cleaning!

84
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:47,815
How's that?

85
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,966
No! It's all gone!

86
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:49,977
One moment!

87
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:51,008
You can bring it back?

88
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,813
Next! Laundry maid! Do laundry.

89
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,373
I can handle that, too!

90
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,195
I can produce a saliva that specifically removes stains.

91
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:02,449
Gross! No one wants to see that!

92
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,133
Next! Parlor maid! Greet people.

93
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:06,742
Easy thing for me!

94
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,554
Hi, I just need a signature for this delivery.

95
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:12,890
The foolish, inferior human is not welcome at this home!

96
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:13,395
Hey.

97
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:16,029
Oh, you're an exception of course, Miss Kobayashi!

98
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:18,222
Last one! Kitchen maid.

99
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:19,283
You cook.

100
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:21,009
Cooking is my specialty!

101
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,101
Try my very own roasted tail!

102
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,204
No, thanks.

103
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:25,941
Huh?

104
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:27,356
No way.

105
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:27,995
Wha...?!

106
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:30,091
Would you prefer it well-done instead?

107
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:31,508
That's not the problem.

108
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,593
Then I'm confident you'll enjoy it immensely!

109
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:35,462
I'm ethically against dragon tail.

110
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,138
Ah-hah! Seems you're a picky eater, Miss Kobayashi!

111
00:08:38,163 --> 00:08:39,181
Dragon logic.

112
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:46,491
It grows back?!

113
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:49,221
Took a bit longer than usual
because I had to remove all the poison.

114
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,263
And it's poisonous?!

115
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,896
Hate to break it to you, but you don't know how to maid.

116
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,605
Then, I'll learn from the ground up!

117
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,496
Shall we start my education with
you telling me what you dislike?

118
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:03,278
What I dislike? I can't do <i>hijiki</i> or eggplant.

119
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,169
Interesting. I'll remember that.

120
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,674
Personally, I dislike eggs
when the yolks have been removed.

121
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:12,183
A while back, I had a friend named
Herensuge who was hit with one and killed.

122
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,415
That's a powerful egg.

123
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:16,323
Hold up. Why are you asking about dislikes?

124
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,839
Shouldn't you ask what I like?

125
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,097
No, that's bad luck.

126
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,482
Unfortunately, I've had far too many
friends slain by the very things they love most.

127
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,826
You know... liquor and women and jewels and such.

128
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,452
Sounds a lot like humans.

129
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:31,386
However, I can certainly let you know one thing I like!

130
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,914
It's you! I love you, Miss Kobayashi!

131
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:35,924
You gonna eat me?

132
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,917
No, not like that! Like sexually!

133
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,585
I'm not into women or dragons.

134
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:42,542
Yes, but I can't put a label on what I feel for you!

135
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:45,990
You saved me, and I'll use my
whole body to repay the favor!

136
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,660
Please use me to commute to work again tomorrow!

137
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,511
Thanks, but I got enough of that earlier. You're hard.

138
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,307
Gimme a chance, Miss Kobayashi!

139
00:09:53,347 --> 00:09:58,287
I was raised to pay back all favors, even if they
were only owed to a foolish, inferior human being!

140
00:09:58,605 --> 00:10:01,513
Call me crazy, but I sense bias.

141
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:06,041
Tohru, there is another reason I'd
rather not let you fly me to work.

142
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,027
Your back?

143
00:10:07,164 --> 00:10:10,523
Well, that's half of it. The other half is...

144
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,313
You're too loud and too fast!

145
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:17,126
I think a dragon's place is in
the home holding down the fort!

146
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:18,762
Fort? What?

147
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:21,098
You're one of the stronger dragons, aren't you?

148
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:23,395
If you consider "starting Armageddon" strong.

149
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,897
I do, and please don't.

150
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,653
The world's dangerous enough without your help.

151
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:31,561
I'm just saying it would be a relief to
know you're here keeping the house safe for me.

152
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:34,160
Yes, I understand!

153
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,606
So consider it done!

154
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:36,920
So pretty.

155
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,222
Well, I'm off to the office.

156
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,269
If anybody calls, you can answer and take a message, yeah?

157
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:43,895
What's a "calls"?

158
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,007
Right, you're a dragon.

159
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,398
This is a phone.

160
00:10:46,757 --> 00:10:48,841
When it goes "ring-ring," you pick it up like so.

161
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:49,868
Okay, got it.

162
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,074
They talk, then you talk.

163
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:52,530
They talk, then I talk!

164
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,508
Okay, take care.

165
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,503
Save travels!

166
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:57,878
Hold the fort?

167
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,367
Oh, is that what those people were doing?

168
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,121
I'll just ask Fafnir for help!

169
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,231
Kill them.

170
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,758
Kill all who try to steal your treasure.

171
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:12,664
Kill all who are suspect.

172
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,883
Curse them with death. Curse their generations to come.

173
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,750
He's always so helpful! All right!

174
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,522
Time to do my best to earn
Miss Kobayashi's love and praise!

175
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,135
Hmm?

176
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,623
The lady who lives here should be
gone all day, but let's make this fast.

177
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:31,183
We'll be in there before you can say "open."

178
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:34,662
Uh.

179
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:46,573
Save us!

180
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:47,097
Hmm?

181
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:48,352
There's a monster!

182
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:48,898
A monster?

183
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,205
We saw it, I swear!

184
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:51,889
I'm home.

185
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:53,173
Welcome back!

186
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,517
Hold the fort down all right?

187
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,368
I suppose, but it was lonely.

188
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:56,819
Ahh.

189
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,233
And I didn't even get to kill them.

190
00:11:58,395 --> 00:11:58,863
Ahh.

191
00:11:58,955 --> 00:11:59,802
Wait, what?

192
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,144
Hey, Kobayashi.

193
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,080
What is it, Takiya?

194
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,011
Want to grab some drinks tonight?

195
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:20,530
Sure, but, like, only one round.

196
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:25,260
So why me? There are plenty of other girls you could ask.

197
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,713
I don't want to go on a date.

198
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:28,564
I asked you 'cause you're like one of the guys.

199
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,786
Wow, how sweet.

200
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:34,014
What's with that girl staring us down?

201
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,027
Do you know her?

202
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,315
Uh...

203
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:40,923
Greetings, I'm Tohru Kobayashi. Miss Kobayashi's new maid.

204
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,317
Her new <i>live-in</i> maid. New <i>violent</i> live-in maid.

205
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:45,291
Hmm.

206
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:48,235
Yeah, it's my turn to take care of the "special" cousin.

207
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,552
I'm Makoto Takiya.

208
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:53,348
Kobayashi and I work together.
It's nice to meet you, Tohru.

209
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,135
And also you, Mister Takiya.

210
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:59,511
This man is clearly attempting to seduce Miss Kobayashi.

211
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,869
I shall not allow it!

212
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,946
Of course I can drink. You stultus.

213
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:06,716
Stultus?

214
00:13:10,033 --> 00:13:10,973
Ah!

215
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:14,194
I love a good drink after work. It's the best!

216
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,497
Miss Kobayashi's the cutest!

217
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,222
I take it you won't be joining
us in our fight against sobriety?

218
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:20,168
I won't.

219
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:20,664
Got it.

220
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,042
I do not intend to share drinks with him.

221
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,363
What do I do about this silly man?

222
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,299
The laws are too strict in this world to do what I want.

223
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:29,347
I know!

224
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,792
I can flaunt how wonderfully close
Miss Kobayashi and I have become!

225
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,438
We're only secondary or tertiary
subcontractors, so why bother complaining?

226
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:41,451
Because I don't like how following their
directions consistently means we fail.

227
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:44,408
And the developers don't even
notice unless we point it out.

228
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:48,799
But making sure they don't have to notice their
faults is part of our job, so again, why complain?

229
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:52,613
I just think foisting their problems
on us is a pretty sucky thing to do.

230
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:55,248
I can't follow what they're saying at all.

231
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,309
Speak, Dragon, please.

232
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,375
Ah, I'm so sorry, Tohru.

233
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,039
We're not exactly including you in this discussion.

234
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:03,746
No, it's fine.

235
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,914
The topic's just so trite, I don't feel like joining in.

236
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:06,834
Okay...

237
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:10,331
We should be discussing the
ramifications of Ragnarok and Armageddon!

238
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,921
It doesn't matter, I've had enough!

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,430
Time to use force!

240
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:17,226
Let the jackals feed off you when you're dead!

241
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,316
Miss Kobayashi...?

242
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:25,281
Tohru...

243
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:30,272
Good maids don't talk that way! No threatening murder!

244
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,671
She's gone drunk!

245
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,049
On top of that, what's with your so-called maid uniform?

246
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:36,562
It's pretty disrespectful to maid-dom, if you ask me.

247
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,385
I mean, have a little self-respect. You look
like you're about to lose a cosplay contest.

248
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:43,706
Um, Mister Takiya?

249
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:47,377
Kobayashi! You're right, she's
just your basic cosplay maid!

250
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:50,459
It's cultural appropriation but without any culture!

251
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:54,789
Agreed! I can acknowledge the cuteness of
Gothic Lolita, but that's a specific fashion trend,

252
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,716
not cosplay! Why does it get so twisted?!

253
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,317
That's what I'm screaming!

254
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,877
Sure, Lolita and the maid fashion
do acknowledge each other, and

255
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:04,052
rightfully so, but they should be
careful not to blend into boring!

256
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,026
I think we're well beyond me just
being a part of this conversation, now.

257
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:10,242
Hey, Tohru!

258
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:14,969
We're giving you some high-level maid
conversation, so you better get in on this!

259
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:15,966
Maid talk!

260
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:17,549
Yes... I'm very sorry...

261
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,779
You know, Tohru, those horns are a nice,
if not confusing, touch to the cosplay.

262
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:24,830
Dragons have horns, and that is all I know about that.

263
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:25,521
Take it off.

264
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:26,383
Huh?

265
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,628
Take it off!

266
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:29,418
Huh...?

267
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,029
Come on! Gird your loins, sister! Cosplay me crazy!

268
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:35,062
Where's the shame in your role, maid?

269
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,254
I'm ashamed!

270
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,415
Give me more!

271
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,641
Show us what your "moe" is made of!

272
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,582
This is insane.

273
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:42,174
Bring more liquor.

274
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,013
Humans are terrifying!

275
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:46,933
And don't forget a good butler!

276
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:48,949
Sorry about that, Tohru.

277
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,622
Kobayashi and I go drinking because
we like to talk about all things maid.

278
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:57,737
As an undercover otaku, being able to share my
passions with someone else is kind of precious to me.

279
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,176
I understand that perfectly.

280
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:03,615
And I'm assuming this means
you won't mind a little surprise.

281
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:16,762
Heh.

282
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:20,616
We can just say I drank too much, too.

283
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,327
You really like Kobayashi, don't you?

284
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,424
Yes.

285
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:30,820
Since we're being so honest, you should know I hate you.

286
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:56,091
Okay, so humans beings all soil
their clothing with waste products?

287
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:58,366
Inferior species!

288
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,739
Miss Kobayashi's waste.

289
00:17:03,886 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh, there's no more left...

290
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:11,768
I've said this before, so don't make me say
it again... Please stop licking my laundry.

291
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,286
'Kay. Then, I'll take care of it by licking you directly.

292
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:17,011
No licking me! Can we discuss the laundry?

293
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,410
Am I doing it wrong?

294
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,975
That's putting it mildly.

295
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:21,604
Tell me what you do beginning to end.

296
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:25,918
Well, first, I use my clairvoyance
to make certain your pockets are empty.

297
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:26,634
Good.

298
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:30,518
Then I separate them into piles by color,
and wash them in appropriate detergents.

299
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:31,153
Good.

300
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,020
Then I wash the delicates in my mouth.

301
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:33,719
No!

302
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,884
I told you I produce saliva that removes stains, yeah?

303
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,341
So gross! I told you nobody wants to see that!

304
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,299
Oh. Would licking make it better?

305
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:41,799
It's spit, not style!

306
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:45,471
Another thing. You can't wear the same
thing every day like you're in some anime.

307
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,314
You're going to have to change clothes, too.

308
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:49,134
But, these are my scales.

309
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:49,993
For real?

310
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,043
Yes. They're a part of me, so
I'd rather not take them off.

311
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,924
Oh. Makes sense.

312
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:55,418
Uh.

313
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:57,293
What's the matter?

314
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,779
It's just, uh...

315
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,386
I bought you some personal clothes.

316
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,763
Thank you very, very much!

317
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:11,479
Well, you're doing a lot for me, so
I wanted, um, to show appreciation.

318
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,799
Miss Kobayashi, would you like to have a sacrifice later?

319
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:17,996
How fun. Care for my fresh blood?

320
00:18:18,021 --> 00:18:19,109
What am I, a demon?!

321
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,547
Heavens no! You're practically an angel!

322
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:24,262
But whatever you do, please do not start serving God.

323
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,725
Look, just try it on.

324
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,043
Ah!

325
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:29,916
Well?

326
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:31,018
It's tight.

327
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,063
What size bra do you wear?

328
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:35,381
A "D!" It stands for "dragon!"

329
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:37,891
At least you bothered to learn something. Gah.

330
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,607
Oh, crap, I gotta go.

331
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:45,278
All right, Tohru, use the Internet to study up
appropriate hygienic practices until I get home.

332
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:46,329
The inter-what?

333
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:47,720
Right. Dragon.

334
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh!

335
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,754
You look it up like this.

336
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:53,819
I understand!

337
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,366
I'll see you later, then.

338
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,846
Safe travels!

339
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,064
The Internet!

340
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:10,144
Hmm, I still don't quite follow this.

341
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:13,911
I can just ask Fafnir to help me out again.

342
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,532
Kill them a...

343
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:17,051
Or maybe not Fafnir.

344
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:21,126
Quetzalcoatl is knowledgeable, so I'll try asking her.

345
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,247
Lucoa! Hey!

346
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,789
Tohru? It's been, like, forever.

347
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,495
So blah-blah-blah and yadda-yadda?

348
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,704
Mm-hmm...

349
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:30,698
Yeah...

350
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:32,924
This doesn't sound like a problem of clean or dirty.

351
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:33,660
Huh?

352
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,259
Well, you remember Nidhogg, don't you?

353
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,072
The one who gnawed on that tree's roots?

354
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:39,748
The world's tree, yes.

355
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:44,564
No matter how much Nidhogg's poisonous fangs
pollute Yggdrasill, the goddesses purify it,

356
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:46,824
so the tree stays clean. However...

357
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,004
Yes?

358
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,388
What do you figure happens to the spots he gnaws?

359
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:51,309
Ah...

360
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,836
As I recall, he leaves energy behind.

361
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,964
Something like a curse?

362
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,037
Yep, that's it.

363
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:59,040
This Miss Kobayashi you speak of is worried about that.

364
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,311
Of course! Thank you very much!

365
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:02,375
Tohru.

366
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,439
Are you enjoying living amongst the humans?

367
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:09,360
I am!

368
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:18,362
At this rate, Miss Kobayashi's
laundry is never going to get dry.

369
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:20,187
I know!

370
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,150
Great work, Tohru.

371
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,305
Really starting to doubt my maid teaching skills.

372
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:56,109
What just happened?

373
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:57,316
I know that breath.

374
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:58,951
I know it well.

375
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,005
Surely there's nothing wrong with inhaling the scent?

376
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,242
I don't imagine you need sleep?

377
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:21,133
Nope. But I wanna sleep with you,
so I think I'm gonna go to bed anyway!

378
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,987
Whatever, do what you want.

379
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:25,068
I have a feeling you don't mean that!

380
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,938
Well, nighty-night.

381
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,168
Yes, good night.

382
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:42,196
It's cramped.

383
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,216
Do you want me to go?

384
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,471
Nah, it's fine.

385
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,388
You okay?

386
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:38,685
It was a fight. In another world.

387
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:41,412
I was run through by a sword.

388
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,104
I bet that hurt.

389
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:47,045
Yes, quite a lot.

390
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,553
And does it still hurt?

391
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:50,938
No. It doesn't hurt now.

392
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,382
That's good, then.

393
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:53,160
Ah.

394
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,763
Sweet dreams.

395
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:00,890
Sweet dreams.

396
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:17,264
Welcome back home, Miss Kobayashi!

397
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,006
I said welcome home.

398
00:23:19,337 --> 00:23:20,775
Welcome back, girl!

399
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:23,182
So, what are you working on, Tohru?

400
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:59,277
Miss Kobayashi! Tell me what you like this time!

401
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:00,004
Maids.

402
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:01,182
You mean me, then?

403
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:03,299
No, not you.

404
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,246
What else?

405
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:05,466
I dunno, peace.

406
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,213
So you're saying I'm enough for you?

407
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:08,571
Nope. I never said that.
