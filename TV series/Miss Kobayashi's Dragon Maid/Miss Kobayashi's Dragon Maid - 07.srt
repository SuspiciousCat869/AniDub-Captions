1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,071
Wow!

2
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:09,119
The beaches in this world are pretty. Real pretty!

3
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:13,081
With so many people, don't you wanna just
mow 'em all down at once, Miss Kobayashi?

4
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:14,384
Can't say I do.

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:16,019
The ocean here's salty?

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,392
Yep, sure is.

7
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:18,846
That's the same, then.

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,710
My favorite thing about swimsuits is that
you can show off as much flesh as you want!

9
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:24,363
Not accurate or appropriate.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,395
For real?

11
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:27,813
Shouta, baby, what do you think?

12
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:29,707
So aggressive!

13
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,706
Way less scary.

14
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,937
Not a compliment, but thanks for the effort, kid.

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,123
Excuse me, ma'am.

16
00:00:37,148 --> 00:00:37,413
Hmm?

17
00:00:37,576 --> 00:00:38,191
Yeah?

18
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:40,440
I need you to come with me...
your swimsuit is way too skimpy.

19
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,543
Hey! Hold on!

20
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:44,368
Well, that was entirely expected.

21
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,599
They finally let me back out!

22
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,706
Why did you think to bring an extra suit?

23
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,477
I didn't. These're scales.

24
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:25,201
You guys wearing scale suits, too?

25
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:26,645
They're cute. I'll give you that.

26
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,211
Thanks! We looked up designs on the Internet.

27
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:29,982
Aren't you jealous?

28
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,159
Of the suit? No.

29
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:32,754
Of what's filling it out? Yes.

30
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,783
I wanna go play, please.

31
00:02:34,898 --> 00:02:36,873
Looks like we're gonna go play for a little bit.

32
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,942
What'll you do here without us, though?

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,127
Hmm... Probably nothing.

34
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,154
What's the matter, Miss Kobayashi?

35
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,492
You haven't seemed excited all day.

36
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,873
There's a good reason for that.

37
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:48,755
To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the beach.

38
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:49,565
Huh?!

39
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,266
I think you might've been too honest.

40
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:54,087
Whatever. It's hot, I burn, and sand gets everywhere.

41
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,201
I couldn't agree more. I prefer to be indoors, myself.

42
00:02:57,249 --> 00:03:00,164
If that's true, then why agree
to come out to a beach with us?

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,656
I have my reasons!

44
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,638
Primarily, I don't have a whole lot going on this summer.

45
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:07,942
On top of that, my manager asked
me if I would look after Shouta.

46
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:11,342
I figured going along with you
guys was the path of least resistance.

47
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,456
Wait, I get it. This is a tsundere thing, am I right?

48
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,548
Not even a little.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,548
I wanna go play now, please.

50
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,240
Oh, right, gotcha. Just a sec.

51
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,279
Uhh...

52
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,165
Sunscreen! First things first!

53
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,908
"I'm an inferior human 'cause my skin
gets damaged by the sun without this stuff!"

54
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,327
Okay, let me start with you, Miss Kobayashi!

55
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:32,880
Get weird and get fired.

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,171
Here you go, Shouta, baby. You don't mind, do you?

57
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,538
Perfect. Have at it!

58
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:41,309
C'mon.

59
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:46,746
No, I can't!

60
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:49,581
Boo. Then let's switch!

61
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:59,884
All right. Is that good?

62
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,625
What? Is what good?!

63
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,008
Am I coating you good?

64
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:06,945
I knew it. You are a demon!

65
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,386
Why...?

66
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:11,795
Bad demon, bad! Stop trying to seduce me!

67
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,295
Lucoa, um...

68
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,331
At this point, you might as well
start acting like you're a demon.

69
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,960
I want to play now, please.

70
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,715
How about watermelon splitting?

71
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,525
I'm in.

72
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,393
Go a little farther right!

73
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:24,737
No, too far, too far. Go back left.

74
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:28,490
Go straight. That's right. Okay, stop.

75
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,455
Yay.

76
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,838
Good job, Kanna!

77
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:39,168
You obliterated every last trace of it.

78
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:41,157
Well. Whaddaya gonna do?

79
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:42,797
I wanna swim, now!

80
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,791
Heck yeah. I wanna swim, too!

81
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,940
Hey, be sure that you don't go too far out.

82
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:48,623
What? How come?

83
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,907
It's dangerous.

84
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:53,206
Yeah. I guess you're right about that, so okay.

85
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:54,140
Not too far.

86
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,940
I still remember that time Leviathan
almost killed me, and I don't want that.

87
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,123
What did you do?

88
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,580
I was too far away to see him clearly,
so I accidentally called him Rahab.

89
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:03,940
Why, you...!

90
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:06,796
My point was less dragon rage and more, "don't drown."

91
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:10,665
Oh, yeah, I totally forgot humans don't
have the ability to breathe under water.

92
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,290
Stupid and inferior.

93
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,745
You can breathe under water?

94
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:14,886
Well, of course!

95
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:17,783
There's nothing like swimming
to your heart's content, you know?

96
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:19,666
What, does she have gills now?

97
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,831
Lady Tohru, let's race to the area there.

98
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,687
Sure, I think that's reasonable.

99
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,123
Do you mind giving us the signal, Miss Kobayashi?

100
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:30,925
Okay. On your marks, get set.

101
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,183
Go!

102
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,184
I forgot to remind them to hold back.

103
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,998
Not too bad, Kanna.

104
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,684
Impressive, Lady Tohru.

105
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,169
I win!

106
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:46,405
That was too far!

107
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,887
We know. We're sorry.

108
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,677
Well, it's whatever. Are you ready for lunch?

109
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:55,503
Yeah!

110
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,379
Thank you. It was delicious!

111
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:02,331
What's next, Lady Tohru?

112
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,331
I dunno.

113
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,797
Miss Kobayashi, what do you...

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,380
What's wrong, Miss Kobayashi?

115
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,915
Oh. Nothing.

116
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,456
Just realized that old man hasn't
changed much since the last time I saw him.

117
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,402
When was that?

118
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,807
Back when I was a little kid.

119
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:19,342
I used to come to this beach with my family a lot.

120
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:22,949
Family...

121
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,373
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

122
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,177
You okay?

123
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,100
Hmm?

124
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:32,938
I'm fine.

125
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,055
Miss Kobayashi?

126
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:36,556
Hmm?

127
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,475
Could you please tell me more about your family?

128
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:42,142
I mean, that is if you don't mind telling me.

129
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:42,736
Huh?

130
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,093
I'd appreciate it.

131
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:48,089
Yeah, okay, sure.

132
00:06:48,812 --> 00:06:50,187
I think we were a normal family.

133
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,757
Y'know, for the most part.

134
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:53,948
I felt like I was raised normally, at least.

135
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,937
They got me through college, so I can't complain.

136
00:06:57,278 --> 00:07:00,007
After that, though, I left home to go to work.

137
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,747
I call my parents every now and then to catch up.

138
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,893
Tell 'em how I'm doing, stuff like that.

139
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:08,563
I, uh, I haven't seen them in a while now, though.

140
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:14,196
And is that considered normal
for a human family in this world?

141
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,227
I guess.

142
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,223
Normal, huh?

143
00:07:17,745 --> 00:07:20,416
Then, why would she welcome a dragon into her home?

144
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:25,851
And if she's from a normal family, why aren't
most humans as accepting as Miss Kobayashi?

145
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,191
I don't get it.

146
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,133
Maybe I'm wrong.

147
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,788
Maybe humans of this world actually could accept dragons.

148
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:36,702
Kill them! Humans are evil!

149
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,770
Kill them all!

150
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,103
You sure you're okay?

151
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:44,915
Yeah. Don't worry.

152
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,921
I'm fine! I just, I feel listless today.

153
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:55,919
I'm not used to having low energy.

154
00:07:59,052 --> 00:07:59,581
Tohru.

155
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:00,084
Uh?

156
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,529
Can I ride you?

157
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,641
This is incredible!

158
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm glad you're having fun! I am, too!

159
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,057
All right.

160
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:34,421
Tohru.

161
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:36,931
Do you think you're starting to get homesick?

162
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,331
No, not particularly.

163
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,078
Well, that makes one of us, then.

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,439
Thanks to our discussion, I feel
like I need to go visit my parents.

165
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:47,181
I'd like to see my parents every now and then.

166
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,651
But it's no big deal.

167
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,306
No? Then what's really bugging you?

168
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,452
I thought for a second about
introducing you to my parents.

169
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,029
You can do that if you want.

170
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,394
No, I can't.

171
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,037
Why not?

172
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,132
Because I'm pretty sure they'd kill you.

173
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:13,051
Does seem excessive, but, that's most
likely just common sense in your world, huh?

174
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:14,289
For sure.

175
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,454
From my parents' point of view, I'm
about as far from normal as you can get.

176
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:21,186
They don't think I have any common sense to speak of.

177
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,576
It's makes me sad.

178
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:24,603
Hmm...

179
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:32,053
Talking to Tohru about this kind of stuff
is intense. And yeah. That makes me sad, too.

180
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:38,377
Certainly drives home the difference between
understanding words and understanding each other.

181
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,645
I've never really considered how
completely different our worlds are.

182
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:49,803
Although, I bet that's why I always feel like I need
to cherish the time we get to spend together so much.

183
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,485
You know what?

184
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,208
That sounds an awful lot like independence to me.

185
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,956
Independence?

186
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,427
Yep. You've developed your
own unique set of values, Tohru.

187
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:03,940
So then, you mean I've become an adult?

188
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:08,237
Who knows? I'm not even sure about me.

189
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:11,143
Most people don't try to become adults, they just reach a

190
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,131
point where they realize they
can't stay children any longer.

191
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:16,819
Ooh, that's deep, Miss Kobayashi!

192
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:18,601
Got one!

193
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,799
Tiny...

194
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,490
Ready to head back?

195
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:31,361
Sure!

196
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,385
Dragon fireworks?

197
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:47,345
That's right.

198
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,429
Won 'em in a lottery at the shopping district.

199
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:03,185
That's it?

200
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:03,756
Yep.

201
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,665
A real dragon is way cooler than that crap!

202
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,349
Very impressive, Lady Tohru.

203
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,999
See! See!

204
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,956
How's that, Miss Kobayashi, how's that?!

205
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:26,518
What?

206
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,989
I can't understand anything you're saying right now.

207
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,019
What on Earth is that?

208
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,248
The admission line for Comiket.

209
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:47,023
And the reason we're around all these
people is to provide cover for Mister Takiya?

210
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,976
Not cover. We just came to help.

211
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:51,679
Apparently, his other two assistants collapsed.

212
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,901
Ooh, I'm all over this!

213
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,659
With my power, I'll be able
to exterminate them in no time!

214
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:56,422
Do not.

215
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,189
By the way, was leaving Kanna behind a good idea?

216
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,278
There's a lot of stuff here children shouldn't see.

217
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,690
Thanks, guys! You're saving me! I'm screwed without help.

218
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,145
It's cool. I kinda owe you a few anyway.

219
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,379
I would have thought you'd ask
Fafnir to help you out with this.

220
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,906
Uh, he's participating as a circle.

221
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,231
Huh?!

222
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:20,017
What? He's a circle?

223
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:20,866
Sorta?

224
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,856
A circle's a group of people like us.

225
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,790
We sell the art we make to other fans.

226
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:25,737
It's way fun.

227
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:26,920
That makes sense.

228
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,520
But why would Fafnir ever do anything like that?

229
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,406
I recommended all kinds of anime and games to him.

230
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:34,821
At some point he started drawing his own.

231
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:37,538
He really seems to be getting into this world.

232
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:39,479
Kobayashi, you can handle sales.

233
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,368
Tohru, I'd really appreciate it
if you could deal with the line.

234
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,535
Sure thing.

235
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:46,214
Hmph. All right. Fine.

236
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:53,991
Attention, Ladies and Gentlemen, as of this moment,
the third day of Comic Market has officially begun!

237
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,605
Guys? What's going on?

238
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,605
No running in the hall, please.

239
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,486
Please do not run.

240
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:06,988
This is bizarre.

241
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,253
It's like they can all barely contain themselves!

242
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,965
Something powerful is holding back their selfish desires.

243
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:14,409
What in the world?

244
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,123
The new one, please.

245
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:17,134
Cash or charge?

246
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,724
Cash! Thank you very much.

247
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,237
The new and the previous one, please.

248
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:24,462
The end of the line for <i>Water
Dragon Shrine</i> starts right here!

249
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,116
Up there, could you guys group closer together, please?

250
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:34,945
Hard to believe tens of thousands
of individuals are able to take

251
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:38,520
such unified actions without
any prior exercises or training.

252
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,481
An extremely powerful energy must be at work.

253
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,008
Uh, excuse me.

254
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:43,985
Who, me?

255
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,107
Yeah, are you, by chance, a cosplayer?

256
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,540
No, by choice, I'm not.

257
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,266
Right, gotcha. I'm sorry. Well, you look awesome.

258
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,514
I figured you were from abroad or something.

259
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:55,121
I happen to be a real maid wearing a uniform.

260
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:58,472
Uh. Oh, I get it now. You're just in character.

261
00:13:58,731 --> 00:13:59,622
How fun!

262
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:01,983
You're wrong. I'm the real deal.

263
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,114
Hey, I understand. It's policy.

264
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,227
If you don't mind, I promise to come
by and take your picture later, okay?

265
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:09,101
No, wait! I told you that I'm real!

266
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,426
The end of the line for <i>Water Dragon Shrine</i> starts here!

267
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,034
These people are passionate.

268
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,788
Meanwhile, I'm over here feeling like

269
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,455
I'm in a firedrake's stomach.

270
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,037
Thank you, sir. Have a good one!

271
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:26,492
I can't believe it's this insane.

272
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,171
Comiket is not to be underestimated.

273
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,814
Still, though...

274
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,815
What in the world could be attracting this
many people and keeping them all in check?

275
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:38,419
It's beyond me... and kinda terrifying.

276
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:39,554
Tohru!

277
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,292
Oh?

278
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,165
Thank you so much for your help!

279
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,382
Need a drink?

280
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,193
I've been waiting for this!

281
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:53,442
Bug collecting.

282
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:02,148
Cicada...

283
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:02,898
...is...

284
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,366
...very...

285
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,723
...crunchy.

286
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,292
Let's see...

287
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,054
We should be getting close.

288
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:14,245
What are you looking for?

289
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:15,815
Trying to find Fafnir.

290
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:19,134
I figured I should stop by and
say hi while I'm on my break.

291
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,173
If you say anything, I'll kill you.

292
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,880
Don't be fussy. Besides, you're the one who looks dead.

293
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,940
It's no fun, but this is what it's like for first-timers.

294
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:33,936
Mind if I, um, look at your book?

295
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:36,050
Heh. Help yourself.

296
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:38,392
"Curse Anthology."

297
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,778
You... Fafnir!

298
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,330
You've printed real, effective curses!

299
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,513
You even tell how to inflict them!

300
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,645
You could curse someone to death if you read this aloud!

301
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,706
You what?

302
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:52,710
That's all you're charging?!

303
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,540
Wow, talk about a bargain.

304
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:57,836
So, uh, maybe... you shouldn't be selling that to people.

305
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:02,981
There are so many cosplayers here.

306
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:05,606
I think that's my favorite part. It's fun to watch.

307
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,783
You'd be surprised how many races from
my world are represented by these humans.

308
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,495
For them, it's more about pretending
to be characters from anime and manga.

309
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,273
If you wanted to, you could totally do that.

310
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:18,165
I am a proper maid, thank you!

311
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,321
No matter how you dress me up, I
will always be your loyal sex slave.

312
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,249
Uh... That's not proper or maid.

313
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,039
What's up?

314
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,867
There's a goblin, a witch, and a sahuagin over there.

315
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:31,401
Wonder what they're from.

316
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:33,445
Nothing. They're real.

317
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:33,944
Huh?

318
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:37,246
They're not dressed up in costumes, and they're not human.

319
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:37,924
Huh?!

320
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:42,126
Excuse me? Yes, hello. I just had a
real quick question for the three of you.

321
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,581
Oh, hi. Can I assume you're like us?

322
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:47,308
Yes. I was wondering what you're doing here?

323
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,993
I like to come to these to spread my wings.

324
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:51,136
Same here.

325
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:53,411
I normally live my life disguised as a human.

326
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:57,589
But being able to come to events like
this gives me a chance to enjoy my real form.

327
00:16:57,648 --> 00:16:58,803
I see that.

328
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:00,986
Why not take a chance and join us, dear?

329
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,106
You can let your real form be seen while also being safe!

330
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,176
No. That'd be impossible.

331
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:07,470
I mean, I'm a dragon.

332
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,038
Dragon?!

333
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:10,696
Yes?

334
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,231
You're a real damn monster?

335
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:13,147
I guess?

336
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,862
And you... You could eat us all if you wanted?

337
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:16,775
Huh?

338
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:17,781
Run!

339
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:19,046
No running!

340
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,382
Dragons must do some crazy stuff.

341
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:22,946
Don't believe them...

342
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,422
Huh?

343
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:27,273
When dragons get hungry, we only
eat as much as necessary to survive.

344
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,884
And this world is survival of the fittest anyway!

345
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:32,331
So you're not denying anything, just explaining it?

346
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,879
Hey, you! Could you come with me, please?

347
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,623
You're costume's too skimpy.

348
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,791
Did you not read the participant's guide?

349
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,610
I didn't expect Lucoa to show up.

350
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:41,270
Hey...

351
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:43,241
Skimpy is as skimpy does.

352
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,264
Now that I look closer, there's more than I first thought.

353
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,999
Beings in their true form, I mean.

354
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:49,181
Are there a lot?

355
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:50,078
Yes.

356
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:53,956
Those that've had a greater presence
while they were here have left records

357
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:56,780
of their stays in this world on
several different levels for tourists.

358
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,466
Like Fafnir and Lucoa. I'm sure you've heard of some.

359
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:14,265
I, umm... I think...

360
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,043
Hmm?

361
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:23,339
I think, that... I wanna be in my real form.

362
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,215
At least partly, just for a bit.

363
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:27,604
Please...?

364
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,186
As long as you can do it and stay out of trouble.

365
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,551
It's fine with me.

366
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,003
Sorry that took so long!

367
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,942
Can I take your picture like that?

368
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:49,648
Yes!

369
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,862
Excuse me! Can I take one, too?

370
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:56,548
Hey, me, too!

371
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:57,223
Uh?

372
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,956
Over here! Can you look this way please?

373
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:03,219
Look over here, next, please!

374
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:04,744
Crap, our break's almost over.

375
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,126
Stay there and just move your head this way!

376
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:06,713
Oh, well.

377
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:11,213
See? Told ya! I came for your pic like I promised!

378
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:14,462
Right. Hello. How's it going?

379
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:15,851
Uh, to be honest,

380
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,657
it's been going pretty rough for me.

381
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,411
But I'm hanging in there!

382
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:21,374
Hey, so.

383
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,540
From my perspective, it seems like everyone in this place

384
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,197
has been drawn here by something with a lot of power.

385
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,432
Do you have any idea what that something might be?

386
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:31,122
Uh...

387
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:39,081
I'm not sure, but uh... Well, it's for sure special.

388
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:40,904
And it's only right here in this moment.

389
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:42,669
Might as well make the most of it.

390
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,902
Whatever this is, it's making a lot of people happy.

391
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:50,307
Hmm?

392
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,089
Yes, you're right.

393
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,639
Might as well make the most of it.

394
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:04,523
Hey, buddy.

395
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,206
Will you take the picture already?

396
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,479
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

397
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,193
Uh-oh! Geh!

398
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,654
Don't tell me there's another line forming?

399
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,022
As of right now,

400
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,955
Comic Market 90 is officially over.

401
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,706
Thank you everyone for your participation.

402
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:25,178
We hope to see you all again in the winter
for the next epic Comiket! Thank you again!

403
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:28,119
I'm back.

404
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:30,630
You survived!

405
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,673
And don't worry, we managed fine without you after lunch.

406
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:35,331
I'm so sorry.

407
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:37,565
I honestly never intended to ditch you.

408
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,709
I know, it's fine.

409
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:44,296
Oh, hey, Fafnir, how'd your book sell?

410
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:47,075
Apparently, not all that well.

411
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,065
All right, so what did you
think of your first ever Comiket?

412
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:54,052
Hmm? Well, let's see...

413
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,074
Mainly, it just reconfirmed my love for you,

414
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:01,317
Miss Kobayashi.

415
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,076
Huh?

416
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:07,891
Thank you, ladies! You were a huge help
today. Like, the best assistants ever!

417
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,409
And if it's no trouble, I'd
love your help again this winter!

418
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,040
Hell no, I'm done with this!

419
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:13,891
Huh...?

420
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,147
What do you think we should print for our next thin book?

421
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,833
How about a dragon maid girl?

422
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:22,071
That sounds great!

423
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,724
So they gave you "free studies"?

424
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:30,431
Mm-hmm. It's my summer homework.

425
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,273
What do you think I should do?

426
00:21:32,372 --> 00:21:33,789
Well, if I were you.

427
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:36,380
I would probably choose something mysterious.

428
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,560
Something that I'd like to know more
about so I didn't get bored with it.

429
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,615
Okay. That makes sense.

430
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,194
Whatcha doing, Kanna?

431
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,646
Studying you. Act natural.

432
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:50,785
Huh?

433
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:29,761
You know, Kobayashi, there's a lot
of talk about Tohru on the Internet.

434
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:30,695
Yeah, I bet.

435
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:34,248
They mentioned you, too. They said
there was a sales lady with dead-fish eyes.

436
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,349
Sorry 'bout that.

437
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:36,885
And they got turned on by those eyes.

438
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,182
And now I'm creeped out.
