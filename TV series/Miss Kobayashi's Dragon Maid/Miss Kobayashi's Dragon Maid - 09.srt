1
00:00:09,152 --> 00:00:11,087
The sports festival is coming up soon.

2
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:15,087
Be sure you give that information I just
handed out to your parents, okay, kids?

3
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:18,512
Hey, Saikawa?

4
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:20,262
What's this sports festival thing?

5
00:00:20,345 --> 00:00:23,329
Hold up. Are you telling me you
didn't have them where you're from?

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:27,303
Oh, my gosh, a sports festival is,
like, one of the most fun things ever.

7
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,345
There's running.

8
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:29,293
Running?

9
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:30,553
Ball-tossing.

10
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:31,688
Ball-tossing?

11
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:32,987
Tug-of-War.

12
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,075
Tug-of-War?

13
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,595
Yeah, and lots of other events where
the whole class teams up together!

14
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:41,095
Our parents get to come and watch for the whole day, too!

15
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:43,324
Like, you get to eat lunch with them and everything!

16
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:45,884
And you're, like, the best at sports,

17
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:48,290
so I bet you'll win it all and be the hero of the day!

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,428
I mean, your mom's gonna be
beyond proud of you after this!

19
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,237
Gotta work that day. Can't.

20
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,845
Kobayashi... Take the day off for me...

21
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,543
Please...?

22
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,971
Sorry, I can't do that.

23
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:38,690
Kanna, Miss Kobayashi's in the middle of her
death march and on the verge of facing Hades.

24
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:39,869
Give it up already.

25
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:40,993
No!

26
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,123
Also, what's a sports festival?

27
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,003
It's when you train alongside your
peers to defeat strong opponents.

28
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:49,970
No, I think that's a bit exaggerated.

29
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,671
Defeat Hades fast, Kobayashi!

30
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:55,702
Then you can come watch me.

31
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,278
Don't be so selfish.

32
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,570
Besides, I'll come with you to watch the sports.

33
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:00,662
No...

34
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,076
Why's it gotta be Miss Kobayashi, anyway?

35
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,562
What am I, chopped liver?

36
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:10,891
No, it's not you, it's just that Saikawa said
our parents could come with us for the day.

37
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:12,542
You're like my big sister.

38
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,355
Kobayashi's like a mom.

39
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,891
Reminder: I'm not old enough to be Kanna's mom.

40
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,731
Although...

41
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:24,460
Some of my classmates do have kids already.

42
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,884
Miss Kobayashi, you hang in there!

43
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,804
At any rate, I can't go.

44
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,033
Sorry, but you'll have to make do with Tohru.

45
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,251
Great. "Make do."

46
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,370
Forget it!

47
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:34,823
Ah, Kanna!

48
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,493
I never thought a parent showing
up or not was that big of a deal.

49
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,803
To start off with, it's not like I'm Kanna's
mother. I'm just a random human she met.

50
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,293
I don't think that matters to her much

51
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,164
because she's been treating you
like a mom-type figure for a while now.

52
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,006
But why?

53
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,831
I can barely be around people.
How could I be a good mother?

54
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:56,260
This is stupid.

55
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:59,212
I never had both my parents make it to sports festivals.

56
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,843
They were always too busy working.

57
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:04,527
I never got upset, either. I knew they had to support us.

58
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,866
Well, Kanna's parents basically gave her free rein.

59
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:10,858
They felt a dragon would grow up strong all on its own.

60
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:13,381
Since she bears the name Kanna Kamui,

61
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:16,580
I'm sure they told her she had
to make sure to be super strong.

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,741
But what she wanted was her parents' attention,

63
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,207
which is why she pulled all those silly pranks.

64
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,497
It just got her banished to this world.

65
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,345
Makes sense she'd want you to spoil
her and give her that attention, now.

66
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:32,686
I get what you're saying, but I still just...

67
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:42,209
Hey, good morning, Kanna. Something wrong?

68
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,569
Kobayashi won't come to the sports festival.

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,132
Really? Wow. It's okay.

70
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,189
There's way more to the day than just parents!

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,652
We get to work together with the
whole class to win, and that's super fun.

72
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:55,306
It does sound fun.

73
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,122
Except your version of "work
together" and ours is totally different.

74
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:01,241
You shut up! No one asked you!

75
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,717
No one has to ask me for my opinion for me to give it.

76
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:04,997
Why are you still talking?!

77
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,395
Oh, my god, shut up!

78
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:08,217
Sports festival?

79
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:12,712
Bad luck that it falls directly
on our delivery deadline day, huh?

80
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:17,147
Yeah, but I'm kinda not sure if there's
really any need for me to go in the first place.

81
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:18,415
Do you not wanna go?

82
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,662
Hmm... No, it's not that.

83
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,648
But I think it would be nice if I could go.

84
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,573
Hmm? What is it?

85
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:29,479
Oh, you know, just my first time seeing
you worry about something like this.

86
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:30,971
Seriously?

87
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,342
Hmm. Oh. I guess so.

88
00:05:35,262 --> 00:05:39,174
Well, I think it's more a question of
do you want to go, rather than can you go.

89
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,163
So do I want to go?

90
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:47,772
La, la, la, I'm the cutest, most
adorable maid forever and ever!

91
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,136
Hey, I'm home.

92
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:53,032
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

93
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,553
Kanna, are you still in a bad mood?

94
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:57,608
You should let it go.

95
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,051
Lady Tohru. Perception block me.

96
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,624
Use perception block on me.

97
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,906
I'm back, guys.

98
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,303
Welcome home.

99
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,314
I'll get your dinner ready.

100
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:43,637
Kobayashi?

101
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,667
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:47,961
Coming to the sports festival, I mean.

103
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,829
It'll still be fun to be able to
work together with everyone in my class.

104
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:56,217
It's fine. And I hope you make your deadline okay.

105
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,891
Oh. Thanks.

106
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:58,860
Good night.

107
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:03,370
So, um...

108
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:07,966
Kanna might have used my perception blocking
to go secretly observe you at your work today.

109
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,335
I know I've felt like this before.

110
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,661
Right. It's guilt.

111
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,396
Just like with Tohru.

112
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,634
Tohru.

113
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:23,716
That's me.

114
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,942
Starting tomorrow, I'll be getting home even later.

115
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:28,507
Do you mean...?

116
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:31,706
Okay!

117
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,990
35! 36! 37!

118
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,833
38! 39! 40...

119
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,177
'Kay! Great work, kids, but that's enough for today.

120
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,595
You should all be so proud of yourselves!

121
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,613
Look at how long you can jump, now!

122
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:23,292
All we have to do is keep this up,
and we'll win the sports festival, easy!

123
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:24,466
Yeah!

124
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,916
Kanna, we're not gonna let 'em down, are we?

125
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:28,917
No way.

126
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,380
You're tearing it up.

127
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:36,205
Trying.

128
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,618
Going to the sports festival, then?

129
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,585
Decide that you want to go?

130
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:44,785
Nope. Decided that I ought to go.

131
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,139
Lemme help. Tell me whatcha need.

132
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,470
Thanks. You're awesome.

133
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:55,511
I know.

134
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,337
And, next drinking night is on you.

135
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,663
Yes, it is.

136
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:11,796
I'll be there tomorrow.

137
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,833
Really?

138
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:16,602
Yep, really.

139
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,515
You beat Hades already?

140
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,394
Mm-hmm. I sure did.

141
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,267
I love you, Kobayashi!

142
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:26,857
That's so cute.

143
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,226
I forget she's still just a child.

144
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:36,727
What do they expect me to do?

145
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,219
What do I do...?

146
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,133
I could go for both!

147
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:44,352
No, that would go over my daily limit! I can't!

148
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,923
But, still...

149
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,249
Oh, god...

150
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,825
Look, ma'am. We really need you to make a decision.

151
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,953
Yes, I know that! I'm trying to!

152
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:04,109
Welcome to the 43rd annual
Oborozuka Elementary Sports Festival!

153
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,712
The events will begin now!

154
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:09,428
First up on the program is the opening parade!

155
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,870
Oh, look! There's Kanna!

156
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,101
Where? I don't see her.

157
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,428
She's looking our way.

158
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,499
Hey!

159
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,965
Yeah, I bet she wants to make sure that I showed up.

160
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,831
Riko!

161
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,303
Little Miss!

162
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:36,282
You're gonna do great!

163
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,583
Shouta, baby!

164
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,020
Oh, Miss Lucoa's here, too.

165
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,139
I'll be right here cheering for you! Hooray, Shouta!

166
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:51,671
The pledge: We athletes hereby pledge
to honor the spirit of good sportsmanship

167
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:57,035
and compete fair and square with all
participants until the very end of the competition!

168
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,952
Fifth on today's program is the
three-legged race by the third graders.

169
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,917
You can do it, Kanna!

170
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,251
No pressure, though!

171
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,487
Riko! You've got this!

172
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,817
Do your best!

173
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,139
Ready...

174
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,722
Um, okay, let's tie our legs together, now.

175
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:22,715
Done.

176
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:25,101
Yeah, thank you, Kanna. You're the best.

177
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:27,428
Still have to hold on to each other's shoulders.

178
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,243
Okay, next pair.

179
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,358
Come on, Saikawa. It's our turn to go.

180
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,484
I-I'm so sorry, Kanna.

181
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,678
I was just way too happy.

182
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:46,307
That's all right, Saikawa.

183
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:47,778
We're gonna get 'em next time.

184
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:50,338
Jeez, Riko, what are you doing out there?

185
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:56,181
Seventh on our program today is
the fifth graders' treasure hunt.

186
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,657
What? You want me?

187
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,320
Yep. Perfect.

188
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,918
Shouta, your older sister's incredible!

189
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,264
Mm... Yeah...

190
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,351
We'll now be taking a break for lunch.

191
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:25,369
Students and parents, please enjoy your time together!

192
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,563
Everyone make sure you're careful of heat
stroke and drinking lots and lots of water.

193
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,141
We'll see you back in a bit!

194
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:34,554
Oh, my gosh! This looks yummy!

195
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:35,563
Yeah, it does.

196
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,300
I'm not just your everyday dragon maid!

197
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:40,470
Thank you.

198
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,246
Lady Tohru, it's good.

199
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:45,783
Thank you for saying so.

200
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,283
Miss Kobayashi?

201
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:48,878
Say, "ah."

202
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:51,381
Tohru... What kind of meat is that?

203
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:52,657
Knew it.

204
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,092
Yeah, this lunch really is especially tasty.

205
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,379
I'm glad you like it.

206
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,779
Eat enough to make sure you have lots of energy!

207
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,788
We'll turn things around after this.

208
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,889
What do they expect me to do?

209
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,812
What do I do?

210
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:21,537
How am I supposed to choose just one
from over ten different combinations?

211
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:24,423
I could go for variations of 'em all!

212
00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:26,710
No, then I wouldn't last.

213
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:28,418
But, still...

214
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,501
Oh, god!

215
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,884
There's the pumpkin and sweet potato.

216
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:35,929
But chestnut's hard to pass.

217
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:38,980
The surprising pairing of grape
and pear would be good, wouldn't it?

218
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,422
No, wait. Chestnut.

219
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:45,685
It's now time to start today's afternoon segment.

220
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,237
Coming up 15th in our program,

221
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,141
we have the third graders' jump rope.

222
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,634
Everyone ready?

223
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,229
And... go!

224
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:55,169
1!

225
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:56,031
2!

226
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:56,918
3!

227
00:13:57,221 --> 00:13:57,887
4!

228
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,669
Go, Kanna!

229
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,055
Jump, Kanna, jump!

230
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,137
Riko, keep those feet up!

231
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,156
Do your best, Little Miss!

232
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,553
22!

233
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:07,669
23!

234
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:12,197
Classes 1 and 4 have tripped on their ropes!

235
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,721
42.

236
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:14,689
43.

237
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:17,070
Uh-oh, Class 3 has tripped on their rope, now!

238
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:19,534
But watch Class 2! They're still going strong!

239
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:20,597
55.

240
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:21,454
56.

241
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:22,517
57.

242
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:23,573
58.

243
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:24,770
Keep on jumping!

244
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,123
Don't stop, now!

245
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:27,851
Finished!

246
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,425
Class 3-2 wins!

247
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:33,002
Did you see that? We just won!

248
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,204
Talk about impressive.

249
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,612
Nineteenth on today's program,

250
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,863
the fifth grade boys' calvalry battle.

251
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,697
Shouta, baby! You can do it!

252
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,640
Kick their tushies!

253
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:52,189
Begin!

254
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,352
Hooray! Go, Shouta!

255
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,178
Get 'em, baby!

256
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,792
Take 'em down!

257
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,288
Finished!

258
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,428
Class 3 with an overwhelming victory!

259
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:12,695
Shouta, you're so lucky!

260
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,137
Your sister's awesome!

261
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,455
Mm. Yeah.

262
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,945
Now for our 20th event,

263
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,931
the third graders' tug of war!

264
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:23,572
Class 1 and 2. Ready?

265
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:27,245
Go!

266
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,811
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

267
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:31,443
Come on, Kanna!

268
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:32,744
Win the tug of war!

269
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:33,919
Focus, sweetie!

270
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:34,902
Do your best!

271
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:40,755
Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho! Heave ho!

272
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:46,948
The winner is...

273
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:48,893
...Class Two! Congrats!

274
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,512
Saikawa, can you believe? We won it!

275
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,595
Hooray!

276
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,602
Yeah! She's doing amazing!

277
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,006
Keep up that winning pace, kiddos!

278
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:35,228
Kanna's class has made it
all the way up to second place.

279
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:37,112
First after this game.

280
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,735
Ooh! It's about to start!

281
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:43,211
Thirty-second in today's
program, the third graders' relay!

282
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:45,644
Hey, Kanna.

283
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:47,634
If we take first place here, we'll win!

284
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,057
This will be the final event for the third graders.

285
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:57,184
Family and friends, they're going to
need your support now more than ever!

286
00:16:58,095 --> 00:16:59,436
First female runners.

287
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:00,809
Take position!

288
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:02,153
Ready...

289
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:05,540
Go, Iida! Get it!

290
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:06,866
You can do it, Iida!

291
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:09,736
All the classes have started strong.

292
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,381
Right now, Class 1 holds the lead.

293
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:15,767
Behind them are Class 2, 4, and 3 bringing up the rear.

294
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:21,127
The baton's passed to the second runner.

295
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:23,360
Makishima, keep up the pace!

296
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:26,240
Saikawa, you're gonna do great!

297
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:27,391
Well, yeah.

298
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:29,835
I'll be passing you the baton from first place!

299
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,422
What a race!

300
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,762
Class 1 and 2 are currently neck and neck!

301
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,580
Good job, ladies! Keep it up!

302
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,565
Here, I, go!

303
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,276
Wow, Class 2 is closing in fast.

304
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,495
And now they've passed Class 1!

305
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,403
Oh, no! What a disappointment.

306
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,268
Class 2 dropped the baton!

307
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,375
Class 1 is back in the lead.

308
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,518
Behind them are Class 4, then 3, and last place is 2.

309
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,927
I'm sorry!

310
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,029
I got this!

311
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,351
The anchors are all fighting for the win,

312
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,095
but look at Class 2 go!

313
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,412
She's passing the others with no problem.

314
00:18:50,682 --> 00:18:51,801
She's so fast.

315
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:55,975
Just one more!

316
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,216
You can do it!

317
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,936
Kanna!

318
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:05,918
Finish!

319
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,632
The winner: Class 2!

320
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,845
You're the best, Kanna!

321
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:18,559
I'm not kidding. That was incredible!

322
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,861
You were so cool!

323
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:23,278
Kanna!

324
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:24,256
You licked me!

325
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,010
But, um... I'm sorry.

326
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,772
I messed up real bad...

327
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:34,451
No, you kept running. If you'd given up,
there's no way I could've passed all of them.

328
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,203
Thanks for being such a good teammate.

329
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,933
Oh, Kanna!

330
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,270
Here you go. You were so good.

331
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,981
Thanks. I had a lot of fun.

332
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,272
You worked hard out there, too.

333
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,349
I know. Everyone in our class worked
hard, that's why we were able to win.

334
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:21,653
I imagine it's less than satisfying not
being able to go full out like you normally do.

335
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,061
No, it was fine.

336
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:25,172
I like being with the other kids.

337
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:27,823
Kobayashi.

338
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,802
Thank you so much for coming today, really.

339
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:38,059
You are very welcome.

340
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,004
And thank you for lunch, Lady Tohru.

341
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,262
No problem! Heh! It was hardly anything.

342
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:50,087
Participating in a sports festival as a guardian?

343
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:52,845
What in the world have I become?

344
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,134
And when did this change even happen?

345
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:04,236
Although, I suppose it would be rather
nice to let loose a little bit more today.

346
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:05,694
I agree.

347
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:08,152
I'm so down. It's been too long.

348
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,708
Let's get to it, then.

349
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,333
Hey, I wanna play, too!

350
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,741
Oh, how fun!

351
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,337
All three of us together!

352
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,703
That okay, Miss Kobayashi?

353
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:20,837
Yeah, sure, as long as you go
where you don't bother anyone.

354
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,853
Lady Tohru, where should we go?

355
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,192
Let's use the same place we did last time.

356
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,851
Oh, dragons.

357
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:39,792
Which should I choose...?

358
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:41,907
Which should I choose?

359
00:21:42,303 --> 00:21:43,917
Which should I choose?!

360
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,479
Which?!

361
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,763
Why?!

362
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,884
Why must the stupid products of man trouble me so?!

363
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,491
Humans are just...

364
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:54,872
...terrifying.

365
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:29,883
I'm the maid Georgie, servant of the Saikawa family.

366
00:23:29,938 --> 00:23:31,278
I'm Shouta's familiar.

367
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:32,668
You can just call me Lucoa.

368
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,595
Familiar?

369
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:34,386
Yeah.

370
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:37,262
It seems we both have somewhat unique hobbies, huh?

371
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:38,182
Yeah.
