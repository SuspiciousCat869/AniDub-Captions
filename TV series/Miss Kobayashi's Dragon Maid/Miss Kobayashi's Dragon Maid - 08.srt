1
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,592
Kobayashi?

2
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:13,360
Here.

3
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:18,163
A bento lunch?

4
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:20,551
Mm-hmm. It's for next week.

5
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:22,021
I've got a field trip.

6
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,402
Oh!

7
00:00:23,613 --> 00:00:24,410
Make one!

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,297
Okay. What kind of food do you prefer?

9
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:30,296
Don't worry about that, Miss Kobayashi.

10
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,159
I can take care of it.

11
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:34,874
Domestic creativity is kinda my thing!

12
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,451
Oh? Is that so?

13
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:41,380
Um, yeah. I'm only the best there ever was!

14
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:44,547
That's funny, because I'm even better than the best.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,532
Well, I'm better than "even better than the best."

16
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,303
Sure.

17
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,284
According to... you.

18
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:59,065
Care to prove your so-called
betterness, or are you scared?

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,563
Careful there, Tohru.

20
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,523
You're good, but you're not that good.

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,460
Uh-oh. An inciting incident.

22
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:10,593
It's on!

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,078
Ready to lose?

24
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,880
Three rounds!

25
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,989
Bento Lunch Competition!

26
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:59,624
Of course you guys would make a game show set for this.

27
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,009
You'll each make three dishes:

28
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:06,179
A salad, a main course, and a dessert.

29
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,224
Use all your skills. Entertain me!

30
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:13,393
What is your character even supposed to be anymore?

31
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,077
Ingredients are up to you.

32
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,093
But remember to stay within the budget as you compete.

33
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:21,506
We don't wanna strain Miss Kobayashi's wallet, do we?

34
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:23,592
Hey!

35
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:24,943
Ready?

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:27,982
Begin!

37
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,678
They both really want to win this.

38
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,426
Who knew Kobayashi cared?

39
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,738
Finished!

40
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:54,159
First dish. Complete!

41
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,484
Let's see.

42
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:59,072
Contestant Kobayashi appears
to be serving cherry tomatoes.

43
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:01,207
Did you just throw the match?

44
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:05,016
You can't possibly expect to
beat a seafood and paprika Caesar.

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,837
I mean, there's no comparison.

46
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,567
Agreed. There's no need to compare.

47
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:12,244
The winner of the salad round is...

48
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,623
...Kobayashi.

49
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:16,068
What?! How'd I lose?!

50
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,631
I can't accept this!

51
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:22,785
How could my salad extravaganza lose to two tomatoes?

52
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,330
Calm down. Allow me to explain your first round failure.

53
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:27,894
Now, then.

54
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:31,225
The problem, Contestant Tohru,
is that you were not prepared

55
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,529
because you didn't bother to find
out the definition of a bento lunch.

56
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,639
There was limited space.

57
00:04:37,597 --> 00:04:38,964
And you made too much!

58
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,011
That's all right.

59
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,588
I'll win next!

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,083
Tohru wins.

61
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,727
Bacon and eggs can't lose!

62
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,679
Hamburger's better, though.

63
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,037
But bacon and eggs are a delicious staple!

64
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,794
Hamburger's better.

65
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,411
No, it's not...

66
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:05,952
Although, when I was a kid...

67
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,132
...I always asked my parents to make burgers...

68
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,357
Last round is dessert.

69
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:12,754
Something in a cup, or a fruit would work.

70
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,270
You are to bring one item that has not been cooked.

71
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:16,326
'Kay.

72
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:19,492
Tohru.

73
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:22,453
This is rather unusual.

74
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,980
You and Kobayashi don't normally fight.

75
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:28,919
No, we don't.

76
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,474
Not ever.

77
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,649
So why...?

78
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm heading off.

79
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:37,289
Be careful.

80
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:39,820
This is deplorable.

81
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,252
What do you mean?

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,664
I love seeing Tohru like this.

83
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:46,782
It's refreshing!

84
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,806
It's the final round, oh, what am I going to get?

85
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,026
Hold on.

86
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:53,558
I know!

87
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,867
Of course. It's perfect!

88
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,536
You realize this fight only happened
because you've grown so close to each other.

89
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,755
I mean, you're fighting but
you're not, like, fighting-fighting.

90
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,311
Either way, it's not a big deal.

91
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,056
She may be a dragon maid. But she can be my friend, too.

92
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,064
Excuse me.

93
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,979
You cannot honestly believe
that you and a dragon are equals...

94
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:34,527
...human?

95
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:41,818
That's at least how Tohru and I both feel about it.

96
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,526
Probably why we fought today, too.

97
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:48,453
Good grief. Why is Tohru not back yet?

98
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,317
Close enough to fight.

99
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:57,896
This is disgusting.

100
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,552
I'm back!

101
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:08,002
Oh! Hi, Miss Kobayashi.

102
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:08,709
You're late!

103
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:09,761
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,872
I'm so not gonna lose, now!

105
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:14,801
Really?

106
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,833
Because I'm not gonna lose either.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,380
Wait. My shoes...

108
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,348
Third round complete!

109
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,843
What's that thing?

110
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,697
Why? Would you like to try some?

111
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:36,308
Wow!

112
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:37,831
That's so good!

113
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,770
What is it? Where do they sell it?

114
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,339
Um... The shopping district, I guess?

115
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,353
Did she just do what I think she did?

116
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:44,956
Yep.

117
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:46,551
It's a fruit?

118
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,250
No way. I've never seen this before.

119
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:51,607
It's official!

120
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,828
You can tell her that I won now!

121
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,076
Items from the other world are against the rules.

122
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:06,591
Oopsie...

123
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:15,078
Tohru!

124
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,002
Whew, that was awesome. Thanks.

125
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:23,576
Sure!

126
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,298
Just to be clear, your food's
always been delicious, Tohru.

127
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:29,639
Jeez, are you trying to flatter me?

128
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,675
Oh, yeah. We've got dessert!

129
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,927
What's wrong, Tohru?

130
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:58,246
Who would've thought I'd find
you hiding out here of all places...

131
00:08:58,777 --> 00:08:59,618
...Tohru!

132
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,586
Our home...

133
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,514
Have you forgotten all of our laws?!

134
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:07,165
Dragons disrupt the order of this world and are forbidden!

135
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,825
You are to return with me!

136
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,876
I see you're as boring and persistent as ever.

137
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,613
Surprise. I'm not going back.

138
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,748
Lady Tohru and Lady Elma are on very bad terms.

139
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:21,091
Yeah?

140
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,168
They're like cats and dogs.

141
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,382
Oh! Did you learn that idiom at school?

142
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:26,540
Good girl.

143
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,205
If you asked me, they look like
they're about to explode any second.

144
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,322
You think they'll be okay?

145
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:35,282
I can't say.

146
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:38,059
Last time they fought, three islands disappeared.

147
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,091
That's awful!

148
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,290
Our power may be considered equal by some...

149
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,499
...but this time, I plan on settling the score!

150
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:50,285
Her stomach just growled like no big whoop.

151
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,993
I'd be mortified, but dragons don't care about that stuff.

152
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:53,841
After all...

153
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,976
Or maybe not. She looks embarrassed.

154
00:09:57,818 --> 00:10:00,468
Shut up, human! You are being very distracting right now!

155
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:05,563
Well, you've got quite the attitude on ya
considering you just destroyed my home.

156
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,669
Maybe you should follow the laws in
this world before you try protecting it.

157
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,864
Even Tohru wouldn't do something like this.

158
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:14,177
Sorry...

159
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:14,819
Prob'ly.

160
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:16,071
I'm sorry!

161
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:20,235
Wait. Why do I always wind up doing the apologizing?!

162
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:21,457
That says a lot.

163
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,702
Hey. She doesn't seem like a bad person,

164
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,434
so why don't you all get along?

165
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:28,613
Because we're from different factions.

166
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,910
Not all dragons are united in thought.

167
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,959
There's the harmony faction that values law and order,

168
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,968
the chaos faction that yearns for chaos and destruction,

169
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,821
and the spectating faction that doesn't
work with either group or even each other.

170
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:41,407
Wow.

171
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:43,602
Elma belongs to the harmony faction.

172
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:45,963
I'm with chaos, obviously.

173
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:47,463
So we oppose each other.

174
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,035
Hold up, you're one of the villains?

175
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,325
No, no, that is not true.

176
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:55,747
I am a good dragon, and I'm on my
very best behavior in this world.

177
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,268
That sounded a bit forced.

178
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:58,585
Sorry to interrupt!

179
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:02,333
But I'm taking you home, Tohru! By force, if I must.

180
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:03,764
Yeah? Try it!

181
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:07,330
I'll eliminate you from this world
and leave no trace of your filth behind!

182
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,744
Take it somewhere else!

183
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,419
I've prepared another dimension. We can finish this there.

184
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:16,746
What's wrong?

185
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,865
Nothing.

186
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,755
I'm just surprised to see the
fiendish Tohru listening to a human.

187
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,778
What in this world happened?

188
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,035
Hurry up!

189
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,439
Hey! You cheated!

190
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:34,240
Who, me? No, I simply respected order like she wanted.

191
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,426
It was a peaceful resolution.

192
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:40,023
Now then, would you like me to fix
what she so carelessly destroyed?

193
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,024
By the way, where'd you send her?

194
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,696
The field Kanna and I played in that one time.

195
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:50,277
Oh man. Where am I?

196
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:54,609
How dare you trick me?!

197
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:56,476
You actually came back here?

198
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,010
I can't believe you sent me to another continent!

199
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,913
Can we stop this? I'm not gonna do anything.

200
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,841
I'll be happy as long as I can
quietly be a maid in this world.

201
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,743
Hey, Tohru? What's going on?

202
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,468
The freak decided to come back.

203
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:10,020
Oh, yeah, I'm the freak?!

204
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:12,577
You're planning to take over this world, just admit it!

205
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:13,892
You're wrong.

206
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,782
Shut your mouth! No more excuses!

207
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,544
Oh, you poor thing...

208
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:23,039
You haven't had any food to eat since yesterday, have you?

209
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,436
I can't...

210
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,507
I'm not from this world... so
I'm not allowed to interfere.

211
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,380
Oh.

212
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:34,983
Here, something like this should be all right, yeah?

213
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:37,374
Come on. Try some. It's cream bread.

214
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,073
Thank you...

215
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,270
I'll kindly take you up on the offer.

216
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,517
If only to restore my strength.

217
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,648
What's this?

218
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,695
It's melting in my mouth!

219
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,660
I think I just ate heaven!

220
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,184
All right. I'm energized now!

221
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,088
Time for us to have that rematch, Tohru!

222
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,270
Or you could go away.

223
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,229
If you do, I'll let you have all of these.

224
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,622
Sorry for the intrusion!

225
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,284
Too big, way too big...

226
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,316
I'm being crushed...

227
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,790
Who's this?

228
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,401
I'll be working with you starting today.

229
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,965
My name is Elma Joui.

230
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,313
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

231
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,222
No way!

232
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,574
What the heck is going on? Why are you here?

233
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,945
I could ask you the same question, human.

234
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,463
This is my work, so I get to ask stuff.

235
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,038
This cannot be just a coincidence, can it?

236
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,410
I'm investigating... It's cultural standard research.

237
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,744
I wanna see if beings from other
worlds can really integrate successfully.

238
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:12,757
That makes sense.

239
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,643
She did say you were with the harmony faction.

240
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,532
Wait, can you even do this job?

241
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,411
You know you can't use magic.

242
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,166
Don't be silly!

243
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:25,368
Trust me. I can do human labor better than any human.

244
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,761
You just watch and learn!

245
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,535
What the heck is this...?

246
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,255
I don't understand any of it.

247
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,205
What are these bizarre boxes?

248
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,985
And what is everyone doing with them?

249
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,314
Ooh! I think I did something!

250
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,520
Yeah. Try this.

251
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:44,210
Yep. Then, you push this.

252
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:46,415
Apologies, human.

253
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:48,584
You do some pretty difficult work.

254
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:53,500
But I've taken the time to memorize Romanized
character input and that kind of nonsense,

255
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,088
so I won't fall behind anymore!

256
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,096
Hope not.

257
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,635
I do have a question.

258
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:00,046
When will I receive compensation for today's labor?

259
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:03,300
Oh. That's, uh, about a month from now.

260
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,056
Do you mean to tell me I won't receive my pay tomorrow?

261
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,371
No. We total out at the end of the month,
and today's the first, so it'll be a while yet.

262
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:14,914
Then what do I do for rent and food in the meantime?

263
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,386
Well, if you commute from the other world, I...

264
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,092
Let me guess, you can't go back.

265
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,878
Right...

266
00:15:24,035 --> 00:15:28,069
I don't possess enough power to open the
gate between worlds at will like Tohru can.

267
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,813
I thought your power was equal to Tohru's.

268
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:33,952
It is. I'm just as strong as her, but in a different way.

269
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:37,344
Wait here.

270
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:44,043
I know you've got a lot on your plate, but hang in there.

271
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:47,103
If you're gonna be working with
me, I'll teach you as much as I can.

272
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:49,044
Don't want ya making my life harder.

273
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:50,794
You have my gratitude.

274
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:54,793
That's pretty hot, so be careful.

275
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,375
Later!

276
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,315
Yummy!

277
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:10,672
I probably should keep quiet about meeting Elma today.

278
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,864
Hey, guys. I'm home!

279
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,013
Welcome back!

280
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,839
Guess what we're having for dinner...

281
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:19,892
What're you doing?

282
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:22,495
There's a strange smell on you.

283
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:23,535
Is it a dog?

284
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:24,861
No, it's a dragon!

285
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,202
Are you secretly cheating on me?

286
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,502
Whatever. Look, so, today at work...

287
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,502
Wait, is it an office romance?!

288
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,629
Congrats. You've picked up another weird phrase.

289
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,662
Can't breathe... I can't breathe...

290
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Miss Kobayashi!

291
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:57,927
Thanks for your help today!

292
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:58,806
You're doing great.

293
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:01,764
You've learned a lot about PC operation, huh?

294
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:02,511
Impressive.

295
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,150
I'm all over this!

296
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,340
Yep. I'm gonna prove myself to you.

297
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,452
Good, because you've still got a ways to go.

298
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:12,489
Oh, Miss Kobayashi, let's grab
some sweet chestnuts on the way home!

299
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,330
They're so yummy!

300
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:15,156
Sure, whatever.

301
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,702
Why, you...

302
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:21,848
It's been a while since my last day off.

303
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,888
Ugh, I wanna do nothing.

304
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,793
Morning! Please excuse me!

305
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:30,322
I'll clean everything so you can enjoy
your day off in a clean room, Miss Kobayashi!

306
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:32,251
Does that sound good to you?

307
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,267
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

308
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:36,160
It's not that I'm not grateful, but...

309
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,643
Hey! What are you doing?!

310
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:44,716
What do you think?

311
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,345
When I get serious, I can make a room spotless!

312
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,099
Except for the sparkling, of course.

313
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,003
This room's never been so clean!

314
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,221
It's brand new, as if Shiva passed through!

315
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,875
What about my furniture?

316
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,210
A space for relaxation doesn't need any of that nonsense!

317
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:04,002
Please enjoy sleeping to your heart's
content in this spacious and relaxing room!

318
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,413
As if I could!

319
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,325
Put it back the way it was!

320
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:09,243
I swear...

321
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,580
Kobayashi.

322
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:13,572
I'm really hungry.

323
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,618
Yeah, I could eat, too. Let's have breakfast, okay?

324
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:18,035
Hold it right there!

325
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:22,341
I'm in charge of breakfast, be it a
full course meal or an imperial feast!

326
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:25,078
Oh! Would you like me to slaughter a cow?

327
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:27,547
I think I'd prefer to have something light.

328
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,406
Yes! I understand!

329
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,743
Ta-dah! Sandwiches!

330
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:32,818
Oh!

331
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:34,447
They look good.

332
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,613
Wait. This meat...

333
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,049
Tohru.

334
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,240
Show me your butt, now!

335
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:44,317
You mean you want me to satisfy
your lust, and not your appetite?

336
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:45,526
Are you dumb?

337
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,172
Yes...

338
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,418
I knew it!

339
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:48,950
The tail again?

340
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,179
What's going on?

341
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:57,730
What do you mean?

342
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,940
You're just unusually gung-ho.

343
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,702
You really can't tell what's wrong?

344
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,328
I can't. You're spinning your wheels, though.

345
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,649
It's like you reverted to how
you were when you first came to me.

346
00:19:14,144 --> 00:19:15,272
Oh. Coming!

347
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,578
No, it's fine. I'll get it.

348
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:19,741
Hello?

349
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,295
Good morning, Miss Kobayashi! How are you?

350
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,346
Elma?

351
00:19:23,868 --> 00:19:25,073
What are you here for?

352
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:28,265
Well. You know I appreciate
how you're always helping me out,

353
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,584
so I decided to bring you something to say thanks.

354
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,608
What's this?

355
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,060
A protective charm.

356
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,868
It turned out well, too.

357
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,939
Whaaat? You made this? So cool. Thanks!

358
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,734
Oh. I get it, now.

359
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:43,377
Tohru!

360
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:44,922
Today, I'm taking you back!

361
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,418
Be gone, Elma!

362
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,173
Miss Kobayashi.

363
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,673
I know that I can be really selfish.

364
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:14,637
So, I try to control myself and put up with it.

365
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:17,357
But...

366
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,341
I feel like you're being mean.

367
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,444
I work hard, too...

368
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,797
All I want is a lot of praise.

369
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:28,138
And maybe to have you pet my head a little bit...

370
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:35,158
Look, Tohru.

371
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,813
I'm not used to being wanted
or even thought that much about.

372
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:42,987
This has never happened to me before.

373
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,384
I don't have a clue what to do about it.

374
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,123
Human relationships...

375
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:52,329
I dunno. I've always found them to be super confusing.

376
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:56,306
I have a tendency to put distance
between me and other people.

377
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,083
I've had friends before.

378
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,821
But I never let them get too close.

379
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,531
So here.

380
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,853
I mean, um...

381
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,116
I can't make it any clearer than this, okay?

382
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,387
Take the hint, please.

383
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,061
Yes, I'll take the hint...

384
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,487
Oh, right. I can make you a protective charm, too.

385
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,035
Then, you'll also gain the protection of evil gods!

386
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,152
It'll be great!

387
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,535
No, thanks.

388
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,264
Why're you so handsy, Shouta, baby?

389
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:54,512
Bad demon!

390
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,718
Tohru! You're too dangerous!

391
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,003
You know that yourself!

392
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:32,331
Elma, you're too... Uh...

393
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:33,307
What?

394
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,718
For now, please put down the cream bread you're holding.

395
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:37,816
How come? They're so yummy!

396
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:38,682
I don't care.
