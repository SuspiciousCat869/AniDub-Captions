1
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:08,187
Seriously, Tohru.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,719
What made you think a kitchen fire was a good plan?

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,951
It was more of an instinct than a plan.

4
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:14,921
You know the stove makes fire, right?

5
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,288
Yes, but I didn't think it would be strong enough!

6
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:19,650
Strong enough to what? Incinerate the kitchen?

7
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,688
I worry you may have brain damage.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,209
Which reminds me.

9
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,245
Why've I been letting her go
shopping on her own this whole time?

10
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:30,334
Probably not the best idea.

11
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:06,341
Wait!

12
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:07,209
Huh?

13
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,150
Aren't we going to the shopping district?

14
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,817
You mean you don't go to the big supermarket over there?

15
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:12,609
Oh, no.

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,384
That place feels like a castle
and completely freaks me out.

17
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,254
Castle?

18
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:18,128
Yes, and the whole thing's white, too.

19
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:20,783
Gives me flashbacks to run-ins with crusader's bases.

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,148
That's unfortunate.

21
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,400
The shopping district's more like the guild's bazaars.

22
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,889
It's a little better.

23
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:29,567
So you shop based on Dragon PTSD.

24
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:30,426
Good to know.

25
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,900
You wanna start by picking up some fish?

26
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:33,532
Sure!

27
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,203
Tohru! What's up?

28
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,142
Good afternoon, Mister Toda.

29
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,650
You're normally out here alone, aren't you?

30
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:40,847
Is she a new friend?

31
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,319
No, she's my Master.

32
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:42,667
Huh?

33
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:43,925
Uh... Hello.

34
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,135
Tohru's a pretty funny lady, huh?

35
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:48,613
We've got some good mackerel in today. Sound good?

36
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:50,369
Hmm... Sounds great!

37
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,921
Let me have two of those and two dried jack mackerel.

38
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:53,866
Coming up.

39
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,583
He gave us an extra fillet of mackerel.

40
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,099
Wasn't that sweet of him?

41
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,343
Why and how are you friends with the fishmonger?

42
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,675
Huh? We're not friends, though.

43
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:06,330
I was just nice to him at first, so he's been
nice to me and gives me free stuff in return.

44
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:07,104
That's all.

45
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,397
The more I get to know you, the more I
get you don't know how humans operate,

46
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,130
like, at all.

47
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:13,323
Oh! Now, don't worry. Things are different with us!

48
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:14,650
We share mutual love!

49
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,484
Like "at all" at all don't get it.

50
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,747
Hey there, Tohru!

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
So what can I get you today?

52
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:20,775
A little extra included.

53
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,897
That's so sweet!

54
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,780
Here, too? This is weird.

55
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:27,438
Hey, long time no see.

56
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,369
Hello.

57
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,218
It's the cosplay lady!

58
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:31,989
That's me! Have a good one!

59
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:34,683
This dragon's better at being social than me!

60
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:37,557
So Miss Condescending calls us foolish,

61
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:42,509
inferior humans and what not, but she's working
this crowd like a champ and seems to enjoy it.

62
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,652
Maybe she doesn't hate us, after all.

63
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,173
Didn't mean to keep you waiting. I'm sorry.

64
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,455
Oh. It's fine.

65
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,887
Now that I think about it,

66
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,902
I kinda hardly know anything about Tohru.

67
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,732
I think I'd like to know more. I think.

68
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:04,508
Probably best not to bring up
that whole injury thing, though.

69
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,066
It's clearly a touchy topic for her.

70
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,110
Wanna grab some dessert, too?

71
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,175
What? You mean it, really?

72
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,359
Sure, what d'ya want?

73
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:15,717
I would like to have an éclair, please!

74
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:19,859
Did you know that the word "éclair"
translates to "flash of lightning"?

75
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,976
I did not.

76
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,359
Speaking of lightning, talk to me about Thor.

77
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,340
Is your name related to his?

78
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,778
Absolutely not! It comes from an author in this world.

79
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:31,109
At least that's what my parents have always told me.

80
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:32,923
Right. Of course you have parents.

81
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:37,134
Someone, help! He's got my purse!

82
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,313
Do you mind? May I get him?

83
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:40,800
What? I dunno.

84
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,215
Can you do it without people knowing you're a dragon?

85
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,789
Yes!

86
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,225
Here I go!

87
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,857
Too far away to catch, now!

88
00:04:59,023 --> 00:04:59,421
Hmm?

89
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,232
Oh, crap.

90
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:09,533
This could be bad.

91
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,145
Tohru!

92
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:18,758
Huh?

93
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,896
That was so amazing!

94
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,868
I can't believe how strong you are!

95
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,361
That was awesome!

96
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,620
That coulda been way worse.

97
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:30,384
She's keeping us safe!

98
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,317
So, um... That was scary.

99
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,493
I was stressing a bit, myself.

100
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:50,045
Sorry. I should have told you to hold back more.

101
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,068
It's fine.

102
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,841
Um, your hand...

103
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,883
You wanna hold on a little longer?

104
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,074
Yes...

105
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,783
I won't be washing that hand for a while...

106
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,233
What's your tail like?

107
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:33,425
Uh. Oh, it's sweet and creamy!

108
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,317
Astounding humility.

109
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:46,119
Must be my delivery.

110
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:47,748
Hello?

111
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:53,930
Hmm?

112
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,042
So this is what I let into my house.

113
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,488
This girl-thing has to be Tohru's friend.

114
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,112
She's got horns and a tail, too.

115
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:07,719
Tohru would be out shopping right now.

116
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:10,183
What do I do about this for now?

117
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,493
What's your name, sweetie?

118
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,730
You break up with Lady Tohru.

119
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:19,176
Hmm? Lady?

120
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,633
Sorry, what'd you just say?

121
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,850
I know the truth. You seduced her with your... Your body!

122
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:26,668
Hmm?

123
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,771
You cuckold.

124
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:28,491
Hmm?

125
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:30,050
You slut in glasses!

126
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:32,206
Okay, pretty sure you're making a mistake.

127
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:33,360
Don't slut-shame me...

128
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,236
Break up with her, slut!

129
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,637
Whoa-kay!

130
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:35,697
Give her back!

131
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:36,374
Okay! Ow!

132
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,535
Miss Kobayashi, I'm home...

133
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,883
Miss Kobayashi, are you cheating on me?!

134
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,194
This is already weird, don't make it worse.

135
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,535
Lady Tohru.

136
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:53,317
This girl is Kanna Kamui.

137
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:54,894
She's an acquaintance of mine.

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,442
Figured as much.

139
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:59,734
Lady Tohru completely disappeared, so I came to find her.

140
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,146
Completely disappeared?

141
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,418
Tohru, you should communicate
with your friends better than that.

142
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,703
I know.

143
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:08,543
I'm surprised you found this place, Kanna.

144
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,682
I saw you breathe fire on those clouds the other day.

145
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,704
And I sensed your magic.

146
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:14,397
Right...

147
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:16,115
It's almost like you shouldn't have done that.

148
00:08:16,274 --> 00:08:19,732
Lady Tohru, why are you dressed in such an odd outfit?

149
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,853
Will you please come back home with me?

150
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,593
I need you, Lady Tohru.

151
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,947
I'm not going home.

152
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,998
But why not?

153
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:34,006
Why?

154
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:37,209
Because I'm in love with Miss Kobayashi!

155
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,025
Be serious.

156
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,898
I knew it!

157
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:39,467
What?!

158
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:42,135
I saw you on your little date at the bazaar!

159
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,788
Holding each other's hands in public. You perverts!

160
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,821
I'm sorry, what?

161
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,062
Why are you blushing?!

162
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:51,659
You should know, if I must, I will kill you.

163
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,600
Now, die!

164
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,307
Kanna. What happened to you? You're practically powerless.

165
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,857
Your power's special here, Lady Tohru!

166
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,162
The mana purity is too low for me!

167
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:13,364
Kanna, does that mean... you can't get home?

168
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,169
No. That's not true, shut up.

169
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:19,490
All right. Well, can I ask, do you have anywhere to stay?

170
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,442
Tohru, look me in the eye and answer for her.

171
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:25,227
I can't. Your dead-fish eyes scare me, Miss Kobayashi.

172
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,984
Kanna, please tell us honestly what you're planning.

173
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:29,968
It's okay.

174
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,567
But if you're after Miss Kobayashi for yourself,

175
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:33,730
you need to give that up...

176
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,307
Tohru, shut up for a second.

177
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:40,645
Actually...

178
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,071
You were exiled for a stupid prank?

179
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,871
Kanna always has loved practical jokes.

180
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,652
Okay, so long story short...

181
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:49,969
It's like this?

182
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,437
Yes, it's like that.

183
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,900
I'm sure they want her to reflect on her actions.

184
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:56,410
It would be useless for me to send her back.

185
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,984
So right now, she's all on her own.

186
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,515
Yes...

187
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:07,524
Kanna?

188
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,648
Do you wanna stay here with the two of us?

189
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:18,494
Hold on. Why'd it take you so much
longer to decide to let me stay, huh?

190
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,094
Once you're stuck with one, you might as well have two.

191
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,635
Tch! I don't trust you humans, though!

192
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,425
You must be plotting something!

193
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,574
You just wanna use me!

194
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:33,973
You can't trust anyone in an unknown world?

195
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,592
Hey, that makes sense to me.

196
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,841
I wouldn't trust anyone, either.

197
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,178
I think a person has to earn trust.

198
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:45,658
And that can only happen after you become
friends or get, like, "romantically" involved.

199
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,666
Listen, Kanna. I'm not asking
for your trust or friendship.

200
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,970
You can live here. That's all.

201
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,605
Okay...

202
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,332
She's so good.

203
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:12,456
I'm so glad I fell in love with Miss Kobayashi.

204
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:30,555
There!

205
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,698
There! There!

206
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,245
Here!

207
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:36,083
How to tame your dragon.

208
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:46,658
Shoop!

209
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,861
I want to play!

210
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:50,987
But the game?

211
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,567
Yeah, I'm bored with that.

212
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,442
Remember, Kanna's still a child.

213
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:57,177
She craves physical exercise to the fullest!

214
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,452
What's wrong with video games? When I was
a kid, that's how I spent all of my time.

215
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:04,426
Kanna, would you like to go play outside with me today?

216
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,423
Mm! Yeah!

217
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,217
Care to join, Miss Kobayashi?

218
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,831
Yes! Please join us!

219
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,105
I don't exercise.

220
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:22,484
And we're... where?

221
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:23,309
I dunno.

222
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:26,209
I landed in the first big
field I saw that looked pleasant.

223
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,965
Well, whatever works.

224
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,961
I'll be here sleeping off the fatigue from my deathma.

225
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:35,066
Wake me up when we're finished playing.

226
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:37,077
Then, figure out how to get us home.

227
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,030
All right, if that's what you want.

228
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,431
You ready to play even if it's just the two of us?

229
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:41,892
Mm!

230
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:03,368
Tch!

231
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,537
Wait! Wait, wait!

232
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,681
Oh, hey. I thought you were gonna take a nap?

233
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:19,438
How can I sleep when you two
are trying to kill each other?!

234
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,990
Don't be silly... we were only
roughhousing a teeny-tiny bit.

235
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,317
You over-exaggerate.

236
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,139
Shoot, I'm at the disadvantage now.

237
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:29,449
Oh! I bet you wanted to join
in, too, right, Miss Kobayashi?

238
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,067
Shame! You should be more honest!

239
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:32,065
You'd kill me!

240
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:36,657
It's fun to move around in a human body.

241
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:38,067
What happened with you, Kanna?

242
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:40,234
I thought your strength had been depleted somehow.

243
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:43,317
It had been, but the source of my power is electricity.

244
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,301
It returned after I recharged.

245
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,050
So what, you're made of lithium?

246
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,704
If you're playing, keep it to human standards.

247
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,286
What? We were at human standards.

248
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,056
Huh?

249
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:53,952
Huh?

250
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:57,893
In our world there are plenty of humans
capable of doing this kind of thing.

251
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,532
There's very few who can do it here, like, none.

252
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:03,320
That's not true, I saw some on TV the other day.

253
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:05,440
What you saw was fiction, not reality.

254
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,464
Oh.

255
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,777
Sorry, for crushing your dreams.

256
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,673
Whatever. I'll be sleeping in this spot.

257
00:14:12,898 --> 00:14:15,026
Try to keep your playing around my level.

258
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,854
Sure! Well, there you have it, Kanna.

259
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:21,650
Let's start by recalling exactly
how Miss Kobayashi usually acts.

260
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:22,737
Okay!

261
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,803
The power of dragons.

262
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:29,514
I've seen it a few times now, but it's still terrifying.

263
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,937
If they wanted to, this world would be gone.

264
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,705
My lower back! It's killing me!

265
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,596
I'm tired... I'm gonna die...

266
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:51,109
Yeah, never mind. They'd never destroy our world.

267
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,468
And, for the record, they've both totally nailed me.

268
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:57,272
Ah, that was super fun.

269
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,026
Was it?

270
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,452
I suppose you really didn't want to play, Miss Kobayashi.

271
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,337
Hmph.

272
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,657
I don't mind playing Word Chain.

273
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:21,516
Indigo.

274
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:22,500
Gorilla.

275
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:23,627
Lambskin.

276
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:24,754
Intercom.

277
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,130
Compadre.

278
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:28,719
Dre... Dre...

279
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,547
Oh, dragon!

280
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:33,225
Ha, ha, you lose.

281
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,975
Agh!

282
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,234
Ah! You're being rude. You only
left my tail-meat behind again!

283
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,174
I said I was ethically opposed.

284
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,300
Although, if you turned it into
ground meat, I probably wouldn't notice.

285
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:56,687
But then you would have no way of
knowing it was specifically my meat.

286
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:58,555
Why is that so important to you?

287
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,090
Hmm?

288
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:05,466
Miss Kobayashi...

289
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:09,321
Please don't enter or even peek into
the kitchen until I call for you, okay?

290
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:10,789
Thank you...

291
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:12,935
Hey!

292
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,459
I will never want your tail!

293
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,141
Where are you going, Kobayashi?

294
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:21,859
Hmm? To work.

295
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,294
I wanna go with you.

296
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,711
Kanna, you have things to do with me today, remember?

297
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:27,696
Things like what?

298
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,834
Kanna hasn't been in this world for very long.

299
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,751
I thought it would be good
for me to teach her some basics.

300
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,157
Yeah? You thought that?

301
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,130
No way! I want Kobayashi!

302
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,616
This came out of nowhere.

303
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:42,794
If you keep being selfish, I'll break you.

304
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:43,774
I'm off!

305
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:44,875
Safe travels!

306
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:49,324
Now then. It's time for you to
learn common sense for this world.

307
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,277
What kind of common sense?

308
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:54,139
To start with, you need to learn what you must not do.

309
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:55,544
Oh!

310
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,909
Honor traffic lights at all times!

311
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,072
Otherwise, you'll be squashed by a "car."

312
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,546
That's what those iron boxes are called?

313
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,315
Lady Tohru, you're smart!

314
00:17:05,386 --> 00:17:06,817
How do they move around?

315
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:09,544
Probably with magic.

316
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,595
Apparently, you need a device called a "license" for them.

317
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,484
Does Kobayashi have that?

318
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,984
A license? I'd love to ride in a car!

319
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:19,317
From what I understand, she possesses a license,

320
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:20,927
but she does not have a car.

321
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,317
Cars impose strains called "inspections,"

322
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,817
"loans," and "tires."

323
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,581
It seems power comes at a price in every world.

324
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:31,608
But... wouldn't it be easier
if she just had you carry her?

325
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:33,785
Why doesn't Kobayashi do that?

326
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:35,539
Great question.

327
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:38,416
Wow, you've got another relative with you?

328
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:39,908
This one a maid, too?

329
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:44,836
Gothic Lolita. A Gothic Lolita with a tribal theme.

330
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:47,457
Huh, interesting twist.

331
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,451
Tohru said she was gonna teach her
some things, so I'm a little worried.

332
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:54,139
Why? Tohru seems to have her act together.

333
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:55,385
You think so?

334
00:17:56,103 --> 00:18:00,080
Well, at the very least, I'm confident
she has compassion for her friends.

335
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:03,633
For real? That is hilarious. Are you serious?

336
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:04,855
What's he saying?

337
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:05,919
Magic words.

338
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,804
You can get through most conversations
using those phrases, so try to remember them.

339
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:13,397
What's that thing?

340
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:15,444
I don't know.

341
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,025
A tool children play with? How do they play?

342
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,585
It looks like it uses the principle of levers, but...

343
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,817
That's a training device for catapults!

344
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,311
Oh!

345
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,477
This is how human children learn the
means of combating monsters in the sky!

346
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,620
Ooh!

347
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:33,654
What's that?

348
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,337
That's called a crepe stand.

349
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,332
It's sweet, like the eggs of a yatagarasu.

350
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,425
What's that?

351
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:45,514
Oh, that's an ice cream stand!

352
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,949
It's cold. But yummy!

353
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,525
This world is peaceful.

354
00:18:57,732 --> 00:18:59,059
It is, isn't it?

355
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,925
Are there dragons here? Other than visitors.

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,553
No, it seems there aren't.

357
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,234
I don't know if they went extinct or if they moved away.

358
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,744
Is it bad to revert to my original form?

359
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,525
No, not as long as you don't allow that form to be seen.

360
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:17,146
Have you learned how to use
perception blocking yet, Kanna?

361
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:18,185
Not yet.

362
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,002
That's okay. Besides, it's not like
there's ever any real need for it anyways.

363
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:26,855
Uh. Um, Lady Tohru?

364
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,634
Yes, ma'am?

365
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:30,661
Why did you decide to come to this world?

366
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,922
All the rumors I heard said that you died.

367
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,370
I was happy to find out they were wrong.

368
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:43,904
Well, to be honest, I came to this world just to escape.

369
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:48,537
I was on the verge of death when I
got here, but Miss Kobayashi saved me.

370
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,222
Kobayashi?

371
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:54,217
I decided to repay her by
being her personal, live-in maid.

372
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,777
Meanwhile, I let people think I was dead.

373
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,106
I've only told a handful of dragons about my survival.

374
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:02,513
Like Miss Lucoah and Mister Fafnir.

375
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:05,324
That's neat, you kinda sound like a retiree.

376
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,875
I guess I kinda am.

377
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:11,116
You know what's funny, Kanna?

378
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,174
I'm very happy. Right in this moment.

379
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:20,523
Hmm.

380
00:20:21,801 --> 00:20:22,859
Come on, Kanna!

381
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:25,131
There's gotta be more stuff you want to know about!

382
00:20:25,384 --> 00:20:25,956
Hmm.

383
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,866
I'd like to see Kobayashi's work.

384
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:34,894
Uh. She might get mad at you.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,815
So what? I wanna see.

386
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:41,089
Hmm. Well, all right. Let's go say hello to her, then.

387
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:55,152
Feel free to change. I blocked perception of us.

388
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:55,582
Mm.

389
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:15,859
What's wrong with you?

390
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:18,250
Huh? Oh, nothing's wrong.

391
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,362
Whatever.

392
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,248
It's not practice for catapults?

393
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,634
It's not. Just a toy kids play on.

394
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:41,765
How about that.

395
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:46,841
Whoa.

396
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:49,817
Whoa, this is fun!

397
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:50,603
Yeah.

398
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:52,759
This toy is great!

399
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,323
Glad it makes you happy.

400
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:29,841
Kanna, supposedly there are
myriads of gods living in this world.

401
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,888
Lady Tohru, what does "myriads" mean?

402
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:34,713
Basically, gods reside in all kinds of things here.

403
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:35,976
Whoa, that's scary.

404
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,419
Don't let your guard down.

405
00:23:37,444 --> 00:23:38,134
Right.
