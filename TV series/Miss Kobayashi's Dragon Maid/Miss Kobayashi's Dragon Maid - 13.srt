1
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:24,132
I promised Saikawa that I would
play with her in the park today.

2
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,218
Oh, fun. Have a good time.

3
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:30,411
Do you have any big plans for the day, Miss Kobayashi?

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,132
I guess I'd like to spend my day off relaxing at home.

5
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:36,757
I knew you'd say that!

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,372
So I am prepared to give my
utmost to ensure said relaxation.

7
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,702
Cool. Leaving me alone is enough, though.

8
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:48,166
Kanna!

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,217
Be careful!

10
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,834
'Kay!

11
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,650
I hope the sun comes out today.

12
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,308
So pretty.

13
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:46,753
Shepherd's purse?

14
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,416
Flower language?

15
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:50,507
It's a book about what flowers mean.

16
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,346
Georgie is letting me borrow it.

17
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,275
I think it's way neat.

18
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,123
You all right?

19
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,073
Let's look up shepherd's purse.

20
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:02,880
Oh, there it is!

21
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,309
Apparently, it means I'll offer everything to you.

22
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,282
Here you go, Kanna.

23
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,310
My everything!

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,530
You mean me or the flower?

25
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,053
Here you go, Miss Kobayashi.

26
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,342
Thank you, Tohru.

27
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:46,958
Do you love it?

28
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:48,771
Yeah, it's really tasty.

29
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:50,856
I was hoping so!

30
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:53,236
I've been working on adjusting the temperature and

31
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,905
intensity to compliment how you're feeling at the moment!

32
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,559
You dragons are an amazing bunch.

33
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,472
Oh, it's not because I'm a dragon.

34
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:04,047
It's because I'm me.

35
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:07,295
I suppose it's about time for me to go shopping.

36
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,150
Any thoughts on what I should make for tonight's dinner?

37
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,562
Omurice.

38
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:20,340
I was just thinking the same thing!

39
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:22,650
But this time, please make it normal.

40
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,842
Normal, it is!

41
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:25,897
I'll be back in a bit.

42
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,191
'Kay.

43
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,613
Omurice tonight.

44
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,734
Omurice tonight!

45
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:40,183
Their lifespan is just so short.

46
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,232
True, but take the house mouse.

47
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,576
For example, it only lives for
maybe a year to a year and a half.

48
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,226
Oh! So sad!

49
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,043
Not at all.

50
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:50,674
Every living creature has its own perception of time.

51
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:53,283
Applying human standards to them is a mistake.

52
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:56,382
How long are you planning to continue this?

53
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,065
Who are you? Are you me?

54
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:06,220
Indeed. I am the doubt within you.

55
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,143
Do not avert your eyes and deceive yourself.

56
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,913
Be honest.

57
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,990
I repeat: How long are you planning to continue this?

58
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:31,563
The time I have now. I simply want to enjoy it.

59
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,026
I want to spend time with Miss Kobayashi, that's all.

60
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,987
How long will it last?

61
00:05:38,424 --> 00:05:40,002
You understand, do you not?

62
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:42,071
One day you will have to return.

63
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,297
You're wrong.

64
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,200
I'm not going back.

65
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,201
Because, I am Miss Kobayashi's maid.

66
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,519
You are not. You are a dragon.

67
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,590
What will you do if a need to return rises?

68
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,735
If the war back there worsens?

69
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,995
If you long for battle?

70
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:05,514
What if... Miss Kobayashi were to...

71
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,476
Miss Kobayashi.

72
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:19,835
This is where I belong.

73
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,412
She is where I belong.

74
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:35,080
Father?

75
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:38,062
You understand why I've come.

76
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:44,144
Return home with me. Now, Tohru.

77
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:47,525
This world is not where you belong.

78
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:04,756
Lady Tohru!

79
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,515
Welcome home, Kanna!

80
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,102
Tohru's still not back from shopping.

81
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,025
Omurice takes more effort than I thought.

82
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,087
Lady Tohru went home.

83
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,259
No, she's out. She's not here.

84
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,070
She went home.

85
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:26,743
To the other world.

86
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,038
Her father came to take her.

87
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,457
He's the Emperor of Demise.

88
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,231
So you mean she went home.

89
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,883
Yes, and I don't think she'll
come back to this world ever again.

90
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,784
She can't refuse the Emperor of Demise.

91
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:53,363
No.

92
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:09,575
Tohru's gone.

93
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,665
Crap, crap, crap!

94
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,358
Kanna, wake up! It's time to go.

95
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,921
Shoot, shoot. I totally forgot!

96
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:41,330
Hot!

97
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,780
Oh, man.

98
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:46,687
Whoa.

99
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:48,669
I'm sorry, Kanna.

100
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,861
It's okay.

101
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:53,426
Kobayashi.

102
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,090
Kobayashi.

103
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:57,084
Kobayashi?

104
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,299
Oh, yeah-hey, Yamashita.

105
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,723
I wanted to talk to you about those revisions.

106
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,726
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of them.

107
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,178
Sorry.

108
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:07,748
Kobayashi.

109
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,605
Did something happen?

110
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:19,909
Tohru went back home. To the other world.

111
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,542
Understood.

112
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,557
I'm home.

113
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,857
Kobayashi. I'm glad you're back.

114
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,607
Thanks, sorry I'm so late.

115
00:09:41,877 --> 00:09:43,052
I bet you're hungry.

116
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:47,152
Are you all right?

117
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,515
How so?

118
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,899
Staying this late, pulling so much overtime?

119
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm good.

120
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:53,759
Kanna's staying with Saikawa tonight.

121
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:54,720
Understood.

122
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,090
Do you wanna go for drinks after we finish?

123
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:02,123
Mm. Nah, I think I'll pass.

124
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,790
Okay. Next time, then.

125
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,496
Sure.

126
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:12,315
Well, good night, Kanna, and good night, Little Miss.

127
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:13,649
Have sweet dreams.

128
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,304
Good night, Georgie.

129
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,265
Kanna! Is everything all right?

130
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,203
Oh, Tohru.

131
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:54,085
Hey, I'm home.

132
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,655
Wish I'd told her the omurice was good.

133
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,378
I would have if I'd known things would turn out like this.

134
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,891
Miss Kobayashi, it's me!

135
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:35,487
It's Tohru!

136
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:37,685
Tohru?

137
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,494
I'm home, Miss Kobayashi!

138
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,844
What am I thinking? I can't fit inside like this!

139
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,034
But why?

140
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:02,888
What?

141
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,132
I thought you left us for good.

142
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,763
You went to the other world, right?

143
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:13,354
Yes. But now... it's okay because I'm back!

144
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,133
This is kind of awkward, huh?

145
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,758
Miss Kobayashi. This is home.

146
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,018
Okay, then...

147
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:46,742
Tohru.

148
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:48,154
Father.

149
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,056
That's her dad?

150
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,933
Why did you leave against my wishes?

151
00:13:53,655 --> 00:13:55,917
I left because I want to be here.

152
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:57,147
Please, you hav...

153
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,457
I said no.

154
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,346
My answer is final, child.

155
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:04,198
We are forbidden from interfering in this world.

156
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,743
You will return home with me, now.

157
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,229
I said no!

158
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:12,626
What you say or want does not matter.

159
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,065
You must accept the truth.

160
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,049
This world is not for you.

161
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:26,208
And I will not allow you to throw
it into chaos over childish whims.

162
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:29,810
You are wrong. This world is my home.

163
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,566
This world is where I belong.

164
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,536
You would live a quiet life as a human?

165
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,190
One day you will fray apart.

166
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,555
You've sensed that, have you not?

167
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:51,626
Come back home, Tohru.

168
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,753
Come back before you get hurt.

169
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:00,413
Should I say something here?

170
00:15:00,937 --> 00:15:03,601
I don't think he intends to be as mean as he's being.

171
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:06,710
But you shouldn't get between a parent and their child.

172
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:10,276
Whatever Tohru decides, I'll respect that choice.

173
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:11,687
I said no!

174
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:13,733
Hey.

175
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:20,122
Are you all right?

176
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,228
Choose your words carefully.

177
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:29,690
You could be eliminated, depending
on what you decide to say to me.

178
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:43,040
Miss Kobayashi. This is home.

179
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,784
Say what you will.

180
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:54,076
She said no.

181
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,394
Tohru doesn't want to go with you!

182
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:02,117
How dare you?

183
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,211
You're not allowed to interfere in this world,

184
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:05,235
that's what you said!

185
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,924
If so, you can't kill me.

186
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:10,068
No, but I can leave you just shy of death, human.

187
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,505
Do your worst, it won't change how I feel!

188
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,450
We must obey the rules of the world.

189
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,480
If any dragons are found living in the human world,

190
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:25,116
it would inevitably lead to disaster.

191
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:28,076
Others will be influenced and make their way here.

192
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:29,965
It may be fine now,

193
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,993
but eventually, some will plot an invasion.

194
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:35,757
Would your feelings be changed, then?

195
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,416
It doesn't matter, that wouldn't be Tohru's fault.

196
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:42,049
Why are you twisting an imaginary
future into her responsibility?

197
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:44,257
She will change things.

198
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,649
And who cares?

199
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,149
Why are you so fixated on my daughter?

200
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,757
Don't tell me you care for Tohru?

201
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,850
I cannot believe a human could be capable.

202
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,096
Why? Tohru's completely awesome!

203
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,492
Yes, I am aware of that.

204
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,745
Tohru's bright and cheerful,

205
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,571
and whenever she feels down,

206
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,161
she hides it with a super cute laugh.

207
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,815
And to top it off, she's a great maid!

208
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,110
Don't you get that?

209
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,380
I won't let you take my maid away!

210
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,107
Back off, she's mine!

211
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,960
You overstep...

212
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,358
I see.

213
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:28,294
If this is the case, we need more room.

214
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,347
Tohru.

215
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,333
Tohru?

216
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,445
This is a first.

217
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:53,065
You've never rebelled against me before.

218
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,594
Well, I've never belonged anywhere before.

219
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:59,406
I want you to know that I respect you, Father.

220
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,694
I admire you.

221
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,181
But I only feel that way as a dragon.

222
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,698
Miss Kobayashi. She's different.

223
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,002
She's special.

224
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,047
Miss Kobayashi's my light!

225
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:15,231
Do not be obtuse, child.

226
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:19,461
Enough.

227
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:26,061
If you defy me, I will not show mercy.

228
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,272
Return with me, you naïve girl!

229
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,788
I won't go back.

230
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:43,106
I will not allow this!

231
00:18:43,382 --> 00:18:45,497
I'm not asking permission!

232
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,456
That's them!

233
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,530
This is your last chance.

234
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,508
Come home!

235
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,844
I won't go back!

236
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,908
Why are you so stubborn?

237
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:08,602
Wait! Please stop this!

238
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,493
Kanna? Miss Kobayashi!

239
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,221
You two are literally fighting?

240
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:18,065
Stay out our affairs, human.

241
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,494
I'm sorry, Miss Kobayashi,

242
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,001
but if you could get to a safe distance, please.

243
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:24,089
Why are dragons like this?

244
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:28,707
You know you'll never get anywhere
if you can't find a way to compromise.

245
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,590
What is your point?

246
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,983
You're overreacting.

247
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:34,382
I don't understand why it has to come to this.

248
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,040
No, of course not.

249
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:38,721
Humans could never understand a dragon.

250
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,174
You're so wrong.

251
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,579
Knowing you're different is only the beginning.

252
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,686
If you accept those differences, you'll be
able to get past them and grow even closer.

253
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:53,090
Then you'll find aspects about
what's different that you like,

254
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,682
which helps build respect.

255
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:56,494
Respect?

256
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,810
Next you bond and forge trust.

257
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:06,928
Impossible.

258
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,607
Living alongside each other will not work.

259
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:10,356
You're wrong!

260
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,784
We've been doing this for a long time.

261
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:16,914
You just have to decide if you think it can last.

262
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,734
I believe it can.

263
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:20,383
What do you believe?

264
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,138
Try having some faith in your daughter!

265
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:39,382
I will not approve.

266
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:44,850
Not of a human who does not even have the
lifespan to make this choice worth her while.

267
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,287
Tohru. My foolish daughter.

268
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,612
I'm sorry, I know I'm being selfish.

269
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:15,662
What should I give you? Everything?

270
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:19,889
I don't mind. I'll give you everything.

271
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,254
I don't need that much.

272
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,296
Good morning, Tohru.

273
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,882
Good morning to you, Miss Kobayashi.

274
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,674
Good morning, Lady Tohru.

275
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:47,429
Good morning, Kanna.

276
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,715
Okay, I'm heading out, now.

277
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,411
We need shampoo-conditioner.

278
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,322
Yeah? Okay, I'll pick up some more!

279
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:54,331
And don't forget...

280
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,971
Eight o'clock sharp, correct?

281
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,909
Don't worry. I remember.

282
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:02,399
Kanna said she was coming over to play again today.

283
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:05,278
In that case, I'll prepare some
chocolates for the two of you.

284
00:22:06,178 --> 00:22:07,773
We get chocolate?

285
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,059
Have a good day, Shouta-baby.

286
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:16,228
Let go!

287
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:19,513
Come on over and try our new waffles, ma'am!

288
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:21,814
Thank you again for stopping by!

289
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:24,097
Tohru.

290
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:24,910
Yes?

291
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,917
I'm thinking of going home for the first time in a while.

292
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,502
Oh, that sounds nice.

293
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,183
I think you should definitely go.

294
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:33,402
Would you like to come with me?

295
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:07,282
I'll never be able to grow old with Miss Kobayashi.

296
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:10,524
One day, the time will come when we have to part.

297
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:21,078
Even so, I don't think I'll ever feel like I would
have been better off not meeting or knowing her.

298
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:29,082
So, I'm going to treasure this
limited time we do have together.

299
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,833
We're home!
