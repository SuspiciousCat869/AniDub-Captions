1
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:07,445
I gotta pee.

2
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:14,758
Huh?

3
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:16,847
Too close!

4
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,085
Someone's here!

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:21,533
Sorry, Kobayashi.

6
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,740
No, it's fine, don't worry about it.

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,267
Hey, it's beer time!

8
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,946
Whoops, excuse me a second!

9
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,676
Is there any juice?

10
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm officially over this.

11
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:10,729
You called looking for a three-bedroom apartment?

12
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:14,122
Yes. I'd like one as close to this area as possible.

13
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,749
How's this?

14
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:16,471
Hmm.

15
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,314
How's this?

16
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:19,131
Hmm.

17
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:21,046
How's this?

18
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,483
Hmm.

19
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,477
They all kinda look the same to me.

20
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,325
This one has a bonus feature:

21
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,292
The rooftop is actually a common area shared by tenants.

22
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,018
Really.

23
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:35,396
The sky's so vast!

24
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,412
It feels amazing!

25
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,428
What do you think?

26
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,356
Well...

27
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,340
I guess we'll take it.

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,725
We've gotta get this place ready for the move.

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,201
First, we clean.

30
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,640
Yeah!

31
00:02:52,103 --> 00:02:55,264
Cleaning, cleaning, la la la.

32
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,904
Beat the dust and de-de-destroy it!

33
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,454
What is she singing?

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,370
No dust will be left behind!

35
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,348
New clean, clean everything.

36
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,342
If not, then death, death, death to the world!

37
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,966
Are you trying to freak me out?!

38
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:08,509
Hmm?

39
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,578
So as a dragon, do you like being clean?

40
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,094
I suppose so.

41
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:17,906
I like to take baths a lot as well as brush my teeth.

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,416
You brush your teeth?

43
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:21,665
Do you have like a dragon-sized toothbrush or something?

44
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,953
No, I use my claws to pick out the bugs.

45
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:26,543
Bugs? But what about the bacteria?

46
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,744
Yeah. They're so small, I don't really notice them.

47
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,001
Bet it's not easy to have such a huge body.

48
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,601
True. Finding somewhere to live was horrible.

49
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,683
That figures. What did you finally go with?

50
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:39,217
Sometimes caves.

51
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:40,694
Sometimes ruins.

52
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,123
Sometimes mountains.

53
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:44,889
I've even slept in the sky a few times.

54
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,341
Seems dangerous!

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,370
Although, that would make living anywhere a breeze.

56
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,001
Whoa.

57
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:50,870
Actually, no.

58
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:51,864
Why is that funny?

59
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:55,288
Anyway, if I stayed in one
place too long, humans showed up.

60
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,360
They're the worst.

61
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,346
You were, like, a rare monster.

62
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,628
The point is, my body kept getting dirty.

63
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,500
But I barely got the opportunity to bathe at all.

64
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,329
Ew.

65
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,542
When worse came to worst, we
would have to lick each other clean.

66
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:08,119
Huh?!

67
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,725
Kanna and I've done that before.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,417
Ugh! That is inappropriate

69
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:12,642
behavior for humans!

70
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,712
Maybe so.

71
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:17,257
But most dragons couldn't care
less about all the silly human rules.

72
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,592
We don't get sick or unhealthy either way.

73
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:22,275
Wow. Okay, I'm jealous of that.

74
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,544
You know what? You're a very sloppy person.

75
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,340
You leave beer cans scattered all over,

76
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,849
and your clothes stay right where you took them off.

77
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:32,792
What does it matter what I do?

78
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,942
That's what I liked so much about living alone.

79
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:37,888
Also, your books are not in any order that I know about.

80
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,836
Now that's just being too picky!

81
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:40,830
Ahem.

82
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,716
Fine, I can overlook the catastrophe of books.

83
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,306
However, you can at least clean up your trash and clothes.

84
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,850
Don't forget this is my home.

85
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,500
You don't want Kanna to pick
up those nasty habits, do you?

86
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,774
No...

87
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:55,964
My father must have felt exactly
like this when my mother yelled at him.

88
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,501
Hmph. You know, Tohru.

89
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,424
I keep leaving crap around
because I'm happy you're here, okay?

90
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:04,710
I like that you clean up.

91
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:09,612
I mean, that stuff's basically a cakewalk for
a mighty and powerful dragon like you, right?

92
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:10,937
Uh-huh. It is!

93
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,522
Tohru, I'd love it if you kept helping out...

94
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,546
...if you want.

95
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,411
I do want! I do! Yes!

96
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,411
So pretty.

97
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,426
Scoundrel Kobayashi.

98
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,877
All right, next up is packing.

99
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:26,694
Right!

100
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,302
I know almost all of these things belong to me.

101
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:31,397
Sorry for asking you to help out.

102
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:34,552
Never fear. You can ask anything at all of me!

103
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,211
I'll do my best, too!

104
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:44,213
Hmm?

105
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,022
Focus, Kanna. Stop fooling around...

106
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:50,469
Chibi Kobayashi! Aah!

107
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,558
Those dead-fish eyes are killing me... they're so cute!

108
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,100
There's something wrong with you.

109
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,141
Can you focus for five seconds, please?

110
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:04,736
What? I had no clue I still had this.

111
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,308
Focus.

112
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,803
Me?! I'm all focus!

113
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,375
Miss Kobayashi!

114
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:21,891
Hmm?

115
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,017
Tell me this maid outfit is yours!

116
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,683
Yeah, that's mine.

117
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:30,958
Will you please, oh, please try it on for me?! I want
to see if you're as adorable in it as I know you'll be!

118
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:31,749
No.

119
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,667
Why? You bought it so you could wear it, didn't you?

120
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,803
Yeah, but as soon as I saw my reflection,

121
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:40,080
I realized I looked idiotic. I'll never wear that again.

122
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,208
Then would you mind if I wore it?

123
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,789
Hmm? Not at all.

124
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,330
Hooray! Thank you!

125
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,521
So, how do I look?

126
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,053
Lovely, lady Tohru!

127
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,880
Mm-hmm! I think it looks great, too.

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,520
I can't say I disagree! Thanks!

129
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:09,788
Although, your clothes seem to always
be a bit too tight in the chest for me.

130
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,495
Speaking of...

131
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:11,862
Hmm?

132
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,350
There's no way in hell you're really just a D.

133
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,447
I'm a D for a dragon if that helps.

134
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:22,658
Ah! Beer, win!

135
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,600
Great work today, you guys!

136
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,848
Yes. You two are so awesome!

137
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,991
Finally, time for a bath.

138
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,570
What happened to the towels and clean
clothes I laid out in the bathroom?

139
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:38,136
I packed all of it up in a box for you!

140
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:38,826
Huh?

141
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:39,707
Huh...?

142
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,429
You know which box that is, by chance?

143
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,799
Good morning!

144
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,650
Sansan Moving Service at your service!

145
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,340
Great. Go to town, boys.

146
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,693
So this is a car, huh?

147
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,837
Let's figure out how we're gonna use this space.

148
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,165
Living room, obviously.

149
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:13,366
Office in here? Sound good?

150
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,623
I think I'll take this one as my bedroom.

151
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,956
Last, but not least...

152
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,652
You two will get to share this room!

153
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,612
Huh?

154
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:24,503
Wait this is our room?

155
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:26,918
Yep. You can do whatever you want with it.

156
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,795
Yay!

157
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:48,118
A whole new life.

158
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:50,364
Hmm?

159
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,143
Shall I wash your back for you?

160
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:54,129
What? No, I'm fine.

161
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,725
You said you liked it when I made things clean.

162
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,182
That is what you said, right?

163
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:02,415
Ugh, that's your angle? Okay, fine, come on in.

164
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:03,415
Okay.

165
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,956
I have a question.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,520
Yes?

167
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:14,953
Wouldn't it be easier for you to
wash your body in your human form?

168
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:18,785
Technically, yes. But I can't be as thorough.

169
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:23,511
All of the confusing and finicky
rules in this world don't help, either.

170
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,132
I find the whole thing a little stifling.

171
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,678
You don't like your human form, do you?

172
00:09:32,381 --> 00:09:33,424
Yes!

173
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:38,495
And no, it's complicated.

174
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:41,560
Sure.

175
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,583
Knock, knock. I'm coming in!

176
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:50,350
Lady Tohru, wash me, too?

177
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,396
Of course I will!

178
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,937
Ugh, too close!

179
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,125
Here I go!

180
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,473
Morning, Tohru.

181
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,206
Hey, Miss Kobayashi! Hope you slept well!

182
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,192
Tohru.

183
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:32,994
Uh, yes?

184
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,213
Want me to wash you as a thanks for yesterday?

185
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,333
Do I?

186
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:37,411
Well, hurry up.

187
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,035
What? Okay!

188
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,022
Thank you... This is incredible...

189
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,627
Feels like I'm washing a car.

190
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:52,851
Oh, thank you.

191
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:55,862
Miss Kobayashi, you're the best.

192
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:57,782
You're welcome, Tohru.

193
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,055
This is the old apartment!

194
00:11:17,973 --> 00:11:21,007
Damn it, why am I so stupid...?

195
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,625
Tohru, that's way too loud!

196
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:45,375
Huh?

197
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,130
Or not.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,096
Do you believe me to be a loud person?

199
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,080
No, I'm sorry.

200
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:56,813
Kobayashi, is your hangover making your head hurt?

201
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:57,972
Yeah...

202
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,969
I can't believe I feel like this on my day off.

203
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,220
The noises sound like they're
coming from both neighbors and above.

204
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:06,228
Would you like me to speak with them about it?

205
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,279
Actually, if you would, that would be great.

206
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,704
Make sure your horns don't stick out, though.

207
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,125
Sure, no problem!

208
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:17,458
And if they refuse to listen to me, I'll
just murder, dismember, and pulverize them!

209
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:18,780
Seems excessive.

210
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,619
I'll start with Miss Sasakibe on our right.

211
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:23,827
Coming.

212
00:12:24,331 --> 00:12:27,331
Hello. Oh. You're from next door.

213
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,429
I'm Tohru. How are you?

214
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,058
I'm good, thanks. Did you need something?

215
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,000
Well... we've been hearing some really loud noises,

216
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,704
so I decided to come check it out.

217
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,471
I didn't realize I was that loud.

218
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,099
What are you doing? Pillaging?

219
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,475
Just cooking.

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,051
Huh...?

221
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,417
Stay here a quick minute.

222
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,725
Here, allow me to share some. Stewed rapeseed blossoms.

223
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,382
Wow, thank you so much!

224
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,475
And if it wouldn't be too much trouble,
would you try keeping the noise down?

225
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,132
Sure.

226
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,547
How could this make such a racket?

227
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,850
Now for Mister Yana on the left side.

228
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:08,311
What? I'm playing music.

229
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,469
Playing music?

230
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,208
Yeah, want to listen?

231
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,850
Are you the god of the underworld because
you sound like Hades crushing Hercules.

232
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:23,654
Best compliment ever. Rock on.

233
00:13:23,782 --> 00:13:26,683
Anyways, please try to keep the volume down.

234
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,926
Mm-hmm.

235
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,412
Last is Mister Sone on the floor above.

236
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,915
I'm sorry, but I have to use a drill for work.

237
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:33,804
A drill?

238
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,558
Yes, I make hand-carved wooden figurines.

239
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,801
Ooh, a gorilla!

240
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,060
That's really well done!

241
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:45,662
Anyway, one of the girls I live with is suffering
from a hangover. So please try to keep it down?

242
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:46,939
Yeah. I'll try.

243
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,792
You're the loud one!

244
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,308
No, I'm pretty sure that's you!

245
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,390
Or it's you both!

246
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,019
This from the guy who has to be the loudest in the room?

247
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,813
What's going on out here?

248
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,295
His drilling is way too loud!

249
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,725
The death metal's too loud!

250
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,534
That creepy noise is too loud!

251
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,892
All I'm doing is cooking!

252
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:04,450
Huh?

253
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,286
At the moment, all three of you are too loud.

254
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,691
We're sorry, Tohru.

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,437
Why do humans always make the same
mistakes over and over? They're beyond help.

256
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:16,256
I'll kill them.

257
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,647
Excuse me. If I could have a word, please?

258
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,417
Hmm?

259
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,788
The problem we're all having is that everyone else manages
to be loud precisely when we'd rather things to be quiet.

260
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,595
So why don't we organize all the times we don't
want to have a bunch of noise driving us insane,

261
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,777
and plan around it?

262
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,359
We'll make a schedule out of our noise preferences.

263
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,410
If some times don't work out, then
we can use the power of the earplug.

264
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,565
And you're certain this plan is acceptable?

265
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,183
These are creatures that haven't
learned anything since evolving from apes.

266
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,142
You know I'm one of those creatures, right?

267
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:46,452
Mm.

268
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:47,808
It's not a big deal.

269
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,427
I wouldn't mind so much if I
wasn't dying in hangover hell.

270
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:54,417
Besides, it's only natural for people who are
going about their lives to annoy other people

271
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,113
who are simply going about theirs.

272
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,792
That's the definition of neighbors.

273
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,483
You might be too good for your own good.

274
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,848
No, I'm not.

275
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,125
I wouldn't like things if they were too quiet either.

276
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,342
I'm gonna take a nap real quick.

277
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:15,794
Of course.

278
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,827
Do you consider me to be too loud?

279
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:41,060
There are times when I feel like you are, yeah.

280
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:43,436
Does it, um, annoy...?

281
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:48,219
Hmm. Kinda difficult to give a
precise answer to that question.

282
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:52,692
However...

283
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,712
For what it's worth, this life's fine. Good enough for me.

284
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:06,741
I'm gonna sleep now.

285
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:09,908
Right. Then I will, too.

286
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,987
You're being too loud!

287
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,530
What should I do about this?

288
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:56,267
I don't like slowing down so I can be considerate
of management's inability to drink like me.

289
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:57,854
Straight to the point as always.

290
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,475
Hmm... You should create an excuse not to go.

291
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:03,041
An excuse?

292
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,743
We're having a party?

293
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:06,290
Yeah.

294
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,079
I was talking to Takiya about doing something here.

295
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:11,742
I need an excuse to get out of
my job's flower viewing thing.

296
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,727
You invited that man to our home?

297
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,090
Oh, stop making that face.

298
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,559
He's a nice guy. Give him a chance. Please?

299
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:20,362
I suppose so,

300
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,054
but I'm only putting up with him for you.

301
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:22,736
How mature.

302
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,232
In return, can I invite some of my friends, too?

303
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,077
Friends like who? People from the shopping district?

304
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:29,300
No, like dragons.

305
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,014
Huh?

306
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't worry. They're all
extraordinarily well-behaved dragons.

307
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,981
Ugh. Why isn't that comforting?

308
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,696
I'm here.

309
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:38,850
Welcome back home!

310
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,333
Surprise. I'm here, too!

311
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,267
Oh, hi. Welcome. Come in.

312
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:44,047
Funny how I don't feel very welcome.

313
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,458
Now, you must be Kanna. Nice to meet you.

314
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,000
Nice to meet you.

315
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:50,401
I like your goth-loli thing.

316
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,337
Hmm.

317
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,100
Where are your friends, Tohru?

318
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,531
They should be here soon.

319
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:57,155
Coming!

320
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,789
If you'll give me one moment, please.

321
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,187
Fafnir, no! Make yourself look
like the picture I sent to you!

322
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,308
Good grief.

323
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:16,393
I hate this and everything it stands for. Kill me.

324
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,884
I'm already dead inside.

325
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:23,206
Miss Kobayashi, I'd like you to meet Fafnir.

326
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,645
Hello, Fafnir, it's a pleasure to meet you.

327
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:28,198
That is what's known as a polite social greeting.

328
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,683
Polite social greeting?

329
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:34,093
It's a magical set of words that helps even the
shyest of people introduce themselves with confidence.

330
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:37,698
Tohru, I have a feeling your
friend might be hostile towards me.

331
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:41,497
That makes sense. He does have
a slight dislike for humans.

332
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:46,017
We're talking about an ancient cursed dragon who's
been guarding his treasure in a cave for, like, ever.

333
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,343
You mean Hobbit style?

334
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,861
Hm? There're more?

335
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:51,281
This one's the last.

336
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,722
Hey, Tohru.

337
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,592
Hi, there! It's been way too long!

338
00:18:56,976 --> 00:18:59,268
Miss Kobayashi, this is Quetzalcoatl.

339
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,620
So cool to meet you. Please, call me Lucoa.

340
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,708
I'm gonna assume all dragons look this unrealistic.

341
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:06,183
Huh?

342
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:07,786
Oh, never mind.

343
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,122
It's cool or whatever to meet you, too.

344
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:12,425
Hmm? Everything chill?

345
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:13,766
Yeah, but...

346
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:16,191
Did you walk here wearing that "ensemble"?

347
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,113
Of course I did.

348
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,856
Doesn't really leave a whole
lot to the imagination, does it?

349
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:38,812
You wanna give it a try?

350
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,917
Now, when you get a hit, be sure to move back a little.

351
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:44,825
Just like that.

352
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,081
Oh, you can't attack when he's doing that move.

353
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:49,354
Almost there.

354
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:50,785
Nice work.

355
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,000
Hey, you killed him!

356
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,833
Ignore that treasure chest if you know what's good for ya.

357
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,587
Those things are called mimics.

358
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,300
Sucks. You died.

359
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,407
He's completely hooked, now.

360
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,933
It's great to see Tohru smiling;
She's not normally the type.

361
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:10,462
Hmm?

362
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,664
I assume that's thanks to you.

363
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:15,142
Doubtful. I'm just a normal human being.

364
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,432
Could be what she needed since
she's never had anything normal before.

365
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:20,392
Her friends are the same way.

366
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:26,718
You know, Lucoa. To be honest,
I'm grateful to Tohru, as well.

367
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,573
Truth is... I didn't use to smile very much myself.

368
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,939
I'd never admit that to her, though.

369
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,100
The food's ready, everyone!

370
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,072
Yay!

371
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:41,066
Watch out for her tail. Can I get you anything to drink?

372
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,600
Drink? Yes, thank you.

373
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,953
But, no offense, I'll need to check it for curses.

374
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:46,914
Curses?

375
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,170
Oh, yeah, forever ago, Lucoa,
who was still a goddess at the time,

376
00:20:50,194 --> 00:20:53,000
had some major drama go down thanks
to being forced to drink some alcohol

377
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,010
an ally of hers cursed, which made
her get all sloppy with her sister.

378
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,386
Will you please stop talking?

379
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,176
I'm starting to get that a dragon's past is never good.

380
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,368
For the last time!

381
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,482
When it comes to fancy butler men,

382
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,167
I say give me middle-aged or give me death!

383
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,809
The young, handsome, and devilish
butler has been taking the world

384
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,011
by storm, and say what you will,
but he's here to stay, sister!

385
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:14,983
Stop messing me up.

386
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,638
She's entirely different when she's drunk.

387
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:18,947
Yeah.

388
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,816
Hey, you! You totally wanna be a maid, don't you?

389
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,903
Uhhhh...

390
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,636
You do, too!

391
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,308
I thought I already was one.

392
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,125
I've told you before, that's basic cosplay!

393
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,167
If you don't like the truth, then take it off!

394
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:31,643
Why?!

395
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:32,359
Fafnir!

396
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,918
We must avert our eyes to preserve Tohru's dignity!

397
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:36,206
Please, don't look!

398
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,007
Stop it!

399
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,549
Let go! Grr! I can't see!

400
00:21:39,663 --> 00:21:40,779
Take it off!

401
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:52,809
I love how no one can not move their body to that.

402
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,119
Fafnir, remember to ignore that treasure chest.

403
00:23:28,936 --> 00:23:30,722
Aw. It's a mimic.

404
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,126
No, don't go to that one either.

405
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,595
That was a mimic, too.

406
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,455
Why do you instinctively go after all the treasure?

407
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,142
It's my nature.
