1
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,833
Across from you,
we have Kaiko Mikuniyama,

2
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,375
a manga artist.

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,583
And to her left, Tokuyama,
an editor at Comic Gifted.

4
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,750
Hello. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

5
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,833
[ITSUKI]
Uh, likewise.

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,083
So, we brought the two
of you here today

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,500
so that you can meet
before the project begins.

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,083
If you have any questions
or concerns for each other,

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,625
now's the time to voice them.

10
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:34,916
Don't be shy.

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,750
Hey,

12
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,000
this girl looks like she lives

13
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,458
in her own private wing
of a mansion.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,500
Are you sure
she's a good fit for this?

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,666
I write some pretty
risque scenes, you know.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,833
Don't worry.

17
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,666
Here are the character designs
and sample pages

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,041
we had her draw.

19
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,666
Feel free to take
a look at them.

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,666
[ITSUKI]
Whoa. Whoa!

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,041
So, what do you think of them?

22
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,458
[ITSUKI]
They're spectacular!

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,125
Wow, do you really mean that?

24
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,041
[ITSUKI]
Absolutely!

25
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,833
Thank you so much!

26
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,583
I've been a die-hard fan
of your novels

27
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,458
ever since they first debuted.

28
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,250
So, I was thrilled when I was
offered this opportunity.

29
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,041
-[ITSUKI] For real?
-Yes!

30
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,083
I'm an only child, so I've never
had a little sister of my own,

31
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,583
but I've always wanted
a younger girl to look up to me.

32
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,250
I'm sure you can understand.

33
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,708
So when I started
reading stories

34
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,083
with characters like that,

35
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,875
I became
a little sister enthusiast

36
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,208
before I knew it.

37
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,000
Yeah, that's exactly
what happened with me!

38
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,500
And what really shines
through in your stories

39
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,541
is your true love
for little sisters.

40
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,708
I admire that passion you have.

41
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,833
The description of Hilde's toes
in the scene

42
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,458
where she's walking up
the stairs barefoot

43
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,250
in volume four was true art.

44
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,583
You did not just bring up
the toe scene!

45
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,958
I'm so glad you appreciate

46
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,250
all the hard work
that went into that.

47
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,041
Well, of course, who wouldn't?

48
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,208
Your books aren't like other

49
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,708
little sister series
on the market.

50
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,833
They're just following trends,
but you care!

51
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,041
[ITSUKI laughing]
I completely agree!

52
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,083
By the way, are there any other
little sister characters

53
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,291
you're into at the moment?

54
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,833
[KAIKO]
Well, this is kind of cliche

55
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,375
but from "Eroma"...

56
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,125
That settles it!

57
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,666
Kaiko Mikuniyama,

58
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,833
I can tell that my work
is in good hands with you.

59
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,833
You have my blessing.

60
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,833
I'm honored, Hashima.

61
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,166
I'll give this manga adaptation
100 percent

62
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,833
so that I won't let you down.

63
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,000
[chuckles]

64
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,541
[HARUTO]
Let's see.

65
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,458
Itsuki and I have new volumes
on the shelves.

66
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,541
"Mahou Academy" is getting
a manga adaptation.

67
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,208
"The Spirit Knight
of the Distant World" anime

68
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,416
is about to air.

69
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Miyako and Chihiro
are about to start

70
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,208
a new school year.

71
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,375
Was there anything else
we're celebrating today?

72
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,458
Yeah, Itsuki and I
are getting married!

73
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,875
Will you stop?

74
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,291
All right, then in honor
of all that good stuff,

75
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,416
drink up!

76
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,083
[ALL]
Cheers!

77
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,375
About time your work
got adapted.

78
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,375
I hope the manga
turns out great, man.

79
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:29,625
Hey, thanks, dude.

80
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:30,875
But there's no need to worry.

81
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,708
I'm positive
it'll be a success.

82
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,750
What makes you so confident
about that?

83
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,125
Is the manga artist
they assigned you that talented?

84
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,375
Oh, yeah.

85
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,000
Not only is their art great,

86
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,666
but their love for
little sisters rivals my own.

87
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,791
At this point, I'm convinced
there's no one out there

88
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,208
who understands my work
better than Kaiko does.

89
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,166
I swear, that girl
was made for me!

90
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,541
Hold on. You mean, you've been
going on and on about a girl?

91
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,375
Huh?

92
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,416
I guess?

93
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,291
She's "made for you"?

94
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,500
Hey! Don't get the wrong idea!

95
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,916
What I meant is that
she was made

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
to adapt my story
into a solid manga!

97
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,916
Oh, okay, good!
Then you must mean

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,625
that I'm the one meant
for you after all, right?

99
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,916
[ITSUKI]
How is that related?

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,291
[NAYUTA] Well, no one
in the whole world

101
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,791
loves you as much as I do.

102
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,625
That's always related!

103
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,041
Sure, but you can't even
spend a full day

104
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,833
talking about
little sisters with me.

105
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,333
So, suggesting you're
"meant for me" is laughable.

106
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,000
I admit that I can't keep up
with your little sister talk

107
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,458
most of the time.

108
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,166
But I'll make up for it
with an excess of love!

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,583
[ITSUKI] Hey!
Get off of me, you idiot!

110
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,958
Mind telling me why you're here?

111
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,166
Itsuki let me know that my sake
had arrived and invited me.

112
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,333
For today, let's forget about
our complicated past

113
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,416
and have some fun.

114
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,833
Can you choose your words
a little more carefully?

115
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,166
You're making it sound
like we have history!

116
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,125
I only asked you to do
my stupid taxes last year.

117
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,291
Whatever helps you sleep
at night.

118
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,541
[HARUTO groans]

119
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,750
Anyway, I must say,

120
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,458
this food is simply divine.

121
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,958
I would love to meet the cook.

122
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh, uh...
that's me. I made it.

123
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,958
Huh?

124
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,333
-Uh... [chuckles]
-Very impressive,

125
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,750
considering your age.

126
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,666
Why don't you come work
part-time at my place?

127
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,625
I've been in the market
for a skilled chef.

128
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,916
And you definitely pass
the test.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,666
Well, I, uh...

130
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,541
I'll need to get back
to you on that.

131
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,833
[TOKI gulps]

132
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,041
Aah!

133
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,000
I needed this after
two all-nighters!

134
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,416
Wait. So 48 hours straight?

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,208
[laughs]
While I appreciate the concern,

136
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,541
us editors have to do this
all the time.

137
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,791
All the time?

138
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,958
I had no idea you had
such a tough job.

139
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,291
It's certainly no walk
in the park.

140
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,041
I have an irregular
sleep schedule.

141
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,583
My job uses me.

142
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,583
My author won't write
his damn drafts.

143
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,208
And my illustrator drops off
the face of the planet!

144
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,583
[TOKI grunts]

145
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,125
But, you know...

146
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,250
it's definitely a job
that's worth the stress.

147
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,166
I think the satisfaction I get
when a new book comes out

148
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,875
is equal to that
of the author's.

149

-I gotta say somethin' to you!
-[ITSUKI] Huh?

You do good work
when you really try,

so cut the crap
and try from the outset!

[ITSUKI]
Wha...

Shut up. You don't know me!

154

Maybe I can't do my best
unless I'm feeling the pressure!

155
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,708
[TOKI] Guess I'll have
to fill up your schedule so much

156
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,125
that you'll always feel
the pressure!

157
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,541
[ITSUKI]
You can't be serious,

you sex worker-obsessed freak!

What the hell does that mean?

I'm not obsessed
with sex workers!

161
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,916
I just respect the fact
that they're trying

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,291
-to make an honest living!

Hmm.

165
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,083
Guess nobody's home, huh?

Well, that's all right.

Uhh, I'll be fine!

They wouldn't want me.

[SETSUNA sighs]

177
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,833
I wonder if there's
any cool scenery around here

178
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,291
that I can study.

179
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,250
[SETSUNA]
How cute.

Whoa! Look at that ass go!

181
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,500
That's the kind of backside
you only see once in a lifetime!

182
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,000
If I can study those cheeks,

183
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,375
I'm sure I can pull myself out

184
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,666
of this bad butt-drawing funk!

[SETSUNA]
Yeah, yeah, you!

Can I help you?

00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,500
Will you do me a favor
and show me your ass?

-Ass! Like your butt?

talking about?

Today was a lot of fun.

216
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,541
Hopefully, we'll be able
to enjoy the cherry blossoms

together next year, too.

That sounds like something
a character in a book says

before they end up dead.

You never know how
an author's life will go,

-so let's not joke.

'cause I'll be just fine.

Right.

Oh, there's some roast beef
and other stuff in the fridge,

Man, you've got
such a nice little brother.

I wish I had him
instead of my sister.

We've been over this.
I could never trade Chihiro

Hey, "animal"?

the premiere
at your friend's house?

-Never mind.
-Hmm?

261
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,291
Anyway, we still have
some time before the show.

262
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,250
Why don't we play a game?

263
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,333
Good idea.

264
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,625
[MIYAKO]
What do you want to play?

265
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,083
[HARUTO]
Let's see.

266
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,458
I'm thinking something easy

267
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,916
we can all do while drinking.

268
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,583
What about "Cat &amp; Chocolate:
Blooming Days"?

269
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,000
What kind of game is that?

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,791
It's a card-based party game.

271
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,541
The player uses the items
in their hands

272
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,333
to try and solve
the problem drawn.

273
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,708
The next card
in the deck determines

274
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,000
how many must be used.

275
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,583
No exceptions.

276
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,583
The other players then judge
by majority vote

277
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,250
whether the problem
was solved or not.

278
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,333
[MIYAKO] That actually
sounds pretty hard.

279
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,666
[HARUTO laughing]

280
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,375
You'll get the hang of it
once we play.

281
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,500
Let's get creative
with who goes first.

282
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,708
How about the person who enjoyed
their school life the most?

283
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,916
-Sound good?
-I'm not proud of it.

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,875
But I had virtually
no friends in school.

285
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,375
I became a shut-in
because I was bullied.

286
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,208
The club I joined fell apart

287
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,375
because of relationship drama
between the members.

288
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,500
Damn writers.
[sighs]

289
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,458
Unlike you all,
I'm actually enjoying

290
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,125
my university life somewhat.

291
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,333
The floor is yours.

292
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,875
We'll continue clockwise
from there on.

293
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,541
Sure, sounds good.

294
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,666
So, I just have to solve
whatever problem

295
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,416
I draw with these items.

296
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,208
Okay.

297
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,750
"I forgot my bathing suit."

298
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,916
Then I'm out of luck.

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,416
I guess I'm not
swimming that day.

300
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,666
That's not an option.

301
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,083
You have to use
the items in your hand

302
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,291
to solve the problem.

303
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,958
Oh, right.

304
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,750
I have to use two of them?

305
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,583
Hmm.
[clicks tongue]

306
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,541
Then, first, I'd change
into my gym clothes.

307
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,083
Then...

308
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,291
I'm sorry.

309
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,208
I forgot my bathing suit
at home.

310
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,208
So could I just practice
soccer instead?

311
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,250
I won't fall
for those puppy eyes.

312
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,666
[whistle blows]

313
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,125
Yeah. That probably
would happen.

314
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,833
Hey, it could go differently.

315
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,125
Fine.

316
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,500
Then the entire class
will just have

317
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,166
to play soccer
in the pool today.

318
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,833
And you are to participate

319

-without clothes on.

What the hell was that?

322
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,541
[laughing]

323
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,041
I think that's a bit
of a stretch.

324
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,833
But why don't we move on
to the judging?

325
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,791
Survey says...

326
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,541
-[buzzer sounds]
-[MIYAKO whines]

327
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,791
What was I supposed to do
with these cards?

328
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,875
I'm up.
Watch and learn, kids.

329
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,541
"I accidentally called
my teacher 'Mom,'

330
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,083
and it's awkward."

331
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,500
[laughs]
That's pretty embarrassing.

332
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,166
Especially as
a high school student,

333
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,666
that'd be practically fatal.

334
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,333
Back in middle school,

335
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,500
my mom passed away,

336
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,250
so if we're talking

337
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,833
about a female teacher here,

338
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,666
she may have just
reminded me of her.

339
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,666
So that'd make sense.

340
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,916
-[MIYAKO] Uhh...
-Uh-- I--

341
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,625
Oh, man. Sorry.

342
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,416
I'm sorry, too.

343
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Uh! Don't worry about it!

344
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,875
I, uh, just have
to use one item.

345
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,333
How about this?

346
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,541
I'd just play it off like,
"I didn't mean you,

347
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,541
I thought I saw my mom
out of the corner of my eye,

348
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,541
but it was just
this anatomical model!"

349
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,583
-How's that?
-Uhh, yeah!

350
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,916
-A plus bro!
-Wow, so creative!

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,291
You're amazing, Itsuki!

352
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,375
-Just amazing.
-Yeah.

353
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,791
That works fine.

354
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,208
[HARUTO]
What do we think?

355
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,958
-[bell rings]
-[ALL chuckle nervously]

356
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,166
Okay.

357
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,750
Then it's my turn now.

358
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,916
[HARUTO]
"I can't fix my bedhead,"

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,416
and I have to use three items.

360
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,708
[MIYAKO] I have a "hair
products" card in my hand.

361
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,666
It'd be an easy fix
if you had that.

362
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,291
You can't always have the cards
you need when you need 'em.

363
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,000
That's just part of the game.

364
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,083
Okay. Here's item number one.

365
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,833
First, I'll put on a headband.

366
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,208
[MIYAKO]
Oh, that works!

367
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,041
That way you can pull
your messy hair back!

368
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,833
And number two.

369
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,125
-Killifish!
-[MIYAKO] Hmm?

370
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,458
Killifish?

371
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,750
[HARUTO] I'll put the fish
into a fish bowl,

372
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,208
put the bowl on my head,

373
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,958
and skillfully balance it
so it doesn't fall off.

374
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,333
And last but not least.

375
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,875
A guitar!

376
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,125
[MIYAKO]
What, a guitar?

377
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,041
If I go to school
with a bowl of killifish

378
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,666
on my head
while playing the guitar,

379
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,166
everyone will be too distracted

380
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,458
to notice my bedhead!

381
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,625
[MIYAKO] You're right.
They'll just think

382
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,083
you've gone clinically insane!

383
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,666
Still solved the problem!

384
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,875
Let me have this!
Now, what's the verdict?

385
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,041
[buzzer sounds]

386
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,125
Uh! How is that worthy
of a passing mark?

387
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,291
I don't know. It was
pretty funny to imagine.

388
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,916
-Sure was.
-I don't understand you guys.

389
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,208
That makes it my turn.
Let's do it.

390
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,208
Okay. "I broke the window,"

391
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,333
and I have to solve this
with three item cards.

392
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,541
That's my whole hand.

393
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,041
Hmm?

394
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,541
Fine. Here we go!

395
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,166
-Uh?
-Huh?

396
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,750
[MIYAKO] A fire extinguisher,
dumbbells, and a moped?

397
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,458
What are you gonna do
with these?

398
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,541
First off,
I'm gonna grab the dumbbells,

399
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,083
one in each hand,
and swing 'em around

400
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,250
to break
all of the windows

401
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,458
-that aren't broken yet!
-Huh?

402
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,291
What a great sound.

403
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,583
The windows break into hundreds
of glass pieces,

404
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,125
one after another.

405
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,333
Of course, a teacher
tries to stop me,

406
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,833
but as they tiptoe
around the glass,

407
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,458
I spray them in the face
with the fire extinguisher.

408
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,750
Then while they're down,
I smack them

409
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,000
with a dumbbell
to shut them up.

410
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,708
Uhh, N-Nayu?

411
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,916
I'll demolish
the remaining windows and walls

412
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
with the empty
fire extinguisher

413
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,125
and blood-covered dumbbells
until I'm fully satisfied.

414
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,708
Then, I'll ride the moped
through the halls,

415
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,500
bringing further destruction
and chaos to the school.

416
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,250
Break, break, break!
[laughs]

417
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,166
Every inch of this damn school
needs to be destroyed!

418
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,083
All of those bastards
who refused to offer me

419
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,916
a shred of help
deserve to die!

420
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,916
Get it together, Kanikou!

421
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,541
Uhh! Whoops.

got flipped there, guys.

-Yeah.
-You think?

424
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,625
[HARUTO]
So what's the verdict?

was able to help me back then!

It really makes you think
outside of the box,

but it's a fun game.

pretty creative,

a "white box" copy yesterday.

Uh. Haruto.

[HARUTO] To be honest,
when I got my preview copy

470
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,708
just a day before it aired,
I thought

471
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,750
something like this
might happen.

472

480
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,958
Well! That's over!

481
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,791
What do you say
we get back to drinking?

482
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,000
(liquid pouring)

483
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,083
This is the best beer
I've had in my entire life!

484
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,000
It's so good.

485
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,041
Uhh. I'll be honest with you,

486
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,916
I don't really know
what I should say.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,333
But, I mean, we're not writing
to make an anime, are we?

488
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,208
We're writing to make
great novels!

489
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,291
So forget it!

490
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,291
Even if it looks kinda bad.

491
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,166
You can just... ignore it?

492
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,625
Guess you're right.

493
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,416
I could just forget
about the anime

494
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,791
and concentrate
on writing a good story.

495
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,291
If I can bring myself
to do that, life will be great.

496
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,583
Oh, Fuwa.

497
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,958
You know,

498
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,500
my novel's just a product,

499
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,291
and I tend to treat it
like one, too.

500
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
I wrote it, researching what
things were popular lately

501
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,416
and gained decent
commercial success.

502
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,958
So if some opinionated reader
calls it uninspired

503
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,666
or a troll says it sucks,
it's generic,

504
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,458
or only sells
because of the art.

505
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,625
I don't care.

506
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,708
It doesn't get under my skin.

507
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,541
Who the hell am I kidding?

508
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,125
I just love them.

509
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,291
Adventure stories
with magic and swords.

510
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,625
Everyone fights over
the pretty girl.

511
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,625
People who try their best
are rewarded.

512
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,625
Stories where the nice guy
ends up happy!

513
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,833
That's why I wanted
to write that.

514
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,250
It's not just
some commercial product.

515
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,541
[sobs]

516
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,833
I love it, God damn it.

517
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,708
How else could I have written
thirteen volumes of it!

518
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,000
You bastards!

519
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,416
To the consumers, this might be
another novel out of many.

520
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,375
But to me, it's unique.

521
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,666
It's dear to my heart.

522
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,791
Why can't you people
understand that?

523
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,666
Damn it!

524
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,958
You can go to hell.

525
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,416
Go to hell.
Go to hell!

526
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,458
Go to hell!
Go to hell!

527
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,000
[MIYAKO crying]

528
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,000
Huh?

529
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,000
No. Miyako,
why are you crying?

530
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,208
Did I scare you?

531
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,375
Yeah, what do you have
to cry about?

532
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,833
You're not even an author.

533
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,208
Is it something else?

534
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,083
[CRYING]
No.

535
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,541
It's not something else.

536
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,708
Maybe I don't know how it feels
to have a story

537
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,125
I wrote become an anime.

538
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,541
But, but...
[continues crying]

539
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,166
But I do know how sad I'd be
if something I tried so hard on

540
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,250
didn't work out!

541
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,000
[continues crying]

542
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,750
Haruto?

543
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,250
[HARUTO]
I'm gonna go.

544
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,208
I don't want you guys
to keep seeing me like this.

545
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,083
Okay.

546
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,500
[BOTH chuckle]

547
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,916
[HARUTO]
Thank you, Miyako.

548
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,041
[MIYAKO]
I wonder if he's doing okay.

549
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,208
[ITSUKI]
Who knows?

550
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,833
We all worry about
this possibility.

551
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,208
Uh-huh.

552
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,208
And unfortunately,
this is common.

553
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,083
It's tricky to jump mediums.

554
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,833
I had no idea.

555
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,791
But I know
how sad I'd be

556
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,916
if something I tried
so hard on didn't work out.
