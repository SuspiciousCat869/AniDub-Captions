-Mmm.
-[page turns]

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,333
It is freezing in here.
What gives?

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,625
I know you've got a heater,
crank it up.

00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,458
[ITSUKI]
Been broken since morning.

[sighs]

6
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,500
Just when I needed it most.

7
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,833
[MIYAKO]
When's it getting fixed?

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,375
Three days.

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,333
So for now we're getting by
with this kotatsu,

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,375
but it's pretty hard
to concentrate on work.

11
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,541
It sucks.

12
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,916
That's perfect!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,875
Huh?

14
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,375
How about something like this?

15
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:37,708
Hmm?

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,416
Uh... How could I forget
about such a classic?

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,833
Hey, it happens.

18
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,041
-Uhh...
-[ITSUKI chuckles]

19
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,916
You wanna go to the beach
in winter?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,250
Well, you see how good
this looks?

21
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,458
I bet the author went to a beach

22
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,125
in Okinawa for research.

23
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,875
-Oh.
-[line ringing]

24

[HARUTO on phone]
What's happenin', Itsuki?

25
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,958
Hey, Haruto.

26
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,250
Not much, not much.

27
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,208
Just thinkin' about taking
a little trip.

28
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,916
-Wanna come?
-[HARUTO] Huh? To where?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,458
Okinawa.

30
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,458
[HARUTO]
What?

31
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
Okinawa!

32
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,833
Ahh--

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,083
The temperature is
seventeen degrees Celsius.

34
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,166
It's almost like winter
doesn't exist here.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,541
Ah.

36
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
I'm beginning to suspect
that you actually wanted

37
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,833
to come here
to avoid three days

38
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,666
in that ice box
of an apartment.

39
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,958
And how did you convince me
to come with you, again?

40
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,500
Spend all your time complaining
and you won't have any fun.

41
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,916
Cheer up!

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,166
It would have been a waste
if you didn't come.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,250
The off-season makes it
cheap to book.

44
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,333
Just like how it's a waste
that Haruto didn't skip

45
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,291
his anime script meeting
to come, too.

46
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,916
[HARUTO]
Man, Okinawa.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,083
I'm jealous.

48
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,416
This beer is good on its own,
but pair it with goya champloo

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
and it's something else
entirely!

50
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,708
Yeah!

51
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,000
I was trying to imagine what
hibiscus beer would taste like,

52
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,333
but I was way off.

53
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,666
Turns out it's sweet,
tart, and delicious!

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,208
Hmm. I wanna have a taste, too.

55
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,125
No. The drinking age
is twenty, remember?

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,041
A couple more years and you can
retire your juice box, kid.

57
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,416
You know,
I might as well ask.

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,333
Is the fact that you see me
as a kid related

59
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,166
to why you don't see me
as a potential lover?

60
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,791
[spurts]
Uhh...

I'm sorry, I can't hear you
very well.

63
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,166
You're gonna have
to speak louder.

64
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,125
Yeah, you're fighting
an uphill battle

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,791
if you want to convince me
that you didn't hear that

66
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,708
when you literally did
a spit-take.

67
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,458
It's not my fault
you weren't loud enough.

68
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,083
Is the fact that you see me
as a kid related

69
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,625
to why you don't see me
as a potential lover?

70
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:20,000
Was that loud enough
or do you need a hearing aid?

71
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,458
I saw your mouth move
but nothing came out.

72
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,791
Maybe the music's too loud.

with me sometime?

-We could just bang.
-I don't know,

It's Natsume Soseki's take
on "I love yo--"

Yes, I do.

It's a quote I recognize
and chose to ignore.

Ah, classic Itsuki.

some of that beer.

just shove your huevos

in an innocent girl's face
like that.

Not too bad.

how do you feel about Nayu?

[ITSUKI]
She's a perv.

126
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,375
Well, yes, but that's not
what I meant.

127
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,583
She says she loves you
all the time.

128
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,958
So, like...

129
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,541
do you ever think about
going out with her?

130
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,750
There's not too much
to think about.

131
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,875
Especially when I gave her
a straight answer ages ago.

132
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,041
Turned her down, of course.

133

[gasps]
You did?

00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,041
Back when?

135
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,666
To answer your question
from the other day,

136
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,583
sorry, but I can't
go out with you.

[sobbing softly]

139
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,541
The day after I rejected her,

140
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,750
she started paying me
regular visits.

141
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,958
And here we are.

142
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,041
Oh.

143
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,541
What's that look for?

144
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,000
Well...

145
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,833
until hearing
your side of the story,

146
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,458
I just assumed you were
a jerk leading her on.

147
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,083
I'm glad that's not the case.

148
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,041
I can't believe
you thought I'd do that.

149
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,000
So then is it safe to assume
that you don't have

150
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,791
any feelings for Nayu at all?

151
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,125
That's a silly question.

152
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,291
I'll tell you one thing,
it'd be a hell of a lot easier

153
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,625
if I didn't care
for her at all.

154
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,583
Yeah.

155
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,583
So have you ever read any
of Kanikou's books at all?

156
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,458
Not really.

157
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,833
If you don't have any plans

158
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,333
to become a novelist yourself,

159
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,708
you should
give 'em a chance.

160
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,250
Honestly, you're missin' out
on something good

161
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,416
if you don't.

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,125
I mean it.
If you can find the time

163
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,541
to read my stuff,

164
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,666
read hers instead.

165
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,125
It's a better use of your time.

166
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,625
[snoring]

167
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,625
You have been busy.

168
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,791
Haven't you?

169
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,750
[MIYAKO] So it sounds like
we're definitely hitting up

170
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,916
Shuri Castle
and Churaumi Aquarium,

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,666
but where else
do you two want to go?

172
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,166
-Deserted island.
-Huh?

173
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,875
Well, there's a part in my story

174
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,458
where the characters end up
on a deserted island.

175
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,666
So I'd like to do some research
for that while I'm here.

176
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,083
Hmm?

177
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
I don't know about deserted.

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,375
How about a remote one?

179
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,708
Uh!

180
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,166
Check please!

181
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,333
[NAYUTA]
The ocean!

[BOTH laughing]

183
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,708
Ooh, the water's so cold.

184
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,041
I don't care if it's cold. We're
here. We gotta go swimming!

185
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,625
[MIYAKO] How do we do that?
We don't even have swimsuits.

186
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,583
[NAYUTA] We don't need
no stupid swimsuits.

187
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,500
No one's here to see anyway.

188
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,833
Whoa, Nayu what are
you doing? Stop it!

189
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,166
Itsuki! Turn around
and don't look back!

190
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,333
[ITSUKI]
Splash!

191
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,125
Girl! Would you put
your clothes back on?

192
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,125
It's freezing.

193
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,125
Duh! We dipped our feet in it!

194
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,500
Actually, I'm starting
to get used to it.

195
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,791
Come on.
You're turn, hop in!

196
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,500
Stop splashing.
You're getting me wet!

197
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,083
Itsuki, get your butt
in the water!

198
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,333
Don't be stupid.

[laughing]

200
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,541
[MIYAKO[ I wonder if my world
will ever be radiant

201
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,208
and carefree like that.

202
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,541
Sorry, did you say
something, Myaa?

203
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,958
Oh, it was nothing.

204
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,208
Itsuki, I've still got
my eye on you.

205
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,416
I'll break your collarbone
if I catch you peeking!

206
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,958
[ITSUKI]
I'm good, thanks!

207
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,833
[shuddering]
It's so cold!

208
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,750
What's up?

209
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
[NAYUTA]
Well, I was just thinking.

210
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,458
It's not like it's
the first time I've noticed,

211
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,541
but your body is well-toned.

212
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,208
Did you used to play sports?

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,166
[MIYAKO]
I did karate from grade school

214
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,041
until halfway
through middle school.

215
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,291
Then played tennis,
and was on the basketball team

216
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,375
in high school.

217
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,083
Though I didn't really want to.

218
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,000
[GIRL] You'll never get popular
doing karate.

219
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,500
That's not exactly my priority.

220
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
And besides, my sensei told me
that I have a lot of potential.

221
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,250
Whoa. Then are you gonna try
for the Olympics or something?

222
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,375
I don't know
about going that far.

223
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,166
[GIRL] Then just join
the tennis club with me!

224
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,333
It'll be fun!

225
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
[MIYAKO] I wonder
what would have happened

226
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,291
if I had stuck with karate.

227
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,833
Maybe I would have been able
to make something of myself.

228
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,625
Or maybe
I would have just given up

229
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,041
at some point along the way

230
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,625
and ended up exactly
where I am now.

231
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,250
Hey, that's cold!
Now you've done it!

This is so crazy?

That's the sound
of my friends having fun

behind a rock.

to save you or anything.

Now we can get married.

that I have sharkskin?

That's never been a problem.

00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,500
Whoa's right!

255
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,500
This is my new work,
inspired by the whale shark

256
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,291
that shook me
to the core in Okinawa.

257
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,166
Titled: "The Whale Shark's
Little Sister!"

258
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,375
Hell yeah!

259
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,500
This is seriously
some quality stuff!

260
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,708
[laughs]
See, you're a man of culture.

261
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,875
Unlike my editor, who skimmed
and rejected it on the spot.

262
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,500
[SETSUNA] Wait, but how do
their pieces fit together

263
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,541
when they're
from two different puzzles?

264
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,083
I saw a show
about salmon spawning,

265
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,291
and they just sprayed
their seed all over the eggs.

266
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,833
Which is not what we do.

267
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,583
Sharks may be fish, but their
eggs are internally fertilized.

268
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,166
So they've got
the right parts.

269
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,750
For real?
So shark dicks are a thing?

270
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,166
Uh-huh. And I've got it
all planned out.

271
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,666
In the final scene,
when the protagonist

272
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,791
and heroine get together,
it's a beautiful moment

273
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,041
that can only be conveyed
through the eyes of a shark.

274
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,833
Yet my editor refuses to push
the envelope a little.

275
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,375
Give me a second, I got to draw.

276
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,666
Wait, right now?

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
-Hmm.

Uh...

280
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,208
This looks...

281
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,041
I want some salmon roe.

282
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,666
What? Why's that?

283
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,375
We were just talking about
fish eggs and stuff, remember?

284
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,333
The topic must have
made me hungry, that's all.

285
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,750
Okay, then go eat some.

286
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,625
Oh, you can't tell me
you don't wanna come too!

287
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,958
Hmm?

288
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,000
I thought we would just hit up

289
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
a conveyer belt
sushi place nearby.

290
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,125
And somehow, we're here.

291
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,333
[SETSUNA]
We wanted salmon roe,

292
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,875
and Hokkaido's got
the best there is!

293
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,500
[ITSUKI] Then explain to me
why we ended up

294
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,625
at a ramen place!

295
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,916
[SETSUNA]
As we were passing by,

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
I saw the ramen
and it so looked good,

297
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,750
my stomach changed its mind.

298
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,291

Whatever.

Okay, this is pretty good.

301
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,291
[SETSUNA]
Mm-hmm.

302
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,958
[ITSUKI] You know what?
On second thought,

303
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,333
we came all the way out here,

304
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,041
we might as well make
the most of it.

I can't feel my face.

308
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Hey, how much farther do we
have to walk to this hotel?

309
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,250
Hmm? I-I think
it's just up ahead.

310
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,541
I'm dreading
even having to ask this

311
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,291
but you do know
where the hotel is, right?

312
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,958
You worry too much!

313

I'm, like, seventy percent sure
it's in this direction.

Seventy?

315

We've got maps, you know.

Let me see.

It's in the complete
opposite direction, you dumbass!
