00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,750
Oh, good, it's just you, Miyako.

3
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,166
On your way somewhere?

00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,666
Karaoke.

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,875
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,958
Well, in that case,
do you mind if I tag along?

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,041
[MIYAKO]
So, aren't you gonna sing?

8
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,708
No, I'm way too busy
to be fooling around.

9
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,458
I don't really understand
why we're here then.

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,000
Duh. Because it's safe and he'll
find me at my apartment.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,541
-Who will?
-You know, my editor.

12
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,625
I take it your deadline
is fast approaching, then?

13
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,125
Well, one of them is.

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,125
In actuality,
there are two deadlines.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,208
Okay, now you've lost me.

16
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,250
[ITSUKI] There's the deadline
where you have some wiggle room

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,750
in case some unforeseen
circumstances arise:

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,333
The tentative deadline.

19
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,083
But then,
there's the dangerous one

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,041
that, if missed, may prevent you
from releasing your book:

21
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,625
The true deadline.

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,291
[MIYAKO]
I feel like I know the answer,

23
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,625
but which of those
are you about to miss?

24
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,958
The true deadline.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,125

-[MIYAKO gasps]
-No way!

27

How'd you find me?

28
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,625
In preparation for this,

29
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,125
I messed with
your phone's settings

30
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,541
so I'd be able to locate you
any time I need to.

31
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,250
I'm pretty sure
that's illegal!

32
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,000
I'd do anything for the sake
of releasing a book.

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,833
Just like a good editor should.

34
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,041
Now get your things.
You're writing at the office

35

and you're not leaving
until you're done.

Let go of me!
Picking me up like a kid.

37
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
I'm a proud man,
and I will not have this!

38

[TOKI]
Oh, you're so proud

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,583
of missing
your deadlines constantly?

00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,083
Come on, dumbass. Let's go.

41
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,708

Just hear me out, man.

-Sorry for making a scene.
-Ow, ow, ow!

Your name is Shirakawa,
I get that right?

45
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,041
The next time this ass tries
to run away from his work,

46
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,583
do me a favor
and let me know.

47
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,458
[MIYAKO]
Uhh... will do.

48
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,708
I don't get
the writing business.

00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,166
Like, for real this time.

50

Now, I'm sure you're wondering
why we called you in today.

by any chance?

Oh, hello!
It's nice to hear from you.

Yes. Yes,

Well, if there's one thing

people should be looking
forward to the most,

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,833
it's the intense battle scenes
that you can only see

62
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,625
in a visual medium
like an anime.

You're not going home
until you finish writing this.

This is pointless. I'll never
be able to finish in time!

I might as well run away.

in that box, dude?

Oh, it's just you, Setsuna.

from the same guy I am?

Nope. I just had
a regular meeting today

and was about to head home.

Oh! I just got an idea!

Why don't you and me get outta
here and go booty-watching?

[ITSUKI] Well, here I am.
In a mixed-bath hot spring inn.

My editor's gonna kill me
if he finds out.

But he can't. I turned off
the GPS on my phone,

so my virtual shackles
are gone.

of booty soup waiting!

-Reference and motivation!

a lot of tail in the series

working on, right?

Yeah, I guess so.
But what about it?

As of late, all my buns
have been comin' out the same.

It's like I've hit some sort
of artistic butt rut.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
So naturally, I want to stare

for inspiration!

00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,750
a tracking device
on your clothes.

161
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,125
Where'd you even get that?

162
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,666
I told you before...

163
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,916
if it's to get this book out,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,875
I will do...
whatever it takes.

165
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,833
[ITSUKI whimpering]

166
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,125
[screaming]

167
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,375
[grunts]

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,625
What gives?

169
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,291
This will be your workplace
for the foreseeable future.

170
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,416
You've gotta be kidding me.

171
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,958
What--
What fresh hell is this?

172
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,083
This is a special room
where we trap--

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
where we put
authors and artists

174
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,583
so they can concentrate
on their work.

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,500
You can't be serious!

176
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,541
I refuse to work
in this dungeon!

177
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,833
Why can't you just put me up

178
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,541
in a hotel room
like you do with Kanikou?

179
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,041
Only authors who have had
their work made into anime

180
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,208
or top the sales charts
are awarded such luxuries.

181
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,750
You've got three days.

182
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,875
That's when we hit
the real final deadline.

183
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,375
-Got it?
-Uhh...

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,875
What happens if I don't make it?

185
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,333
I'll kill you.

186
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,541
You'll... You'll what?

187
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,250
[TOKI]
You heard me. See ya.

188
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,166
I'll let you out
once you've finished.

189
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,416
Hold on a minute!

190
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,250
How am I supposed
to go to the bathroom?

191
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,708
[ITSUKI]
Don't tell me.

192
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,125
Feel free to use
that box at your leisure.

193
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,458
Just think of it
as another way

194
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
to maximize
your remaining days for work.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Can't have you wasting time
walking down the hall.

196
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,375
This is insane!
Let me out of here!

197
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,708
I mean, please let me out!
I'll be good. I promise!

198
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,291
[sobbing]
Please!

199
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,791
This can't be real.

200
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,833
Did he actually lock me
in this prison cell?

201
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,916
The only choice
I have is to write.

202
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
Uh...

203
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,000
[groans]

204
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,458

Uh!

209
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
What the hell
are these monsters?

210
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,083
[roaring]

211
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,041
[SIEG]
My hands are shaking.

212
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,000
Am I actually experiencing fear?

213
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,916
[roars]

214
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916

[breathing heavily]

[typing]

218
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,291
[ITSUKI]
I have to hurry up and finish,

219
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,750
or I'm gonna die.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,125
[panting]

221
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,791
[SIEG] I don't want to die.
Hilde. Hilde!

222
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,500
[snickers]

223
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,666
You look pathetic, vermin.

224
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
It's Chrom!

225
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm not letting you
escape me again.

226
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,666
This is where you die, Sieg!

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,958
[roaring]

228
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,416
[shuddering, screaming]

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,541
[TOKI] I'm not letting you
escape me again, Itsuki!

230
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,416
[screaming]

231
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,583
Just a dream.

232
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,833
A dream?
I wasted all that time.

233
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
-[HARUTO] Hey!
-Huh?

234
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,666
-Itsuki!
-Haruto?

235
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,375
You okay in there?

236
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,083
[ITSUKI]
I'd be lying if I said I was.

237
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,000
You sound so defeated, man.

238
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,291
You know, you might
get away with giving up.

239
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,208
The editors aren't
completely heartless.

240
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,333
If you honestly can't do it,

241
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,833
I'm sure
they'll delay the release.

242
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,416
That reminds me, your new volume
comes out in March too, right?

243
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,583
Yeah. But mine's already
well past the revision stage.

244
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,500
[grunts]

245
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,375
So, what are you gonna do?
Wanna give up?

246
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,583
Not yet. I'll keep
grinding away for a while.

247
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,333
All right. Good luck.

248
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,791
Thanks.

249
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,541
I'm gonna finish this
as fast as possible

250
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,291
so I can escape this hellhole.

251
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,000
[chuckles]

252
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,916
By the way, they don't let you
use cell phones in there, right?

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,041
Want me to deliver any messages
to Chihiro or Nayu for you?

254
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,625
[ITSUKI]
Hmm?

255
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Just tell them not to worry.

256
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,958
Roger. Well, you can do it.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,375
Okay. I'm not letting them
get any further ahead of me.

258
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,708
[typing]

259
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,708
[ITSUKI] Somehow, I made it
to the climax in one piece.

260
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,208
But I can't write a scene
that I'm satisfied with.

261
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,208
Damn it!
I'm so close to finishing this!

262
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,291
-[HARUTO] Itsuki.
-Uh?

263
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,125
I didn't think
you'd come back again.

264
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,291
Well, I had
to deliver your gifts.

265
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,791
First, a lunch
that Chihiro made for you.

266
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,833
I made some food.

267
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,083
Can you take it
to my big brother for me?

268
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,083
Sure thing.
I bet it'll lift his spirits.

269
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,791
I hope so.
I know it's not much,

270
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,333
but I want to help
any way that I can.

271
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,000
Though I'm sure my brother
will be fine no matter what.

272
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,875
Chihiro.

273
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,250
[HARUTO]
And second, some more

274
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,875
Valentine's chocolates
from your readers.

275
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,083
-Better late than never.
-[ITSUKI] Ohh!

276
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,583
Thank you so much
for bringing me these.

277
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,625
Also, tell Chihiro
I said thanks.

278
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
Will do. Hey,

279
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,583
let's all get together
for drinks at your place soon.

280
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
[ITSUKI]
Yeah.

281
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,833
Whoa!

282
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,916
Huh?

283
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,625
Uh!

284
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,291
[MIYAKO] Do your best
on your manuscript.

285
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,041
[NAYUTA] When you get back,
let's go to a hot spring.

286
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,000
From your loving wife.

287
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,083
[chuckles]

288
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,375
Whatever, kid.

289
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,083
[moans]

290
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, man, this is so good!

291
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,541
[eating noisily]

292
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,708
Oh, this chocolate
is delicious too.

293
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,625
All right.

294
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,041
This battle decides my fate!

295
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,000
[CHROM laughing]

296
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,958
It looks like this will be
the end of your story.

297
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,916
Now doesn't it, Sieg?

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,750
[SIEG gasping]

299
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,958
Ah!

300
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,375
[panting]

301
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
[NOBUSHIGE]
Are you giving up, Sieg?

302
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,708
[YUUNA] If my brother thinks
you're strong, then so do I!

303
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,625
[HILDE]
You can't lose, big brother!

304
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,041
I want you to come back to me!

305
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,166
[SIEG]
Hilde.

306
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,333
[ITSUKI] When this is over,
I want to eat

307
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,208
Chihiro's delicious food again!

308
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,916
[SIEG] When this is over,
I want to eat

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,750
Hilde's disgusting food again!

310
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
[ITSUKI]
I want to drink and play games

311
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
with Haruto and Miyako again!

312
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
And go on trips with Setsuna!

313
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,583
[SIEG] I want to spar
with Nobushige and Yuuna again!

314
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,791
[ITSUKI] I want Ashley
to call me "big brother" again!

315
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,208
[SIEG] I want Hilde to call me
"big brother" again!

316
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,666
[ITSUKI]
I want to see Kanikou again!

317
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,041
[SIEG]
I want to see Hilde again!

318
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:15,208
No matter what, I'm going
to make it back to Hilde.

319
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,791
I refuse to be beaten by you!

320
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,666
[ITSUKI] I'm going home,
getting drunk, and going to bed!

321
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,416
I refuse to be beaten
by this deadline!

322
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,083
That's impossible!

323
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,583
How do you have
the strength to stand?

324
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,833
How can you still
bring yourself to fight?

325
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
[screaming]

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,666
[screaming]

327
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
[ITSUKI/SIEG]
'Cause this is my will.

328
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
The strength of us all!

329
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:43,000
True power!

330
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,291
[typing]

331
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,416
[ITSUKI]
Uhh...

332
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,583
It's done.

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,041
I finally finished it.

334
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,083
And there's no doubt about it.

335
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,500
This is my strongest,

336
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,833
most well-written piece
of literature to date!

337
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,750
[laughing]

338
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
Hell yeah!
I'm the best!

339
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,583
I'm so brilliant,
I scare myself sometimes!

340
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,541
[continues laughing]

341
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
-[chair clatters]
-[ITSUKI grunts]

342
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,791
Just you wait, "Mahou" fans.

343
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,833
I'm giving you
the greatest masterpiece yet

344
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,791
as thanks for... your gifts.

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,708
[ITSUKI] Check it out.
They've got 'em all on display.

346
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,958
I don't know about you,
but I'm always nervous

347
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,458
on a new release date.

348
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,250
It's been four whole years
since I debuted.

349
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
But this feeling
just never goes away.

350
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, got that right.

351
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,208
Yes, buy it. Buy it!
You know you want to.

352
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[inhales sharply]
Uhh...

353
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,458
Huh?

354
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,750
[groans]

355
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,666
-Huh?
-[HARUTO] Hmm?

356
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,041
-Ha!
-[grunts]

357
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,708
-Is that one any good?
-Yeah, I like it.

358
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,375
Heh! Well, clearly, that guy
has damn good taste.

359
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,625
Good for you.

360
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,125
Ha!

361
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,833
[grunts]

362
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,291
Uhh...

363
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
[ice cubes clink]

364
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,083
[drawn-out groan]

365
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,375
Come on, man.
Don't let it get to you.

366
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,875
My book has
the soon-to-be-an-anime bump.

367
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,458
Plus, it comes
with exclusive swag

368
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
depending on where you buy it.

369
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,166
We shouldn't be comparing
our sales

370
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,333
when I have
an unfair advantage.

371
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,458
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

372
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,083
This is nothing new.

373
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,000
But it's still frustrating.

374
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,250
A lot.

375
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,708
I can understand that.

376
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,916
Plus, this new volume is the
best work I've ever produced.

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,166
I had to suffer
to make it happen.

378
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,166
But I feel more accomplished
than ever before.

379
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,166
My efforts have never yielded
such positive results.

380
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,000
-I'm glad.
-Know what?

381
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,041
I'll even say that this is
the universe's best book.

382
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,250
Your "Spirit Knight
of the Distant Sea" thirteen?

383
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,750
It's crap next
to "Mahou Academy" five.

384
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
Best in the whole universe, eh?

385
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,458
You know, it's funny,
I actually find my series

386
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,166
to be better than yours, too.

387
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,125
Which means I'm the best
in the universe.

388
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,375
[BOTH chuckle]

389
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Well, I'll win soon.

390
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,125
[HARUTO] You took the words
right out of my mouth.

391
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,416
Huh?

392
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,916
Nothing. So!

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,666
Since I'm the one
with the anime series,

394
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,583
food's on me today.

395
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,791
Are you serious?

396
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,208
Then I'm ordering me some cake!

397
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,666
[buzzing]

398
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,875
Uhh!

399
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,250
What are you worried about?

400
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,541
Your book came out
on time, didn't it?

401
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
Sorry, I guess
it's a force of habit.

402
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,291
Yeah?

403
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,500
[TOKI on phone]
Hey, Itsuki, can we talk?

404
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,208
There's something
I need to tell you.

405
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,416
Uh, sure, what's going on?

406
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
[TOKI] Trust me, this is
nothing to be scared of.

407
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,916
Congratulations.

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,500
They've decided "Mahou Academy"
will be made into a manga.

409
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,833
Uhh...
