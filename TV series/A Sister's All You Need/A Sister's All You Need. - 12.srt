When I was in sixth grade,

2
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,583
my mother was so ill
she had to be hospitalized.

3
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:20,833
On top of that, my father would
come home late because of work,

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,833
so we hired a housekeeper.

[MITAHORA]
You can't always

6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,291
leave your
vegetables on the plate.

7
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,041
[ITSUKI]
I told you I don't like them,

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,125
Miss Mitahora.

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,791
I asked you not to put them in.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,250
Do you want to grow up to be
big and strong, or not?

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,916
Thought so. Eat up.

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,333
You look tougher already!

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,125
Could you at least
stop cooking carrots

14
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,291
and green peppers
into the meat?

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,916
It tastes weird.

[sighs]

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,291
My second year of middle school,
my mother passed away.

18
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,083
I couldn't make any friends,

19
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,083
with how pathetic
I looked all the time.

20
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,708
So...

21
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,208
I always went straight home
after school and read books.

22
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,916
When a book really sucked me in,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,333
I could leave my harsh
life behind for a bit.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,208
I fell in love with all
of the beautiful girls

25
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,625
in these stories.

26
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,833
And I often took
the most interest

27
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,500
in the little sister characters.

28
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,916
[sighs]

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,916
If I were the author,
I'd have the protagonist

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,958
and the little sister
get together.

31
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,833
Not that I could ever
write a novel.

Nice to meet you!

Like...? Oh!

38
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,250
Yeah!

39
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,250
Like your housekeeper.
I'm her daughter!

40

Freshman in high school!

41
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,875
And you must be Itsuki Hashima.

42
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah, that would be me.

43
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,791
What are you doing here?

44
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,875
I just came to
hang out with you.

45
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,291
What? Hang out?

46
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,416
I heard that you've
been down lately.

47
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,375
So I came to try
and cheer you up!

48
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,458
Our housekeeper sent
her daughter to cheer me up?

49
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:12,041
That's kinda strange.

50
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,125
No, she had nothing
to do with this.

51
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,666
I came here all on my own.

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,833
-Uh.
-[giggles]

53
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:20,583
She almost never stops
talking about you at home

54
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,125
so I had to come meet you.

55
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,333
Like how you got
a hundred on a test,

56
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,583
and how good a kid you are
for doing your homework.

57
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,291
She's always comparing me
with you,

58
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,750
like we're both her kids.

59
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,333
So naturally,

60
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,791
I started to think of you
as my responsible little bro.

61
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,750
I don't know if I'm happy
to be thought of like that.

62
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,958
Who wouldn't be worried
if someone they considered

63
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,333
a little brother
was feeling down?

64
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,750
I couldn't allow that.

65
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,291
So here I am!

66
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,333
Wow that's really... nice.

67
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,833
This came out of nowhere,
so obviously I was shocked.

68
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,916
But she was going out of her way
to help a total stranger,

and heroines of the stories

[AYANE] Wow, you sure have
a lot of manga.

72
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,125
[ITSUKI] They aren't manga,
they're novels.

73
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,458
Not that it matters.

74
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,666
[AYANE]
Oh, really? Hmm.

75
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,375
I didn't know they made
novels like this.

76
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,083
Yeah, that one's a little off.
Not my usual stuff.

77
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,041
Oh, I get it,
you're embarrassed.

78
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,666
Trust me,
there's no reason to be.

79
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,333
I borrow indecent manga
from my friends all the time.

80
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,000
Really? You do?

81
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,333
Um-hmm.

Maybe I'll try reading
some of these, too.

Thanks!

One sec, I'll find something.

Hmm.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,958
Since you're new, let's start
with a shorter story.

91
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
Maybe a light fantasy?

92
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,750
I bet you'd connect with
a school story more.

93
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,666
Maybe you'd prefer
a female protagonist, too.

94
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,583
Come on, you don't have to
devote so much energy to it.

95
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,916
Of course I do.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,500
Hmm?

97
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,375
Well, what if you don't like
the one I pick out?

98
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,541
You can just let me
borrow something else.

99
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,000
But for now, I think I'd like

100
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,208
to read the one
you're most into at the moment.

101
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,500
[ITSUKI]
The one that I'm the most into?

00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,916
[AYANE]
Yeah.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,250

Ayane Mitahora came over
to my house every week.

117
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,916
She was a pretty high school
girl who'd hang out with me.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,583
We'd talk about light novels.

119
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,083
She'd even cosplay for me,
every once in a while.

120
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,958
So, as you might expect,

and got rejected.

Yeah.

135

What kind of person are they?

He's a boy in
the same class as me.

super good-looking,

and he works
in the library.

I think I must have
fallen for him

00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,583
about him ever since.

144
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,916
He was always working hard,

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
even when the other kids
fooled around

146
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,833
instead of getting ready
for the cultural fair.

147
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,083
And he's the only one who really
cleaned up when it was over.

148
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,500
But he'd go straight home

149
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,916
as soon as he was done
with his assigned task.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,833
He never quite followed
the crowd--

151
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,291
Okay, I get it!

152
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,375
You're the one
who asked about it.

153
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,875
I...

154
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,791
-Uh.
-Uh.

155
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,083
I like you a whole lot, Ayane.

156
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,625
Huh?

157
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,125
You know.
I mean I like, like you.

158
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,000
So will you go out with me?

159
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,291
I'm sorry.

Wait, what do you mean?

162

I'd bet anything that I've read
more light novels than that guy.

163
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,583
And I'm not super

00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,916
and extra bonuses
when you roll the die.

324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,708
Huh. That sounds good.

325
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,458
I just made one million
because of reprints.

326
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,583
I failed to debut again.

327
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,583
Uhh.
Just 200,000 again.

328
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,750
Uploaded a novel online.

329
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,666
Nothing really happens.

330
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,125
Rejected again.

331
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,333
Rejected again!

332
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,916
Again.

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,291
Again!

334
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,500
Rejected... again.

335
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,958
Dude, give it up.

336
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,208
Go try the minor
or mid-level labels.

337
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,750
No way!

338
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,666
I'm sure if I don't give up,
my dreams will come true!

339
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,708
But you're letting everyone else
get way ahead of you here.

340
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,458
Like for example: Nayu,
how much money do you have?

341
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,416
Something like
20 million yen.

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,000
-[ITSUKI] Twenty mil?
-Major labels, man.

343
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,333
And all I've got is 300,000
from my side gig.

344
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,458
But you're still the most
popular one of us,

345
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
aren't you, Fuwa?

346
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,000
[MIYAKO] I guess each route
is a little different.

347
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,416
You don't earn much on
the internet novelist route,

348
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
but it's easy
to get popular.

349
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,666
You have a lot of money
and popularity at a major label,

350
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,583
but neither at a minor.

351
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,916
Yeah, sorry for being
such a winner.

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,541
But you'll get used to it.

353
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
[dice clatter]

354
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,583
Let's see.

355
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,958
I missed a deadline,
so I miss five turns,

356
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,541
and lose three happiness points?

357
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
Don't you think that's
a bit too harsh

358
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,041
for just missing a deadline?

359
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,500
[MIYAKO]
What do you mean "just"?

360
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,375
At major labels, publishing
gets really strict.

361
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,958
I've heard that if
you miss a deadline,

362
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,875
they might not let you release
a book for another year.

363
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,208
Well, good to know it's not all
sunshine and rainbows there.

364
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,958
I think I'll go for
a mid-level label now.

365
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,458
What ever happened
to following your dreams?

366
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,166
[ITSUKI]
Oh. Six.

367
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey.

368
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,875
I just got an offer
from a mid-level label.

369
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,250
[sighs]

370
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,958
Being a 'net novelist
is pretty comfortable.

371
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,291
But you know what?
I'm goin' for it.

372
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,375
My series is now an anime!

373
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,458
And I get two million yen,
too, yeah!

374
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,416
They're making my series
into a live-action movie!

375
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
And I get a million yen!

376
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,416
But I miss two turns and lose
three happiness points?

377
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,458
Wait, what's going on?

378
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,791
These stupid trolls
are flooding my blog!

379
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,666
If my popularity
is higher than six,

380
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,958
I lose three happiness points,
miss two turns,

381
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,458
and my popularity rank
drops by two?

382
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,291
What did I do to deserve
such a terrible fate?

383
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,625
Win a million betting on horses?

384
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,416
What does that have to do
with being a writer?

385
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,250
My editor lost my manuscript!

386
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,833
I miss two turns and lose
five happiness points?

387
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,083
[ITSUKI]
Oof.

388
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,833
That's pretty depressing.

389
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,416
[CHIHIRO] My media venture
falls through

390
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,333
because my editor screwed up.

391
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,791
Minus five happiness points.

392
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,041
Could you not, editor?

393
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,458
I kinda feel bad.

394
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,958
I know this is a game,

395
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,291
and you just drew a
completely random unlucky event,

396
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,291
but I'm still sorry
about your editor.

397
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,833
My anime was a failure.

398
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,291
Minus five happiness points.

399
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey look.
Just like me.

400
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,500
Looks like my publisher
got bought out.

401
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,541
And now I get to go
to a major label

402
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,500
and start a brand new story.

403
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,583
I'm not sure if this is
a good thing or a bad thing.

404
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
[CHIHIRO] Because
the protagonist of my book

405
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,208
didn't end up
with the heroine they wanted,

406
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,000
I ended up getting a stalker.

407
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:24,041
So I lose three turns and four
points from my happiness meter.

408
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,291
Geez, a stalker?

409
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,083
Does that kind of thing
actually happen?

410
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,000
[TOKI] And things
only got worse from there

411
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,958
for our band
of troubled writers.

412
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,208
Until...

413
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,041
Finally done!

414
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,833
[CHIHIRO]
I swear, I had no idea

415
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,458
want the readers wanted
from me after a while.

416
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,166
[HARUTO] I never should have
published my book.

417
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,416
I should have just treasured
my time on the internet scene.

418
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,583
[MIYAKO]
So who won this thing, anyway?

419
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,041
Didn't we say that the person

420
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,791
with the most
happiness points wins?

421
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,291
[MIYAKO] Wait,
everyone's in the negatives?

422
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,458
[CHIHIRO]
Makes sense.

423
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,000
Most of the events
took points away.

424
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,583
I barely remember
anything positive.

425
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,166
Yeah, and since
Itsuki took forever to debut,

426
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,750
he just didn't have
as many chances

427
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,500
for anything bad
to happen to him.

428
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,625
I know I won the game
and everything,

429
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,875
but I don't feel good.

430
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,500
And this game is...

431
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,875
Yeah.

432
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,541
It's pretty damn realistic.

433
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
I hate to say it,

434
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,125
but I have seen most of
the game's events happen.

435
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,375
What? That's crazy!

436
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,500
Is the life of a writer
really this bad?

437
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,166
Yeah. It's not exactly easy to
be happy with a job like this.

438
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,916

It sounds so hard.

Well...

we wouldn't still be here
if it wasn't fun, too.

You've got such a good attitude,

Yes?

about what it's like
to be an editor sometime?

being one yourself?

Okay.

part-time at our office?

[giggling]

Out of everyone
in the whole world,

465
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,000
Itsuki loves me!

466
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,708
And that's a fact!

467
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,208
He just needs to become
a protagonist like me.

468
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,958
I don't know what that'll mean,

writer in the universe to me.

I guess I'll just have
to keep inspiring him.

[MAN 1] What?
You're seriously buying that?

474

Wasn't the anime terrible,
though?

That anime never happened!

still kick ass.

-Hell, yes!

483
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,458
My time has finally come!

484
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,333
[TOKI] Let me tell you
the whole story first.

485
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,041
This opportunity only came up

486
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,541
because another
anime project fell through.

487
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,416
So basically,
you're the replacement.

488
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,083
There's really
no time or budget,

489
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,250
and frankly, the chances of it
being a success are low.

490
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,500
Plus, the whole thing with Fuwa.

491
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,500
So do you wanna do this?

492
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,458
I do.

493
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,125
[TOKI]
You sure?

494
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,166
You can't know how things'll
turn out if you don't try.

495
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,541
So you bet your ass
I'm gonna try.

496
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,291
What I said sounded cool
and all, but...

497
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,250
No, it'll be okay.

498
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,708
I can get through this.

499
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,375
After all, I don't
have a little sister.

500
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,625
And as long as I have
this yearning for one,

501
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,583
I can keep going forever!

502
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,958
Yeah.

503
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,875
Now let's do this!

504
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,875
[typing]

505
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,250
I have to tell Itsuki the truth!
