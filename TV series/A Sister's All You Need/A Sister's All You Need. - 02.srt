00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,916
[ITSUKI]
Hmm.

2
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,916
Hmm.

3
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:19,833
Hmm.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,250
That's not right.

5
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,125
I'm just trying to study
for a test,

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,125
but my school's library
is too crowded.

7
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,208
So, I was hoping you'd let me
study here instead.

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,083
I'm just trying to study
for a test,

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,083
but my school's library
is too crowded,

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,708
so I was really hoping
you'd let me study here instead.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,958
Okay!

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,791
[inhales deeply]

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,208
[NAYUTA] And what are you
doing here, Myaa?

14
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,208
Uh!

15
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,125
[high-pitched voice]
I won't tell, big brother.

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,250
[normal voice]
Still not right.

17
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,583
[doorbell rings]

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,333
Oh. You're looking
for a place to study?

19
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,291
Must be tough being
a college student.

20
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,333
It's not easy. So, yeah.

21
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,708
[doorbell rings]

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,208
Hmm?

23
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,708
Maybe he's not home.

24
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,708
Hey! Turns out
the door was unlocked.

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,083
Don't just go in!

26
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,208
[high-pitched voice]
I'm embarrassed.

27
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,291
Could you turn off the lights?

28
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,875
[normal voice]
No. That's cute,

29
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:22,125
but I want Hilde
to be more true to herself.

30
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,166
I just want
to hold on to you

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,833
and never let you go!

32
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,875
[normal voice] No, she needs
to be even more straightforward!

33
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,416
[high-pitched voice] The truth
is that I love you, big brother!

34
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,541
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Hmm?

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,541
[laughing]

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,291
[screaming]

37
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,583
Well, what have we got here?

38
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,708
We've got nothing!

39
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,958
I promise I'm not insane,

40
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,875
I've got a good reason
to be doing this!

41
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,208
-I swear!
-Oh yeah, I know, don't worry.

42
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,958
You were just acting out a scene
in your novel. I get it.

43
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,333
What was that shriek?
Did you find Itsuki?

44
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,750
-[gasps]
-[ITSUKI screams]

45
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,791
Why are you naked, you pervert?

46
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,333
This is normal for authors!

47
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,666
He has to live the experience
to write about it!

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,166
If he doesn't, he can't paint

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,833
a convincing picture
for his readers!

50
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,875
It's research!

51
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,458
[MIYAKO]
So, he has to get naked?

52
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,541
[ITSUKI] Will you two get out
of my bathroom already?

53
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,166
[sighs]

54
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,708
Man, why can't I
figure this out?

55
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,458
[doorbell ringing]

56
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,791
What, did they forget something?

57
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,125
I heard you the first ti-- Huh?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,083
So, uh, dude why are you
dressed like that?

59
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,166
It's nothing weird, I swear!
Uh...

60
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,000
[giggling]

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,541
[sighs]
Well, seeing that

62
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,083
just ruined my day.

63
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,083
What? But you're in college.

64
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,625
Aren't there naked guys
just walking around everywhere?

65
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,916
You have a warped understanding
of education.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,291
Everything I've seen
on the internet

67
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,041
is all about drinking
your weight in liquor

68
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,666
and waking up
with a sticky face.

69
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,791
Not everything you see online
is true!

70
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,041
Fair enough. So, does that mean
you're a virgin?

71
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,291
Uh!

72
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,041
Of course I'm not a virgin.

73
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,750
I've had plenty of boyfriends,
so, you know...

74
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,500
Ah, I'm jealous.

75
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,208
You're so mature.

76
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,000
I wish I could do naughty things
with Itsuki all the time, too.

77
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,458
Wait, what-- Why--

78
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,041
The way you said that
makes it sound like

79
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,500
I do that stuff with him,
and you know I don't.

80
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,541
He's a former classmate,
and nothing more.

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,958
[NAYUTA] Oh yeah. You two went
to the same college.

82
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,625
How could I forget that?

83
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,625
[MIYAKO] He did quit
after about six months,

84
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,291
so I can't really blame you.

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,250
So, hey. Can you tell me
what he was like back then?

86
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,291
Hmm...

87
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,166
[yawning]

88
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,083
Tired today, are we?

89
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,500
Yeah, I got called in
in the last minute.

90
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,250
Barely slept at all.

91
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,541
I know that feeling.

92
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,750
My boyfriend
wouldn't let me rest

93
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,041
for a second last night.

94
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,500
Wouldn't let you rest?

95
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,500
Hmm?

96
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,625
Oh, that guy's
always off on his own,

97
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:26,958
typing up a storm.

98
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,666
[GIRL 2] Yeah, I think
his name's Hashima?

99
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,250
Kinda creepy.

100
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,000
[GIRL 1]
He can't have many friends.

101
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,375
[MIYAKO]
I got this sense that he had

102
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,708
something more important

103
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,875
than class,
goofing off, or work

104
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,708
that he was devoting
his time to.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,041
Something that I didn't have.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,708
He must've been writing
that novel every chance he got.

107
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,666
I swear, you could hear
the clicks of his keyboard

108
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
between every spoken word
in that room.

109
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,916
He'd go straight home
when class was over.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,041
And as far as I know,
never talked to anyone.

111
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,583
Sounds just like him.

112
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,208
[laughing]

113
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,666
Yeah, that sucks, man.

114
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,000
Please don't laugh.

115
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,250
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,958
Really though, Nayu's one thing.

117
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,958
But for Miyako
to see you like that?

118
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,041
You probably ruined
the poor girl's day.

119
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,458
[ITSUKI grunts]

120
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,541
Actually, how did the two of you

121
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,083
become friends, anyway?

122
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,833
At first glance,
you don't really seem

123
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,250
to have anything in common.

124
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,791
That's a good question.

125
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,000
[MIYAKO]
Hey, Hashima.

126
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,166
What are you always typing
on that laptop of yours?

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,166
Hmm? Uhh!

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,833
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,291
It's notes and stuff.

130
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,208
Oh, come on,
I won't tell anyone.

131
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm writing a novel.

132
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,333
Well, that makes sense.

133
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,958
I guess you want
to become a novelist

134
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,916
one day then, huh?

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,291
I don't want to become one.

136
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,583
I already am one.

137
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,916
Oh.

138
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,958
-So, I picked up your book.
-Hmm?

139
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,500
I read through it
yesterday after class.

140
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,916
You did?

141
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,875
Yes, but I can't say
I understood it.

142
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,333
Like, what exactly about kissing
his little sister

143
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,208
granted the guy
magic powers?

144
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,583
[scoffs]

145
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,125
Like my work is something
that a college chick

146
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,625
who can't keep her legs closed
could ever understand.

147
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

148
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,416
I've never even had a boyfriend.

149
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
Besides, who in their right mind
would understand it?

150
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,250
It's crazy!

151
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,458
You can't honestly think

152
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,125
that this will connect
with readers.

153
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,291
Oh, I can't, can I?

154
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,291
You happened to have read
the second in a series.

155
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,333
The "Genesister of
the New World," volume two.

156
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
And it sold
one hundred thousand copies.

157
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,083
You're kidding me!
That garbage?

158
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:42,166
How dare you call
my masterpiece "garbage"?

159
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,125
Who are you to even say that?
You couldn't understand it!

160
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,000
"This will never connect
with your readers."

161
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,375
Connected with
a hundred thousand people

162
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,750

you'll be getting a whole new
league of passionate fans.

No, thanks!

327
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,916
Besides, I wouldn't want
my books to sell

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,416
just because
of the person I am.

[HARUTO chuckles]

330
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,000
[HARUTO] You get serious
about the weirdest stuff.

331
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:02,916
Hey, Myaa?

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,833
What's up?
Do you need something?

333
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,041
Let me fondle
your boobs real quick.

334
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,000
W-- And why should I
let you do that?

335
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,916
I'm in the middle of writing
a scene about squeezing tatas.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,083
And I gotta live it
to write about it.

337
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,666
May I remind you that you have

338
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,583
perfectly good breasts
of your own to grab?

339
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,375
Yes, but the cup size
of the character in question

340
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,416
is just about
the same as yours.

341
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Did you think that
that would convince me?

342

[NAYUTA]
Please!

343
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,541
I need to do this to paint
a vivid, realistic picture!

344
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,375
[MIYAKO] So that naked stunt
really was for work.

Fine. Let's just
get this over with.

347
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,958
Oh, I need them bare,
if you would.

348
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,708
And you conveniently forgot
to mention that until right now?

349
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,958
What if I said "pretty please"?
With sugar on top?

350

The next time I need a favor,
you had better say yes!

a few seconds, okay.

on them either.

Give it up!

360
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,791
I said I only wanna flirt
with little sisters, man!

361
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,291
And mark my words,

362
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,833
one day I shall create
the ultimate little sister!

363
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,583
I don't even know how to respond
to that at this point.

364
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,708
Like, I actually have
a little sister.

365
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,666
And let me tell you, they're not
as great as you make them seem.

366
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,750
All she does is complain
about every little thing I do.

367
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,375
Plus, she'll smack me
for nothing

368
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,708
and tell me my books
are gross or boring.

369
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,583
Then she gets on my case
about interviews,

370
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,375
because they're "inconvenient."

371

-It's depressing.
-Oh, whatever!

372
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,041
Don't compare
that piece of trash

373
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,166
in little sisters' clothing
to my little sister!

374
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,916
Whoa, damn, dude!

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,333
She may not be perfect,
but she's not that bad!

376
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,708
I'll have you know,
she used to be

377
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,666
as cute as a button
when she was little!

378
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,125
And the last time I got sick,

379
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,208
she even went out and bought
some gelatin for me.

380
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,083
Also, you don't even have
a little sister!

381
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,333
Yes, I do.

All right, I think
I've got my fill.

00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,208
I should be able to write
a good scene now.

That's lame. Who would want
to read something like that?

There's plenty of female fans
who are into that kind of thing.

Okay, sure,

towards virgin guys?

with some more female fans?

it's marketed towards guys,

[ITSUKI] No matter
what you want in life,

there's always someone else

it usually means a whole lot
