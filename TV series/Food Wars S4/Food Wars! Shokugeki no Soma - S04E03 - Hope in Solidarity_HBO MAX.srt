00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:06,500
Hmm.
Yes, I see.

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,708
I'd say I've been blessed
with the or three.

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,416
It is what it is,
or so I've been told,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,166
to something of that effect.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,500
My family's got lots of cash and
I'm a really awesome cook.

6
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,750
Plus, don't forget, I'm totally
pretty boy cute, right?

7
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,458
I gotta say, I've kind of been
given it all, you know.

8
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,416
What's that you say?
They say I'm on the short side?

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,250
That means nothing.
Nothing at all!

10
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,500
Do you hear me over there?
It means nothing to me!

11
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,166
Anyway, I've got
other gorgeous stuff on my side

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,083
as I'm flying down the road,
a surefire victory in fame.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,916
But then that day came.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,541
As a first year, I was
challenging senior students

15
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,375
left and right,
winning battle after battle.

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,333
When suddenly out of the blue,
an epic defeat,

17
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,125
and all that pride
turned into dust.

18
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,375
But that wasn't even
the worst of my problems.

19
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,250
The truly worst part
is what came next.

20
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,708
It's been 10 days and you're
still down in the dumps, Kuga?

21
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,291
If you challenge
Eishi Tsukasa,

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,000
of course you won't be able
to claim victory,

23
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,125
you itty-bitty
pipsqueak.

24
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,625
It must be serious if Kuga
won't even react

25
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,208
to being called silly names.

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,833
You managed to draw a battle
against the number one seat.

27
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,083
Now, don't you think
that's something to be proud
of?

28
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,625
You're right!

29
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,250
I, the great
Terunori Kuga,

30
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,083
am the only underclassmen
to have challenged Eishi Tsukasa

31
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,791
since he became
a second year! [ Laughs ]

32
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,458
Why do you keep that kind of
talk to yourself, Isshiki?

33
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,791
That settles it.
I'm gonna go challenge him

34
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,500
to a revenge match
right now!

35
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,125
Wait.
Are you kidding?

36
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,458
Tsukasa.

37
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,916
Tsukasa:
Oh, Rindo.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,250
I thought you were
in South America.

39
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,375
I told you that I would be
coming back today, right?

40
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,000
More importantly, it was
pretty cold for you to do that

41
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:39,166
while I wasn't around.
Huh? Do what?

42
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,458
Have a food war
with Kuga, duh.

43
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,125
Kuga.
Who exactly is that again?

44
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,875
Uh...uh...

45
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,208
What are you talking about,
Tsukasa?

46
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,250
You battled Kuga
in a food war.

47
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,500
Good grief.
Don't you remember anything?

48
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,541
Oh, yeah. He's the guy
who does Szechuan, right?

49
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:59,916
Kuga: Tsukasa. He wasn't even
trying when we fought.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,333
I'm not just another
face in the crowd.

51
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,125
With this next battle,

52
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,541
you're going to learn about
Terunori Kuga the hard way.

53
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,083
Prepare yourself before
you eat this!

54

Check out that Eishi dude's
dish. What is that?

71
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
Did he make sherbet?
Nah, it's steaming.

72

So, that's a dish
from the number one seat.

My goodness. That thing
looks friggin' amazing.

Still, our side's dish
is hardly lacking in beauty.

75

Whoa. That pork shoulder
looks juicy and piping hot.

76
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,208
It appears to be a sweet
and sour pork

made with black vinegar.

78

Look at
his presentation.

79

It's as gorgeous as any high end
French or Italian dish

80
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,916
I've seen.
Terunori Kuga's
Szechuan cooking skills

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,708
seemed like they would be a bad
fit for this tea battle.

82
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,500
What kind of
flavor combination

83
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,375
has he come up with?

00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,250
And now
for the taste test

the most nervous person ever.

I totally understand
how she feels.

87

You can do it, man.
Come on, bring it.

88
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,458
Regarding Mr. Kuga's dish,
the idea to pan fry

89
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,333
and then smoke
the meat was interesting.

90
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,958

Both:
Right on!

00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,250
When you taste it,

95
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,333
it's as if the freshness
of the tea bathes

96

the whole visible spectrum
with the brightest of emerald.

97
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:05,250
The balsamic vinegar and Subaru
Mimasaka's smoked soy sauce

98
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,541
add to the black vinegar glaze!

99
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,208
The richness and acidity of it
binds to the umami of the pork,

100
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,583
eliminating the unpleasant
fatty aftertaste.

101

Histoire: The theme ingredient
of green tea is elevated

Anne: That said,
here is the point

106
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,041
that deserves
the most attention.

107
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,125
It is not the methods of Chinese
cooking alone

108
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,750
that have brought forth
this flavor.

109
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,875
There is masterful usage
of French techniques as well.

110

Yeah, yeah, I'll explain it all,
so listen up.

112
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,666
I kicked that black
vinegar braise up a notch

113
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,333
with sauce au vinaigre
balsamique.

114
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,291
It's a sauce used in
French cooking

115
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,125
in their back-end
notes of that as well.

116
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,416
Indeed so.

117
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,375
It says right here
that vinaigre balsamique

118
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,083
is a reduction
of glace de viande,

119
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,083
which is itself a reduction
of fond de veau

120
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
and balsamic vinegar.

121
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,125
It also says it combines
the brightness of acidity

122
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,625
with a rich,
deep flavor that could elevate

123
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,250
the sweet and sour pork
to its highest potential.

124
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,083
French cooking, huh?
That Kuga's something else.

125
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,416
Awesome!
Where'd he get the idea,
let alone the skill?

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,750
I thought his specialty
was Chinese cuisine.

I have to change up my cooking.
It was a lot of work for me.

129
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
I had to break through the
wall
of Szechuan cuisine,

130

You will no longer find
yourself
asking who Kuga is ever again!

You really have become a
different person in recent days.

134

It's quite
remarkable really.

135
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,708
But we third years
aren't so unskilled

136
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,250
that that amount of effort
would be enough to beat us.

137
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,416
But I'm sure
you already knew that.

138

yet such an
