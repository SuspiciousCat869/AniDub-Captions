And even
in a Japanese eatery,

163
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,458
it would just be something
to round out the meal.

164
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,958
It would never be served
as a main dish.

165
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,208
Plus, in no way
at all would you find

166
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,041
something like that
in a gourmet cookbook.

167
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,666
How disappointing.

168
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,375
My own daughter
made something

169
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,416
that is so clearly
a poor choice.

170
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,375
You should have given up
from the start.

171
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,291
I can tell just by looking that
this dish is a shameful attempt.

172
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,958
I have no desire to taste it.

173
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,083
Oh!

174
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,583
I thought judging
was done using the tongue!

175
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,666
Leave it to
my all-knowing father

176
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,791
to be able to do
so using only his eyes.

177
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,833
But maybe if those two
over there

who you believed to be the most
ideal chefs at the school,

if they agree
that this is delicious,

180
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,666
perhaps you'll have
no other choice but to concur.

181
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
Hmm. Well, well.
What's this?

182
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,458
Do I smell a challenge brewing?
What do you say, Tsukasa?

183
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,333
I guess we have
no choice, huh?

184
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,083
Hmm. I suppose we could
partake of some.

185

Mm.

And it goes without saying,
because this is a course meal,

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,333

the appetizer first.

It's pure Yukihira.

Something this delish,

201
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,125
it's got
to be called a specialty.

Sure enough, he's come along
so much further.

Soma Yukihira,
you're amazing.

fit into the course menu?

205
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,791
True, this next dish of theirs
will either make

206
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,708
or break the menu
they haphazardly decided on.

207

Great. Now bring up this dish
you're so damn proud of

and I'll do you the honor
of tasting some, Miss Erina.

[ All gasp ]

213
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,000
This chicken is so tender,
and that fat,

214
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,083
plus the wonderfully gooey egg
melts on the tongue.

215
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,583
The meat's interior is
just the right rare,

216
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,416
while the skin
is wonderfully crispy.

217
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,916
The way this was cooked
perfectly accentuates

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,083
the flavor of
this top quality chicken.

219
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,500
Rindo: The sauce includes salt,
pepper, eggs, and fresh cream,

220
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,291
and then slowly heated
until it was nice and thick.

221
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,166
The addition of bright
yellow turmeric gives it depth,

222
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,000
making it a dazzling
scrambled egg sauce.

223
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,333
Tsukasa:
Rising up from below is the rich
taste of senbei rice crackers,

224
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,666
freshly steamed rice,
and diced squid

225
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,875
mixed with sesame oil
spread thin

226
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,166
and baked to a crisp.

227
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,208
The interplay
of crispy and gooey.

228
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,541
The multiple
layers of texture

229
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,166
are the perfect match for
the juiciness of the chicken.

230
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,708
The chicken, the egg sauce, and
the rice of the senbei crackers.

231
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,583
Together, these three elements
make this an oyakodon,

232
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,541
but the major player
in all of this

233
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,208
is actually the croute
that's been wrapped around

234
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,875
the chicken breasts.

235
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,208
A croute.

236
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,041
It's a delicious dough
that's often used

237
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,583
to make bread
or pie crust

238
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,916
with added seasoning
and baked until nice and crispy.

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,333
What's more, when wrapped
around
a protein that's then baked,

240
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,416
it highlights
that particular ingredient.

241
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,708
It adds flavor, allowing you
to elevate your dish.

242
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,625
That is correct.
It's the ultimate secret

243
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,666
to what actually makes
this dish work.

244
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,666
While I had originally intended
to use a croute for the chicken,

245
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,083
you can see I was forced
to alter my plan

246
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,250
in favor
of an entirely new dish.

247
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,750
I had to suddenly stir
in a certain ingredient,

248
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,458
and that ingredient was...

249
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,750
freshly diced
squid tentacles

250
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,541
and thick, creamy
peanut butter.

251
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,750
All:
S-S-S-S..

252
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,541
Squid and peanut butter?!

253
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,708
Um,
for real, though?

254
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,208
Yes.

255
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,291
It is the squid
and peanut butter that does it.

256
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,833
It ties the two together.

257
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,041
It is simply
the joint ingredient.

258
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,041
Its full bodied,
yet mellow flavor

259
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,166
heightens the richness
of the chicken meat,

260
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,166
making it
the perfect secret ingredient.

261
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,125
The tentacles also add
the right amount

262
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,083
of saltiness and bitterness,

263
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,416
making it
the ultimate compliment

264
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,958
to the fattiness
of the protein.

265
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,958
Even the disgusting cooking
Soma

266
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,541
is always forcing on us

267
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,541
can be transformed into
something most delicious.

268
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,875
Huh?

269
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,166
The dish is built around
two main players --

270
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,833
the Jidori chicken and the squid
and peanut butter croute.

271
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,375
I remade the sauce and garnishes
to further enhance

272
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,291
the flavor profile.

273
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,791
By eating
Soma's appetizer prior to this,

274
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:05,208
it allowed the flavor
to play across the tongue

275
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,375
to the greatest extent.

276
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,416
Much like how Soma made use
of the God Tongue,

277
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,208
Erina used his disgusting
cuisine method to her
advantage.

each other's cooking,

adding strength to
their dishes,

which they otherwise
wouldn't have had!

You're awesome,

282
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,375

sneaky sneak, Erina.

"You're welcome",

and now
you're stealing this?

Ha! You were the one
who first started this fight.

289
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:36,833

previously unknown.

298

just support the main dish.

299
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,000
It served to elevate it!

00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,000
It was the perfect
accompaniment
beyond all other appetizers.

301
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,916
At first glance, their
approach
seemed totally reckless,

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,875
but they were able to
coordinate
with perfect precision.

303

It was like
a live performance.

from the speakers.

tornado of sound...

their due.
