Yes. That's right.

163
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,666
We're the new seats
on the Ten.

164
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,166
That means you're guaranteed
a spot, Megumi!

165
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,791
Huh?
Is he for real?

166
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,083
I mean, that's believable. I'm
so happy, I can start crying!

167
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,166
Way to go!

168
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,583
This is awesome,
Takumi!

169
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,666
You're really
on the Ten!

170
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,750
[ Laughs ]
Congrats! Yay!

171
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,458
But who will be assigned
to which seat?

172
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,541
Most importantly,
the number one.

173
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,791
Well, of course,
it will have to be Miss Erina.

174
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:09,791
She did turn out that incredible
main dish during the final bout.

175
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,041
Mm.

176
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,458
I've gone along
with your selfish whims,

177
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,541
so this time you must listen
to one of mine.

178
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:20,041
So, Soma, you're taking
the number one seat.
Huh?

179
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,208
Wha?
But Miss Erina --

180
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,208
It was, to an extent,
thanks to you,

181
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,625
that I was able to produce
this dish in the first place.

182
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,333
Considering the person
who contributed the most

183
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,000
to this food war

184
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,750
and the one most suited
for the seat is Soma Yukihira.

185
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,250
I'd say
that's cool.

186
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,250
If it weren't for
the little Soma over there,

187
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,416
then things wouldn't have
turned out so rosy like this.

188
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,666
Of course,
he has my vote, too.

189
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,333
Yeah, my vote,
as well.

190
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,916
What the --
Soma?

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,458
[ Grunting ]

192
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,416
Now,
I hate to rush this,

193
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,625
but there is one thing the Ten
must decide upon immediately.

194
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,000
A new director of the school
must be selected.

195
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,750
What?

196
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,875
But Grandfather, you're
the director of the academy.

197
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,416
That position was unfortunately
taken from me

198
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,791
when your father
stripped me of it.

199
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,416
I would be losing face
were I to reclaim it.

200
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,041
However, there is
a silver lining.

201
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,458
So yeah, I'm retired now,
and the truth is,

202
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,791
I'd be glad
to have some me time, okay?

203
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,458
Grandfather.

204
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,083
So, who shall
that responsibility fall to?

205
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,291
I ask this of the new number
one seat of the Ten.

206
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,625
Well, if I must pick, it's got
to be this one here.

207
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,708
Uh...

208
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,125
Huh?!

209
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,208
For generations, the director
has been someone

210
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,791
from the Nakiri family.

211
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
Besides, it should be
an easy job

212
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,208
knowing how stuck up
and prissy you are.

213
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,291
And, uh,
besides all that,

214
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,250
your dish ran circles
around my own specialty.

215
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,916
Hate to say,
but you're still better than me.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,125
So, unless you take
the director's spot,

217
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,833
I'm not taking
the number one seat.

218
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,458
Now you look here,

219
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,875
that's no reason for me
to have to be the new
director!

220
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,875
What if Uncle Soe were to do it
instead, Grandfather?

221
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,625
Soe: No, I'm in agreement
with the number one seat.

222
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,041
Huh?
Uncle Soe?

223
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,500
Why, hello there,
Erina.

224
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,166
Been quite a while,
hasn't it?

225
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,041
Oh, Father.
Glad you made it.
Of course.

226
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,500
Both: A pleasure
to see you, sir.

227
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,625
Mm?

228
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,666
My adorable little Alice.

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,500
Work has kept me away for
way too long,

230
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,500
but I finally
made it back.

231
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,833
Hello there, Soma Yukihira.
What's up?

232
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,041
Huh? Huh?

233
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,666
I, like you
and my father,

234
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
believe that Erina is perfect
for the position.

235
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,125
Her fresh vision makes
her magnificently suited

236
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,875
for the role
of academy director.

237
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,750
Please, Erina,
it's my wish to entrust

238
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,541
the future of Totsuki
to you.

239
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,333
Uh...

240
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,583
Mm.

241
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,458
[ Sighs ]
Alright, then.

242
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,375
I guess
I'll have to accept

243
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,750
the number one seat
as well/

244
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,375
But know this.

245
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,041
I won't feel like
I've taken the top spot

246
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,625
until I've taken you down
once and for all.

247
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,541
You're going to say it.
"Soma's food is awesome."

248
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,291
Just wait, 'cause that day
is gonna come.

249
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,458
[ Exhales sharply ]

250
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,375
So, then Soma
and Miss Erina...

251
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,541
[ Chuckles ] Looks like
they are both able

252
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,250
to succeed
in their own way.

253
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,875
It's simply incredible!

254
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,250
Absolutely incredible!

255
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,500
They did it!

256
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,125
You did it, too.
Megumi.

257
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,875
[ Both laugh ]

258
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,541
Hmm.
This makes Soma Yukihira

259
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
all the more
worth it to defeat.

260
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,416
I'd challenge the bastard
to a food war tomorrow.

261
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,416
Hmm.
Yeah. Me, too.

262
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,541
Boy: That transfer student,
Soma Yukihira

263
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,000
is now the number one seat?

264
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,625
Boy #2: What's gonna happen
to us now?

265
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,166
Don't tell me
we're gonna be expelled.

266
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,416
Boy #3: We betrayed the rebels
and talked down to them

267
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,708
as we sided
with the Azami Administration.

268
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,916
There's no way we could just
stay at school after that.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Huh?
What are you saying?

270
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,083
Nobody's getting expelled,
okay?

271
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,625
And listen up! On my word
is the current number one seat,

272
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,625
I'll accept a food war
challenge from anyone.

273
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,250
[ Cheers and applause ]

274
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,250
It's not like I outright beat
Chef Tsukasa or Rindo

275
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,250
in a one on one food war
or anything,

276
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,791
so I hold this seat
only temporarily.

277
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,583
If you battle me, you don't
have
to wager anything of your own.

278
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,291
Anyone who wants to
come after me, be my guest.

279
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,791
I got a ways to go, but I'd
like
you all to stick with me.

[ Laughter ]

281
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,041
Do it, Father.
Mm.

282
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,000
As departing director,
I make the following decree.

283
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,458
The director of
Totsuki Fine Dining Academy

284
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,750
shall be Erina Nakiri,

285
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,291
and the number one seat of
the Council of Ten

286
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,500
shall be Soma Yukihira.

287
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,833
[ Cheers and applause ]

288
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,291
I never thought he'd actually
make the number one seat

289
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,291
this quickly.

290
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,875
He's a hasty
little jackass.

291
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,375
Soma: We could go totally crazy
in this exciting

292
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,916
and endless wilderness.

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,916
So, let's butt heads.

294
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,833
Megumi: Dear Mother,
are you doing well?

295
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:37,875
It's been a few months now
since that regimental food war.

296
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,666
Our third year seniors
have all graduated

297
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,500
and are now exploring
their own paths.

298
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,000
Woman: Miss Momo,
we would definitely like you

299
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,333
to produce another mascot
character for us.

300
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,000
Not interested.

301
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm going to focus entirely

302
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,666
on making the cutest of sweets
from here on out.

303
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,083
I want to make
the world sweeter,

304
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,250
more delicious, and more
and more cute.

305
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,250
Miss Momo!
Mm?

306
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,583
Please show us
your latest creation.

307
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,750
For my latest dessert,
I now bring you

308
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,750
Momo's Imperial
Majestic Pistachio Daifuku.

309
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,666
All: So adorable!

310
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm terribly sorry. We won't
have a reservation available

311
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,750
until next spring.

312
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,791
Excuse me.
Uh, kada, please.

313
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,250
Understood.

314
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,875
I'll put all my heart
and soul into making it, sir.

315
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,458
Man: This is the killer ramen
from that Totsuki graduate, huh?

316
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,166
[ French accent ]
C'est si bon!

317
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,250
No doubt this is going to take
