00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,916
but they'll be served
consecutively,

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,375
so teams are judged
over who makes the best course.

162
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,916
In other words, one shall
prepare the hors d'oeuvres

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
while the other member
of the team shall work

164
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,041
on making the main dish.

165
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,375
Two dishes
that go together?

166
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:09,833
To make a full course.

167
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,166
Really?

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,875
So that means the dishes
will be judged together.

169
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,416
Sweet!
This sounds like fun.

170
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,458
-Yeah.
-You are free to choose

171
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,250
whatever theme
ingredient you wish,

172
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,750
but in exchange, the task
you are assigned is

173
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,291
creating a multi-course meal
of true gourmet food.

174
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,916
Director Azami,
have you any objections?

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,250
None. Actually, I think
that it is a wonderful idea.

176
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,541
A cooking suite composed
by the duo of Tsukasa and Rindo.

177
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,708
I would love nothing more
than a fresh taste of it.

178
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:42,416
Besides, the current Council
of Ten perfectly embodies

179
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,250
what my vision
of an ideal chef is.

180
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,916
Although I don't feel
Erina is capable

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,458
of making true gourmet food.
[ Growling ]

182
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,250
I am merely stating
what I know to be true.

183
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,625
Erina: I wouldn't be
so confident.

184
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,625
I'm no longer
the person I used to be.

185
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,208
In fact, the dishes I make now
are beyond compare.

186
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,750
[ Azami chuckles lightly ]

187
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,166
All you see is a delinquent
daughter who ran away from home.

188
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,000
But that meek and obedient girl
you clearly have in mind

189
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,666
no longer exists.

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,958

00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,458
-Way to give it to him!
-[ Chuckles ]

192
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:17,083
At this young age,
it's perfectly natural

193
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,750
to become rebellious,
my dear.

194
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,791
As your father,
I accept that

195
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,041
and welcome you
to join us in Central.

196
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,791
But only after we've cleansed
you and removed all
impurities.

197
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,708
That is to be
your destined fate, Erina,

198
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,791
because you are the key
that is necessary

199
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:36,125
to guide all chefs
along their proper path.

200
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,208
Well, then, so be it.

201
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,875
See you on the morrow.

202
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,875
The victor shall forge
Totsuki's path to the future.

203
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,125
Put your best food forward,
you young and valiant chefs!

204

Woman:
Yeah, those two might stand
a real chance at this.

205
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,208
Woman #2: Soma and Erina have
both sharpened their skills

206

in the kitchen
to a new level.

207
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,875
They can definitely
produce a dish

208
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,666
that won't lose to the first
and second seats of the Ten.

All: Those two can do it!

210
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,666
Hey, Chef Rindo.
Huh?

211
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,875
Do you mind if I ask you
something real quick?

212
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:10,708
Huh?

213
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,000
Sure.
What is it, Takumi?

214
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,125
I apologize if I have
the wrong idea.

215
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,250
Really.

216
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,666
However, I could sense
something was off

217
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,541
during our battle earlier,
and I wanted to know.

218
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
So tell me, what exactly was it
that frightened you

219
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,250
during our battle
just now?

220

What?! I'm not scared,
you big old dummy!

221
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,041
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

222
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,166
I swear,
young punks like you

223
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,541
are just so full of themselves
these days!

Huh?
What's going on here?

225
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,500
Did you piss off Chef Rindo
or what?

226
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,166
Takumi:
Not intentionally.

227

Tomorrow is the day,
the end of the food war,

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,666
and all will be settled.

to sleep for a second night!

that the rest of us

232

can help you with?
Yeah, 'cause, I mean,

233
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,458
those two are fighting on behalf
of all of us who got kicked out.

234
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,666
Maybe we can help decide
what to make.

-No, no.
-Huh?

Everybody arguing
about what's best

to waste precious time.

on our butts doing nothing.

is simply to have faith

whip up a winning dish.

Then -- boom! --
we'll shove it in their faces!

and cook up a good appetizer.

Neither of them is esoteric
enough to be a main dish.

main
dishes at Shino's, did they?

the first seat

313
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,583
on the Council of Ten.

314
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,625
Well, if you're taking
the first seat,

315
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,083
then I'm gonna take
the second seat.
Huh?

316
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:32,458
It'll be way more fun to aim for
the top if we do it together.

317
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,875
Uh, sure.
We're gonna go to Totsuki,

318
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,291
then it'll be
one-two domination!

319
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,375
Sounds good.

320

Rindo: And then
Tsukasa and I did just that.

321
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,416
We actually ended up
becoming the first

322
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,916
and second seats
on the Council of Ten.

323
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,041
Chef Tsukasa,
I thought you needed

324
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,958
to attend a gourmet banquet
with Chef Rindo today.

325
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,333
Yeah, but I've got an endless
amount of work to do.

326
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,625
That's not good.

327
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:01,708
Butchy and I will gladly
help you out with doing this.

328
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,958
I'll take care of
all the budget documents.

329
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,833
I'm really good
at crunching numbers.

330
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,083
Rindo: Tsukasa wasn't good
at a lot of things

331
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,875
outside of cooking,
but he kept doing his best

332
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,625
for the sake
of becoming a master chef.

333
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,458

absolutely perfect!

The first seat
is no joke!

336
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,166
Totsuki sure is
an impressive school.
Heavens, yes!

337
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,750
And I hear he's currently
the best student there.

from the famous Totsuki Academy.

Eishi Tsukasa.

Congratulations, Tsukasa.
You got invited to go overseas

00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,541
to cook in a super fancy
restaurant.

350

-Simply amazing.

Nice work!
You did awesome, Tsukasa.

354
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,500
Especially the main dish.

355
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,166
That sauce you chose to do
must have been a real challenge.

356

O-Oh, thanks for saying
that, Rindo.

Man: Dear me.

358
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,333
What a horrid banquet
that was.

359
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,750
It was so horrid, in fact,
that I found it amusing.

360
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,875
What the hell?
Who even are you?

361
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,541
Eishi Tsukasa,

362
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,875
the intense passion
you poured into your cooking

363
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,541
didn't reach any of those pigs
who were in attendance today,

364
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,666
now did it?
What?

365
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,083
And I know that main dish
you served

366
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,375
isn't one that you yourself
consider to be any good.

367
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,041
Isn't that right?

368
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,333
Is it still bothering you?

369
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,666
Who cares what some weird
skunk-headed jerk says, anyway?

370
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,166
Look, all the people there
loved that main dish of yours,

371
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,250
and I thought it was
totally unique, as well.

372
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm not sure.
But lately,

373
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,333
whenever people I don't know
praise me for my cooking,

374
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,166
it really gets on my nerves.
I don't know why that is.

375
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,583
What?

376
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:05,375
But that man, he was
the only one thoughtful enough

377
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,916
to actually give me
any kind of real criticism.

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,250
Rindo: After that,
at some point

379
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,125
when Tsukasa was on his own,
he got approached.

380
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,000
Uh!
Say, you're the boy
I met in Vegas.

381
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:23,375
What a coincidence.
Coincidence?

382
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,041
It feels more like
you're following me around.

383
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:28,125
You should be happy
that we met again.

384
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,833
I think you've taken
an interest in me.

385
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,500
Am I wrong?

386
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:36,125
Suppose that Pablo Picasso
was still alive today.
Okay.

387
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,125
And imagine that he has just
unveiled a brand-new painting.

388
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,208
Would you be able to discern
whether or not

389
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,083
it was a genuine work
of genius?

390
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,833
That would be impossible.

391
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't know very much
about painting or art.

392
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,416
I guess I'm impressed
by music sometimes

393
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,083
when they're able
to emphasize a single instrument

394
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,958
while also blending them
together.

395
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's make this easier
by talking in terms of food.

396
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,791
You can deduce
a chef's ingenuity

397
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,458
from tasting their dish.
I'm sure you can agree.

398
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,541
But what about people
without any knowledge

399
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,000
or sense of cooking?

400
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,125
Doesn't matter how much
ingenuity you put into it

401
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:11,083
or what challenging
new methods you use.

402
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,083
Their reactions
will always be the same.

403
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,333
Just carrying the title
of the first seat

404
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,791
was enough to make those
self-proclaimed foodies

405
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,041
rave about your food.

406
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,166
Are you getting sick
of hearing from them?

407
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,541
All that energy you have should
be used for the sake of people

408
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,833
who truly understand
how incredible your skills
are.

409
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,291
For example,
people like me.

410
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,500
Then Tsukasa started
to search for and accept

411
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,083
more job offers
in America.

412
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,416
I only found out about it
after the fact,

413
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,583
but he had been meeting
with Azami Nakiri

414
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,083
every time he went.

415
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,833
What do you think it means
for a chef

416
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,208
to polish their skills?
Huh?

417
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,166
At a glance, the cooking
profession seems

418
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,291
like a vast wasteland,

419
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,375
but the truth
is the exact opposite.

420
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,041
There is a definite finish
line
for all chefs to reach.

421
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,041
As long as they know
the proper method,

422
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,250
anyone can reach
that goal,

423
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,208
and without
having to face any trouble.

424
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,541
I don't understand
how that would even work.

425
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:11,208
You must never heed any words
from the pigs of the world.

426
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:15,083
All you need to do is pay
attention to a single compass

427
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,208
with 100% accuracy
that knows how to get you there.

428
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,541
It's the only thing capable of
saving the chefs of the world.

429
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,541
And my daughter
happens to have it.

430
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,541
It is known as
the God Tongue.

431
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,750
The God Tongue?
Do you mean...

432
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,250

433
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:33,000

435
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,958
Megishima: So, Azami Nakiri
must have already planned

436
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,000
his takeover
of Totsuki Academy

437
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,083

so close to Tsukasa.

439
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,750
I don't really care
about all that stuff.

440
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,583
Then tell me,
why are you backing that guy?

441
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,333
Well, because...

442
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,666
Rindo: A new wave
is coming in to take over,

443
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,083
and the mere thought of
riding it makes my heart pound!

444
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,083
I thought that was
the best way to keep on

445
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,583
making tons of yummy stuff
alongside Tsukasa.

446
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,875
Now then, I have to hurry
and get some sleep
