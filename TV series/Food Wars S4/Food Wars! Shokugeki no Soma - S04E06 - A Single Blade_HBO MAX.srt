Normally, white sauce is made
by melting butter with flour,

then adding milk while
continuing to heat and stir.

fully accentuate the butter.

mochi then?

The slow fried salmon.
The flour with a hint of sugar

176
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,458
reacts on a chemical level
with the butter,

177
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,166
producing an exquisite richness
to create the ultimate meuniere.

178
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,583
It's as if the saltiness

and delightful bitterness
of the squid liver

180

have completely incorporated
the flavor of the butter.

The soy marinated roe has been
paired with pomegranates

and tonburi caviar.

183
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,500
The butter has fused
these three ingredients

into a perfect blend.

185

And also, the secret
to his use of butter

186
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,625

lies in that special

He put oranges
and lemons in it?

191
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,625
So that's what all those
oranges
and lemons were for.

192

When pairing
the fattiness of the seafood

193

with that of
the greasy butter,

194
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,583
it naturally becomes too rich
for one to consume.

195
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,416
Which is why, to avoid that
and create

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,416
a more pleasing
flavor to enjoy,

197
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,458
he instead went with using
the sharp tang of oranges.

The butter is seeping
into my very brain!

When paired with the plump
and juicy tofu skin,

355
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,791
the pilaf within comes across
as delicate and refined.

All: This is such
a perfect combination!

I know, right?

360
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,458
The key was to do up the rice
without rinsing it first,

361
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,750
then before seasoning
the fried skin,

362
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,541
I rinsed it
to remove the oil.

363
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,541
But the most
important thing of all

364
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,958
was the kinda
sorta white sauce,

365
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,583
which I made with soy milk
and sliced mochi.

I see
what you did there.

367
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,750
A normal white sauce
using butter and flour

368
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,708
would have been way too heavy
and risk ruining the dish.

369
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,541
This has depth and creaminess,
but it's not oily.

370
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,833
That's what made
the uniquely light flavor

371
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,041
of this mochi based white sauce
so indispensable.

372
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,416
That I topped it
with some different cheeses

373
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,541
and baked it in the oven.

374
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,750
That's what makes it
so crispy.

375
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,416
Doing it like that also
emphasizes the saltiness

376
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,958
as well as
the smooth creaminess of it.

and then ramps
up the flavors to their max.

380

Some ingredients blend softly
into the richness of the butter,

and other ingredients
become even richer with it.

It was my mother's remorse
