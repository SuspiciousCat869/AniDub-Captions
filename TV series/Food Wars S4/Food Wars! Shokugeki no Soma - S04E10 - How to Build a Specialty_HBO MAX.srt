Older ants pump out
too much formic acid,

the taste harsh.

00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,541
Back then,
Soma couldn't put up

162
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,625
a decent fight against it,

163
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:48,041
but now he's served up
something to outclass even
that.

164
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,041
I can't -- I can't
bring myself

165
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,666
to destroy
this masterpiece.

166
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,208
It'd be shameful.

167
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,375
Don't be a prude, Anne!
Give me a bite of that!

168
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,750
Nah --

169
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,708
[ Moans ]

170
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,916
[ Moans ]

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,458
[ Moans ]

172
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,916
Why don't you give it a taste,
Soma?

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,166
You can compare it to that
previous venison dish of mine.

174
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,875
How could something
be this delicious?

175
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,333
The taste flies off the tongue

176
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,791
and shoots right up
into my nostrils.

177
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,250
The flavor's gonna
rattle my brain.

178
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,083
There's a frickin' universe
of difference

179
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,083
between this dish
and his other one.

180
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,916
That appetizer was not meant
to simply guide the diner

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
along to the final course.

182
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,083
It took us to a place

183
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,708
where all chefs are free of
hardship and mediocrity,

184
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,125
a world of peace and beauty
we have struggled to find,

185
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,416
a culinary Eden.

186
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,041
Hey,
quit acting like you've won.

187
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,416
Soma and Erina are not going
to let that happen.

188
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,708
Yeah!
Damn straight, girl!
You tell 'em, Meat-Meat!

189
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,416
Huh?
Why are you two staring at me?

190
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
Hmm?

191
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,166
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
What's going on?!

192
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,125
[ Whimpers ]

193
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,875
Out here,
it is manifested.

194
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,541
My power
of endowment.

195
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,208
Both:
Endowment?!

196
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,708
When I taste greatness,

197
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,958
the endowing pulse
within me discharges,

198
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,333
causing those around me to lose
all their clothing in one burst.

199
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
What is
he talking about?

200
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,708
I don't think
I understand this.

201
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,125
So, is he saying that the people
around him

202
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,208
were forced to get naked?

203
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,416
I remember
that happening once.

204
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,166
Whenever someone formally
receives the Nakiri surname,

205
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,125
they inherit
the power of endowment.

206
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,791
This includes marrying
into the family, of course.

207
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,166
So Uncle Azami was also
granted endowment abilities.

208
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,416
What is going on
in the Nakiri family?

209
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,708
You know,
these things happen.

210
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,125
No!

211
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,291
Well, now, can't say
I'm too impressed forcing a
girl

212
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,416
to disrobe
in the middle of a public venue.

213
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,291
It was not intentional.

214
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,875
It is simply indicative
of how delicious this was.

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,875
The fabled nakedness
of the great Nakiri family.

216
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,541
The fact that
the endowment ability

217
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,666
manifested
on such a great scale

218
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,250
proves that this dish is nothing
less than the genuine article.

219
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,916
Rindo Kobayashi put everything
into her appetizer

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,750
to highlight the main dish,
which allowed Eishi Tsukasa

221
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,083
to bring sheer brilliance
to his plate.

222
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,083
I can imagine no greater
response to this challenge.

223
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,958
They are the most powerful
forces on Totsuki's campus,

224
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,666
and the course that these two
have served up

225
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,375
is nothing less than
the ultimate in fine dining.

226
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:15,416
Now, the Totsuki side
has served their dish,

227
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,666
and it's in
the most exquisite of forms.

228
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,958
On the opposite side, the main
dish will be served up by Erina,

229
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,416
who has forgotten my teachings
and peppered it with impurities,

230
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,250
which can never be considered
fine dining,

231
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,750
thus there is no hope

232
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,250
that you will ever
win this battle.

233
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,916
When we fought before,

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,875
you didn't serve this dish,
did you?

235
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,208
And so, I'm led to believe
that you decided to take it

236
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,791
a little easy
on me back then.

237
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,250
Frankly,
it's kind of an insult, Chef.

238
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,041
Ah.
It wasn't intended as an insult.

239
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,125
Rather, I thought
there was no need

240
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,041
to put forth the effort
to make the dish.

241
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,750
But since now the emphasis
is true fine dining,

242
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,791
I simply went with the
greatest
option at my disposal,

243
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,208
and naturally, I chose
to use my specialty.

244
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,916
Then the gloves
are off now,

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,375
because I'm not here
to lose either.

246
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,208
I couldn't make this
at the time,

247
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,875
but this is
<i>my</i> specialty.

248
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,625
So, get ready!

249
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,958
I'm gonna whip it out,
right here and now.

250
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,500
Did Some just say
that he's going to

251
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,958
make a specialty
of his own?

252
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,958
But Soma's the one
making the appetizer.

253
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,083
What's it going to be?

254
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,041
Is it a specialty
appetizer?

255
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,416
If it's our dude
Soma we're talking about --

256
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,166
Don't tell me he's going
to make<i> that!</i>

257
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,083
Behold, my specialty
appetizer --

258
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,916
squid tentacles
drowned in peanut butter!

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,625
Both:
Peanut butter squid?

260
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,083
There's no way, right?

261
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,833
Wait, Takumi,

262
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,083
so how did the recipe meet-up
go with them last night?

263
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,958
Yeah. Did they come up
with some sort of strategy?

264
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
I swear,
this is going nowhere!

265
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,791
Let's just put aside who'll
be making the main dish.

266
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,291
Instead, we should use tonight
to hammer out

267
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,583
the overall
core structure.

268
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,208
You're fine
with that, right?

269
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,333
Soma: I'm telling you,
this is the kind of appeti--
Oh, come on!

270
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,333
I'm going outside to get myself
some fresh air for a minute.

271
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,375
Erina, come back!

272
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,458
[ Door closes ]

273
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,041
Ha!
She seems rather excitable.

274
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,041
If the two of us
can't work this damn thing out,

275
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,916
I say we just go with some
rock, paper, scissors.

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,625
You can't be serious.

277
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,791
And if you lose
rock, paper, scissors,

278
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
will you properly devote
yourself to the appetizer?

279
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,833
Ugh. True.
It could end up coming to that.

280
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,708
There's no "could
end up" about it.

281
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,708
Just what are you
talking about?

282
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,958
Oh, by the way,
Isshiki,

283
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,333
what was that key thing
we heard about?

284
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,708
Sounded important.

285
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,958
Because you are the key
that is necessary

286
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,708
to guide all chefs along their
proper path.

287
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,166
Ah.
Director Azami.

288
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,916
He wants
to make use of her God Tongue

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,166
to implement
his plan.

290
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,375
Erina's tongue
can determine what is

291
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,875
good and bad about a dish.

292
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,125
And because of that gift,
her decision can free chefs

293
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,166
from the burden
of menu creation.

294
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,833
That is Central's
ultimate ideal.

295
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,458
The key that lies at the heart
of their great revolution.

296
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,750
Oh, really?
They want to use the God Tongue.

297
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,291
That sounds kind of interesting,
actually.

298
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,958
Mm!

299
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,958
Soma didn't say much
at the time,

300
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,583
but does he have
some idea in mind?

301
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,291
Erina!
Hmm?

302
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,083
Here are some chicken livers.
Taste them for me?

303
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,208
Chicken livers.
What's he doing?

304
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,208
He should be cooking.

305
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,916
In the regimental,

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,958
it's okay for you to help
each other out with the cooking.

307
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,583
So, then it shouldn't
be a problem to leave

308
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,083
the tasting to her.

309
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,041
If you're out to use Erina
to help you,

310
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,208
I'll just have to use her
God Tongue a bit myself!

311
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
That's an evil face!

312
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,333
What are you thinking there,
Soma, my man?

313
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,375
He's totally gonna use
his own teammate!

314
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,916
Although,
it does make sense.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,708
Not this. Rubbing homemade
mayonnaise into the livers

316
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,708
is indeed a good thing,
but the taste of it

317
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,708
doesn't spread
across the tongue well enough.

318
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,250
Got it.

319
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,708
How about now?

320
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,166
This is good.
Heh.

321
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,166
So, basically what he's doing
here is going back

322
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,833
and fine tuning the flavor
of each part.

323
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,625
Doing it this way,

324
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,125
he can take stock of what's
lacking and adjust accordingly,

325
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,166
getting those flavors
as fully realized as possible

326
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,125
so as to make the perfect dish
to bring down the council.

327
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,791
Clever.

328
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,333
Yes. This way,
he will probably be able

329
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,083
to make
one incredible appetizer.

330
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,166
But still, being told
how to adjust his flavor...

331
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,250
Yeah.
By the time it got this far,

332
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,125
Soma would have
pitched a fit.

333
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,916
Not now.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,250
It looks like Soma has learned
Miss Erina's true power.

335
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,041
He's come
to finally trust her!

336
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,458
Give the spice mix
a little taste!

337
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,083
How's the sauce
flavor palates?

338
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,416
To his credit, he will now
listen to my instruction.

339
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,291
This should
at least be laudable.

340
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
And yet...

341
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,166
If you must
make the appetizer,

342
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,625
what do you think of doing
a paté de campagne?

343
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,333
Oh.
A paté de campagne.

344
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,000
What is that?

345
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,125
It's an appetizer that refers
to a country style paté.

346
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,833
We've had to make it
in class before.

347
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,625
You take ground meat,

348
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,458
then add liver paste, stir in
vegetables, and cook it up.

349
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,166
The sticky texture and rich
flavor increases

350
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,083
the diner's anticipation,
making it a staple appetizer.

351
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,666
So basically,
it's just like corned beef.

352
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,125
It's completely different.
Whatever.

353
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,541
Now, regardless, the first dish
should tie into the main one.

354
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,208
Please keep this in mind.

355
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,125
Now then, I will
teach you the recipe.

356
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,958
I showed him
how to prepare this.

357
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,458
So, why does he keep tweaking
its arrangement?

358
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,000
[ Soma laughs ]

359
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,166
Soma,
what are you doing?!

360
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,041
Heh.

361
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,833
All done now.
Who's hungry?

362
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,916
Huh?
Huh?

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,541
Huh?
Wait!

364
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,166
All:
Now hold on!

365
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,583
Your order is up.

366
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,333
How do you like
my super delish appetizer?

367
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,208
[ Laughs ]

368
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,250
This...

369
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,916
This is...

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,250
You say you consider
this an appetizer?

371
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,708
He's a caveman!

372
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,333
A slab of meat is what cavemen
eat in anime!

373
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,500
Never mind the look.

374
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,666
There's no way
that's anything

375
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,166
other than
the main entree!

376
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,666
Dude, Soma!
What the hell are you doing,
brah?!

377
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,708
Huh?
What's the matter?

378
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,375
I just did what Erina
asked me to do earlier.

379
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,166
I served them a paté
de campagne as a starter.

380
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,708
Soma.

381
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,041
Is so determined
to fire back at Chef Tsukasa

382
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,666
for that specialty that he's
gone completely off the rails

383
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,375
and has sabotaged
your chances of winning?

384
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,750
Why, Soma?

385
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,416
Soma Yukihira,
you fool.

386
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,541
Now, look here.
That is not an appetizer.

387
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,750
Why do you seek
to admonish him for this mess?

388
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,083
Excuse me.
What was that?

389
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,916
I, uh, just thought
that I, uh...

390
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,250
Still, I suppose
we may as well try some.

391
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,708
True enough,
the inside is a paté.

392
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,166
By wrapping shaved meat
around the exterior,

393
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,708
he's made it look like
a piece of solid bone-in flesh.

394
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,375
Mmm.

395
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,083
[ Gasps ]

396
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,041
The exterior is made out
of shaved marinated beef.

397
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,583
While it's rich
and flavorful,

398
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,291
it's those fruity,
meaty juices

399
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,916
that grab hold of
your consciousness.

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,750
Just beneath that,
there's some sliced bacon.

401
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,583
It's also placed there
so as to hold the paté firmly

402
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,583
in place.

403
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
From the first bite,

404
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,541
the impact of all the protein
races through your body.

405
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,791
For the base
of that delicious marinade,

406
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,833
I used a Korean barbecue sauce.

407
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,250
To the store-bought sauce,

408
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,291
I decided to add aromatics like
garlic and ginger,

409
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,250
and I added soy sauce and mirin
to balance out the flavors.

410
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,083
It forms the perfect base.

411
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,750
I kept going,
adding honey, some grated onion,

412
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,750
and a bit of orange juice
to the mix.

413
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,666
I had Erina taste test it,

414
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,916
making sure it was a good match
for the paté de campagne.

415
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
It's not just the exterior.

416
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,208
The paté nestled within
is exquisite as well.

417
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,375
The flavors are so rich,
but also so delicate.

418
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,791
It's the perfect match
for the mellower exterior meat,

419
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,083
creating
a firecracker of flavor.

420
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,625
Chicken livers
are first,

421
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,625
complemented
by breast meat and cream,

422
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,375
then diced green beans,
carrots,

423
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,291
and shimeji mushrooms
are folded in,

424
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,333
each playing their own role,
making it simply wonderful.

425
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,375
Confit, [Speaking foreign],
and [Speaking foreign],

426
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,041
the perfect method
was used for each ingredient,

427
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,333
drawing forth
a soft sweetness,

428
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,125
which elevates the dish
to a whole new level.

429
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,916
Mm.

430
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,041
[ Gasps ]
What?

431
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,291
The flavor just changed.

432
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,875
It's like from between
these was delicious meat,

433
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,791
a geyser
suddenly erupted.

434
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,208
What is this
savory aroma?

435
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,875
Though I have yet
to try a bite,

436
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,750
my body is
reacting to it.

437
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,500
Something is oozing out
from in between the meat.

438
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,750
That would be a slow simmered,
super rich,

439
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,375
jellied consomme sauce
I thought would be nice.

440
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,458
Just before serving, I injected
a whole bunch of that stuff

441
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,416
using a large
cooking syringe.

442
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,166
As you keep eating,
more will start to come out,

443
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,958
evolving the flavor.

444
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,250
A flavor bomb.

445
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,583
That's like out
of molecular gastronomy.

446
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,541
Where the hell did you learn
that, Soma?

447
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,250
Amazing.

448
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,708
It feels as if this dish has me
in its thrall,

449
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,833
even more so than it did before.

450
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,666
From the luxuriousness that hits
you with the first bite,

451
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,291
as you continue,

452
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,875
it's like you're buffeted
by wave after wave of ingenuity.

453
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,625
To think all of this
was incorporated

454
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,833
onto a single plate.

455
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,458
Such satisfaction.

00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,708
[ Gasps ]

The endowment
has struck!

461

So then, Azami Nakiri must think
this is delicious, too.

Azami: This approach
to the vegetables

463

call to mind
Kojiro Shinomiya,

464
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,875
the Legume Magician.

465
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,750
By realizing the taste
and sweetness of the vegetables,

466
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:24,208
their dignity is preserved,
yet their flavor enhanced.

467
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,250
Also, different flavors come out
at different times,

468
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,166
pulling the diner
right along with it.

469
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,666
Wow. Like that crazy dish
that Soma made

470
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,666
for the lunar feast.

471
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,208
That's correct.

472
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,375
I took my two revise
Yukihira dishes

00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,500
and combined them.

474
