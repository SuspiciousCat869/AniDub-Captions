The definition of green tea
is quite broad

00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:34,333
and as such, there are
just as many applications.

37

Green tea is essentially
an unfermented tea.

It's dried immediately upon

Come to me.

48
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,541
Sencha should be steeped
in hot water for 30 seconds,

49
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,583
drawing out [inaudible] and
giving it its bitterness.

50
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,750
Genmaicha, which lacks both
bitterness and umami,

51
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,375
should also be steeped
30 seconds in 95-degree water.

52
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,541
That will elevate its aroma.

53
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,791
The compounds in deep-steamed
Sencha, however,

54
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,333
are easily dissolved,

55
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,416
so it should be steeped
in 80-degree water.

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,083
Then there's Gyokuro --
2 minutes at 60 degrees

57

to allow its umami profile
to fully develop.

He's using an iron pot to boil
the water for the tea.

First a balsamic reduction.

135

Then after that, I'll be adding
black vinegar and sugar

And then finally,
the pièce de résistance,

138
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,416
this smoked soy sauce.

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,541
That's smoked soy sauce?

exactly what it is.

has been over there

142

smoking it
this entire time.

143
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,791
When soy sauce is
smoked like that,

144
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,333
it becomes even more mellow

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,458
an altogether different depth
of lingering flavor.

146

It certainly
does smell delicious.

147
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,416
By infusing that smoky aroma
into the meat

148
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,875
as well as the sauce,

149
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,000
it creates a profile
that's more multilayered.

150
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,333
That's quite the innovation,
I will say.

151
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,583
And I would also say
excellent teamwork.

By scoring
the protein first,

477
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,291
it means the second you take
a bite, it melts in your mouth,

478
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,333
creating a wave
of delicious flavor.

479
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:38,583
Yes, your version was
quite splendid indeed,

480
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,333
but what I made
for the judges

481
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,875
was bite-sized
Kodama sushi.

482
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,333
It seems you understand
you made the common mistake

483
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,333
of applying too much scoring
on a piece of fish.

484
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:52,375
If you apply the knife
as you would with normal sushi,

485
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,500
the protein will melt
too quickly.

486
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,333
In order to prolong
that deliciousness,

487
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,458
you must learn
to control your scoring.

488
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,166
It seems you were unable
to trace

489
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,333
that extremely subtle difference
in my technique.

490
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,500
You mustn't blame yourself
with that mistake.

491
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,125
It is merely a difference
in our experiences

492
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,791
forged along the path
of sushi.

493
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,250
No. But what -- what about Chef
Megishima's African ramen?

494
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,458
What about all the high praise
you gave it?

495
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,000
True, his African ramen
was most spectacular,

496
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,000
but it can be said
Rindo Kobayashi's dish

497
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,583
has eclipsed even that.

498
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,375
By using the techniques
of firecracker chicken,

499
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,041
she was able to take
the mild flavor of the alligator

500
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,375
and give it
a whole new dimension.
