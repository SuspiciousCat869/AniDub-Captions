Incredible!
Mmm!

322
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,833
Even as the sweet fragrance
blossoms,

323
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,625
the crispness of the apple

324
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,041
is a delight to the palate.

325
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,750
This scent is Damask rose!

326
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,750
Damask rose?
Really?

327
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,416
So, that's what
that thing is?

328
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,041
Yes. Damask rose.

329
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,583
This is one of
my most favorite flowers ever.

330
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,916
It just always smells
so beautiful.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,583
They say it has the most refined
scent of all flowers.

332
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,250
It is called
the Queen of Roses.

333
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,625
Even Cleopatra adored
this flower.

334
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,333
She would even soak them
in her bath

335
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,083
to enjoy the fragrance.

336
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,958
You mean to tell me those apple
tarts smell

337
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,375
like freakin'
flowers, too?

338
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,250
They got to be
delicioso, bro!

339
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,375
So she's managed to impart
all of that aroma,

340
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,583
but no damage
from the boiling.

341
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,958
That's right.

342
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,916
If she condensed
that aroma through simmering,

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,250
it should have completely
wrecked the appearance

344
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,625
and texture
of the apple.

345
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,416
That's because I didn't
simmer it.

346
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,041
I simply infused
the rose's fragrance.

347
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,916
It might take a little more work
on the chef's part,

348
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,250
but first you gently rinse
the Damask rose petals

349
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,291
and then into the pot
they go.

350
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:43,125
After doing that, you can make
a sweet pink syrup out of them.

351
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,958
Thinly slice the apples
and give them a little soak

352
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,500
in the extract made
from the boiled apple peels,

353
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,875
then you add
the gorgeous rose syrup.

354
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,625
Let is sit
for 30 minutes or so.

355
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,291
Do that, and the apples will
turn a delicate rose red

356
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
and slowly take a wonderful
fragrance

357
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,166
for all to luxuriate in.

358
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,916
Just tossing everything
into a boil

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,875
would not be queeny
at all.

360
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,666
Being allowed a very slow
and graceful soak

361
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,625
better suits a rose
than a hot boil.

362
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,000
If I were to give this
splendid dish a name,

363
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:16,291
it would be
Apple Tart Fit For a Queen.

364

Also,
this basket is made of bread,

365
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:18,875
so you can eat it as well.

Reminds you of the autumn
leaves, doesn't it?

369
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,583
So then she utilized the apples
in order to make the sweets.

370
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,000
It is but
a subtle infusion,

371
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,500
and yet this requires
both a delicate hand

372
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,291
and a breadth
of expert techniques.

373
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,833
You need to discern
the optimal water temperature.

374
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,625
Without it, this sirup
is impossible.

375
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,666
Not a single ingredient
was lost.

376
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,041
As such, the natural sweetness
and the acidity of the apple

377
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,833
become the basis
for the tart.

378
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,375
And the luster
she achieved

379
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,000
by applying the liquid
with concentrated apple skins

380
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:53,916
was beyond reproach.

381
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,083
Her aesthetic
sense extends

382
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,291
even to
the lovely presentation.

383
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,750
It's as if she's from
some children's book.

Indeed, she is

to create a princess
of deliciousness.

that thing's a dud!

But taste
is where it counts.

409
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,375
Let's base this thing
on taste.

410
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:09,166
Let us now
begin our deliberation.

411
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,500
The filling is a
white bean paste,

412
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,041
and there are bits of diced
apple mixed in as well.

413
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,333
Oh, the apple
envelops it all

with a lush and truly beautiful,
refreshing scent.

415

However, that apple tart remains
superior in appearance,

416
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,125
and if I must,
aroma as well.

Not so fast.

Japan's dorayaki has
