162
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,291
Do your best,
Erina-poo!

163
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,208
Okay, Bucchi.
Let's make a great dish

164
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,166
and get rid of all this anger.

165
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,416
And we'll also take down
Erin-yan while we're at it.

166
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,250
Whoa!
What is all that?!

167
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,541
I'm trippin' on all those
super colorful batters

168
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,541
she got over there!

169
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,541
Interesting.
Let's see.

170
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,916
Strawberries,
matcha tea, cocoa, blueberries,

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,541
and black sesame.

172
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,833
It's like the fresh,
clean palate

173
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,375
for some vibrant painting.

174
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,500
With these beautiful,
delicious, edible colors,

175
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,625
it's time to start making
my painting.

176
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,958
She looks to be completing
one fancy illustration

177
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,333
after another.

178
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,916
How can she possibly
be so fast?

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,833
[ All gasp ]

180
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,250
She baked them all out
at once?

181
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,208
How good can
this pipsqueak be?

182
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,250
Now that they're done
and cutely decorated,

183
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,833
I'll put them in the oven
for three minutes,

184
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,708
and then after
I take them out,

185
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,041
by squeeze in this batter

186
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,875
that has the
delicious brown sugar.

187
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,083
It would seem to me that she's
making a form of cake roll.

188
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,708
The illustrated
confectionery popular in Japan?

189
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,000
If that's true,

190
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,416
that's surprisingly
unsophisticated,

191
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,750
considering the luxurious tart
she made.

192
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,833
Even the decorations
have to be cute. So cute.

193
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,625
She's using
the sucre tiré.

194
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,166
By tempering
the candied sugar,

195
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,000
keeping its flexibility,

196
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,666
you can stretch it out.

197
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,541
Of all
the candy making techniques,

198
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,083
this is the one that creates
the most sheen,

199
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,041
but it's extremely
hard to master.

200
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,666
And yet, she makes it
look so easy.

201
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,916
Her performance brings a wealth
of cuteness

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,958
to the entire cooking process.

203
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,250
Cuter. Cuter.

204
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,583
Carde:
Hold on a minute.

205
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,041
Histoire: Just how many
does she plan to make?

206
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,375
It's still not enough.

207
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,208
Right, Bucchi?

208
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,958
Momo's House of Sweets sure is
keepin a busy pace today.

209
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,291
Will Erina
be alright?

210
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:17,458
Well, let's just relax
and watch her do her thing.

211
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,041
I'm not sure
what she's up to,

212
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,666
but old Erina
sure seems fired up.

213
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,000
She's so careful
with the heat.

214
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
Whoa!
They came out gorgeous!

215
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,791
Look at those beauties.

216
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,625
She's made crispy tuiles
of brown sugar and black sesame.

217
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,125
And she has
two batters ready --

218
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,958
one with egg whites
and one with yolks.

219
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,125
Judging by all the ingredients
laid out,

220
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,875
it seems Erina's doing
a confectionery as well,

221
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,625
against the most skilled
patissier in Totsuki.

222

Yah!
It looks like it, huh?

223
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,333
Erina-poo is talented,

224
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,875
but isn't that
a bad move?!

225
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,875
No. The odds of winning are in
Miss Erina's favor.

Ah.

240
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,750
I was wrong when I called it
unsophisticated.

241
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,666
There is nothing simple
about that creation at all!

242
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,375
However, no matter how great its
appearance, taste is everything.

243
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,125
Yes, that's true.

244

the flavors dance on the tongue.

245

246
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,708
Mm! Oh!
Oh!

Oh! What is this
exquisite texture,

248
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,375
this
delightful sweetness?

249
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,583
When touched
with a fork,

250
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,875
it bounces back with
delicate fluffiness.

251
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,000
It is so remarkably
spongy!

252
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,541
Yet it melts in the mouth

253
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,541
like a soft, gentle rain
falling upon the tongue

254
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,958
and churgling its way
to utter bliss.

255
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,291
More than that, what is
this sweetness that permeates

256
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,583
to the very core?

257
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,458
The answer you're looking for
is this.

258
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,625
Both:
Soy sauce?!

259
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,750
I added cream, brown sugar,
vanilla essence,

260
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,750
and soy sauce,

261
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,041
then whipped it all up

262
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,041
and spread it on the cake
I just baked

263
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,416
and pulled out of the oven.

264
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,250
Then I rolled it up
and let it chill.

265
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,291
That makes the flavor
of the brown sugar

266
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,000
even cuter when one
bites into it.

267
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,541
So, put simply,

268
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,250
complementing the sweet elements
with a salty one

269
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,500
actually
emphasizes the sweetness.

270
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,791
It's an idea
much like salted caramel.

271
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,125
You used an original
soy sauce cream

272
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,583
to add flavor
to the mixture.

273
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,041
Brown sugar.

274
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,333
It contains sodium ion
and other minerals

275
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,750
not found in normal sugar,

276
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,541
giving it its unique flavor.
It is a mystery unto itself.

277
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,250
The unique flavor of the brown
sugar is the perfect match

278
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,541
for the richness
of soy sauce,

279
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,666
making it a match
made in heaven.

280
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,833
If you take a bite
with a piece of fruit in it,

281
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,291
then you'll enjoy
a different explosion

282
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,958
of flavor.

283
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,375
Of course, you can eat the candy
decorations, too.

284
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,708
So, if you put some little
pieces of it on your tongue

285
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,916
before you eat the cake,

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,583
it tastes
even more amazing.

287
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,875
I'm speechless!

288
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,583
With each bite,
it's as if I'm being led

the taste and looks,

00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,041
Good luck and all that stuff,
Erin-yan.

322
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,500
Do your best or whatever,
Erin-yan.

323
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,041
Woman: Huh? That's what
you want, Momo?

324
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,375
But it's not very cute.
Are you sure you want it?

325
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,375
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

326
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,291
Now you want this?

327
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,041
This one, right?

328
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,041
Man: Momo just keeps predicting
the next big thing.

329
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:42,583
Woman #2: She's a prodigy,
a prodigy of cuteness!

330
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,208
Man #2:
Miss Momo, these are the new
products we have in mind!

331
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,166
Which of them
do you think are cute?

332
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,000
Woman #3: You like to design
for these children's clothes?

333
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,500
Man #4:
Or these new sweets?

334
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,208
This one. That one.
That one. This one.

335
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,583
Woman: What?!

336
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,750
Man: You're really going to
Totsuki Academy?

337
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,000
But we make toys!
Are you sure?

338
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,625
Woman #2: No, come to
our fashion company.

339
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,625
Man #2: You could be
a graphic designer.

340
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,041
Woman #3:
Please tell us, why did you
choose to become a patissier?

341
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,958
Well, because I believe

342
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,750
that I'm at
my ultimate cuteness

343
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,125
for delightful,
enjoyable sweets.

344
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,750
To this very day,

345
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,333
I've walked the path of what
I think is cute,

346
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,791
expressing both cuteness
and deliciousness

347
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,416
in all the dishes
that I've curated.

348
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,250
And yet...

349
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,916
So, let me inform you

350
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,250
of the real reason
of your current mindset.

351
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:34,166
Just what is it you think
you'll inform me of, Erin-yan?

352
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,875
Erina: My apologies
for the wait. Please enjoy.

353
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,458
This is
soufflé léger de grace.

354
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,333
Ah.
A souffle.

355
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,291
I made one of those before.

356
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,666
Fluffy.

357
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,000
She countered
her opponent's roll cake

358
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,958
with an actual
pancake instead.

359
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,166
That's just like Miss Erina
to tackle the problem head on.

360
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,416
It's perfect.

361
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,708
I mean, it looks stylish
and super pretty,

362
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,625
but visually,
that roll cake

363
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,208
is just way too powerful
for anything else to succeed.

364
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,583
[ Giggles ]

365
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,625
Hey, what's up?
Is something funny here?

366
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,250
[ Giggles ]
Not really.

367
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,666
Well, let's
have a taste then.

368
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,750
A dish from
the God Tongue.

369
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,750
The cake looks so light
and wonderfully fluffy.

370
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,041
The moment
the fork slices into it,

371
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,666
the expectation of it
melting upon the tongue

372
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,041
runs through
every nerve of the body.

373
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,125
She knows how to make a dish
such that just imagining it

374
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,625
on the tongue
can control the human heart.

375
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,333
Erina: Love.

376
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,500
What is this?!

377
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,291
This is no
normal pancake.

378
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,500
Between these
two cake layers is...

379
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,041
All:
Anko!

380
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,708
Huh? Anko?

381
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,833
Yes. That is
the star player of this dish.

382
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,708
I used refined adzuki beans,
then added some brown sugar.

383
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,833
Brown sugar
infused with bean paste.

384
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,166
[ Giggles ]
She used a pressure cooker

385
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,708
to get it done quickly

386
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,458
and without losing any flavor.

387
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,958
A brown sugar paste?

388
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,333
So, then,
this dish is just a --

389
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,041
It's a bit
of red bean anko

390
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,875
that's been sandwiched
in between two pancake layers.

391
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,583
You know it is
traditional dorayaki.

392
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,875
The finest adzuki beans
from Tokachi

393
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,541
make the flavors
speak in even lower volumes.

394
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,041
The brown sugar is a perfect
match for this dish.

395
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,958
There's no flavor disparity
in this at all.

396
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,833
That's Master Erina,
our Hokkaido expert.

397
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,416
She knows
her ingredients!

398
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,791
Whoa!
Take a look!

399
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,541
Even Urara's
sucked in.

400
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,291
No,
I mustn't do it.

401
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,041
I must stand firm
and act solely just as an MC.

402
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,458
Don't worry. There's no reason
to hold back.

403
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,125
Don't you want to know just how
delicious this dish really is?

404
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,875
I want it.
Please, Master Erina.

405
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,208
More.
Please instruct me.

406
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,958
Make me your filling.

407
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,000
Anne and Urara: Fold me into
these sumptuous layers!

408
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,291
Looks like she's
been sandwiched, too,

409
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,583
as Anne-ko filling.

410
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,208
I'm so jealous.
Uh, shameful.

411
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,083
Now, judges, what say you?

412
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,416
A moment, please.

413
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,208
There is one more person
that I would like

414
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,958
to taste
this creation of mine.

415
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,750
Will you do me a little favor,
Miss Queen of Cuteness?

416
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,041
Momo: I will admit that your
dish seems pretty decent

417
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,750
in terms of cuteness.

418
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,750
However, it's still only
a 9.5.

419
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,791
Why did you add anko
to make it like a dorayaki?

420
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,458
I would think that would
have dulled

421
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,916
that delicate flavor
and texture of the souffle.

422
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,666
You could have just added
brown sugar to the meringue

423
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,833
so as to make it
a souffle pancake

424
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,125
that then would have giving you
a 10 out of 10.

425
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,750
I can tell by looking

426
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:34,666
it's just sub par, the same
as Megumi Tadokoro's dish.

427
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,750
Is that truly the case?

428
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,458
I think
that if you have a taste,

429
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,500
the reason
for your foul mood,

430
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,333
I'm certain that it will become
clear to you.

431
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,500
Did you hear her, Bucchi?

432
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,500
What do you think?

433
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,458
Huh?
Give it a taste and see?

434
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,375
Yes. You're much too kind
for us, Bucchi.

435
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,375
Mm.

436
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,458
Hmm.

437
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,875
This cuteness --

438
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,791
avoiding it is impossible.

439
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,000
Whoa.

440
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,166
What the --
What is even happening?

441
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Momo's gushing
over something she didn't make?

442
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,541
This -- This --
This beautiful depth of flavor.

443
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,791
You've added yogurt
as the secret ingredient.

444
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,166
That's exactly right.

445
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,500
I found by straining it,

446
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,166
the flavor
was concentrated enough

447
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,625
to become
a Greek style yogurt.

448
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,291
Removing the moisture
from the yogurt

449
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,375
emphasizes
the dairy aspect,

450
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,875
giving it a more subtle cheese
like depth of the flavor.

451
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,666
Then I added that
to the souffle batter,

452
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,000
which I made
with beaten egg whites.

453
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,208
So, then this --
this must have been

454
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,083
what made the presence
of the brown sugar

455
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,000
even more prominent
in the dish.

456
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,791
Wow!

457
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,416
It didn't look like she was
using any special tool, though.

458
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,458
I see. That's how she used
those coffee filters.

459
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,208
Yes. Not only are they easy,
they're made for filtration.

460
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,500
That very design made them the
perfect choice for this dish.

461
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,083
Thanks to the strained yogurt
as my secret ingredient,

462
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,541
I was finally able to reach
the level of exquisiteness

463
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,875
I wanted.

464
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,500
Something
with a stronger flavor

465
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,250
like ricotta or cream cheese
would have,

466
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,625
as Momo Akanegakubo
said,

467
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,791
been sub par.

468
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,708
She is a talent indeed.

469
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,833
Upon seeing such skill as this,
I can imagine nothing greater.

470
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,375
Truly, she's an epiphany
from the heavens,

471
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,125
one that transcends
the boundaries of convention.

472
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,833
Erina:
The flavor that was my goal
could only be reached

473
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,458
by transcending the norm.

474
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,833
If I had not seen Megumi's
inspired dorayaki,

475
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,583
I could never
have made this dish.

476
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,208
What?
That dish

477
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,791
was a soufflé
léger de grace.

478
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,166
So,
that's a light souffle

479
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,000
and "grace"
can translate to "blessing",

480
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,416
just like your name,
Megumi.

481
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,583
Huh?

482
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,958
Momo,
up until now,

483
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,291
your exceptional
cooking sense

484
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,291
has allowed you to always
put out some top-tier dishes.

485
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,416
And that's why you refused
to even acknowledge

486
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,000
that there are worlds beyond
that which you have no control,

487
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,583
where dishes sparkle
with a shine

488
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,750
you've never known.

489
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Megumi
was willing to experiment

490
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,083
and fall short of a 10

491
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,041
because she was aiming
for a 12.

492
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,083
That's what irritated you.

493
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,125
How dare you,
you horrible girl!

494
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,291
You're acting all big and just
saying whatever you want, huh?

495
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,333
No wonder why everyone here
called you the Ice Queen,

496
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,791
Erin-yan!
Yes, that they do.

497
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,958
But I am no longer
a queen content with merely

498
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,125
sitting back in her throne
and ruling with no innovation.

499
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,416
That's right. The frustration
that you're experiencing,

500
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,125
it's something that I have
felt myself once before.

501
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,333
On that day, in my castle over
which I had full reign

502
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:32,583
and I have absolute authority,
he appeared.

503
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,958
There's no way
I'll acknowledge this dish.

504
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,666
The only cute things
hose those Momo thinks are
cute.

505
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,208
End of story.

506
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,666
I don't want
to acknowledge this.

507
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,000
I really don't want to.

508
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:47,666
Oh, no!
I'm gonna say it.

509
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,291
It's super cute!

510
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,416
You are most welcome.

511
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,666
Urara: The winner,
from the rebel alliance,

512
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,541
Erina Nakiri!

513
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,375
She did it! Miss Erina just beat
the number three seat

514
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,500
on the Ten.

515
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,708
All: Yeah!

516
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Banzai! Banzai!
Banzai!

517
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,000
You got some nerve,
Erina.
Hmm?

518
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,833
You sneak. You totally stole
my catch phrase,

519
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,500
even though you changed it up
to try to make it

520
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,000
your own.

521
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,166
Now, look her! I was not
inspired by your phrase at
all!

522
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,333
You took a glance over at me,
though, didn't you?

523
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,083
And that was totally a sign
you were ripping me off.

524
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,833
But you won,
so I totally forgive you.

525
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,500
I don't need your
stupid forgiveness!

526
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,958
Erina!
Congratulations.

527
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,666
And also, um,
w-well, um...

528
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,708
thanks so much!

529
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,041
Thank you for my
name in --

530
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,083
Th-- Thank you
It's so nice of you.

531
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,708
Come on now.
It's nothing to cry about.

532
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,083
God, you're weird.

533
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,708
Any case, this is no time
to rest on our laurels.

534
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:51,041
There are still
two cards remaining.

535
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,666
Your attention, please.
I have some news.

536
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,875
I hereby announce a small change
to the judges panel

537
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,541
for this food war.

538
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,750
Effective immediately,
I am acting as panel chairman.
