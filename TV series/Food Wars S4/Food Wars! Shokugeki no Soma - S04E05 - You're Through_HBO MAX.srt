Although it was

Artichokes.

205
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,750
This unassuming vegetable
is known to have an abundance

206
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,458
of the bitter compound
called cynarine.

207
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,500
Its main characteristic is that
it inhibits

208
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
the taste receptors
on the tongue

209
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,541
and tricks the person
who is eating so much so

210
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,083
that anything
eaten afterward

211
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,583
is perceived as much sweeter
than intended.

For real?
For real?
It can do that?!

serving a dessert

and add to the sweetness.

216
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,000
A lot of famous chefs
make use of that knowledge.

217
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:32,708
Your shigureni dish is one
of intensely rich sweetness.

218

Makes sense, I guess?

remaining on the tongue,

291
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:48,125
even simple water can seem
dangerously sweet in comparison.

292
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,583
So, you're saying the sweetness
of Takumi's shigureni

00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,000
All: Yeah! Have a little
sip or something!

316
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,625
No, I'm fine
with it as is.

317
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,291
Well, it's a good thing,
accepting one's fate.

318
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,541
Don't have to,
because I will win.

319
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
What?

320
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,208
Takumi.

321
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,958
The pizza.

322
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,166
He should have made
the shigureni the main topping.

323
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,958
Ah.

324
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:10,458
The all-important shigureni
is only on half of it.

325
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,625
Shoji: The other half
is cheese only?

326
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,000
Daigo:
That's way too simple!

327
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,375
Oh, no.

328
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,625
What are Takumi's
chances of winning?

329
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,625
Buon appetito.

330
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,875
Huh.
So I see.

331
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,375
The left
and right side toppings

332
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,833
are clearly separated, much like
a Japanese delivery pizza.

333
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,666
Is it acceptable
to eat this by hand?

334
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,416
In Italy, it is common to use
a knife and fork to eat pizza.

335
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,708
Please feel free to eat
it however you wish.

336
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,166
How you decide to eat the pizza
won't affect

337
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,916
how delicious it is.

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,291
However, there is one thing.

339
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,833
I would ask you all
to heed the words of your chef,

340
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,708
and that would be for you
to begin eating

341
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,750
with the shigureni side
on the right.

342
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,000
Hold on
just a minute!

343
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,708
But the cynarine would make
all the sweetness

344
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,041
count against it.

345
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,875
What are you even thinking,
Takumi?

346
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,916
Well then, I'll begin
with the shigureni.

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,041
I'm sure its taste
is sublime.

348
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,500
Or yet, would
have been normally

349
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,541
if it weren't for
the cynarine.

350
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,250
Given the nature of this
contest, it can't be helped.

351
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,458
[ All groan ]

352
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,791
[ Gasps ]

353
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,125
[ All gasp ]

354
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,416
This deliciousness is simply
unrivaled!

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,666
[ Groaning ]

356
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,541
What the --
But how can that be?!

357
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,083
I used a yuzu and miso
sauce on the pizza dough.

358
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,000
It was a combination I'd already
decided upon.

359
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,125
As intended, I took the miso,
sugar, and mirin,

360
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,541
but scaled back
as much as possible

361
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,666
to account for the chemical
components of the cynarine.

362
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,000
And instead, I use yuzu juice
to bump up the acidity level,

363
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,333
and I even added
some grated rind to it.

364
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,000
That added bitterness
and sourness.

365
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,166
I assumed that Chef Eizan's
roasted beef dish

366
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,833
would be eaten first,

367
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,666
so I had to adjust
the flavor balance.
[ Gasps ]

368
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,166
The way this was put together
has made the shigureni

369
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,541
much more flavorful
than if eaten on its own.

370
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,916
A normal Italian menu
always starts with an
appetizer

371
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,583
so that the diner
can look forward

372
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,541
to the upcoming main course,

373
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,875
which, as you know,
is the secondo piatto

374
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,625
Mr. Aldini's approach was to
make his rival's meal

375
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,125
the appetizer,

376
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,166
and his own dish the actual main
star of the show.

377
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,416
Mr. Eizan's offering became
a little more

378
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,916
than an opening act.

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,833
Impossible.
You bastard.

380
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,208
Are you saying you already had
that sauce combination in mind?

381
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,375
I only used artichokes
as a countermeasure

382
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,958
after seeing
the shigureni!

383
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,333
That way, you couldn't see
what I was really up to.

384
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,666
How could you possibly know I'd
be using artichokes in my dish?

385
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,416
I knew from the start.
What?

386
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,333
I knew the instant that the
theme ingredient was announced

387
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:44,500
that you would stoop low enough
and want to use artichokes.

388
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,791
There were few ingredients
in the storehouse

389
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,833
that could be used
to counteract sweetness.

390
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,625
For example,
the miracle fruit,

391
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,125
which is known to turn
sweetness into sourness.

392
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,666
But the miraculin glycoprotein
it contains

393
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,875
lasts about two hours,
give or take.

394
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,625
This would affect subsequent
judgings

395
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,166
for the rest of the day.

396
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,791
Knowing all that, it only left
artichokes as an option.

397
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,375
I've been watching you
this whole time,

398
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,708
and so I followed
your twisted line of thinking.

399
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,000
That led me
to the only remaining option

400
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,333
I figured you would use,
just as I'd planned all along.

401
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,250
Ah...
It can't be.

402
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,916
That means he wasn't
just glaring at me

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,125
out of plain resentment.

404
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,875
Since the third bout began,

405
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,250
he's been watching me
this whole time.

406
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,916
He's had me pegged
from the start.

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,333
Takumi:
Yes, that's right.

408
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,166
You're still the same,
and your past 21 food wars,

409
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,625
you've used
your opponent's strength

410
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,375
against them 12 times.

411
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,166
I was sure you used the same
approach this time as well.

412
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,458
Go on, keep going
with your same sad approach,

413
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,208
not knowing that I've seen
right through you.

414
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,500
Yes.
Be the jerk you are.

415
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,958
I'm sensing some real feelings
of resentment here.

416
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,375
Yeah. Something about
Takumi-poo
is different this time
around.

417
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,000
He's far more persistent
than he would appear to be.

418
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,583
I can say the same thing
about you too.
Huh?

419
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,875
It's kind of like something
Mimasaka would do.

420
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,875
Who would have thought that
the cynarine's effect

421
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,375
could be used against
itself?

422
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,875
They used their mutual enmity
to outsmart each other,

423
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,041
a battle of lesser
domain!

424
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,125
The deliciousness
of this pizza is truly...

425

Both:
...an inescapable illusion!

426
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,500
Hell yeah!

Desecrate Eizan,

And yet, the menu I have
prepared for you

429
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,083
is not yet finished.

[ All gasp ]

431
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,833
Italian cuisine generally
doesn't have a third course

432
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,250
when dining
at a restaurant.

433
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,125
But I wanted to break new ground
in today's bout,

434
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,583
so the other half of this pizza
does just that

435
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,958
with the cuisine
I've chosen.

436

Terzo piatto.

437
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,083
A third place.

438
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,333
Well, fancy that. That pizza
he made looks just like

439
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,583
two half moons.
[ Gasps ]
Half moons.

440

A Mezzaluna!

441
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:54,750
My dish is actually called
a double half moon pizza.

442
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,833
Now you will experience
its true flavor.

[ Grunts ]

444

[ Both gasp ]

[ All gasp ]

448
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,958
He has used for different types
of cheeses for this half.

449
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,875
Mozzarella, parmesan,
gorgonzola, and ricotta.

450
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,291
In other words,
we have a quattro formaggi!

451
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,625
These normal toppings
in Italian cuisine.

452
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,291
But combining them
is rare.

453
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,208
It's a perfect match
for the crust,

454
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
which was baked
a golden brown,

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,083
and has a hint of black pepper
to provide a spicy accent.

456
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,125
The difference between this and
the sweetness of the shigureni

457
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,833
lends such an amazing
depth of flavor.

458
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,833
From the bitterness
of the artichokes

459
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,375
to the sweetness of
the shigureni,

460
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,458
then the saltiness of
the quattro formaggi.

461
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,125
Uno.

462
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,666
Due.

463
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,666
Tre!

464
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,000
It invites the diner to the far
reaches of heaven in...

465
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,500
All: A triple jump
of deliciousness!

466
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,208
That's how confident
I was that from my experience

467
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,500
of baking more pizzas
than I can count,

468
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,708
I knew I can make the
ultimate quattro formaggi,

469
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,916
one that was a perfect match
for the shigureni.

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,666
But that's not all.
If not for the Stagiaire,

471
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,125
the shigureni pizza
would not have been possible,

472
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,208
and if not for
my battle with Mimasaka,

473
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,583
it wouldn't have occurred to me

474
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,916
to follow my opponent's
way of thinking.

475
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,666
All the losses, all the trials
I've endured up until now,

476
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,583
the taste of those experiences
are what let me make this dish,

477
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,791
and it's thanks to you for
having pitted me up

478
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,500
against Mimasaka.

479
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,291
It's what kept me moving forward
up to this very point.

480
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,375
He saw right through
my intentions

481
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,000
and used them to present
the judges

482
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,541
with a dish
of high voltage deliciousness,

483
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,958
just like Subaru Mimasaka
did to him prior.

484
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,541
This time,
he had me dancing

485
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,333
in the palm of his hand.

486
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,875
Damn you,

487
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,333
you friggin' annoying
first year!

488
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,250
Urara: In the second code
of the third bout,

489
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,791
the winner is
from the rebel's side,

490
