...a Witch.

4
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,416
[ROBIN]
Witches must be hunted.

That's the rule.

[ROBIN]
Isn't that right, Amon?

7
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,750
I've hunted so many...

8
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,791
I thought that the
Craft was a power

to hunt Witches.

...as a Witch...

20
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,041
So you want info
on someone who came

21
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,750
into the country
in the past month

22
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,583
through an American base?

23
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,833
I even tried goin' through

24
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,583
all of the Immigration
Bureau's data,

25
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,958
but sure enough, I didn't get

26
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,625
a single hit on anybody
fitting that description.

27
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,208
Well, that's not so surprising.

28
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,875
Okay, you're on then.

29
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,333
It'd be pretty dangerous work,

30
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,583
but since you're the one
who's asking me to do it...

31
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,708
I owe you one, buddy.

32
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,708
Well then, off to
the next informant.

Are you busy, sir?

35
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,708
[ZAIZEN]
No, come on in.

36
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,333
[TECH] Have you received some
sort of new information?

37
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,125
It's only a partial report,

38
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,000
but it seems that they
may have discovered

39
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,791
the whereabouts of Amon.

40
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,750
You think they really found him?

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,000
I do.

42
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,458
As we suspected, Amon's
injuries from the attack

43
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,750
were treated back at
Solomon headquarters.

44
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,250
Which would suggest
that he's in Europe now.

45
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,666
Yes...

46
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,166
And it seems as if his wounds
have completely healed.

47
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,666
They're telling me there's
a very strong possibility

48
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,333
that he's already left
the European Continent.

49
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,583
Then there's also a chance

50
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,500
he's found his way
back to Japan?

51
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,375
[ZAIZEN]
Mm... It's possible.

52
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,833
What is it, sir?

53
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,708
It's also possible that Amon

54
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,791
might have gone over
to headquarters' side.

55
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:27,125
[TECH] Perhaps it's too risky
to let him run loose.

56
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,250
It doesn't matter,
that man hasn't been given

57
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,625
one single piece
of vital information.

58
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,625
I'll admit that he was second
to none at hunting witches.

59
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,291
But in the end,
that's all he's good for.

60
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,083
Anyway, what did you need?

61
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,416
[TECH]
Right. I've brought you

the most up-to-date information

63

about the progress
on the Orbo Project.

64
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,833
[ROBIN]
I know...

65
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,916
I know that Sastre won't
be the last one.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,333
Solomon will definitely
send another hunter.

67
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,875
Will I fight them?

68
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,541
Can I fight them?

69
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,208
[OLD WOMAN]
The answer to that question

70
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,541
is hidden deep inside
yourself, little one.

71
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,666
Yes. I know that.

72

[computer beeping]

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,000
The next hunter is in Japan.

74
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,250
An earth Craft User...

75
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,708
Huh...

76
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,708
What's the matter with everyone?

77
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:18,875
Our hunt schedule

78
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,916
is completely backed
up with targets,

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,416
but if this continues...

80
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,208
We'll just fall further
and further behind.

81
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,416
That's true.

82
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
You might be right.

83
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,875
Maybe the answer to all of this

84
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,333
is that you need to go
over there and tell them

85
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,125
a joke or something to
cheer them up a little.

86
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,333
Are you kidding, sir?!

87
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,166
I think I can safely
say that my jokes

88
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,250
will make them feel even
worse than they do now.

[MICHAEL]
A hunter from HQ?!

93
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,791
[SAKAKI] So, you really think
he's here to hunt Robin?

94
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:06,125
Can you think of another
reason he'd show up?

95
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,291
If that's the case,

96
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,208
then what's headquarters
saying about him?

97
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,458
Not a word.

98
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,041
All they're saying right
now is that a hunter's

99
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,375
been sent to Japan.

100
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,875
There's nothing about
his name or his objective.

101
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,125
What do you suppose
they're up to, then?

102
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,500
It's pretty clear that they
don't trust us anymore.

Oh c'mon, you know what
I mean, don't ya.

105
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,708
You mean the deal
with Zaizen and HQ?

106
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,708
Well yeah, I definitely
get the feeling

107
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,708
that they're not getting along.

108
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,125
You've got a point.

109
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,250
I guess the fact that there's
no talk of cooperation

110
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,000
between the departments
probably means

111
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,166
the bosses are on
bad terms right now.

112
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,583
In fact, I bet we could
easily find Robin

113
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,500
if we really set our minds
to tracking her down.

114
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,875
After all, our information-
gathering capability

115
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,791
here in Japan is far
better than theirs.

116
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,458
But then, if it turns out
that we have to help them

117
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,750
that would mean that we'd
actually have to take part

118
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,416
in the hunt for her,
wouldn't it?

119

being totally hostile
to Robin, didn't it?

162
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,916
But from now on,
I'm completely on my own.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,208
Well you know, I sorta
got the impression

164
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,208
that you knew about that
last hunter beforehand.

165
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,708
Yeah, that's what I thought.

166
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,458
Well in that case, why don't
you hit up that source again?

167
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,958
Well. It's because, I...

168
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,250
It's tough to go to them now

169
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,166
because they saw you
take out a hunter, right?

170
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,125
Huh?!

171
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,666
How did you know, Nagira?

172
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,791
Why do you sound
so surprised, Robin?

173
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,041
It's clear you've been
getting intel somehow.

174
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,625
So it's only natural
that you got it

175
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,041
from one of your old teammates.

176
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,291
It makes sense.

177
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,458
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,750
I guess I should have
been more careful.

179
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,666
[NAGIRA]
You didn't have much choice.

180
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,375
However, now you're
being too timid.

181
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,208
Uh?

182
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,666
So maybe they finally saw

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,166
that you can be a
dangerous woman...

184
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,625
It's a real shame to lose all
your faith in your friends

185
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,416
over a thing like that.

186
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,208
Well, that was quick.

187
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,916
I put a rush on it.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,750
And?

189
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,833
It's just as you suspected.

190
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:25,750
Really...

191
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,875
This guy fits the description,

192
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,583
and also he entered Japan
under his own name.

193
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,666
His own name?!

194
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,375
Yeah, except that his ID said

195
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,250
he was a civilian from
the European Union.

What are you investigating?

The hunter from yesterday.

204
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,625
Any luck?

Hmm... Uh...

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,750
Well, then. Far be it
from me to try to tell

209
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,750
you people not to
investigate something...

210
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,041
But, I'd appreciate it if you

211
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,291
didn't forget you
have a job to do.

212
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,791
And as for you, Dojima...

213
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,791
What do you think you're
doing, standing around

214
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,000
like that with your coat
still on your arm?

215
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,666
I realize you enjoy being
late, but you should have

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,916
gotten down to work
a long time ago.

217
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,416
He's withdrawing money
on a regular basis.

218
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,875
The most recent withdrawal was

219
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,541
at the Kamiigusa
branch two days ago.

220
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,125
Is there some sort of problem?

221
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,875
Not really, I was just kinda
wondering why he would

222
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,291
do something as obvious
as use his own account.

223
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,958
You were the one
who told me to check

224
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,291
his bank account,
so why are you surprised?

225
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,375
I know, but I didn't really
expect it to be this easy

226
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,833
to track the guy down.

227
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,708
It's almost as if...

228
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,166
As if he's trying to broadcast
his movements or something.

[door clicks, footsteps]

What the hell does Amon
think he's doin'?

231
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:39,791
Why would he go and deliberately

232
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,541
do things that would
leave a trail like this?

233
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,291
Is he tryin' to call me out?

234
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,666
That can't be it.

235
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,375
And even if he were,
what good would it do?

236
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,875

Not now.

Huh? What, then?

248
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,125
[ROBIN] Michael, have you
gotten any information

249
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,000
about a new hunter
from headquarters?

250
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,500
A hunter? How did you--?

251
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,291
[ROBIN]
It won't end with Sastre.

252
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,375
I'm positive they'll be
sending another hunter.

253
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,375
If you know anything,
please tell me.

254
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,875
Just wait a second Robin,
you're not gonna try

255
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,916
to take on HQ all by
yourself, are you?

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,375
Don't worry. I'm the same
person I've always been.

257
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,416
But now headquarters has
classified me as a Witch.

258
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,625
Is it because I learned the
inner secrets of the Craft?

259
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,166
I have to find out. Otherwise...

260
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,833
You're pretty tough.
You know that?

261
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:16,125
I've got some information on
that hunter from HQ, all right.

262
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,875
And this time, they sent it
directly to my computer.

263
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,458
[ROBIN]
Why would headquarters do that?

I don't know.

265
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,291
But if they were able to access
my computer, then they're

266
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,958
the only ones who've ever
been able to hack into it.

267

There's someone else who

271
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,708
could've broken in to your
computer system, Michael.

to your system is Amon.
