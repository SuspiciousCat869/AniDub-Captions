[TOUKO] Robin? Robin?
Sleeping out here again.

3
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,791
[ROBIN]
Mm... Uh, good morning.

[ROBIN grunts]

00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,458
[TOUKO] Looks like you were
up late again last night.

6
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,125

You'd like some coffee, right?

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,583
Yes, please... Touko?

10
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,500
[TOUKO]
Hm?

11
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,291
[ROBIN]
I saw you the other day.

12
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,791
When you were with Amon.

13
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,000
[TOUKO gasps]

Perhaps you're lovers?

16
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,458
[TOUKO]
Don't be silly.

17
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,583
[ROBIN]
Hmm...

Yes?

Amon...? Yes.

22
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,250
You mean right now?

23
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,500
[ROBIN]
All right.

24
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,083
[MICHAEL] Normally,
the impact from falling

25
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,750
or even the water
pressure afterwards

26
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,458
couldn't crush anything
as badly as this.

27
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,208
It's someone with
extraordinary powers.

28
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,250
That is, if it was
actually done by a witch.

29
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:53,750
The driver who died in it was a
32 year-old named Ryoji Kasai.

30
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,125
Do you remember the big
200-million-yen robbery

31
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,083
that happened in
Tokyo last month?

32
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,291
Are you talking
about the one where

33
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,083
those guys took that
armored car out?

34
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,916
They checked the bills
in Kasai's pockets

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,125
to see if they matched,

36
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,791
and one of the serial
numbers was traced

37
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,250
to the shipment in the
armored car that day.

38
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,916
Not only that,
but Kasai worked

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,166
at a security company
that did armored transport

40
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,416
until about three months
before the incident.

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
[KARASUMA] So in other words,
they think he had a hand in it.

42
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,583
[DOJIMA]
Okay, so what?

43
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,083
Do they expect us
to find the rest

44
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,458
of the money or something?

45
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,916
[ZAIZEN]
No, that's for the police to do.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Until we hear otherwise,
they're handling it.

47
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,250
For now, it's a
potential homicide

48
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,375
with a ties to a
robbery and that's it.

49
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,791
We'll stay in the loop.

50
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,083
I want to see how this
investigation develops

51
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,083
in case signs of
a witch show up.

52
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,041
[KOBARI]
So, how are things going?

53
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,083
[ROBIN]
Huh?

54
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,208
You made a big
change moving here.

55
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,333
Well... it seems like every
day's a battle against time

56
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,750
and I always lose.

57
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,000
Like this morning.

58
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,541
Somehow I couldn't
get any breakfast.

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,708
Well, that doesn't
sound very good.

60
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:58,000
You're going to have to take
better care of your health.

61
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:01,083
Now then, would you care for
another espresso, perhaps?

62
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,166
[ROBIN]
Yes, thank you.

63
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,791
--[phone rings]
--[ROBIN] Oh.

64
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:05,958
[ROBIN]
Yes?

65
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,916
[AMON] This is the hospital
where they brought

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,791
the driver of the armored
car that was robbed.

67
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,791
They already took
a police report,

68
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,541
but it wouldn't hurt
to double-check.

69
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
[DRIVER]
This again.

70
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,458
Just like I said
every other time.

71
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,625
No matter what I did,

72
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,541
the steering wheel
just wouldn't respond.

73
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,583
[AMON] So... you're
saying it wasn't a case

74
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,833
of driver error.

75
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,208
Yeah, you heard me.

76
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,500
But then...

77
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,208
...what caused you to
lose control like that?

78
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,125
How do you expect me to know?

79
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,166
I was too busy trying
to make it out alive

80
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,708
to think about that.

81
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,166
Understood.

82
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,708
But when they inspected the
steering mechanism later,

83
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
they couldn't find
anything wrong.

84
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,208
Isn't that why you
guys suspect me?

85
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,958
You figure I was
just playing dumb.

86
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,458
I musta been in on it
from the beginning, right?

87
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,333
But I wasn't! It's true.

88
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,625
I didn't have anything
to do with it!

I've got an interesting bit

00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,166
of police news here.

95
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,833
They've been looking
into this Kasai

96
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,291
and they think one of his
buddies might be involved.

97
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,166
Suneo Tazawa, 37 years old.

98
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,416
He used to work for a
scrap metal company.

99

What about the witch list?

no hits from the list.

the police up to now?

[MICHAEL] They're on
their way to arrest him.

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,916
Should we go ahead of them?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,125
We can't. They won't allow us
to meddle in something like this

105
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,708
until we actually know
that this Tazawa's a witch.

106

We'll have to tell them to
exercise some patience here.

00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,666
[AMON]
Sakaki!

162
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,000
Get Michael on the line,
we're gonna need an ambulance!

163
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
[ROBIN, SAKAKI]
Huh?

164
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,750
[AMON]
There's a child inside the car.

165
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,458
[ROBIN]
There's a child?

166
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,166
[DOCTOR]
It looks like somebody gave him

167
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,250
some juice that was drugged.

168
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,083
He's in a very deep
sleep right now,

169
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,541
but he'll be fine
when he wakes up.

170
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,541
Well, that's good to know.

171
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,708
[MICHAEL] The case itself
is simple enough.

172
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,958
Tazawa must have
been the mastermind.

173
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,541
He probably just
brought Kasai in

174
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,916
because he had
inside information

175
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,083
about the cash deliveries.

176
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,166
Perhaps. But now that Tazawa's
power has been revealed,

177
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,750
he's going to be that much
more aggesive and dangerous.

178
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,000
And as I'm sure
you all realize,

179
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,833
witches prefer to
hide their powers,

180
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:07,125
and they try to blend in
as much as they can.

181
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,458
It's very rare to reveal it to
someone who's not a witch,

182
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,458
and when they do,

183
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,166
it's usually the
result of a trauma

184
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,250
or some kind of mental
stress that's caused

185
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,000
by an emotional breakdown.

186
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,458
According to the police records,
they were both compulsive

187
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,875
gamblers who owed a lot of
money to various people.

188
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
So does that mean he
killed Kasai to cover

189
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,750
his own tracks and also
not have to divide

190
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,166
the money afterward?

191
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,458
Maybe they both wanted it
all and he just got lucky

192
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,083
and pull it off
before he got to him.

193
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,625
[AMON]
In any case,

194
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,416
whatever happens, Tazawa knows
that the law's after him

195
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,875
and he knows he's
opened Pandora's box.

196
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,041
We don't necessarily
know what he'll do next,

197
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,625
but he won't hesitate
to use his powers.

198
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,708
[KARASUMA]
What about the boy?

199
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,250
[MICHAEL]
Mamoru Kudo, age seven.

200
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,500
He's a distant
relative of Tazawa's.

201
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,958
It seems his parents
passed away recently.

202
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,375
For the past six months or so,
he's been living with Tazawa.

203
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,666
[DOCTOR A] How do you feel?
Do you have any pain?

204
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:06,541
Good. You should be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

doing all righty?

207
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,291
If he starts having headaches,
call me immediately, okay?

208
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,958
Well that's a relief.

seriously wrong.

Is there anything you need?

Where's my Uncle Tazawa?

Oh, Mamoru...

217
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,291
[ROBIN] He doesn't know that
his Uncle tried to kill him.

218
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,916
He seems very worried
about Tazawa.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,625
That's horrible! He was
like a parent to him.

220
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,291
And also... that little
boy trusted him.

221
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,750
He's just a big <i>oni</i> .

Hm? <i>Oni</i> ?

223
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,541
An Oni is probably what they'd
call a hobgoblin or a troll

in Europe. No, that's not

[DOJIMA] Look, the only
reason we came here

229
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,958
was so we could pick
up the boy's clothes

230
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,250
and some everyday things
for him, that's all!

Right now, this site's
part of an investigation.

235
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,916
And even the STN needs a
proper warrant to enter

236
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,958
a sealed investigation
site like this.

237

in the hospital, okay?

he's been passed around

Mr. Tazawa took over custody,

00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,916
but he's pretty
much neglected him.

272

It was pretty bad.

273
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,208
He didn't pay much
attention to him.

274

Then on the other hand, he is
an awfully strange child.

Oh, now there, there, darling.

Do you remember those stunts
people used to do on TV?

Bending spoons and such?

278
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,375
I guess he just thought
it was fun to show folks

00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,541
how he could twist
things with his mind.

Is something wrong? Hello?

Dammit! Stupid Cops!

[MAMORU]
Uncle?

324
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,250
[TAZAWA]
Huh?

[gasps]

326
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,208
Hi, Uncle! I haven't
seen you for a while.

327
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,041
M-Mamoru...!

328
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,541
[MICHAEL] The police
have Tazawa surrounded.

329
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,791
You should head over
there and join Amon.

330
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,041
The location is--

331

[ROBIN gasps]
Mamoru...

332
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,333
I don't get it. Why would
he want to save Tazawa?

333
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:36,750
Amon...

334
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,291
Let's look around!

335
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,875
We have to find that kid or
it could mean serious trouble!

Come on, Uncle, hurry up!

338
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,666
[MAMORU]
Um... Uncle?

339
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,250
You didn't... You didn't
try to kill me, did you?

340
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,666
Why? Who told you that?

341
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,125
Aren't you gonna pick those up?

342
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:11,875
Listen, I...!

343
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,000
Pick 'em all up.

[TAZAWA gasps]

345
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,541
[MAMORU] Why? Was I in
the way, Uncle? Was that it?

346
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,291
Look, I'll give you
the money, okay?

347
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,583
You can have it all, I swear.

348
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,583
[MAMORU giggles]
You're strange, Uncle.

349
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,083
You know the money's
already mine,

350
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,083
cause I earned it
myself with my power.

351
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,375
Right?

352
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,958
But then you, Uncle...

353
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,625
And Uncle Kasai, too.

354
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,833
You guys tried to
take it from me

355
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,541
and hog it all for yourselves.

356
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,666
You gotta...
You gotta forgive me!

357
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,000
I-I... Somebody help me!
Help! Help!

[TAZAWA gasps]

360
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,875
You shouldn't have tried to
kill me like that, you know.

361
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,416
No. Don't do it.

362
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,916
No! Don't do this, Mamoru!

363
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,666
Don't do it, Mamoru!

364
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,125
Stop it, I beg you! No!

[MAMORU]
Huh?

367
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,625
But he... my uncle...

368
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,958
He tried to kill me, and then...

369
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,583
I mean, I only...

370
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,375
They're not going to
take me away, are they?

371
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,500
[MAMORU]
Oh, it's all right.

372
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,041
Don't worry,
they'll forgive me.

373
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,083
I'm only a kid, after all.

374
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,541
I'll be back to
see you real soon.

375
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,458
I'm just a little boy.

00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,458
Huh?

That was the Factory?

[AMON]
Let's go.

[NARRATOR]
Three hundred and twenty years

381
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:24,041
have passed since the
coven sank in the dark.

382
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,958
Ritual of darkness.
Changing lives.

383
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,708
[NARRATOR]
Straying from the right path.

384
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:35,125
Even a chosen one is not
allowed to evaluate souls.
