Hello?

Michael...

10
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,708
[ROBIN]
A strange corpse?

11
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,708
[MICHAEL]
It's 4:20 right now.

12
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,250
Be at the office by five, okay?

13
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,583
[COP A] All right,
I just got confirmation

14
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,041
from our commander.
We can't touch this case.

15
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,416
[COP B]
How come?

16
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,541
[COP A] It's officially been
turned over to the STNJ.

17
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,791
[COP B]
Is it that strange a corpse?

18
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,333
[COP A] Apparently, it's all
shriveled up like a mummy.

19
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,875
[COP B]
I see.

20
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,958
What are those guys
doin' in there?

21
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,541
[SAKAKI] The guys from
the Factory sure are late.

22
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,333
We're never gonna be able
to figure anything out

23
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:37,125
just standin' around lookin' at
a mummified corpse like this.

24
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,250
Robin! Don't mess up the
crime scene, all right?

[KARASUMA]
Amon...

26
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,833
I talked to the police and
look what they gave me.

27
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,208
They picked up this
licence near the corpse.

28
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,541
Haruo Katayama, 22 years old.

29
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,250
Old-lookin' corpse
for a 22-year-old.

30
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you think this
is the same guy?

31
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,291
[AMON] We'll have to wait
for the Factory to tell us.

32
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,208
[SAKAKI]
Hey!

33
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,750
I told you,
don't touch anything!

34
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,625
[ROBIN]
Something's here.

35
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,208
[ROBIN]
An insect.

36
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,416
[SAKAKI] I'm sure Dojima
is ditchin' again.

37
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,291
I'll bet she's still not here.

38
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,791
Oh, there she is.

39
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,791
She's goofin' off again!

40
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,375
[SAKAKI] Jeez, what are they
up to? This is stupid.

41
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,166
[ROBIN]
What is it?

42
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,625
Well, it looks
as though somebody

43
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,291
is trying to hack their way
into the STN computer.

44
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,500
It's all right.

45
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,500
My security firewall
is just about perfect.

46
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,166
There's nobody that could
break through it.

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,416
But if they do,

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,000
he's got a collar
around his neck for life,

49
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,666
like you-know-who.

50
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,333
It's always the same, isn't it?

51
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,125
Uh, Hattori, what happened to
those files you were getting?

52
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,833
Um y-yes, those files.

53
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,458
I was just, uh...
They're right over, uh...

54
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,333
[AMON]
What are you doing?

55
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,625
Michael, let's go.
There's a meeting.

56
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,958
He's such a pain.

57
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,125
[KARASUMA] Mummified corpses,
similar to the one

58
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,291
we found, have been reported

59
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,333
in two other places
in the region.

60
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,166
The victims are
a 33-year-old male

61
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,875
and a 28-year-old female.

62
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,041
Furthermore, DNA testing
has confirmed that

63
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,041
the body from this morning
is that of the person

64
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,125
pictured on the
license we found.

65
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,041
Their powers hadn't
yet awakened,

66
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,583
but all of the victims
were descendants of witches

67
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,541
that are registered
in our database.

68
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,208
They were all witches?

69
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,416
[AMON]
Michael.

70
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
In an old file left by
the forerunner of STNJ,

71
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,791
I found several similar
mummified body incidents.

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,333
Hundred and twenty years ago
in Europe, 80 years ago

73
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,708
in Japan, and 40 years
ago in the USA.

74
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,958
All the victims were witches
or decendents of witches.

75
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,125
Back then, it was
determined that

76
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,500
it was caused by a
certain kind of witch,

77
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,041
and in the case 80 years ago,
they even found a suspect.

78
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,958
There was a suspect?

79
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,625
[DOJIMA] Hey, he's a
pretty good looking guy.

80
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,083
Kazuma Kurata.
He was 30 years old.

81
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,000
Kurata went missing
when his boat vanished

82
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,083
during a violent storm at sea,
so the case was never solved.

83
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,416
What about the body?

84
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,041
[MICHAEL]
It was never found.

85
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,625
It's 80 years ago, right?

86
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,416
Even if he survived, I'm sure
he must be dead by now.

87
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,583
[SAKAKI]
Wait a minute.

88
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,208
With all the past cases,
why would a witch

89
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,416
mummify another witch?
I just don't get it.

90
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,833
[AMON]
In any case...

91
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,833
It looks like we'll need
to investigate him again.

92
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,791
It might be another witch.

93
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,875
But it could also be the actions
of one of his descendants.

94
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,291
[ATTENDANT]
Mrs. Kurata?

95
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,333
There are some people here
who wanna talk to you

96
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,541
about the late Mr. Kazuma.

97
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,791
Mrs. Kurata!

98
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,208
[OLD WOMAN]
Kazuma?

99
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,458
She gets like this sometimes.

100
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,458
Just let me know when you're
finished and ready to leave.

101
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,958
[DOJIMA]
Sorry to trouble you.

102
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,375
[DOJIMA]
Bow politely, now.

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
[OLD WOMAN]
That man will never die.

104
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,500
I know he's still young.

105
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,208
I married him and lived with
him for many, many years.

106
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,000
But he remained just like
he was when we first met.

107
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,791
He never seemed
to grow a day older.

108
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,250
It wasn't the same for me.

109
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,666
I kept aging and turned
into an old woman.

110
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,625
[OLD WOMAN]
You never change, do you?

111
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,041
You're just like mountains
around the lake.

112
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,375
[DOJIMA]
This was such a waste of time!

113
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,625
Yeah, we drove all this
way just to find out

114
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,250
that Grandma was
totally out of it.

115
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,500
Huh?!

116
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,750
Right! I got it.

117
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,750
I'll head over there right away.

118
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,250
Looks like they
found another mummy.

119
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,583
Sakaki, go check the
hotel's security cameras.

120
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,916
You got it.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,166
[KARASUMA]
Hm?

122
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,250
[AMON]
Another insect.

123
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
[DOJIMA]
Miho!

124
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,083
[KARASUMA]
Well, you two are late.

125
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,416
Oh, and guess who
we just discovered

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,541
on the security camera video.

127
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,208
[DOJIMA] Kurata?! You mean
Kurata isn't dead?!

128
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,625
[SAKAKI]
This is impossible!

129
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,750
Even if he was alive,

130
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,083
he would be 110
years old by now!

131
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,333
[KARASUMA]
No matter how you look at him,

132
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,500
this guy looks like
he's in his 30s.

133
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,708
[ROBIN] Dojima, maybe
what that old woman

134
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,916
told us was true.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,166
[AMON]
What?

136
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,791
[ROBIN] She said that
Kurata was always young,

137
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,000
that he never aged.

138
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,166
Never aged?

139
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,291
[SAKAKI]
No way!

140
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,333
How could somethin'
like that happen?

141
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,958
According to a hotel employee

142
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,583
who saw the guy
walking down the hall,

143
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,166
there was a tattoo of something
like a bug on his hand.

144
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,208
Wait a minute, I saw a
tattoo on Kurata's hand.

145
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,208
That's right,
a tattoo of a scarab.

146
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,500
[DOJIMA] Look at that.
Even the tattoo is the same!

147
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,250
[SAKAKI] All right, let's assume
that this guy is Kurata.

148
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,958
Why does he keep
goin' after witches?

149
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,166
He does it so he
can live forever.

150
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,875
[ROBIN] If Kurata is
a witch whose powers

151
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,750
are to absorb the life
energy of other witches,

152
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,333
then the cases in Europe
and Japan 120 years ago,

153
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,583
and 40 years ago
in the United States,

154
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,708
and the two we have now
are perhaps all connected.

155
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,916
It's obvious!

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This guy has a need
to absorb life energies

157
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,291
from other witches
about every 40 years!

158
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,791
Kinda' like a vampire,
but for witches.

159
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,375
Michael, that hacker you had.
When did he start?

160
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,791
I don't know. Yesterday I think.

161
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,166
Why do you ask?

162
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,958
In the STNJ computer,
there is a giant database

163
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,833
containing a list of witches
and all of their descendants.

164
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,708
If Robin's hypothesis
is correct,

165
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,875
Kurata might very well
be in desperate need

166
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,375
of that list right now.

167
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,000
Then Kurata was responsible
for the hacking?

168
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,708
[AMON] Michael, if there's
another attempt to get in,

169
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,791
don't interfere.

170
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,041
Give him the info
he's looking for.

171
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,375
Huh?

172
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,375
I'll have a surprise for him.

173
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,958
[footsteps]

174
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,458
Robin.

175
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,250
I brought some donuts.

176
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,125
I'll go make some coffee.

177
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,750
Is this what's on
Kurata's tattoo?

178
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,208
[MICHAEL]
It's a scarab.

179
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,708
Yes, I know.

180
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,875
A beetle that was thought of

181
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,791
as a holy creature
in ancient Egypt.

182
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,583
There are reports that
sometimes witches

183
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,041
will use some sort of a symbol

184
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,875
in order to utilize
their powers.

185
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,541
I assume the scarab is the
symbol used by our culprit.

186
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
[ROBIN]
Can I ask you something?

187
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,958
[ROBIN] What's the meaning
of the "collar"?

188
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,166
[ROBIN] You know, what
Dojima was talking about.

189
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,958
[MICHAEL]
Oh. What did Miss Dojima say?

190
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,250
[ROBIN] She just said
I should ask you about it.

191
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,583
[MICHAEL]
I see.

194
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,666
[ROBIN]
Is it him?

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,833
Prob'ly

196
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,541
It's very primitive hacking,

197
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,833
but I guess I'll let
the guy in as planned.

198
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,958
Target confirmed.

199
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,958

You're kidding. You just
let him get away?

208
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,750
[SAKAKI]
You got no right to talk.

209
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,833
You ditched us again.

210
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,208
[DOJIMA] So, how come
the Craft didn't hit him?

211
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,125
[DOJIMA]
Hm?

212
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,208
[AMON]
What do you think?

213
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,416
Huh?

214
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,416
About Robin's powers.

215
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,125
Is she just out of control?

216
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:35,750
Or is she...

217
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,666
This is rather unusual for you.

218
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,750
You're not one to be
concerned about other people.

219

[phone rings]

220
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,750
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry but
I have some bad news.

221
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,541
The hacker from this morning
was just found dead.

222
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,375
[MICHAEL] I'm pretty sure it
must've been Kurata's doing.

223
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,375
[AMON]
I gotcha.

224
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,750
Well, that's it.

225
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,375
So, I guess we're back
to square one, then, huh?

226
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,500
[AMON]
Yeah.

227
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,750
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,416
I didn't order this.

229
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,125
Japanese miso soup can
help to warm your soul.

230
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,750
Go ahead. It's on the house.

Robin, we've got an emergency!

236
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,416
[DOJIMA]
It happened early this morning.

237
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,416
[DOJIMA]
Can I see it?

238
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,208
It says "the tenth of
June at the lake shore."

239
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,875
[ROBIN]
What's the name of the lake?

240
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know.
There's no way to tell.

241

Hey, wait a sec. This photo...

00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:28,708
Maybe Michael can determine
the location using his database.

Huh?

263
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,041
We got him because
you determined

264
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,458
which lake it was, Michael.

265
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,583
Look, I brought you some donuts.

266
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,666
I'll go make some coffee.

267
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,125
[MICHAEL]
I was a hacker once.

268
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,583
[gasps]

269
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,083
But I wasn't what
you call a cracker.

270
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,791
I just liked to sneak through
high-end security systems

271
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,583
to reach terminals that
seemed impossible to reach.

272
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,208
I would never
attack the systems.

273
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,666
I would just leave a small
trace so I could get back in.

274
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,708
That way I could
play around later.

275
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,375
That was it.

276
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,666
Every computer system
all around the world

277
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,666
became my playground.

278
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,000
But then, one day,
I wound up inside a system

279
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,791
that was too much
for me to handle.

280
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,125
And I got trapped.

281
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,000
The STN.

282
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,708
It was amazing.

283
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,875
I... just couldn't believe
what I was dealing with.

284
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,375
I couldn't get myself
out of the system,

285
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,416
even though I tried to logout.

286
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I didn't realize
they were tracing me.

287
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,833
Soon after that, a bunch of guys
came and raided my apartment.

288
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,750
I thought I was history.

289
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,916
In fact, they were actually
gonna kill me right then.

290
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,791
But our boss stopped them.

291
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,000
You mean Zaizen.

292
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,250
[MICHAEL] In exchange
for sparing me my life,

293
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:11,375
I swore that, from that day on,
I would work for him.

294
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,625
Our boss has a collar on me.

295
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,041
So I'm stuck here.

296
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,333
