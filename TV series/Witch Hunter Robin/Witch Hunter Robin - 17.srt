Hey! I did it!

320
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,958
I really did it!
I hunted a witch!

321
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,083
That's right.
You did a good job, Yurika.

322
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,041
So it's true. You're safe.

323
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,791
Thank goodness.

324
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,291
Yeah...

325
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,958
Looks like you're having a...

326
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,125
...hard time.

327
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,375
[DOJIMA]
See? We really do need you.

328
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,000
This just proves that
we need your help, Robin.

329
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,875
[KARASUMA] The Factory
is headed here right now...

330
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,541
You should get going.

331
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,250
I understand.

332
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,333
Thank you so much, Robin...

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,333
Ah...

334
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,750
Could you fix my partner?

335
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,416
If you don't mind.

336
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,208
[DOJIMA chuckles]

337
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,333
[NAGIRA slurps]

338
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,458
[NAGIRA slurps]

339
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,333
[NAGIRA] In Japan, there's a
custom where you eat soba

340
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,666
when you're moving.

341
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,500
[slurps]

342
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,166
[NAGIRA] Now, I won't
ask you what happened,

343
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,333
but I'm not gonna
clean up after you, either.

344
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,166
If something happens...

345
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,875
...you better be prepared.

346
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,125
[ROBIN]
That child...

347
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,041
...she was a Seed, wasn't she?

348
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,291
[NAGIRA]
Hm?

349
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,333
[ROBIN] Nagira, are you
trying to save witches?

350
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,958
[NAGIRA slurps]

351
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,000
[ROBIN] Are you the leader of
a syndicate that opposes

352
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,541
the STN-J or something?

353
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,833
[NAGIRA] That's enough
dinner for tonight.

354
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,291
I don't do anything
as troublesome as all that.

355
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,000
But you see... It's like
I was saying before.

356
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,500
I just don't appreciate
it when people

357
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,291
try to lock folks up.

358
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,958
I guess that's all
there really is to it.

359
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:28,125
[ROBIN] I see. That's why
you're helping them.

360
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,291
[NAGIRA]
Who knows?

361
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,166
But if that's true...

362
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Amon is...

363
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,875
...your enemy...

364
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,250
Yeah, I guess so.

365
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:48,250
But then, why do you help him?

366
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,250
I just can't sever
ties with him.

367
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,625
[ROBIN]
Sever ties...?

368
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,000
Way back, Amon
and I actually lived

369
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,250
together for a few months or so.

370
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,875
A long time ago,
when we were both just kids...

371
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,791
Together... with Amon...

372
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,541
[NAGIRA]
Yeah...

373
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,583
[ROBIN] I helped hunt
down a witch again today...

374
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,541
From now on...

375
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,208
...what should I do...?

376
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,458
[ROBIN]
Amon...

377
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,083
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

378
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,541
since the coven
sank in the dark.

379
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,208
The fragment
for three centuries...

380
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,125
Stalking nightmares...

381
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,791
A letter from back
of the memories...

382
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,916
An immortal phantom
drives habitants

383
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,041
of darkness to the
feast of lust.
