Hello?

00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,958
Ms. Dojima?

00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,750
Huh? Ms. Karasuma?

5
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,916
She left the office
right after Haruto did.

6
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,208
Say what?!

7
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,541
The Factory attacked Haruto?!

8
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,166
Why would they--

00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,541
I gotcha.

[KOSAKA]
Michael...

13
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,750
It seems that
the time has come.

14
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,291
We're standing at
a crossroads now.

15
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,500
"Crossroads"?

16
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,250
Do we make the choice
to protect the STNJ...

18
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,625
...or follow our
Administrator till the end?

19
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,458
It looks like you've
lost weight?

20
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,375
Is that so... You okay?

21
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,958
Good.

22
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:49,375
It must have been
terrible for you.

[KOBARI]
Welcome home.

24
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,083
[phone ringing]

25
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,625
No luck.

26
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,416
She's not answering
her cell or at home.

27
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,333
Then, she must be--

28
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,416
Don't make it sound
so ominous!

29
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,791
You know, it could be that
she's just out on an errand

30
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,458
and can't answer her
phone right now.

31
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,750
No, Karasuma has
always made sure

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,875
that we could reach
her at any time.

33
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,875
If we've tried this hard to
reach her and there's still

34
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:12,166
no answer, then it's safe to
assume she's being hunted.

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,458
That's crazy! Why would
the administrator hunt us?

36
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,083
It's Zaizen.
And he's got a plan.

37
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,375
He wants to start hunting
witches with humans.

38
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,500
Using the power of the Orbo.

39
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,041
But, what about us then?

40
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,291
As far as he's concerned,
Zaizen may think

41
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,416
that hunters are no longer
necessary to capture witches.

42
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,958
But still! He can't do this!

43
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,583
[DOJIMA] Zaizen is in a very
delicate position right now.

44
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,291
Solomon HQ is completely
opposed to Orbo research.

45
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,958
It might be more accurate to say

46
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,541
that they're actively
trying to prevent it.

47
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,458
That's what that raid
on the office was about.

48
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,333
HQ was trying to find out
the secret behind the Orbo.

49
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,250
In Zaizen's eyes,
it may not matter

50
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,958
if you're a hunter or not,
a witch is a witch.

51
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,208
With no need for a
group of hunters,

52
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,875
I guess it should come
as no surprise

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,583
that he's trying
to eliminate us now.

54
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,250
[SAKAKI]
You sure seem to know a lot...

55
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,250
...Dojima.

56
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,125
Tell me. How do
you know all this?

57
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,625
C'mon, spill it!

58
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,833
How is it that you're privy
to all this inside knowledge

59
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,083
from Solomon HQ?

60
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,041
[DOJIMA]
I...

61
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,583
Well, I...

62
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,750
I'm so sorry...

63
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
I was actually...

64
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,916
...a Solomon agent sent in
to uncover the truth...

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,583
To get info about the Orbo.

66
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,958
So then...

67
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,833
You're sayin' you're nothin'
but a spy for Solomon.

68
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,750
And that means you were
lying to us this whole--

69
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,000
[ROBIN]
You're wrong.

70
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,833
No, you're wrong.
It's not like that.

71
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,666
Since we're all
telling the truth,

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,583
I wasn't brought in to be
a replacement, either.

73
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,625
What are you sayin'?

74
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,916
My real reason for
being assigned here

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,291
was to get information
about a secret

76
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,333
concerning Witches
here in Japan.

77
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,916
Just because we're
all a part of the STN

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,250
doesn't mean we always
have the same goals.

79
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,916
That's the kind of organization
that Solomon happens to be.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
[NAGIRA]
So...

81
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,375
Assuming that Karasuma
lady got hunted

82
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,083
and they probably took
her off to the Factory.

83

Amon, what's your next move?

84
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,791
We go in and rescue her.

85
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,458
But, Amon...

86
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,416
You're planning on
sneaking into the Factory?

87
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
But that's...

88
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,083
Uh. Michael.

89
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
[DOJIMA]
Michael!

90
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,458
What's going on?

91
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,583
I can't believe you
left the STNJ building!

92
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,916
Hey, what's goin' on here, man?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Uh?

94
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,083
[SAKAKI]
With you, I mean!

95
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,458
'Cause didn't you say that you
could never leave that place?

96
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,875
If I stay inside
the organization...

97
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,000
And if I always do what
they tell me to do,

98
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,500
then they'll let me live.

99
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,708
But then I
learned something...

100
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,041
I learned that a life
inside that kind of a cage

101
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,500
doesn't mean anything.

102
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,250
Michael...

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,625
Besides, if Haruto and Karasuma

104
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,208
have been attacked
by the Factory,

105
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,541
I guess that means

106
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,208
that I'm not really safe
inside their cage anymore.

107
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,166
Huh?

108
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,666
Amon!

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,708
This'll mean we're
defying Zaizen, you know.

110
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,666
Looking at Robin,
something occurred to me.

111
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,333
No, Robin made me
realize something.

112
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,916
That I'm gonna have
to be strong, too.

113
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,291
But back to the subject.

114
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,250
How do we go about rescuing
Ms. Karasuma from them?

115
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,750
Currently, we're in no position

116
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,208
to put together an
operational plan.

117
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,125
Our top priority is getting
recon on the Factory.

118
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,250
We have to find out
what conditions she's

119
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,291
being held under
before we can move in.

120
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,291
If you're gonna be sniffing
around the Factory,

121
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,916
use the STNJ
as your home base.

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,416
Yeah, but what if the Chief
or Hattori are there?

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,916
I really don't think you
need to worry about that.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,583
The Chief has decided
to join up with our side.

125
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,041
He's on our side?

126
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,291
Wait. That's crazy!

127
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,625
It's actually not
as crazy as you think.

128
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,208
I'd like to help you guys out
too, if you don't mind.

129
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,833
However, I should tell you I'm
gonna be doing things my way.

130
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,750
I'm gonna check out Zaizen.

131
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,583
Why Zaizen?

132
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,625
[SAKAKI gasps]

133
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,458
Oh, yeah! I get it!
I'll join you!

134
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,750
Me, too!

135
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,000
No. You shouldn't be seen
in public just yet.

136
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,166
But why not?

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,000
[ROBIN]
Amon's right, Sakaki.

138
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,791
I think you might want to lie
low someplace for a while.

139
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,500
Lie low someplace? Like where?

140
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:38,916
[SAKAKI]
Um?

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,375
There's a client coming.

142
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,125
Could you clear out
for a little while?

143
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,333
[SAKAKI]
Oh, sure! I'm sorry.

144
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,583
[HANAMURA] And could you do
something about this desk...

145
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,333
...like maybe cleaning
it up a little?

146
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,375
[SAKAKI]
Huh?

147
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,041
Sure.

148
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,666
Oh, I swear...

149
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,458
First that lover of his,
and now her boyfriend!

150
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:59,416
Mr. Nagira is too kindhearted
for his own good.

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,666
[ZAIZEN] No, this was decided
by the Japan branch alone.

152
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,458
There's no evidence
that the order came

153
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,000
from Solomon headquarters.

154
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,375
Once the local branch realized
that HQ wasn't going to act,

155
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,708
they graciously restored
our budget to us.

156
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,750
But it's a little early
in the game to see this

157
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,750
as any kind of move
towards reconciliation.

158
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:19,958
And therefore...

159
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,500
...I'm going to change
the hunt project.

160
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:26,208
Only use agents who are
verified to be compatible.

161
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,166
I want a new unit put
together immediately.

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,833
You'll be increasing
the hunts then, sir?

163
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,750
We'll be handling
all future hunts,

164
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:37,416
even those from the STNJ. You
should make the preparations.

165
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,916
[TECH]
So this means it's finally...

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,750
Yes.

[ZAIZEN chuckles]

171
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,791
Good job, Hattori. Move
along to the next one.

172
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,875
[HATTORI]
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,916
But, Chief, I gotta question.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,375
Are you sure it's
all right to do this

175
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,583
without informing--?

176
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,500
Hattori, what are you
babbling about now?!

177
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't you get it yet?

178
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,916
We're trying to organize a
revolt against the Administrator

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,583
and you really expect us to
ask for permission first?

180
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,083
[MICHAEL]
Okay...

181
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,166
I just finished cutting all
of our links to the Factory.

182
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,916
This should also keep
them from being able

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,375
to monitor us on our
mobile terminals.

184
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,125
I finally managed to
get a copy of it,

185
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,708
but half of it's blanked out.

186
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,000
Talk about bureaucratic
red tape!

187
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
Still, I'm pretty impressed.

188
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,166
You linked Zaizen to
Toudou's disappearing act.

189
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,416
And he went missing
almost 15 years ago.

190
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
[NAGIRA]
It was just a wild guess.

191
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,208
So, you gonna take us there?

192

[NAGIRA]
Take you where?

193
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,250
To the place that's gonna
fill in those blanks.

That's the second time today.

He goes out a lot more
than I thought he would.

196
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,541
I guess he must be hard at work.

[car starts]

198
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,000
[ZAIZEN] That's right, just keep
the STNJ under surveillance.

199
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:32,125
No, surveillance will be fine
for now. Timing is crucial.

200
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,708
I want to keep any evidence
of our conflict here

201
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,666
hidden from headquarters.

202
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,833
[AMON] Zaizen investigated
Toudou's disappearance?

203
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,500
[DOJIMA]
Just as we expected.

204
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,041
When we visited Toudou's
mother and asked her

205
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,541
she told us that Zaizen
came by 15 years ago

206
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,458
and went through
all of his belongings.

207
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,958
His belongings?

208
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,250
But I thought Toudou disappeared
somewhere in Europe?

209
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,416
His objective must've
been to get the research

210
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,750
Toudou left behind.

211
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,125
He had to retrieve it.

212
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,958
Solomon would never
leave material like that

213
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,916
just lying around
for someone to find.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,625
Especially from a man who was
a part of their research core.

215
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,916
First question is, why did
Toudou disappear so suddenly.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,208
And the second one is
what did he leave behind?

217
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,583
If we can answer those,
then we might learn how

218
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,625
Orbo was created
in the first place.

219
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,041
Not to mention the cause of the
trouble between HQ and Zaizen.

00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,333
[AMON] Michael can you
look into that for us?

00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,916
It's not gonna be easy.

After all, we just cut

has been in constant

Our results are irrefutable,

there's still no reaction

Japan branch and the police are

240
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,250
waiting to see what Solomon's
reaction will be to this.

241
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,375
[ZAIZEN] So, it all hinges
on whether or not we can

convince the people at

I thought they might
become afraid us.

After all, with

we do seem to be pulling
ahead of them.

break this standoff

I'm not sure, the

320
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,791
I just thought, if Zazen
is looking into it, too,

321
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,791
well, that means...

322
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,250
[gasps] Wait a second!

323
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,750
I've got it! We might
be able to use that!

Uh, Chief? Whaddya mean?

325
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,083
Where you going?

326
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,916
I'm off to play politics,

Huh?

[door slams]

329
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,791
So, then...

330
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,166
What you're saying is that
Zaizen is trying to obstruct

331
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,291
the activities of Solomon HQ?

332
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,916
Yes, sir.

[POLICE COMMISSIONER]
So...

334
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,083
Tell me exactly why
it is you want to know

335
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,833
when this man is being moved.

336
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,666
[KOSAKA]
For the STNJ, sir.

337
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,208
If we were to leak that
information to them now,

338
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,375
then they should be
able to stop Zaizen.

339
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,875
I understand.

340
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,750
If we manage to cause
some internal strife...

341
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,750
...it will put Zaizen at a
serious disadvantage.

342
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,500
I'm a bit surprised. You aren't
normally this devious, Kosaka.

343
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,791
Well, it's just that I, uh...

Heh, heh.

[POLICE COMMISSIONER]
It's me.

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,666
There's something that I'd
like you to find out right away.

I came by the other day.

There's something else I'd like
to ask you, if you don't mind.

happy to speak to you,

Mr. Amon, but I'm afraid
that I'll have to ask

your friend there to leave.

I believe you may already

[MOTHER] I'm sorry,
I don't know what you mean.

00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,958
This has to do
with the photograph

that's in your son's room.

about the woman

who's in the picture
with your son.

I don't know her.

But ma'am,
she was with your son--

That picture was
taken while my son

was away living in Europe.

I haven't the slightest
idea what sort of people

while he was over there.

Please forgive me for
dropping by unannounced.

Well... Guess I was wrong.

00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,541
I thought perhaps your son
was married to that woman.
