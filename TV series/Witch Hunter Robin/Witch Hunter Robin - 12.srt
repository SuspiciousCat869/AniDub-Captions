1
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,416
[ROBIN]
Who are you?

2
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,166
Who am I, you ask?

3
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,375
How shall I explain...

4
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:36,958
[ROBIN gasps]

5
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,916
[OLD WOMAN]
I am time.

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,208
[gasps]

7
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,458
[OLD WOMAN]
From the distant past,

8
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,000
time that has been
piling up like dust in

9
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,333
this little valley of a world...

10
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,208
That is who I am.

11
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,208
[AMON]
Yes, it's a witch's symbol.

12
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,833
[KARASUMA]
You know it?

13
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,833
Have you ever heard anything
about a certain incident...

14
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,875
...called the
Salem Witch Trials?

15
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,958
[KARASUMA] As I recall, it was
back in Colonial America.

16
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,666
A number of women were
murdered after they were accused

17
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,583
of being witches.

18
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,875
That was something like 400
years ago, though, wasn't it?

19
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,625
[AMON] Yes, it was
the late 17th century.

20
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,500
This is the symbol that
was carved into their bodies

21
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,458
to mark them as being witches.

22
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,416
[KARASUMA] I don' t know why,
but we've been repeatedly

23
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,541
receiving this symbol
on the office computer

24
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,125
since late last night.

25
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,708
At least I know where it's from.

26
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,750
It's coming from
Robin's workstation.

27
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
--[AMON] Robin's?
--That's right.

28
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,083
I'm not sure what
to make of it,

29
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,000
so Michael's trying
to figure it out.

30
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,875
As far as I can tell, there
doesn't appear to be

31
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,416
too much damage to the system.

32
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,875
[AMON]
And where's Robin now?

33
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,875
Do you mean you
haven't heard about it?

34
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,250
We got a call
from Touko earlier

35
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,083
asking if we knew anything.

36
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,083
She said that Robin's been
missing since last night.

37
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,333
A Salem Witch...?
But how...?

38
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,958
So you have
finally figured it out.

39
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,041
You're lying.
There is no way this is true.

40
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
[OLD WOMAN]
Lying?

41
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:34,416
[ROBIN] The Salem witches were
executed over 400 years ago...

42
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,041
And yet...

43
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:40,750
Why do some of those
witches still seem to exist?

44
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,125
Time does not always
oblige us and choose to flow

45
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,458
in the same predictable manner.

46
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,583
It can even come
to a halt and sit

47
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,958
in complete stagnation.

48
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,708
At least, this is true
for some people.

49
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,833
[ROBIN gasps]

50
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,833
[DOJIMA] Maybe she just
decided to play hooky today.

51
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,541
No, that's
more like your m.o.

52
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,208
Robin wouldn't do that.

53
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,416
Just as I thought;
Robin's not answering.

54
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,166
And she hasn't been to
Harry's this morning either.

55
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,625
[DOJIMA]
Maybe she just ran away.

56
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,750
Once again, I'd say
that's more your speed.

57
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,250
[MICHAEL]
Excuse me.

58
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,083
I know you like to chatter,
but if you've got free time,

59
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,083
why aren't you out
looking for her?

60
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,750
Even if Robin didn't
have anything to do

61
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,291
with sending that image...

62
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,666
...it's connected to her
somehow or other.

63
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,041
[SAKAKI] Boy, he's in
a bad mood, isn't he?

64
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,958
[DOJIMA]
What do you expect?

65
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,750
Now that someone's hacked his
impenetrable security system...

66
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,500
[ZAIZEN]
I see.

67
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,166
So you don't think she's
the one who sent this?

68
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,875
Robin's workstation
is simply an entry point.

69
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,083
I'm pretty sure that
what we're really looking at

70
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,666
is a case of someone from
the outside using her terminal

71
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,541
as a proxy. That's how
they were able to hack

72
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,250
the STNJ's security system.

73
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,833
[ZAIZEN]
So what's it all about?

74
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,833
Why go to all that trouble just
to send us some cryptic symbol?

75
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,791
[AMON] We don't know what
the intruder's intentions are.

76
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,166
Right.

77
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,041
And how long have these
intrusions been going on?

78
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,625
[AMON] The first traces
of it were a week ago.

79
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,916
So it started a week ago...

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,541
[AMON]
What are you thinking?

81
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,291
It's been precisely
one week since

82
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,791
we hunted Narumi, hasn't it?

83
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,333
[AMON] Yes, it has, but
Narumi's being held by

84
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,750
the Factory, so that should
rule him out, should it not?

85
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,125
True enough.

86
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,583
However, what if there
were other witches involved

87
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,708
that might still be at large?

88
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,875
Now, as far
as I understand it,

89
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,583
Narumi never gave any
indication of exercising

90
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,458
his powers until very recently.

91
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,000
As far as we can tell.

92
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,750
If he had been
using them before,

93
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,916
the STN would have
been watching him.

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,583
[ZAIZEN]
That means...

95
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,208
...it could be a witch...

96
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,375
...who can control
other witch's powers...

97
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,208
In any case, keep
a close eye on that intruder.

98
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,583
And while you're doing that,

99
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,708
I'll have a look around
and see what I can find out

100
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,875
about this Salem mark.

101
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,916
[AMON]
You're going to do it yourself?

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,833
There's something about this
that strikes me as peculiar.

103
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,250
[OLD WOMAN]
You tell me that I am not real?

104
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,791
[OLD WOMAN]
But can you honestly say

105
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,708
that you yourself are real?

106
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:33,666
You are a witch, yet you
willingly serve the Confraria.

107
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,958
[ROBIN]
No, that's... I'm...

108
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,458
[OLD WOMAN]
Oh?

109
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:41,125
Then tell me: what are
these powers of yours?

110
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,500
Are you saying that
it's not witchcraft?

111
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,083
So you're simply
a human being?

112
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,583
Just another descendant
of Saturn, nothing more?

113
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,041
Who is this Saturn?

114
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,875
We're supposed to go
to the Walled City

115
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,208
and just wait around there?

116
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,791
What's the deal? I don't get it.

117
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,166
Hey, is Robin inside
there or something?

118
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,875
I dunno... I'm sure
Amon's got a plan though,

119
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,166
or he wouldn't send us over.

120
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,166
Anyway, let's get over
there and stand by.

121
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,083
Okay, but why on stand-by?
What's the point?

122
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,791
[OLD WOMAN] What do you know
about the great witch hunts?

123
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,416
Do you know when
the last ones were?

124
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,875
Tell me, do you know?

125
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,500
18th century England.
The year 1717.

126
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:38,208
France. In the year 1745.

127
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,416
Germany. In the year 1775.

128
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,583
And finally... In the
year 1793 in Poland.

129
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,625
How many innocents were killed?

130
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:54,375
The enormity of the destruction
is impossible to comprehend.

131
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,458
It has been said that
several hundred thousand

132
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,875
perished during those periods.

133
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,750
Some even say that
as many as 9 million witches

134
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,250
were burned to death.

135
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,875
[ROBIN]
Nine million...

136
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,000
However... that was
far from the end

137
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,291
of the tragedies
visited upon us.

138
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,833
Some envied the witches
because of their powers

139
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,500
and they never stopped
persecuting them.

140
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,250
They were always in
the bowels of society.

141
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,583
Just waiting for the time
to continue the hunt.

142
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,916
You're wrong.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,375
It's not persecution
to pursue those whose hearts

144
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,041
have been taken over by evil.

145
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,291
I have been watching this
happen for over 300 years.

146
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:37,166
And I have been listening
for over 300 years...

147
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,083
...to words like those.

148
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,041
[ROBIN gasps]

149
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,125
For some reason,
you still cannot believe it.

150
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,000
Hardly surprising.

151
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,208
I will show you what
you and your associates

152
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,083
have been doing...

153
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,541
The meaning behind it.

154
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,041
The meaning behind it.

155

[OLD WOMAN]
In the name of the mages...

156

Wait a minute,
what's going on here?

161
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,250
What's that supposed to be?
Hey, Michael!

Hi, Amon.

167
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,916
[AMON] What's wrong?
The communicator isn't working.

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,416
[MICHAEL] I can't use the

It's that symbol again!

Most of the system's
down right now.

Is it an attack on the STNJ...?

[OLD WOMAN] The images of

Is it a devil?

No, i-it is not a god!

That's...

180
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,916
That's something...

So what you mean to say is...

00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,958
...that it is not a god,
but rather a devil.

...humans have ever known.

189
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,583
[MICHAEL] Okay, Amon, I think
I'm actually gonna be able

190
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,416
to find out who's
responsible for all this.

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,750
Really? You figured
out how they got in?

192
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,750
[MICHAEL]
Yeah, I found a loophole.

193
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,083
I think what happened is
they hacked into the system

194
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,375
through our
communication devices.

195
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,791
[AMON]
What?!

196
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
[MICHAEL] As long as the
access code's been entered,

197
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,791
they can get into the system
directly through the device.

198
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,083
That's why the
firewall didn't work.

199
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,250
[AMON]
Have you located Robin yet?

200
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,208
No, I've been trying
to track down her device

201
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,416
for a while, but it looks like
they did something to it,

202
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,583
and I haven't figured
out what's up yet.

203
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,625
[AMON]
Try the Walled City.

204
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,833
What, are you telling me
you've got a lead on her?

205
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,208
I'll explain it to you later,
I need you to hurry.

206
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,291
[MICHAEL]
Gotcha.

207
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,500
[KARASUMA] Yes...
It's Robin's scooter all right.

208
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,458
It looks like
she is here after all.

209
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,750
[AMON]
I see... Okay, I'm on my way.

210

A demon!

213
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,708
You're wrong. That's not it.

214
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,375
That's not why demons
fell from Heaven.

215
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,416
They fell because they
drowned in their own greed.

216
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,083
That's why the gods--

217
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,625
How can you possibly
say that the demons

218
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,625
were the ones who
fell from grace?

219
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,208
[ROBIN gasps]

220
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,791
[OLD WOMAN]
The ones who committed

221
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:23,416
the truly horrible acts of
history were actually the ones

222
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,541
who had been labeled as "gods."

223
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,125
[ROBIN] That was necessary;
i-it was to save them

224
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,750
from their misguided ways...

225
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,166
[OLD WOMAN]
Salvation? That's not true.

226
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,166
It's wasn't as simple as that.

227
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,291
What really moved
the gods to act...

228
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,916
...was jealousy.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,083
Jealousy and fear
of those individuals

230
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,791
who harbored strong powers.

231
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,916
These two emotions
drove them forward.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,833
The feelings consumed them,

233
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,875
and led them to annihilate
their former comrades.

234
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,333
And they did it.

235
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,958
They who had shared the
same blood were renamed.

236
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,083
They were "fallen gods."
They called them "witches".

237
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,708
That can't be true!

238
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,125
[YOUNG WITCH]
It is true.

239
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,291
Why would they play upon
the doubts of people

240
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,000
who were living in fear?

241
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,708
[OLD WOMAN] Why did they go to
such great lengths to implant

242
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,166
these feelings of
doubt in people,

243
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,791
and send innocent people
to burn at the stake?

244
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,083
You, of all people, should know.

245
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
I should know?

246
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,541
[OLD WOMAN]
Yes, you should...

247
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,500
...because you carry
the blood of countless people

248
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,833
who died that way.

249
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:40,083
That's right. You can't deny it.
You have witches' blood in you.

250
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,791
[AMON] Yes, I think that's
probably what's going on:

251
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,958
the intruder must have lured
Robin here under some pretext,

252
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,708
and then used the personal code
in her terminal to hack into

253
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,666
the STNJ's system.

254
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,833
[ZAIZEN]
Hmph.

255
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,000
As I mentioned,
I did a little research

256
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,916
on the Salem incidents myself.

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,791
It seems quite a few
witches are very well versed

258
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,041
in that period.
And their knowledge

259
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,208
is surprisingly accurate.

260
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,083
Do you know anything about
the Witch of Methuselah?

261
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,208
The clan of the immortal?

262
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,666
[ZAIZEN]
That's right.

263
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,166
Perhaps it's true.
Maybe they really do exist.

264
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,750
Knowledge that dates
back a few hundred years

265
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,833
can become a very powerful
weapon in the right hands.

266
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,208
A weapon?

267
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,625
[ZAIZEN] Even if they don't
have power of their own,

268
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,416
they may be able to use
such vast knowledge

269
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,541
to control other witches.

270
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,791
[ZAIZEN]
What's is it?

271
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,416
Nothing... But something
just struck me.

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,791
Sakaki told me about
the last time with Narumi

273
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,500
when all his powers seemed
to just suddenly dry up.

274
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,708
[ZAIZEN] Find Robin
as quickly as you can.

275
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,375
That may very well be
where the answer is.

276
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,833
[AMON]
Understood.

277
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,750
[OLD WOMAN] This is
the last prayer of a girl

278
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,708
who is soon to be
burned at the stake.

279
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,958
[OLD WOMAN] Those who choose
to hunt their shadow...

280
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,208
...will be destroyed
by that shadow.

281
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,125
Does that mean...

282
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,791
...that I've been hunting...

283
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,000
...my own shadow...?

284
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,458
[OLD WOMAN] You see, the truth
always has two faces.

285
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,208
[ROBIN]
Amon?!

286
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,666
A witch...
must always be hunted.

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,791
[gasps]

288
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,166
[ROBIN]
No! I'm not a witch!

289
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,750
[OLD WOMAN] No? What's
so different about you?

290
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,791
[ROBIN] My craft is one
that's used to hunt witches...

291
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,833
[OLD WOMAN] So you burned
the bodies of the witches...

292
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,583
...by the fire of
the burning stakes?

293
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,125
[ROBIN]
No... That's not true...

294
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,166
[OLD WOMAN] It's no different
than 400 years ago.

295
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,625
The history of suffering
is not over yet.

296
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,291
Still, it continues.

297
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,916
No... You are continuing it.

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,166
Those who carry
the witches' blood...

299
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,291
[ROBIN gasps]

300
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,416
A witch...

301
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,916
...must always be hunted.

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,125
[ROBIN]
Amon...

303
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,750
Amon?

304
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,291
Amon...

305
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,833
Amon...!

306
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:23,041
[YOUNG WITCH] I am finally
able to put an end to it...

307
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,166
[OLD WOMAN]
...after such a very long time.

308

[gasps]

309
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,500
It was such a long time.

310
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,250
It was far too long...

311
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,000
[ROBIN]
400 years of knowledge...

312
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,666
Everyone needs to attain
the mysteries of the Craft.

313
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,666
[ROBIN gasps]

314
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,750
What's that...? Could it be...?

315
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,208
[ROBIN]
This is the craft's...

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,583
[AMON]
Methuselah...

317
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:43,791
A witch who was
given eternal life...

318
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,041
The only thing that can
bring death to its eternal soul

319
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,333
is a fire that burns
its entire body.

320
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,375
[ROBIN]
That's why she chose me...

321
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,750
So that she could
end her eternity...

322
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,250
[AMON] If it's true, then
the burning of the witches

323
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,458
at the stake... may have
been something prompted

324
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,333
by some distant memory
of the Methuselah.

325
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,000
Such memories...

326
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,833
...are just too sad...

327
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,875
[MICHAEL]
Hm?

328
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,541
Hey.

329
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,916
[AMON] Did you find out what
the witches were after?

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,875
No, I still can't figure it out.

331
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,875
It seems that they
just used the system

332
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:43,583
because they wanted to send
a message to Robin, that's all.

333
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,916
To Robin?

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,333
Yeah. They were trying
to get in touch with her;

335
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,375
they wanted to send her
information about her powers,

336
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,000
but that's as much as I know.

337
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,583
Saturn, is it?

338
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,250
[MICHAEL]
What's that?

339
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,708
[AMON]
Greek mythology.

340
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,666
He was someone
who feared that his child

341
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,083
would someday
usurp his position...

342
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,750
...so much so,
in fact, that in the end,

343
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,833
he killed the child
and ate its flesh.

344
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,833
[MICHAEL]
His own child?

345
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,958
[AMON] Those were the words
that the witch left with Robin.

346
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
[MICHAEL]
The witch?

347
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,250
[ROBIN] I've recovered a
relic that's possibly related

348
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,833
to passing on the
secret of the Craft.

349
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,333
I'll stand by
for further orders.

350
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,416
[NARRATOR] Three hundred and
twenty years have passed

351
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,333
since the coven
sank in the dark.

352
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:30,541
Inquisitors. Witch hunters.
A crushed fate...

353
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:35,666
The child of darkness chosen by
the Lord shall see the judgment.
