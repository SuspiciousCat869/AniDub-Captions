00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,750
[DOJIMA yawns]

2
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,083
[KOSAKA]
Hm?

3
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,875
Well then, Dojima...

4
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,916
You must be tired from
working so late last night.

5
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
[DOJIMA chuckles]
Nah.

6
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,750
[KARASUMA]
Yurika.

7
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,541
[DOJIMA]
Hm?

8
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,125
Think you're ready
to go out now?

9
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,541
We need to start investigating
this strange death

10
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,708
that happened last night.

11
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,208
Ugh... But I...

12
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,125
Don't worry about it.

13
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,666
I'm sure that you can
take it from here.

14
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,083
[KOSAKA] I wish I had
your level of confidence.

15
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,625
I've informed our
manager about

16
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,416
the situation around here,

17
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,708
but he keeps telling me that
he's sure we can handle it

18
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,166
and refuses to even
set foot in this place.

19
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,791
I wonder if he's gone over
to visit the Factory again?

20
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,708
Well, that's what
he said anyway.

21
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,500
But how do we know he's
telling us the truth?

22
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,250
I don't know what to tell ya.

23
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,416
You mean what we've heard
from the boss, right?

24
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,791
I've heard the same.

25
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,083
Sorry to disappoint
you, chief,

26
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,708
but I don't know any
more than you do.

27
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,458
[KOSAKA grunts]

28
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,333
Well, I'm gonna get going now.

29
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,625
[SAKAKI]
Miss Karasuma, I'll go with ya.

30
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not sure that's such a--

31
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,583
[HATTORI] Oh! Sakaki, we need
you to stay here with us.

32
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,500
We'd be in trouble if something
happened here, ya know.

33
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,791
Heh! You guys are just a
bunch of big scaredy-cats.

34
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,375
For the past month,

35
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,875
not one person in
this room has said,

36
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,500
"If only Amon was here."

37
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:12,958
Yeah...

38
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,791
I've been checking up
on things there.

39
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,916
Production of Orbo must resume.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,541
And as for Amon,
HQ says the same thing.

41
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,708
That's right. Headquarters
still has no idea where

42
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,083
Robin might be now. They haven't
issued a search warrant.

43
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,000
At least not one
concerning that case.

44
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,916
Yeah, I'm sure if they
put their minds to it,

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,416
they could track her
down at any time.

46
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,666
But, it's obvious that their
true objective was the Orbo.

47
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,666
She was just an excuse
for them to get to it.

48
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,791
In any case, I want you to
follow Headquarters' movements.

49
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,125
Right, I'll leave it up to you.

50
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,666
[RECEPTIONIST]
That's exactly what I mean!

51
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,833
Don't you think so?
Well, I knew it all along!

52
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,708
H-Ha, ha! I know!

53
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,625
Yeah, you got that right.

54
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,833
But did you hear
the latest news?

55
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,708
Yesterday, Mrs. Kato's husband--

56
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,125
[ROBIN]
Excuse me?

57
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,875
I've got a package to deliver.
From the Nagira Law Office.

58
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,125
Oh, I see, could you wait
just a moment, please?

59
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,416
Please, take a seat.

60
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,333
The usual delivery from
Mr. Nagira has arrived.

61
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,750
[RECEPTIONIST] Uh, yes...
Yes, it seems that way.

62
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,083
[ROBIN]
Hm?

63
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,625
[MOTHER]
Come here, you mustn't do that.

64
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,916
[RECEPTIONIST]
Yes, I understand completely.

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,750
I'll take care of it. I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

66
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,916
Uh, sorry to keep
you waiting.

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,166
[ROBIN]
Hm?

68
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,041
I've been instructed to
accept the delivery here

69
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,333
for the time being.

70
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,125
Thank you.

71
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,750
Huh...? Uh, nice bike
you got there!

72
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,000
[chuckles]

73
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,791
[NAGIRA yawns]

74
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,916
She's certainly taking
her time coming back.

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
[NAGIRA]
You think so?

76
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,041
[HANAMURA chuckles]

77
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,125
Perhaps that new
young lover of yours

78
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,416
has just decided to
run off somewhere?

79
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,791
[NAGIRA]
Lover...? Heh!

80
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,791
[NAGIRA]
Huh?

81
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,250
[NAGIRA] Hey Hana,
if something happens, call me.

82
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,500
I'm gotta buy some cigarettes.

83
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,916
[HANAMURA] Could you at
least do a little work?

84
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,875
All you've been doing lately
is chasing after the new girl.

85
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,500
I'm not the one
chasing after her,

86
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,375
she's always coming after me!

87
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,708
Am I right?

88
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,583
Whatever...

89
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,625
[HANAMURA] Jeez... You be
careful out there, now.

90
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,083
[DOJIMA grunts]

91
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:32,333
[gasps, yells]

92
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,333
[WITCH A]
Sneaking around like that...

93
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,875
Let our little friend go.

94
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,208
[DOJIMA gasps]

95
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,208
[WITCH A grunts]

96
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,208
[DOJIMA screams]

97
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,000
Someone please...

98
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,708
[gasps]

99
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,208
[chuckles]

100
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,916

101
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,166

[WITCH B, C gasp, whimper]

103
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,833
[DOJIMA gasps]

104
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,166
[ROBIN] Dojima. Hurry up
and contact them.

105
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,291
[DOJIMA]
Robin?

106
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,041
[gasps]
Don't go! Robin, wait!

107
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,250
[DOJIMA]
That was pitiful, huh?

108
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,083
A witch hunter being
chased down by a witch.

109
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,750
I was on the trail
of a missing Seed.

110
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
And I was being tailed
and didn't know it.

111
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,333
But those guys weren't
the ones I was tracking.

112
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,083
Oh, there must be a
connection somewhere, though.

113
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,833
[ROBIN]
Hey, Dojima.

114
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,250
How is everyone?

115
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, everyone's fine.

116
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,208
Those guys that attacked
us in the office

117
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,916
were using plastic pellets.

118
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,791
Other than Sakaki,
who broke his leg,

119
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,166
we're all back up and running.

120
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,208
But it's really asking too
much of us to hunt like

121
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,000
we used to without you
or Amon to help us out.

122
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,416
And about Amon. Where is he?

123
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
They won't give us any
information about that.

124
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,291
I was thinking that maybe he
was hiding with you, Robin.

125
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,125
But I guess I was wrong.

126
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,000
I see. Then Amon is--

127
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,833
Ever since the attack,
Mr. Zaizen has just disappeared.

128
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,708
What do you think
might be going on?

129
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,250
I don't know. I've been
wondering about this.

130
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,958
Why is all of this
happening to me?

131
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,666
I dont know why the
syndicate is trying

132
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,250
to chase me down like this?

133
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,750
[DOJIMA]
Please... don't worry.

134
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,166
We don't have any orders
to hunt you back at STN-J.

135
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,666
I don't know what'll
happen in the future...

136
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,291
...but I'm glad that you're
all right. Thank goodness.

137
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,208
[ROBIN]
Amon...

138
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,416
Amon was the one who saved me.

139
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,333
Really? I see! Everyone will
be very happy to hear that!

140
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,375
[ROBIN]
No!

141
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,125
Don't tell them
anything about Amon,

142
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,625
or anything about me!

143
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:02,125
All right, then.
If you say so. But...

144
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,666
...could you maybe help
me with something?

145
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,291
Could you help me?
If I needed you?

146
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,291
Sakaki can't move at all,

147
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,875
and Miho is trying to
act like Amon would.

148
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,791
So they might try to
send me out on a hunt

149
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,666
all by myself again.

150
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,916
Robin, if that happens,

151
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,958
will you come along with
me and help me out?

152
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,208
[ROBIN]
I can't.

153
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,250
I can't tell you how
to get in touch with me.

154
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,458
And besides. If you're
connected to me in any way,

155
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,291
it'll just cause you trouble.

156
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,875
Robin...

157
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,291
[ROBIN]
Dojima.

158
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,458
Have you heard anything else
about what happened that day?

159
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,000
[DOJIMA gasps]

160
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,208
Come to think of it,
Michael did say--

161
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,416
[ROBIN]
What?

162
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,708
That it looked like they
managed to steal an

163
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,750
Orbo gun and some data.

164
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:55,125
Luckily, Michael's security
program was able to stop them,

165
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,875
so they didn't get anything.

166
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,250
What do you mean?

167
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,708
[DOJIMA sighs]

168
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,041
[DOJIMA]
Robin...

169
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,791
Thank you so much. I'm grateful.

170
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,500
[HANAMURA]
Oh, there you are, stranger.

171
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,041
The boss's been
worried about you.

172
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,916
I just went out
to get some coffee.

173
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,708
Well, if you're gonna be late,
give us a call. Please.

174
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,000
[ROBIN]
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,166
I delivered the package, though.

176
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,958
Since you had some coffee,

177
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,833
I guess you're not gonna
want any tea, right?

178
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,958
No thanks, I'm fine.

179
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,583
[HANAMURA]
Hm!

180
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,500
She could at least
sit down for a while.

181
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,833
I don't know about young
people these days.

182
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,708
Why is he so interested in her?

183
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,833
He must be going
through a phase.

184
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,208
[AMON] Robin...
The next time I see you...

185
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,833
[ROBIN sighs]

186
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,250
[ROBIN sobs]

187
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,041
[ROBIN]
I'll wait for you.

188
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:07,250
But, I just don't want to
just sit here waiting.

189
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,166
[KARASUMA]
I've cornered him.

190
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,166
[MICHAEL] The Factory
is already on its way.

191
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
[KARASUMA]
Roger.

192
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,458
[SAKAKI] Don't be reckless,
Miss Karasuma!

193
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,375
[SAKAKI] Are you listening,
Miss Karasuma?!

194
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,333
[gasps]

195
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:53,291
[KARASUMA grunts]

196
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,750
[KARASUMA grunts]

197
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,208
[WITCH D grunts]

198
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,750
[KARASUMA grunts]

199
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,458
[HANAMURA]
He's calling for you.

200
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,291
He's inviting you
to go out to dinner.

201
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,541
All right, so let's hear it.
Did anything happen there?

202
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,125
Not really...

203
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,916
You know, I'm well aware that I
was the one who said it would be

204
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,208
best for you to hide
here in the city,

205
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,375
but I don't want you to
forget the kind of situation

206
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,708
that you're in right now.

207
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,458
I haven't forgotten.

208
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,791
Something goes wrong and
you'll put me in danger.

209
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,250
I'm looking after you
because Amon asked me to,

210
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,750
but I have absolutely no
intention at all of risking

211
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,833
my life in order to protect you.

212
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,333
I just to bumped into someone.

213
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,458
A friend from the STN-J.

214
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,625
Oh, really? Did you talk to 'em?

215
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,958
I didn't say anything
about myself.

216
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,791
But, I thought maybe she might
know something about Amon.

217
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,833
Hey, you said he
was gonna call you.

218
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,625
I mean, that was the promise
that he made to you, wasn't it?

219
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,916
Well, whatever.

220
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,625
There's something
I wanna ask you.

221
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,125
Take a look at this.

222
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,500
[gasps]

223
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,333
Can you tell me if that's
Zaizen, the boss of the STN-J?

224
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,708
[ROBIN]
Touko...

225
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,166
Do you know that woman?

226
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,041
Yes. We were roommates.

227
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,625
She was involved in the
incident because of me...

228
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,875
Oh, I see. She's in
a sanatorium now.

229
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,125
She's recovered physically,
but apparently she was

230
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,166
so traumatized, she's become
emotionally unstable.

231
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,791
What?

232
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,708
I'm not really sure, but it's
probably not such a big deal.

233
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,625
They're just being extra
careful because she's

234
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,625
Zaizen's only daughter.

235
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,500
Daughter?

236
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,625
You mean you didn't know that?

237
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,666
She has a different last
name because her mother is

238
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,875
his ex-wife, but he's
actually her father.

239
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,541
But Touko...

240
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
Why didn't she tell me?

241
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,166
[NAGIRA]
Don't know.

242
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,291
I just don't understand
any of this.

243
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:31,458
It looks like...
I can't trust anyone.

244
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,708
No one except Amon, right?

245
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,750
[ROBIN gasps]

246
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,791
I don't know myself,

247
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,875
but... I guess that Zaizen
guy is really something.

248
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,500
So Nagira,

249
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,791
you're not just checking out
the STN-J for me and Amon.

250
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,333
You have your own objective
as well, don't you.

251
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,708
My own objective?
Nah, it's nothing like that.

252
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,166
I just can't stand it when
someone decides they can

253
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,500
hunt people down and
lock them up by insisting

254
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,500
they're a witch or a Seed
or something of that nature.

255
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,333
[KARASUMA sighs]

256
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,208
[KOBARI] It seems a
little different now.

257
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,208
[KARASUMA]
You think so?

258
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,291
It's not just you,
Miss Karasuma...

259
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:21,083
It feels like everyone here
has changed a little bit.

260
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,875
Yeah... It does.

261
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,625
[KOBARI]
Welcome.

262
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,458
Hey there, good work today.

263
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,833
[DOJIMA]
You too!

264
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,083
You both must be
pretty exhausted.

265
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,083
Why don't I make the two
of you something sweet?

266
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,500
You did a really good
job out there today.

267
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,041
I'll probably be able
to join you tomorrow.

268
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,000
That is, of course,
if nothing happens.

269
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,375
You're so strong.

270
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,333
No, I'm not really.

271
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,333
Inside I'm scared.

272
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,250
I bet you I'm one of the
most frightened ones

273
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,041
out of all of us.

274
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,166
I feel I'll go mad
if I think too much,

275
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,750
so that's why I keep moving.

276
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,416
I can't do it anymore.
I just have to tell you.

277
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,083
I want you to listen too.

278
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,500
[KOBARI]
Hm?

279
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,750
Well what is it?

280
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,750
Today... The person who
saved me... was Robin.

281
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,125
What?

282
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:14,000
Robin... is all right.

283
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,375
Thank goodness.

284
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:19,958
I'm so glad.

285
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,541
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

286
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:23,958
since the coven
sank in the dark.

287
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,791
A fugitive...
A small encounter...

288
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,958
An invisible truth...

289
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:34,000
An endless fate draws
down a pitch-black curtain

290
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,708
on the stage between acts.
