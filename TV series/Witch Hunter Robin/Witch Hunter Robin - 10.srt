[ROBIN]
By the way...

63
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:10,833
Is it... okay for this
place to be so empty?

Well, I don't quite
know about that.

But seeing how I've managed
to keep the place going,

it can't be bad.

the guy that you--

00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:03,125
[HATTORI] I heard you.
But I was a little busy.

00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,458
In case you hadn't noticed,
I was sipping my tea.

Please forgive me.

00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,041
But you know, if you hear me,
you don't gotta ignore me.

86
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,291
Huh? Did you say something?

87
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,041
Nope. I didn't say a thing.

88
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,916
So, about the chief--

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,375
[HATTORI] Don't be redundant.
I heard you the first time.

at Harry's right now.

00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,750
[HATTORI]
He went to check on the girls.

93
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,583
They're always causing problems,

94
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,083
and now we've sent
them over there.

[slurping]

96
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,833
[HATTORI] Since we are the ones
who are responsible for them,

97
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,708
we must keep track of them.

98
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,416
So, that's why he looked
like he was all wound-up.

99
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,125
[HATTORI]
Sorry, we're you speaking to me?

100
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,791
Nope. It was nothing.

101
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,583
I just hope that
what he sees at Harry's

102
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,625
doesn't send him back
here in bad mood.

I was afraid of!

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,750
That you would just
sit around and do nothing.

working hard for me.

to drag yourself
to work every day,

Wow, Chief, you look
more worked up than usual.

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500

misses having someone

did you get that possible
match last night?

136

[MICHAEL] It was right after
we did the routine checkup,

so it must have been
somewhere around 21:30.

footage from last night.

This is when the suspect
enters the restaurant.

145
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,541
[AMON] Notice the guy
sitting at this table.

146
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,041
Just for a moment...
he reacted to the suspect

147
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,041
as he entered.

148
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,208
What's that mean?

149
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,333
If you remember...
we suspected this guy

150
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,250
because we thought that he
looked like Yutaka Kobari.

You mind clueing
the rest of us in?

154
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,000
He reacted to this guy

155
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,000
'cause he thought he
was Yutaka Kobari, too.

[gasps]

157

Then that means
someone other than us

Check the footage
from the past few days

was the first time

161
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,583
this guy's been to Harry's

164
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,458
[KARASUMA]
Yutaka Kobari became a witch

165
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,208
that the STNJ had targeted
around two years ago.

166
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:42,541
[KARASUMA] The informant
was the owner of Harry's.

167
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,416
And Yutaka was his son.

168
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,541
Yutaka trusted and confided
in his father about his powers.

169
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,333
Kobari managed
to escape the STNJ

170
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,208
and then completely disappeared.

171
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,041
[AMON]
About six months later,

172
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,583
stories began to surface
regarding a series murders

173
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,625
in the U.S. that bore
a strong resemblance

174
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,375
to his style of killing.

175
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,833
Yutaka Kobari had
moved to the United States

176
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,166
and become a hit man
for this organization.

177
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,041
However, eight days ago,

178
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
the STN headquarters
received word

179
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,583
of new activity on him.

180
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,541
It appears that Yutaka Kobari
has secretly re-entered Japan.

181
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
[SAKAKI]
Amon!

182
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,708
He has been there!
You were right.


183
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,000
[liquid gurgles]

184
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,375
[gasps]

185
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,708
[DOJIMA]
Hey, what's wrong, Boss?

186
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,541
Huh? Oh, it's nothing.

187
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,166
[TOUKO]
This is typical.

188
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,625
From out of nowhere you decided

189
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,125
to call and ask me where
I am and what I'm doing.

190
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,541
[AMON]
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,458
That's new.

192
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,041
[AMON] I haven't been
able to sleep lately.

193
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,291
There's a new case.

194
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,875
[AMON] It's actually a case
from a couple of years ago

195
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,500
that's come back.

196
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,791
For some reason,

197
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,208
I'm having a hard time
trying to stay focused on it.

198
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,333
My mind wanders

199
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
and I find myself
thinking of you.

200
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,708
Strange.

201
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,875
[AMON]
Yeah.

202
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,458
Not that.

203
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,833
What I think is strange is that

204
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,875
you're actually willing
to admit this to me.

205
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,541
[AMON] I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

206
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,333
[TOUKO] I was wondering when
you were going to say that.

207
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,541
[TOUKO]
Can I ask you one thing?

208
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,875
What's that?

209
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,125
[TOUKO]
Do you--

210
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,916
[inaudible]

211
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,791
[ROBIN]
Here.

212
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,541
It's on the house.

213
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:22,083
[phone vibrates]

214
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,750
[MICHAEL]
He's leaving.

215
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,666
[SAKAKI]
Huh?

216
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,291
[KARASUMA]
Enlarge it.

217
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,625
[SAKAKI]
But...

218
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,666
Why's he's leavin'
so early tonight?

219
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,625
Damn it!

220
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,333
[SAKAKI] He's been waiting
for days and he leaves now?

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
The man with
the trench coat left.

222
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,583
[MICHAEL]
I know.

223
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,166
And nothing seemed to happen.

224
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,333
He's walking out
the front door now.

225
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,583
Maybe he just
gave up early tonight.

226
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,000
[MICHAEL]
Maybe.

227
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,583
After all, he has been waiting
there for over a week.

228
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,416
[KOBARI] Oh, Miss Robin...
That customer's all right.

229
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,208
I'll wake him up
a little bit later.

230
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,333
It's getting rather late.

231
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,750
Why don't you help
clean up as well

232
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,250
so you two can go on home?

233
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,541
Uh, sure.

234
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:35,000
[sirens blare]

235
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,041
You were finally able
to get 'em to leave.

236
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,666
I take it you received
the message I sent you?

237
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,291
[YUTAKA]
What's wrong?

238
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,875
Why don't you
say anything to me?

239
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,583
Or... are you afraid of me?

240
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,083
Is that it?

241
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,250
I don't know.

242
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,416
Maybe. I might be afraid.

243
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,125
Hmph.

244
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:20,250
Maybe you feel guilty
'cause you betrayed me.

245
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,666
[YUTAKA]
Anyway it's pretty pathetic.

246
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,291
A father who's
afraid of his own son.

247
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:31,000
[typing]

248
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,125
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

249
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,541
[AMON]
Has everyone gone home already?

250
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,791
Yeah.

251
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,416
They've been puttin' in
a lotta hours this week.

252
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,750
Guess they wanted to
get home early for once.

253
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,041
Early?

254
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,250
Yeah.

255
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,666
The guy with the trench coat.

256
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,291
He decided to bail outta
Harry's pretty early tonight.

257
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,791
For some reason.

258
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,875
[AMON] Let me see
the footage of the guy

259
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,125
leaving the restaurant.

260
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,250
Huh?

261
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,375
So, tell me,
do you still resent me?

262
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,958
Resent you?

263
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
I guess I do.

264
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,375
It's true that I hated
you for a long time.

265
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,458
When I left this country,
I dreamed about nothing else

266
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,125
but coming back here
and killing you.

267
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,666
Do you know how it feels

268
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,000
to be treated like a monster
then thrown away like garbage?!

269
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,083
I am... still a human being.

270
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,833
I just happened to have
gained some extra powers.

271
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,958
And because of that...

272
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,541
...you threw me away.

273
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,083
I kept thinking,
"I'll kill him!"

274
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,708
"Someday I'll go back to Japan

275
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,500
and force the same
terror upon him

276
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,166
that he turned upon me."

277
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,666
That's what kept me going.

278
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,000
Then, I finally let it go.

279
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,500
[YUTAKA groans]

280
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,791
[KOBARI]
Yutaka!

281
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,375
[YUTAKA whimpers]

282
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,416
[YUTAKA] Are you really
going to call me...

283
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,333
...by my human name? [groans]

284
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,541
You must believe me
when I tell you this.

285
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,666
I tried very hard to
ignore your powers

286
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,416
and convince myself that
you were a normal man.

287
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,458
Then one day...

288
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,250
I realized that your
powers had become

289
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,458
so developed that I simply
could no longer deny them.

290
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,958
I knew it was only
a matter of time

291
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
before your powers took over

292
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,250
and you'd start
hurting other people.

293
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,125
It was my tainted blood
that did this to you,

294
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,500
and I knew I had to stop it.

295
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,458
[YUTAKA]
I know that.

296
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:54,000
But... I was in the U.S.
before I understood.

297
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,750
The only thing this power
is good for is killing people--

298
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,791
[YUTAKA groans]

299
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,583
[YUTAKA] He got me on the way
in, and it's starting to...

300
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,166
[KOBARI]
Yutaka, it's all right.

301
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,708
You don't have to
say another word.

302
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,916
It's not... all right.

303
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,208
I didn't think
that I would survive...

304
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,083
...as long as I have.

305
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,708
The people I work for...

306
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,166
They have no problem killing
anyone who betrays them.

307
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,541
"Betrays them"?

308
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,500
I... I betrayed
the organization.

309
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,958
[gasping]

310
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:30,750
I felt I had to see you...
just one more time.

311
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,750
I wanted to tell you that...

312
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,791
...that I'm sorry.

313
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,166
[KOBARI]
Yutaka!

314
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,916
Forgive me... Father...

315
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,458
[KOBARI sobs]

316
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,666
You're too late.

317
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,750
I didn't betray
my own son because

318
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,958
I was afraid of the power
that runs through his blood.

319
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,291
What I was afraid of...
was my own blood.

320
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:30,333
And what powers that I may
have lurking within myself.

321
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:35,166
I have no right...
to call myself... a father.

322
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,125
Why do you think
Miss Dojima is so late?

323
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,416
[ROBIN]
She said she was bored.

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,166
I believe she's very
easily attractive.

325
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,291
I think you mean to say,
"very easily distracted."

326
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,541
[ROBIN sighs]

327
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,375
Want one?

328
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,541
[ROBIN]
Mm.

329
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,916
May I... ask something?

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,250
Sure. Go ahead.

331
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:05,625
I wanted to ask you how
you felt about your son.

332
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:14,583
You must mean when I found out
about Yutaka's powers. Right?

333
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,375
I'm not really sure.

334
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,833
Two years can seem
so very long ago

335
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:24,041
when you're faced with
something like this.

336
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,166
It was a confusing time for me.

337
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,375
But there is one thing
that I know for certain.

338
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,916
And that is...
he truly was my son.

339
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,458
[gasps]

340
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,333
He "was"?

341
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,333
[liquid gurgles]

342
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,875
[NARRATOR]
Three hundred and twenty years

343
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,625
have passed since the
coven sank in the dark.

344
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,458
Walled city.

345
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,041
Those who had
forgotten their past.

346
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,500
Wandering runaways.

347
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,958
The child of the darkness

348
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,583
who strays there will
be judged by the soul

349
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,166
called "Eternal."
