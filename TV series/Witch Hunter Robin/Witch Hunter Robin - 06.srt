1
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,750
[KARASUMA]
Amazing.

2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,958
[MICHAEL] Her maximum range
is up by ten percent,

3
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,791
and her accuracy
is now 98 percent.

4
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,333
That makes her almost perfect.

5
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:03,583
[whistles]

6
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,458
That means we'll finally
get some use out of her.

7
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,458
She can go home.

8
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,375
--[beeping]
--[MICHAEL] Hm?

9
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,166
But, she says she wants
to do some more.

10
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,750
[AMON]
Tell her to hold back a bit.

11
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
[ROBIN] I didn't think
I was running that low.

12
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,500
[thunder]

13
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,750
[gasps]

14
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,083
[ROBIN]
What should I do?

15
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,375
I'm lucky that you came by.

16
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,541
[EIKO]
Yes you are.

17
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,291
Because it'd take you
well over an hour

18
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
to get to town from here,

19
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,791
And besides, a girl shouldn't
be walking here all by herself.

20
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,291
There are too many
scary criminals around.

21
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,458
Oh, I didn't know that.

22
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,833
[EIKO] Oh, very much so,
and there are a lot of kids

23
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,125
like you out there these days.

24
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,625
[ROBIN]
Huh?

25
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,125
[EIKO] I'm on my way right now
to give a piece of my mind

26
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,208
to a young girl who couldn't
even bother to call in sick.

27
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,875
If she really doesn't
feel like working,

28
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,750
I wish she would just quit.

29
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,041
Ridiculous.

30
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,541
Kids nowadays, I swear.

31
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,791
[EIKO] Work is how society
knows that you exist.

32
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,166
And life just isn't any fun

33
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,916
unless you pitch in
and work hard,

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,416
at least to show that you
wanna be a part of it all.

35
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,041
I know what you mean.

36
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,666
[EIKO laughs]

37
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,208
[ROBIN]
Did I say something strange?

38
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,708
[EIKO]
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,083
But it's just that I didn't
expect you to agree with me,

40
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,375
that's all.

41
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,958
Well, thank you very much.

42
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,250
Oh, wait a minute.

43
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,291
Here, go ahead and take this.

44
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,875
Oh, it's not very far.

45
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,541
[EIKO]
It's all right.

46
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,791
Take my business card.

47
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,000
You can return it whenever
you feel like it.

48
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,166
Oh.

49
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,708
Uh, thank you.
If you'll excuse me.

50
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,916
"Eiko Yano." Huh.

51
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,250
[CHIE sighs]

52
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,375
[CHIE]
I've got no energy.

53
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,833
I ditched work again today.

54
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,250
I'm probably gonna
get chewed out again.

55
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,875
[JEANNE] You have nothing
to worry about, Chie.

56
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,708
If anyone tries to harass you,
I'll never forgive them.

57
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,458
[CHIE]
Thank you. I--

58
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,541
[doorbell rings]

59
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,250
So what's going on?

60
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,375
You didn't even call in!

61
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,041
That's the second
time this month!

62
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,541
[CHIE]
I know.

63
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,375
[EIKO]
Are you sick or something?

64
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,625
[CHIE]
No.

65
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,958
I'm just bored.

66
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,375
[EIKO]
What?

67
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,666
[CHIE] The only work I get
to do is the boring stuff.

68
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,916
[EIKO] You have to walk
before you can run.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,375
If you do well with
what I give you,

70
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,833
then I'll trust you with
more interesting work.

71
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,083
[EIKO growls]

72
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,958
Stop that--are you
even listening?!

73
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,791
[EIKO] You mind telling me
what you're doing

74
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,041
washing dishes when I'm
trying to talk to you?!

75
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,125
[CHIE] I thought it would be
impolite if they were dirty.

76
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,458
[sighs]

77
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,375
[EIKO]
Jeez.

78
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,625
Why can't you just
get your act together?

79
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:24,333
If you can't, it's all
gonna be on my head.

80
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,916
[CHIE]
Okay.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,208
--[EIKO] Hm?
--Is there something the matter?

82
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,666
Well, I thought I just
heard something.

83
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,791
[CHIE]
Really?

84
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,333
[sighs]

85
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,375
[EIKO] All right then,
I guess I'll be going.

86
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,458
Just make sure to come
in to work tomorrow, okay?

87
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,250
[CHIE]
Okay.

88
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,083
[sighs]

89
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,750
Oh, hi. Good morning.

90
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,041
Excuse me.

91
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,791
Do you mind if I
leave this here?

92
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,458
[GUARD]
Oh, sure.

93
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,291
Ah, for your Vespa, huh?

94
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,750
Yes.

95
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,875
[GUARD] Do you want me to
bring it to you later on?

96
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:42,916
[GUARD]
Miss Robin?

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,416
[ROBIN]
I need to borrow this.

98
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
Sure.

99
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,000
[SAKAKI] Hey. You guys look
pretty bored somehow.

100
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,833
And what do you mean
by that, Sakaki?

101
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:53,958
If you're trying
to say something,

102
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,541
you might just spit it out.

103
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,375
Oh, nothing. No big deal.

104
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,458
[MICHAEL]
It's just an accident.

105
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,166
In fact, it looks
like the police

106
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,333
closed their
investigation yesterday.

107
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,458
Can you find anything
else about it?

108
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,375
[SAKAKI]
What is it?

109
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,791
Is there something wrong?

110
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,416
No, it's just that...

111
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,083
[KOSAKA]
Do we have an incident?

112
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,125
Well, Robin?

113
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
[ROBIN]
Uh, no.

114
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
It's nothing really.

115
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,208
[ROBIN gasps]

116
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,375
[ROBIN]
Amon!

117
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,458
I want to go pick up my Vespa.

118
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,750
Huh?

119
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,541
H-Hey!

120
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,208
[AMON]
This is the last time.

121
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,583
You know, you're much
too young to be using--

122
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,291
I'd like you to take me
somewhere else, okay?

123
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,500
[AMON]
What?

124
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,250
[KARASUMA]
So what's the big deal?

125
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,000
Why'd you call me with my
personal code like that?

126
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,125
[AMON]
Sorry to bother you.

127
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,333
[KARASUMA]
I was up all night working,

128
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,166
and I haven't slept a wink.

129
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Besides, we don't do accidents.

130
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,500
Yes, I know that.

131
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,125
[KARASUMA]
Then why are we here?

132
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,250
I thought it would be better
than touching a corpse.

133
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,250
Come on, that's not what
I meant, and you know it.

134
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,250
[ROBIN] Well... I saw her
just before she died.

135
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,916
If it hadn't been for
her I'd have gotten

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,958
soaked in that big storm.

137
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,416
And that's really the only
thing I know about her.

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,041
I'd like to think that someone
knew what happened to her

139
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,375
in the last moments of her life.

140
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,041
That's not it.

141
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,416
I need to know for myself.

142
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,958
[KARASUMA] I'm not on call
just to help satisfy

143
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,000
some idle curiosity of yours.

144
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,583
Our job is to hunt down witches,

145
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,125
not to waste our
time messing around

146
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,291
with normal traffic accidents--

147
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,333
[AMON]
You've made your point.

148
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a child's selfishness.

149
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,916
Let's try to humor her.

150
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,500
What is it?

151
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,291
It's surprise and amazing shock.

152
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,041
I'm not really quite sure why.

153
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,500
What made her feel like that?

154
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,500
I just told you, I don't know!

155
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,666
Maybe a cat jumped
out in front of her.

156
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't think that was it.

157
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,416
Huh?

158
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,000
[ROBIN]
There are no skid marks.

159
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,166
If something had jumped out,

160
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,708
she would have immediately
hit her brakes.

161
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,708
And that doesn't
explain her neck wound.

162
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,916
Maybe she wasn't looking
where she was going.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,250
She did hit the windshield;

164
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,416
a wound like that isn't
all that strange.

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,458
[AMON] Humans are fragile;
they die easily.

166
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,208
[ROBIN]
Amon...

167
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,458
I'd like to go see who Miss Eiko
was on her way to visit.

168
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,083
Well, great, suit yourself.
It's fine by me.

169
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,791
I'm gonna go home.

170
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,375
Hang in there, Amon!

171
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,333
[doorbell rings]

172
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,875
I have to say, I never expected
you'd be so aggressive.

173
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,166
[doorbell rings]

174
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes?

175
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,708
[CHIE] Well, for her sister,
you don't look much like her.

176
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,500
[ROBIN] She was going
to be my sister-in-law.

177
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,250
He was Miss Eiko's boyfriend,

178
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,500
and as his sister,
I was concerned.

179
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,958
You see, after she passed away,
my brother went into shock.

180
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,916
[ROBIN] Did Miss Eiko say
anything to you last night

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,750
that struck you as
out of the ordinary?

182
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,916
Huh?

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,666
[AMON]
Perhaps she had an enemy?

184
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,708
Well...

185
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,458
Miss Eiko is very pretty.

186
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,208
And she does a good job at work.

187
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,750
Aren't you sad about this?

188
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,791
Huh?

189
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,166
What do you mean?

190
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,666
She was your boss. You spent
time with each other.

191
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,916
Ah, I have to go to work now.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,541
Miss Eiko gave me a
big lecture last night.

193
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,166
Yes, but--

194
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,250
Let's go.

195
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,125
I'm sorry we bothered you.

196
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,916
[AMON]
Are you satisfied now?

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,791
Why are you so
curious about this?

198
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,583
That girl is pretty strange.

199
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,750
True, but her
alibi's pretty good.

200
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,125
The landlord saw
her say good-bye

201
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,625
to Miss Eiko as she left.

202
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,166
Yeah, I know, but then again...

203
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,333
You must admit,
she's a bit weird.

204
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,166
I can take you to pick up
your bike now, if you want.

205
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,291
Oh.

206
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,166
I forgot to get the gas.

207
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,750
Oh, Miss Robin!

208
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,458
Mr. Michael asked
me to make sure

209
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,666
you went to see him in the
office when you got back.

210
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,958
Michael?

211
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,583
I found out a few things, Robin.

212
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,833
Doesn't it look suspicious

213
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,500
if we're all in here
at the same time?

214
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,875
[DOJIMA]
Oh, it's all right.

215
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,416
This girl Chie that you
guys met earlier today.

216
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,250
We shouldn't be
doing this, you know.

217
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,625
If it's the law or curiosity...

218
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,500
...I'll choose curiosity.

219
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,666
[ROBIN]
What's that?

220
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,458
[MICHAEL]
It's a CAT scan of her brain.

221
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,166
Apparently she had a
concussion a while back,

222
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,416
and when she was in the
hospital, they took these.

223
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,541
Here. See this area?

224
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,666
Do you notice how it looks
like it's all divided up?

225
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,875
[SAKAKI]
What do you mean?

226
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,000
Is it supposed to be
connected or somethin'?

227
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,666
Yup. Separated sectors
are pretty rare,

228
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,958
and they're a classic symptom of
multiple personality disorder.

229
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,125
But if she's displaying
any other personalities,

230
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,500
there's no record of it.

231
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,625
So in other words,
she's able to get by

232
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,208
just fine in everyday life.

233
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,500
As far as I can tell.

234
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,250
Why don't we just stop here?

235
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,583
We shouldn't spy
on innocent people.

236
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,958
But this one's a witch.

237
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,041
What makes you so sure of that?

238
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,375
And how would you explain it?

239
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,958
I don't know if
I can explain it.

240
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,041
I wouldn't know how.

241
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,291
It's not a very good habit

242
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,208
to go around suggesting
that everybody

243
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:19,291
who acts a little unusual
might be a witch, now is it?

244
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,833
We're gonna be in trouble
if we cause another false alarm!

245
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,583
Look, Robin, I know you
want to try out your powers,

246
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,875
but this isn't the way.

247
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,083
[gasps]

248
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,291
Don't you know what
it's like to want

249
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,583
to use your power sometimes?!

250
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,875
[KOSAKA clears throat]

251
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,416
Everyone was missing,
so I figured

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,333
you were up to something sneaky.

253
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,083
To search through
personal information

254
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,000
without reasonable cause.

255
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:43,250
That is an abuse of power,
even for the STN!

256
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,750
Amon, you of all people
should know that!

257
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
I wanna know who
started it this time.

258
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:51,875
[ROBIN]
I did.

259
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,041
[gasps]

260
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,791
They were doing it
because I asked them to.

261
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,000
[KOSAKA]
Robin...

262
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,833
Since you were only
assigned to us recently,

263
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,041
I'm sure you must be
very tired right now.

264
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,208
You can go home for
the day and rest up.

265
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:02,791
But I'm not...

266
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
[AMON]
Robin.

267
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,041
You need to do as you're told.

268
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:11,000
[KOSAKA]
Okay, now, let's break it up.

269
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,708
[DOJIMA] Aw, jeez,
and it was just getting

270
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,166
interesting, too.

271
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,750
[SAKAKI] Imagine that: you're
interested in your work.

272
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,416
[DOJIMA]
Like me more now?

273
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,583
[SAKAKI]
Not really.

274
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,166
[MICHAEL]
Hm?

275
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,250
Michael.

276
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
How many degrees of kin
did you look up?

277
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,875
I went out to three degrees.

278
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,916
Go ahead and look all
the way up to the sixth.

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,291
But that's really
an abuse of power--

280
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,833
[AMON] Law or curiosity--
which would you prefer?

281
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,250
How's this?

282
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,666
If you find something,
I'll show you a killer website.


283
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,541
[MICHAEL]
Okay, I'll do it!


284
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,083
[GUARD]
What are you doin' with that?

285
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,041
I'm measuring the oil.

286
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,791
[ROBIN]
It runs on a mixed fuel.

287
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,166
Well, that's a bit
of a pain, isn't it?

288
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,166
[GUARD]
Anyway, I guess I'll get going.

289
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,125
Please be careful
on your way back.

290
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,416
Okay.

291
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,083
[gasps]

292
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,625
[ROBIN]
I'd better hurry...

293
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,916
Here, go ahead and take this.

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,250
[AMON] Humans are fragile;
they die easily.

295
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,541
Ridiculous.

296
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,041
Kids nowadays, I swear...

297
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,333
Huh? What do you mean?

298
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,583
Look, Robin, I know you
want to try out your powers,

299
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,458
but this isn't the way.

300
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,625
[MICHAEL] One of her distant
relatives was a witch.

301
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,208
Is that so?

302
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,625
Yeah, but I found out something
even more interesting than that.

303
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,333
Three years ago,
her boyfriend died

304
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,125
in a very strange way.

305
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,041
Blood loss from wounds in his
Achilles' tendon and an artery.

306
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,125
That's a strange way
to get killed, isn't it?

307
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,500
[MICHAEL]
This guy...

308
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,500
He sounds like he was quite
a bit of a player, too.

309
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,208
I get the impression that this
girl Chie was just a fling.

310
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,416
[AMON]
Was she a suspect?

311
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,208
[MICHAEL]
Nope. And she had a solid alibi

312
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,958
for that case, too.

313
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,333
Sorry to make you
go through all that.

314
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,250
Hey, wait! What about
the killer website

315
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,166
you were talkin' about?

316
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,291
Oh. I almost forgot.

317
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,625
I'll tell you about it
when you're an adult.

318
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,333
What's up with that?

319
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,125

[AMON]
This is...

321
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,625
[gasps]

322
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,750
[ROBIN]
I'm sorry.

323
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,125
That's it. From now on,

324
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,958
I don't want you to use
those powers in the house.

325
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,291
It may not be a big deal to you,
but it really gets on my nerves.

326
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:28,791
[kettle whistles]

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,208
You're so straightforward.

328
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,708
I guess it means
you're still young.

329
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:41,666
Robin, you know about
conservation of matter, right?

330
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,666
Boiling water
decreases in volume.

331
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,833
But that's only because some
of it's escaped in the air

332
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,291
in the form of steam.

333
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,583
It's the same thing
with human emotions.

334
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,750
You can deny your feelings,

335
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,791
but they're always
hiding somewhere.

336
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,208
Even if you think
you've controlled them,

337
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,583
they're never really gone.

338
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,708
[ROBIN]
Yes, I think you're right.

339
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:01,208
I think... I should trust
my instincts more than I do.

340
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,375
Well, that's a dead end.

341
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:12,083
[DOLLS echoing]
Unforgivable!

[CHIE] Hello, resource
management center.

345
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,500
[JEANNE]
Chie, we've got a problem.

346
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,875
That guy just came by again.

347
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,375
[CHIE]
Huh?

348
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,750
[JEANNE] The guy who said he
was that woman's boyfriend.

349
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,083
He was just in here sniffing
around for something.

350
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,500
I did what I could
for the moment.

351
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,125
But I'm still worried, so get
home as soon as you can!

352
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,541
[CHIE]
All right.

353
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,000
[clicking]

354
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,083
Huh?

355
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,875
[JEANNE]
Unforgivable!

[grunts]

357
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,583
[AMON]
I see.

358
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,041
So that's it.

359
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,333
[gasps]

360
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,375

[JEANNE] Those who learn
our secret are unforgivable!

364
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,208
[DOLLS echoing]
Unforgivable!

365
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,500
[JEANNE]
Unforgiveable!

366
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,875
[JEANNE screams]

367
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,083
[CHIE]
Jeanne!

368
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,875
[CHIE]
Jeanne!

369
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,416
[DOLL A]
Kill her, Chie, kill her!

370
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,208
[DOLL B] We have to
avenge Jeanne's death!

371
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,375
[DOLL C] We can't let
her out of here alive!

372
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,000
[DOLL A]
Let's kill her!

373
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,416
[DOLL B]
Chie!

[DOLL C]
Chie!

00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,708
[DOLL A]
Hurry!

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,291
[gunshots]

377
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,291
Robin!

378
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,750
Use your power and
burn the dolls!

379
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,541
They're part of the witch!

380
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,125

Everyone!

384
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,291
Wait!

385
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,916
Stop.

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
It's too late.

387
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:49,166
[KOSAKA]
...45, 46, 47, 48...

388
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,333
...49...

389
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,541
I thought that,
according to Amon's report,

390
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,416
there were 50 dolls
in the place.

391
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,291
Oh, yeah? Then, what
happened to the other one?

392
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,541
Hey, ya never know.

393
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,041
It could still be out
there running around.

394
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,583
[HATTORI] But, that
wouldn't make any sense.

395
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,958
The witch died, right?

396
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,333
[KOSAKA] She certainly did.
No, that's impossible.

397
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,708
[KOSAKA laughs]

398
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,750
[KARASUMA]
Nice work.

399
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,291
[ROBIN]
Not really.

400
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh, don't be so modest.

401
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,166
[ROBIN]
It's not that.

402
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,041
[ROBIN] It's just
always a very sad thing

403
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,041
when someone you know dies.

404
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,833
I sort of... wanted to
get my mind off of it.

405
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,541
But, she was quite different.

406
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,458
It didn't bother her.
And that was...

407
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,750
I wanted to believe that...
when someone passes away,

408
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,291
everyone close to the person

409
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,375
is deeply affected.

410
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,708
You can return it
whenever you feel like it.

411
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,416
I'm sorry I couldn't

412
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,291
return it to you properly.

413
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,041
Touko...

414
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,208
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

415
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:24,041
since the coven
sank in the dark.

416
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,708
Innocent heart.

417
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,750
Summoning of destruction.

418
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,083
Parasitism and awe.

419
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,125
A tragic genius of gray soul

420
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,291
cannot see the
existence of darkness.
