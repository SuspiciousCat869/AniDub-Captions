It can't be...

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,666
How could Karasuma be here?

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,333
[MICHAEL]
Miss Dojima.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,208
[DOJIMA]
What is it?

5
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,750
You said

6
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,000
that an assault team was gonna
attack this facility, right?

7
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,000
Huh? Yeah...

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,833
Then we have to
stop them, quickly.

9
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,958
This place is rigged
to crush everything in it

10
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,083
if there's any sort
of emergency.

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,750
If we're not careful,
it'll collapse on us!

Uh-oh. I can't get
through to them.

15
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,375
What is it?

16
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,958
The attack is going to start.

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,541
We had it planned so they would
begin the assault immediately

18
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,833
if my signal was ever cut off.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,375
Let's move.

20
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,416
[SAKAKI]
Uh?

21
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,583
[SECURITY] Intruders are
crossing the security line.

22
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,833
[DIRECTOR]
Seal the security gates.

23
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:21,000
Security personnel,
circle behind the gates.

24
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,208
Stand by for intruders.

25
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,416
[PILOT] November Foxtrot

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,250
I've just passed point 3-A.
Proceeding to combat altitude.

27
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:46,041
[ZAIZEN] They're equipped
with heavy weaponry?

28
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,541
I understand.

29
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:52,750
Evacuate the scientists quickly.

30
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,916
Is it an attack
by headquarters?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,708
That would be my guess.

32
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,500
But sir, why would they choose
to rush matters like this?

33
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,708
I don't know.

34
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,666
Hm?

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,416
Is something the matter, sir?

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,666
It's Toudou's hidden data!

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,625
Of course. That must be it.

38
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,583
How is the decoding coming?

39
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,125
[TECH]
We're currently at about 78%.

40
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,666
Send it to me right away.

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,458
[TECH]
Very well, sir.

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,458
What is it?

43
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,333
About the test subject, sir.

44
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,583
She has tested completely
negative for Orbo extraction.

45
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,708
Then eliminate her.

46
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,750
Eliminate?

47
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,125
But, sir.

48
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,375
I believe she will be
an excellent specimen

49
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,166
for further testing.

50
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,625

00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,041

Have it your way.

53
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,041
Look like it's gone offline.

54
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,375
Does that mean the attack's
started already?

55
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,375
Probably.

56
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,750
We've gotta get outta here.

57
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
Where should we go?
You mean, up?

58
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,458
[DOJIMA]
Mm...

59
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,625
Goin' up there now
would be dangerous.

60
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,041
I know that.

61
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,625
You know that, huh?

62
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,208
And the elevator?

63
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,250
How you gonna get that working?

64
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,625
I think I might be able
to help with that.

65
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,416
You think so?

66
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,208
[MICHAEL] There ought to
be a panel someplace

67
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,583
that lets you control
the elevator directly.

68
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,041
For instance...
Someplace like that.

69
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,083
Ms. Dojima, jump in once I
get the door open, okay?

70
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,666
But what about you?

71
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,916
[MICHAEL] This situation
isn't gonna solve itself

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
by staying down here.

73
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,458
Besides, where you're going
is even more dangerous.

74
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,083
I'll keep ya company.

75
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,333

be safe, either.

00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,875
You don't have to tell me that.

00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,208
Well, I guess I'll tag along
with you, little lady.

00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,250
I'll go with you, too.

to take care of
down here, right?

Is it Robin's group...?

98
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,125
Send security to the
elevator hall immediately.

That's right.

Robin's true form.

115
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,583
[ZAIZEN]
Robin is no ordinary Witch.

116
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,125
Can you let power
like hers exist?

117
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,791
Can you allow a world in
which genetically altered

superior beings, make the
weak bow down to them?

The choice is
completely up to you.

Even if your abilities
have weakened now,

121
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,666
it doesn't change the simple
fact that you're a Witch.

122
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,083
The question then becomes,

123
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,583
will you join my organization
and survive as a hunter.

124
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,958
Or will you decide instead

to become a fugitive
just like Robin?

126

It's your choice.

What I'm offering,
is one last chance.

One last chance?

Hmph.

You mean that you came
all this way to see me

that's the only reason
we came here.

15 years ago.

00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,750

Yes. Some of it,
but not everything.

Yet, in spite of that,
you still wanna know?

00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,375
So you're absolutely
certain, then?

168
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,750
Toudou...

169
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,958
[TOUDOU]
Zaizen, by the time you,

170
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,666
or anyone else,
listens to this recording,

171
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,208
chances are I will be dead.

172
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:52,458
Even so, I can't simply consign
all of my research to oblivion.

173
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,541
This work I've done, as a
Solomon research scientist,

174
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,833
and a member of the Genome...

175
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,375
Perfect Witch...

176
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,166
I have decided to call this
special project of mine

177
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,583
"Project Robin" in honor
of the King of Witches.

178
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,916
My colleagues have
laughed at my efforts,

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,166
calling it "Project
Devil Child."

180
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,416
They've brushed me off,

181
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,416
dismissing the research
as mere armchair theory.

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
To tell the truth,
I probably never would've

183
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,625
put this project into motion
if I had not met her.

184
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,000
Maria.

185
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,041
[TOUDOU] Normally, Solomon
should have discovered

186
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,041
what I was up to when
they finally decided

187
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,291
to pull the plug on
all of our research.

188
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,083
As it turns out, however,

189
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,583
they were far too lenient
when it came to my work.

190
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,625
Eventually, I started
achieving results

191
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,958
that began to run counter
to many of Solomon's ideals.

192
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,958
But fortunately, the project
made it to the final stage

193
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,916
without being discovered.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,041
I have a feeling
that in the future,

195
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,666
Solomon will disavow any
knowledge of its existence.

196
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,541
However, her father
was the one person

197
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:58,000
in Solomon I was
never able to deceive.

198
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,041
Juliano Colegli. He will never--

199
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,125
You're the Devil's child.

200
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,541
You understand?

201
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,083
At the core of your being,
that's what you truly are.

202
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,166
That's it?

203
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,375
What's that?

204
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,791
[ROBIN] Is that all of what
Toudou recorded?

205
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,500
I don't understand. What more
do you expect there to be?

206
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,333
[dings]

207
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,458
It's me.

208
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,291
I don't care about
whatever is missing,

209
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
just put it on the
monitor right away.

210
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,458
[TOUDOU]
That is to say that...

211
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,041
...to Solomon, the success
of the research

212
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,458
behind Project Robin
would mean the rebirth

213
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,291
of the Devil in a literal sense.

214
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,916
Her existence would
validate a past

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,166
that they must obliterate
at all cost.

216
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,875
In ancient times,
mankind was ruled

217
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,666
by a more powerful species
of humanity called "gods."

218
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,125
The species that possessed
these special powers,

219
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,500
what we now call Witches,

220
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,000
were seen as nothing
less than gods to us.

221
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,958
But then, suddenly,
a genetic mutation in a god

222
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,208
born about 3,000 years ago
changed their destiny forever.

223
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,375
It was to have a profound
effect on the future

224
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,583
of the gods, as well as humans.

225
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,583
The gods, having
lost their ability

226
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,458
to pass on their own
genetic information

227
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,791
to their descendants
due to this mutation,

228
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,208
lost their status as
heirs to humanity.

229
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,833
What the hell is he saying?

230
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,625
[TOUDOU]
Having now risen to power,

231
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,458
humankind feared
the rebirth of the gods.

232
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,041
They sought to suppress and
eventually control them

233
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,208
over the years.

234
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,333
They call them
devils and witches,

235
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,750
saying that they had powers

236
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,500
that humans were not
meant to possess.

237
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,500
That is the truth
behind Solomon.

238
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,333
This research was branded
with the mark of heresy.

239
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,458
And Solomon destroyed
every last trace of it.

240
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,125
Witches are supposed to
be our successors?!

241
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,166
No, that's impossible!

242
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,250
I refuse to accept that humans
are inferior to Witches.

243
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,875
[ZAIZEN] Delete all of
the files immediately!

Continue the playback.

Karasuma...

253
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,333
[TOUDOU] I attempted to recreate
a Witch that had their innate

254
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,375
powers and had the ability
to pass on its genes--

255
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,708
I met a hunter named Maria...

256
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,625
[ZAIZEN] Karasuma, are you
trying to betray me?!

257
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,208
[KARASUMA]
I'm not betraying you.

258
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,458
Can't you see?

259
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,000
I was terrified
of losing myself.

260
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,000
I had to cling to something.

261
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,041
If I didn't,

262
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,458
I was afraid that I'd gradually
fall to pieces and go insane.

263
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,833
I knew that you were lying.

264
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,041
I never believed you
for an instant!

[growls]

266
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,541
[TOUDOU] ...but within her
now, a new life is growing.

267
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,458
Who may be able
to change the future.

268
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,000
A child I've designed.

269
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,208
Able to change the future?!

270
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,083
[TOUDOU]
It seems almost fantastical

271
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,166
and yet my mind has
become obsessed...

272
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,125
[ZAIZEN]
There is only one future!

273
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,291
And impure witches like you
will have no place in it.

274
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,208
Neither do you!

275
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,208
Nor you!

276
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,791
[TOUDOU]
...not its power, per se--

277
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,541
but rather the ability
of the Witches

278
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,666
to once again
inherit the species.

279
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,416
They are terrified
that this child

280
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
will become the Eve of Witches,
believing that she...

281
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,666
You're supposed to be some
sort of "Eve of Witches"?

282
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,458
You call that the truth?!

283
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,041
He's wrong!

284
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,041
Witches are nothing
more than filth!

285
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,541
They're a race that pollutes
the pure water that is humanity!

286
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,958
In order to protect the
beauty of that purity,

287
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,958
to protect humanity itself,

288
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,500
we must wipe Witches off
the face of the Earth!

289
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,375
You would exterminate
Witches even though

290
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,541
they're God's chosen creation,
just like humans?

291
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,583
Witches? Chosen by God?!

292
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,708
Then why did their genes
mutate and become abnormal?!

293
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,833
I'll tell you!

294
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,708
Because witches had
become corrupted!

295
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,208
They could never be the
successors of humanity!

296
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,125
They were corrupted because
they had been forsaken by God!

297
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,708
God doesn't forsake
any of his children.

298
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,208
[AMON] I'll admit that
I can't fully accept

the existence of

[ROBIN]
Their blood flows inside me.

00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,250
The blood of Witches
that have been persecuted

370
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,583
over and over
since ancient times.

I don't just feel their power.

372
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,166
I also feel the sadness
caused by that power.

373
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,666
Maybe that's why that woman

374
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,958
who struggled to give birth
to me called me "hope."

375
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,416
A Witch who knows sadness
might be able to understand

376
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,708
humans even when
surrounded by a sea of them.

someone as powerful
as you ought to exist.

But the only way to
find the answer to that

381
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,041
is for you to survive.

382

If what Karasuma was worried
about ever comes to pass,

truly change the future

with a power that's lying
dormant within her,

she wanted to pass
it on to this child.

[TOUDOU]
As my final gamble,

I have decided to entrust
our unborn child to Juliano.

Will he actually be capable
of killing Maria's child?

400
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,416
I will have to stake her
slim chances of survival

on his mercy.

[TOUDOU]
Even if she survives, however,
