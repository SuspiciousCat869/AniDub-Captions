Twelve and twelve...

The Two Coven are here and
they're surrounding me...

[CORTION] Power lost
a thousand years ago...

7
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,166
Yet, the descendants
of the fallen angels

8
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,083
are still being passed down...

9
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,875
It's in their blood--a
power sealed away deep into

10
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,166
the darkness at the
end of eternity...

11
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,708
[ROBIN] A power sealed away
into the darkness...?

12

[gasps]

13

[AMON]
Robin.

21
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,958
[AMON]
What's wrong? Answer me! Robin!

22
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,666
[ROBIN gasps]
Y-Yes...

23
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,875
[AMON]
What were you doing?

24
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,125
Nothing.

25
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,000
[AMON] The witch
went around container #3

26
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,333
and is headed your way.

27
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,458
We'll corner him.

28
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,041
I want you to flank
him from the left.

29
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,583
I understand.

30
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,500
[gasps]
There he is.

31
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,208
I think this
should be all right...

32
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,875
Hm?

00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,708

[gasps]
The Andred Rune...

40
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,416
[AMON]
Robin, what's wrong?

41
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,083
The witch should be there now.

42
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,708
Report your current condition.

43
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,833
Robin!

44
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:19,958
[AMON]
I just finished explaining

45
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,666
everything to the Factory.

46
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,458
Never make a mistake
like this again, understand?

47

--[ROBIN] But...
--I don't want to hear excuses.

I'm not lying to you...

00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,791
I didn't hear
any shots fired in there.

50
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,666
But that's just not...

51
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,791
You should go home for today.

52
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,916
[ROBIN gasps]

00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,916
[ROBIN sighs]

54
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,916
[ROBIN]
Thought so. Still here.

55
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,708
[MICHAEL]
A spent shell?

56
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,000
Could you analyze
it for me, Michael?

57
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
Analyze it?

58
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,250
What kind of gun
was used to fire it

59
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,250
and where might that
gun be right now...

60
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
Well, that's not
completely impossible,

61
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,750
but tell me: what's up
with this all of a sudden?

62
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,375
It's nothing.

63
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,500
But do you think you
could do it right away?

64
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,333
You're in a hurry, huh...

65
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,208
All right, I'll try it.

66
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,625
Thanks a lot.

67
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,458
One more thing...

68
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,250
Could you please not
tell Amon about this.

69
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,375
Well, I guess so but, what're--

70
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,541
[ROBIN]
Thanks, I'm counting on you.

71
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,208
Should I have dinner first?
Or should I take a bath?

72
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,083
A bath, I guess...

73
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,166
[AMON]
I don't want to hear excuses.

74
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,166
[ROBIN]
I didn't lie...

75
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,250
[ROBIN sighs]

76
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,916
[MICHAEL]
An anti-witch bullet...

77
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,958
Why does she have this?

78
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,458
[KARASUMA]
Five years ago?

79
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,000
Five years and three months
ago to be exact.

80
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,000
That was when they prohibited
the use of these things.

81
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,750
Then why are you asking me?

82
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,041
[MICHAEL]
The info is so classified

83
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,375
I can't find out much.

84
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,791
If the info is really that
ancient, then only you

85
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,000
and Mr. Amon would
know about it.

86
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,750
Just who are you
calling "ancient"?

87
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,583
I haven't turned
into an old maid yet!

88
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,750
Well, you're a lot
older than me at least.

89
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,500
Why, you little twit...!

90
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,833
[DOJIMA]
What? Who's an old maid?

91
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,041
[SAKAKI]
Welcome back. So how was it?

92
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,083
There was nothing.

93
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,000
I couldn't find any trace at
all of someone like that.

94
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,541
[SAKAKI]
Like a ghost or something!

95
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,250
Maybe this witch was nothing
but a hoax after all.

96
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,500
[DOJIMA]
But, Amon said...

97
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,791
Oh... By the way, what was
that about Amon and Miho

98
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,708
and being ancient? Well?

99
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,291
Huh?

100
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,041
Oh, you mean about this?

101
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,250
Miss Karasuma...

102
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,041
Maybe you can try
scrying it. Go for it.

103
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,375
--Well?
--Gimme a second...

104
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,708
[KARASUMA gaps]

105
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,333
[MICHAEL] There isn't
anything left in it...

106
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,375
...is there?

107
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:58,750
I didn't mention this before,

108
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,291
but this is the spent shell
of a bullet that the STN

109
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,333
used to use against witches.

110
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,291
[MICHAEL]
Take a look.

111
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,125
See how there
are engravings on it?

112
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,708
I think they're
to ward off evil...

113
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,500
Michael, where did
you get such a thing?

114
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,250
Did Robin give it to you?

115
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
[KARASUMA]
What about Amon?

116
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,333
Apparently, she wants to keep
Amon out of the loop on this.

117
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,583
This shell...
It was just used.

118
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,583
[DOJIMA] Hey, wait a minute,
why does Robin have a shell

119
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,375
for an anti-witch bullet?

120
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,916
Dojima. Where are the two of
them staked out right now?

121
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,625
[DOJIMA]
The same site as yesterday.

122
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,000
Sakaki, come with me.

123
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,500
Why? Where're we going?

124
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,375
I'm worried about this.

125
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,916
An anti-witch bullet...

126
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,166
And then...
A witch that is like a shadow.

127
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,291
A trap?

128
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,208
It could be.

129
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,541
[SAKAKI] Let us know if you
hear anything from Mr. Amon.

130
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,666
Gotcha.

131
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,625
[ZAIZEN]
I see... Best of luck.

132
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,375
[SAKAKI]
I wonder if he was just a hoax.

133
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,958
There's no car
fitting that description...

134
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,666
Come one, let's go
and take another look.

135
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,791
Huh?

136
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,833
[ROBIN] Touko let them
pile up like this again.

137
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,625
[ROBIN]
Hmm?

138
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,000
[ROBIN]
For me?

139
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,250
What is it?

140
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,875
[SAKAKI]
What do you wanna do?

141
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you wanna go back?

142
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,708
[KARASUMA] Let's try going
to Robin's place.

143
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:14,250
You're really fixated
on this, aren't you?

144
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,250
[KARASUMA]
Something's nagging at me.

145
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:19,750
Come to think of it,
Amon didn't even brief us today

146
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,583
about the failed
hunt last night.

147
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,791
That's not like him.

148
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,041
He's never acted
this way before...

149
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,375
Let's go.

150
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,083
Touko... Must be home.

151

Robin! Are you all right?!

00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:03,875
What's going on?!

171
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,833
[ROBIN]
The circle--!

172
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,000
[SAKAKI]
Miss Karasuma, this way!

173
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,083

174

Robin, wait!

178
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,708
There's no point
in chasing them!

179
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,583
[ROBIN]
Karasuma! Take care of Touko!

180
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,833
But what about you?

181
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,208
[ROBIN]
I'm all right.

182
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,916
[SAKAKI]
Those are...!

183
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,791
[ROBIN grunts]
Sorry.

184
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,916
[AMON]
You're not going anywhere.

[KARASUMA]
What should we do now?

189
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,791
[AMON]
Her apartment is no longer safe.

190
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,458
[SAKAKI] Maybe Robin
can sleep at the office.

191
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,500
[AMON]
The office? Yeah...

192
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,916
[RESCUE WORKED A]
We can't do anything else here.

193
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,416
Amon, we're probably heading
over to the hospital.

194
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,750
What about you?

195
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,791
I see.

196
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,583
No, I'll pass...

197
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,750
[ZAIZEN] Don't worry. I kept
the police out of this one.

198
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,541
I won't let them
touch the scene.

199
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,916
But tell me--how did we
end up with such a big mess?

200
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,166
[ZAIZEN]
What?!

201
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,250
[MICHAEL] That's why you
think Robin was attacked?

202
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,416
[KARASUMA]
When you think about it,

203
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,958
the timing was just too perfect.

204
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,250
What timing?

205
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,958
The Inquisitioner's timing.

206
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,541
[DOJIMA] That's true, I guess,
but that Inquisitioner

207
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,458
didn't come here to
interrogate Robin...

208
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,791
Well, it might have
not seemed so at first...

209
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,708
But it's not like we knew every
move that he was making, right?

210
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,250
And besides...

211
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,708
[KARASUMA]
It feels just like...

212
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,166
...that time.

213
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,833
[SAKAKI gasps]

214
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,791
[KARASUMA]
What happened with Kate.

215
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,708
[SAKAKI]
Kate...

216
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,166
[KARASUMA] I completely
forgot about it

217
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,166
since Robin came,
but in reality,

218
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,083
it was only eight months ago.

219
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,250
[DOJIMA] Now that you
mention it, how did Amon know

220
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,500
to show up at the scene
tonight with no warning?

221
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,625
C'mon! Do you think
it was Mr. Amon?

222
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,583
Please! You're out of your mind!

223
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,125
Why would Mr. Amon
do this to Robin...?

[ZAIZEN] Why didn't
you follow my orders?

227
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,125
[ZAIZEN] If you had moved
as I told you to,

228
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,125
Touko would've been safe.

[NARRATOR] Three hundred and
twenty years have passed

233
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,708
since the coven
sank in the dark.

234
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:29,666
Visit by the black robed.
Attacks. And a farewell...

235
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,958
I descend alone into the
darkness with the unseen truth.
