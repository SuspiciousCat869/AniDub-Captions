00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,458
When I heard that she was
having a baby with Toudou,

163
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,833
I was filled with joy.

164
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,125
I believed that God was
still smiling upon me.

165
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,708
[JULIANO] But I discovered
that Toudou had deceived me.

166
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,250
To him, Maria was nothing
more than a test subject.

167
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,375
And then, I stood
over you that day.

168
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,875
[JULIANO]
But when I saw you Robin.

169
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,458
This little girl whom Maria
had sacrificed her life

170
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,333
to give birth to...

171
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:59,666
...all I could do was walk back
home, carrying you in my arms.

172
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,375
It was possible that you
didn't necessarily possess

173
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,000
the power that Toudou
had designed for you.

174
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,041
Or so I told myself.

175
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,250
[JULIANO] Perhaps all I've
been doing is putting off

176
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,833
the day when I must
learn that answer.

177
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,833
I was relieved to discover
that the powers

178
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,416
your father had tried to design

179
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,958
into your body had not
manifested yet and

180
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,958
I prayed in my heart that you
would stay this way forever.

181
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,666
[ROBIN]
But I've changed now.

182
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,541
I've learned the
Arcanum of the Craft,

183
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,083
and I've become a source
of anguish to you, Juliano.

184
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,583
No, that's not true.

185
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,083
It was the weakness of my heart.

186
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,666
From the moment you left my side
Robin, my heart was filled

187
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,000
with the most intense
anxiety imaginable.

188
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,791
Misgivings...? Yes, that's it.

189
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,083
I had misgivings that you
would awaken one day,

190
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,041
that eventually
you would change.

191
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,166
It was possible that I was
already being deceived.

192
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,375
These misgivings
turned into fear,

193
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,791
which spurred me
to order your hunt.

194
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,041
[CROW caws]

195
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,916
The source of my suffering

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,791
was the weakness inside
my own heart,

197
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,666
nothing more and nothing less.

198
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,083
I'm sorry, I didn't
want to change.

199
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,958
You have not changed, my child.

200
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,625
[gasps]

201
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,875
Power corrupts, and absolute
power corrupts absolutely.

202
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,875
It terrified me.

203
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,583
The thought of you, addicted
to your own immense power.

204
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:32,125
However, it would seem that
my anxiety was unfounded.

205
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,458
Robin, the question
I must ask you now is

206
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,500
having confronted the truth,

207
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,916
to what penance do you
sentence yourself?

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,750
I would sooner take my own
life than to go on like this,

209
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,458
as one's original sin.

210
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,791
I believe in you.

211
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,375
And no matter how cruel
the truth may actually be,

212
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,875
I have every faith that you
will meet it head-on.

213
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,375
I know you have that
strength within you.

214
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,750
These pages are part
of Toudou's secret journal.

215
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,458
Not even I know the whole truth

216
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,083
about what he was
trying to accomplish.

217
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,000
But if you read it,
I think you will know

218
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,416
where the answers are hidden.

219
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,875
Robin...

220
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,583
My daughter, Maria, insisted
on calling you her "hope."

221
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,708
Her hope?

222
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,250
But why?

223
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,250
[ROBIN] Why? What would
make her say that?

224
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,833
[JULIANO] I'm sorry to say, I
don't have that answer to that.

225
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,708
But now... Now that I've
seen you here, unchanged,

226
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:40,791
I believe I understand
what she may have meant.

227

What you decide
to do with that truth,

[ROBIN] We're sure going
down a long way.

321
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,375
[SAKAKI] Security's more
lax than I expected...

322
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,166
[DOJIMA] But if anything
does happen down here,

323
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750
there's only one exit.

324
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,750
[NAGIRA] So the way in is easy,
but gettin' out is a bitch, huh?

325
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,708
[MICHAEL] Maybe they're holding
Karasuma someplace else...

326
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,708
[NAGIRA gasps]

327
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,500
[NAGIRA]
Damn, this is confusing!

328
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,708
Don't you think it's safe
to take these masks off?

329
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,750
[AMON]
I suppose you're right.

330
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,583
[DOJIMA]
Hey, guys, check this out!

331
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,166
[AMON]
What is it?

332
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,875
[SAKAKI] There's a door that's
not accepting my access code.

333
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,333
[MICHAEL]
Let me see it for a second.

334
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,041
I'm gonna try looking
up a different code.

335
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,541
[beeping]

336
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,708
[MICHAEL]
Got it.

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,666
[MICHAEL]
It didn't occur to me earlier,

338
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,375
but according to
the data I confirmed

339
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,958
when we were upstairs, this
place doesn't officially exist.

340
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,541
[NAGIRA] In other words,
we hit the jackpot.

341
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,250
[elevator door opens]

342
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,166
[SAKAKI]
What is this place?

343
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,791
[MICHAEL] The word "Plant"
was written by the entrance.

344
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,166
[NAGIRA]
"Plant"?

345
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,916
[DOJIMA] At any rate,
it looks like this might be

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,125
the Orbo production plant.

347
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,208
[SAKAKI] Hey, even if we search
this place top to bottom,

348
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,208
you really think Karasuma
is in here?

349
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,583
[ROBIN gasps]

350
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,791
[AMON]
Let's go.

351
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,875
[ROBIN]
Where?

352
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,833
[AMON]
We're going up there.

353
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,083
It's weird, she doesn't
seem to be here either.

354
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,708
And there's no sign of
a Witch detention center.

355
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,416
[NAGIRA] So then what
that hell do these guys do

356
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,083
in this creepy place?

357
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,000
[AMON]
I have no idea.

358
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,583
[beeping]

359
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,166
[gasps]

360
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,000
Hey, haven't we told you not--

361
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,708
[ALL gasp]

362
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,166
Oh, c'mon Robin. What did you--

363
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,833
A...

364
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,208
...girl...

365
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,916
[SAKAKI]
But these are...

366
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,583
These are witches we hunted.

367
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,000
[DOJIMA]
Then the Orbo back there was--

368
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,583
[DOJIMA]
Hey, wait a minute!

369
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,083
That means...

370
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,708
This place is--!

371
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,375
[SAKAKI]
I get it.

372
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,083
This is what was really
behind our "humane" hunts!

373
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:25,625
Don't you see?

374
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,666
All this time we've been
helping them do this!

375
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,916
[ROBIN]
Karasuma...

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,333
[MICHAEL]
Huh?

377
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,000
I know that Karasuma is here.

378
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,666
It can't be...

379
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,125
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

380
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,875
since the coven
sank in the dark.

381
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,125
The trap of perdition.

382
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:30,125
A refused successor.
An eternal war.

383
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:34,125
Believing in a hope and its
power to create the future,

384
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,083
I start walking now.
