00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:31,083
[AMON]
Your eye exam took two hours.

2
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,083
What should we say when
we make our report.

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,416
We'll say exactly what
the doctors said.

4
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,333
[GUARD humming]

5
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,041
Hi, Miss Robin.
It's just about done.

6
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,833
Thank you very much.

7
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,666
Does that mean you're
still not satisfied?

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,833
[ROBIN]
It just feels a little strange.

9
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,666
It's my own body, after all.

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,625
I should know it
better than this.

11
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,791
What's that thing?

12
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,708
When I was in Italy,
that's what I rode.

13
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,875
I've been waiting
for it to get here.

14
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,166
[AMON] They explained it;
your eyesight gets worse

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,666
when you use your powers
at their maximum level.

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,333
You don't agree with
that assessment?

17
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,125
I just don't see how
they could be so sure

18
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,125
to make a diagnosis like that.

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,708
[AMON] Are you going to use
your glasses or not?

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,166
[ROBIN]
I'll use them.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,833
I think you'd better.
You're much too dangerous

22
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,208
if you can't
control your powers.

23
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,791
So, does that mean

24
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,166
that you're going to start to
treat me properly from now on?

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,875
Like a real partner?

26
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,750
I'll ask you to do
whatever's necessary,

27
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,541
whether you're my
partner or not.

28
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,916
[ROBIN]
What is your power, Amon?

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,125
It looks like you
always use a gun.

30
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,375
Perhaps it's just that
you haven't awakened yet.

31
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,916
[AMON] There's no need
to answer your question.

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,708
Okay then, Miss Robin.

33
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,333
It's ready to go.

34
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,166
[gasps]

35
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,500
What's the big idea?!

36
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,791
Hey, Robin, leave him alone.

37
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,041
Why'd you do that?

38
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,500
--[ROBIN] I was just looking.
--My goodness,

39
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:07,958
--[KARASUMA] It's rude to stare
--I was so surprised!

40
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,125
at people like that.

41
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,416
I just find it very
unusual, that's all.

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,750
Ladies... just a second here.

43
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,125
[KARASUMA] We didn't come
out here just for you

44
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,833
to play around. Stay
focused and do your job!

45
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,583
Uh, miss...

46
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,958
Oh, that's right,
I'm terribly sorry.

47
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,250
Have you seen this guy?
Maybe somewhere around here?

48
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,166
Do you really think he'd be
living in a place like this?

49
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,958
[DOJIMA]
Are you sure...

50
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,041
...our missing witch would be

51
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,333
hanging out around
in this kinda dive?

52
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,375
[SAKAKI] Try to think of it like
some kind of a scavenger hunt.

53
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,916
[sighs]

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,250
[SAKAKI]
Shouji Takizawa, 46 years old.

55
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,375
He had a good home,

56
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,791
worked in a top-notch
brokerage firm.

57
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,291
And yet, suddenly,
one day he disappears.

58
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,375
[DOJIMA] Hey, guys disappear for
all sorts of reasons, you know.

59
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,583
[SAKAKI] True, if they aren't on
the witches' descendants list.

60
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,041
[DOJIMA]
Who's to say?

61
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,500
Maybe he's just a witch who
embezzled company funds,

62
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,166
or a witch who was caught
having an affair.

63
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,458
Besides, maybe he's
staying in a hotel,

64
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,791
instead of someplace like this.

65
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,125
[SAKAKI]
When he disappeared,

66
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,958
he didn't take any money
or credit cards with him.

67
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,916
If you're gonna live in
this town without money,

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
there are only a couple of ways.

69
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,333
Yeah, I know. But it's
such a yucky job.

70
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,791
Hey, excuse me, sir.
Can I ask you something?

71
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,916
What can I do for you?

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,791
[SAKAKI] Any new additions to
the group around here lately?

73
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,916
Are you a cop?

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,083
[SAKAKI]
Heh. No, nothing like that.

75
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,791
I'm just lookin' for
somebody, that's all.

00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,833

00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,000
[SAKAKI]
Hm?

79
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,708
What is it?

80
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750

[DOJIMA sniffs]

82
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,416
Do you notice that?
What's that smell like?

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,833
[SAKAKI]
Smell?

84
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:10,750

[sirens blaring]

95
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,458
[ZAIZEN]
Yeah, I got it.

96
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,416
That was the lab
with the test results.

97
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,875
Apparently, the body had no
genetic anomalies whatsoever.

98
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,625
So that one was
just a false alarm.

99
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,375
[AMON] You can't tell if
someone's a witch or not

100
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,791
just by looking at them.

101
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,791
I'm sure there isn't anything
Sakaki could have done about it.

102
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:18,291
[ZAIZEN] I decided to forego
Sakaki's punishment this time.

103
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,708
Now do you mind explaining
about Robin's glasses?

104
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,416
[ZAIZEN] Why did you go out
of your way like that?

105
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,958
[ZAIZEN] You really don't
understand at all.

106
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,416
From now on, it'll be
your responsibility

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,541
to keep a close watch
on her at all times.

108
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,000
Understand?

109
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
Yes, I understand.

110
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,000
[KOSAKA]
So let's just say "sorry"

111
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,666
isn't enough right now.
Do you understand that?

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,083
[SAKAKI]
Yes.

113
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,041
Sakaki...

114
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,458
[SAKAKI]
Huh. How lame.

115
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,375
Ah-choo!

116
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,250
Hey, Michael. He was
working with Dojima.

117
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,208
Why aren't they
both getting scolded?

118
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,666
Maybe you should go
ask her yourself.

119
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,041
It's just so awkward to ask
a thing like that directly.

120
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,833
[DOJIMA] It's because
I'm special, that's why.

121
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,833
[MICHAEL, ROBIN]
Hm?

122
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,208
[DOJIMA] Well, if you must know,
my parents are pretty high up.

123
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,541
and they thought that the
only real option left for me

124
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,166
was to join the STN.

125
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,583
So they begged
Mr. Zaizen to let me in.

126
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,291
[KOSAKA]
Ah-Ah-choo!

127
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,625
You don't sound too good.

128
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,958
You okay, Chief?

129
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,583
[KOSAKA] Yeah, I don't have
a fever or anything.

130
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,250
Have you ruled out hay fever?

131
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
[KOSAKA]
Oh, that's right!

132
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,416
I always heard that
you get better by giving

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,041
the virus to someone else.

134
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,291
[HATTORI]
Huh?!

135
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,750
Ah...

136
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:59,166
Do you know if this sort of
thing has ever happened before?

137
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,625
[AMON] About a year ago,
Karasuma felt the presence

138
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,791
of a witch one time when she
was in the middle of town.

139
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,458
I was just passing
through a crowd one day,

140
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,791
when I suddenly felt
this unmistakable presence

141
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,833
of a witch's
consciousness within it.

142
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,833
But then...

143
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,916
...with all of those people,

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I just couldn't
figure out who it was.

145
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,541
But it was there.

146
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,625
[AMON]
And when Karasuma looked back,

147
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,916
this one man
started running away,

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,041
as if he was
terrified of something.

149
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,375
And when apprehended,

150
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,500
he proved not to be a witch,
just an average guy.

151
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,833
He was petrified when
they caught up with him.

152
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,625
He was so out of it,
he couldn't even speak.

153
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,041
Not only that,
he couldn't remember

154
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,875
the slightest thing about
what was chasing him.

155
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,791
And right then,
I noticed something

156
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,625
like the smell of
fragrant olives in bloom.

157
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,291
And they weren't in
season at that time.

158
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,791
I don't know if it's
quite the same thing

159
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,750
that Dojima experienced.

160
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,041
As a matter of fact, that's
exactly what it was like;

161
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,500
it smelled just like olives.

162
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,625
I have a memory about that.

163
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,708
Although the details
of that memory

164
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,500
are rather private, you know.

165
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,541
Oh.

166
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,458
[ROBIN]
So is it the same witch?

167
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,166
[MICHAEL]
I did some research on it,

168
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,083
but the victim back
then didn't have anything

169
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,625
in common with the guy just now.

170
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,625
The only thing that links
them together is that smell.

171
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,750
Right, and by itself, that
doesn't really help us much.

172
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,166
Yes, but...

173
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,416
What are you thinking about?

174
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,000
Are you going to sniff
your way around town?

175
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
Hey, Amon.

176
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,291
We got lucky then.

177
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,625
The only thing that
happened to that guy

178
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,583
was he wound up with a
case of temporary amnesia.

179
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,458
We need to be careful.

180
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,583
[MICHAEL] Unfortunately,
the smell is completely gone

181
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,583
by the time they ever
get to the Factory.

182
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,083
And the exact same thing
happened both times.

183
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,541
So that's not gonna
give us any data.

184
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,333
Well, anyway, let's see
if there's anything like it

185
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,458
in the database in Solomon.

186
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,041
[GUY B]
What'a ya know. It's you again.

187
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:09,875
[SAKAKI gasps]

188
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,041
Hey, sonny, have any luck

189
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,750
with that guy you
were tryin' to find?

190
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,791
[SAKAKI]
Nah.

191
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,625
Let me see.

192
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,625
Huh?

193
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,083
[GUY B]
We may not look like much,

194
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,291
but we have our own
territorial boundaries,

195
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,791
not to mention a pretty
wide network of friends.

196
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,833
So it's pretty obvious when
somebody new comes in.

197
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,083
Oh.

198
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,291
Here you go.

199
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,500
[GUY B]
Hm...

200
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,208
I haven't seen anybody
like this around here.

201
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,666
I'd say your best idea's

202
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,666
to be lookin' in
that park up ahead.

203
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,791
Word has it they got a few
new folks in there recently.

204
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,916
[SAKAKI]
Thank you. I'll go check it out.

205
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,250
Welcome.

206
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,625
Have you heard
from your "friends"?

207
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,875
Anything peculiar they
might know about?

208
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,125
What is it? Is there
anything wrong?

209
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,916
Ah--

210
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,333
[ROBIN]
Karasuma, is there anything else

211
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,500
that stands out in your
mind about that incident?

212
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,708
Oh, I must have just made
a mistake, that's all.

213
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,708
[ROBIN] But it was exactly
like the case we just had.

214
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,583
You can't call it
a "case," Robin.

215
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,916
It's nothing more than
a hunch right now.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,541
We don't have the
slightest bit of evidence

217
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,125
that there was any witch there.

218
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,666
Besides, as far as we know,
the guy who ran away

219
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,500
may not have had
anything to do with it.

220
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,875
Yeah, that's true.

221
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,041
But then again...

222
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,333
[KARASUMA]
It sounds to me like you can't

223
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,625
wait for another incident.

224
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,375
But I'm not like that.

225
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,166
I'm much happier when
nothing happens at all.

226
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,250
It's just that I'm...

227
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,041
I'm sorry. It's all right.

228
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,208
I just get annoyed sometimes.

229
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,833
[AMON]
Michael.

230
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:26,875
[MICHAEL]
Sorry, no luck;

231
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,333
the Solomon database
doesn't have

232
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,875
anything on the smell either.

233
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,083
[AMON]
Figures.

234
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,666
Do a search and see
what you can find

235
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,208
on a witch named Single Eye.

236
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,208
His name's Single Eye?

237
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,291
[AMON]
Dojima.

238
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes!

239
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,041
Where's Sakaki?

240
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,208
He went out a while ago, but we
haven't heard from him, sir!

241
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,916
And he's not answering
his cell phone.

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,666
I see.

243
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,625
[chiming]

244
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
[MICHAEL]
Whoa, look at that!

245
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,541
This is something different.

246
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,375
Hardly any cases have
ever been reported

247
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,625
about this type of witch.

248
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,625
He doesn't do anything
obvious or even observable.

249
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,833
In fact, it's not
physical at all.

250
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,166
Instead...

251
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,458
...he controls their minds.

252
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,958
Sorry to bother you.

253
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,625
Anyone home? Hello?

254
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,041
[GUY D groans]

255
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,791
[GUY D groaning]

256
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,208
[MICHAEL] He sends a
powerful telepathic signal

257
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,958
into people's minds.

258
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,500
But he doesn't take
complete control over them.

259
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,666
I mean, it's not like the witch
can do anything he wants.

260
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,958
He seeps into the
other person's mind

261
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,208
and inundates them with terror.

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,208
It can't be.
How is that possible?

263
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,458
Yeah, well, it's just a theory.

264
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,583
But the idea is that
he amplifies the doubt

265
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,208
and terror that's
already in their minds

266
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,375
and brings it to a boil.

267
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,666
So then...

268
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,000
The more feelings of
doubt or terror you have,

269
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,375
the more susceptible
you are to his power.

270
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,375
That makes it a tough case.

271
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,250
I don't see how we're
going to be able to tell

272
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,916
who's using these powers.

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,083
It would be pretty hard
to tell who the witch was,

274
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,458
especially on a
crowded city street.

[phone rings]

[SAKAKI]
Amon! You gotta get over here!

277
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,125
There's a guy who
looks like he might

278
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,791
have the same condition
as the one I saw before!

279
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,250
He seems... like he's completely
afraid of something.

280
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,625
But I don't know what it is.

281
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,583
[groaning]

282
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,750
All right, then. I'm on my way.

283
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,000
Keep a close eye on him,

284
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,875
but make sure you don't
agitate him any further.

285
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,500
All right, I want
you guys to head over

286
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,083
to a different area now.

287
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,375
[ROBIN]
Huh?

00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't worry. Easy does it.

289
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,833
I'm not gonna do anything, okay?

290
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,375
So why doncha just take a
deep breath and calm down.

291
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,666
You can do that, right?

But what does it mean?

Why would it be
at the same place?

There it is!

307
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,083
Sakaki. I'm pretty sure
this one's just a decoy.

308
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,416
[SAKAKI]
Huh?

309
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,541
This is all just a diversion.

310
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,125
So if the first case
was a decoy, too,

311
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,375
then there's gotta
be something about

where the first
incident happened.

are on their way.

too well out of this eye.

319
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,250
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

320
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,583
It's okay.

321
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,125
[DOJIMA]
Hey, over here!

322
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,708
[DOJIMA]
Hm...

323
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,083
[DOJIMA]
Huh?

324
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,791
They're all gone.

325
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,250
How can that be?

326
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,833
[SAKAKI]
Dojima!

327
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,833
[DOJIMA]
Sakaki. All the photos...

328
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,750
[AMON] I just got a call
from Michael a minute ago.

329
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,500
Takizawa's dead;
they found him drowned.

330
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,166
He died three days ago.
It was suicide.

331
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,458
He couldn't have.

332
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,250
[ROBIN]
So... that means we're supposed

333
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,958
to be looking for...

334
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,041
...whom?

335
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,833
Do you think that
the kind of witch

336
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,166
we're looking for...
never really existed?

337
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,750
There's always the
possibility that

338
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,250
somebody's been toying
around with us.

339
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,333
[gasps] Do you smell it?

340
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,791
That's it! The same exact smell.

341
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:16,041
[SAKAKI gasping, grunting]

342
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,708
[SAKAKI gasps]

343
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,708
It's all right.

344
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,208
Everything's going
to be just fine.

345
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,666
Hey, the smell!

346
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,958
It's suddenly gone.

347
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,875
[KARASUMA]
I don't get it.

348
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,916
I don't feel any anger
or hatred here at all.

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,958
Just a sadness and despair
like I've never felt before.

350
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,500
It's simply an intense sadness.

351
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:25,875
My secret memory.

352
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,833
The one that I was
talking about before.

353
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,083
To be honest, it isn't
all that much of a secret

354
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,916
in the first place.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When I was a little girl,

356
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,708
our family had
a beautiful garden

357
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,083
filled with fragrent
olive trees.

358
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,000
I can't remember my
parents' faces anymore,

359
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,916
but the smell of those trees...

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,791
I'll never forget that.

361
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,541
[DOJIMA]
How 'bout you?

362
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,500
Do you have any memories
of your old home?

363
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:55,416
Well, you see, I... don't
have parents or a home.

364
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,708
That's got advantages.

365
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:05,375
[phone ringing]

366
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,083
[beep]

367
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,958
Hi, Amon. I wonder where
are you right now.

368
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,291
I'm sorry. I just had
to get out of there.

369
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,666
Just forget about
the other phone call.

370
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,500
It just... seemed to me that you
were awfully tired, that's all.

371
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,625
Well, I'll see you later.

372
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,375
[gasps]

373
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,291
Hello again. Good evening.

374
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,416
And a good evening to you.

375
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,375
[KOBARI]
Espresso, I presume?

376
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,208
[ROBIN]
Yes, please.

377
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,625
[gasps, sneezes]

378
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,041
[gasps]

379
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,125
I've got my own.

380
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,791
[ROBIN]
May I ask you something?

381
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,041
[AMON]
Go ahead.

382
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,833
[ROBIN]
I was wondering.

383
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,541
Were you expecting that
that the perpetrator

384
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,000
would come back?

385
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,416
To pick up the
photos of his family?

386
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,625
[AMON]
Yeah.

387
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,875
Although I don't know
why he persisted,

388
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,916
considering the risks
he was taking.

389
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,583
[ROBIN]
Amon, do you have a family?

390
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,208
[AMON]
No.

391
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,583
I don't have any real family.

392
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,125
Neither do I.

393
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,250
I have one more question.

394
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,666
How did you know that the smell

395
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,458
came from a witch
known as Single Eye?

396
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,541
[AMON]
It's just a rumor, that's all.

397
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,833
I wasn't sure of anything
when I brought it up.

398
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,208
As a matter of fact,

399
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,666
the one who told me about it
just made you a drink.

400
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,916
Huh?

401
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,083
It was just a little something
I'd heard a while ago.

402
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,625
They say when that kind of
witch uses its powers,

403
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,041
the only evidence left behind

404
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,000
is an overwhelming,
lingering odor.

405
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,833
But there's one more detail.

406
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,916
Single Eye means precisely
what you'd imagine.

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,916
He's a man who's
only got one eye.

408
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
[ROBIN]
One eye?

409
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,083
You see, although
he's got two eyes,

410
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,666
and looks the same as we do,

411
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,583
one of the eyes
is merely decorative

412
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,500
and he's unable to
see with it at all.

413
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,791
[gasps]

414
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,333
My goodness, you mean
that man was...?

415
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,541
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

416
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,583
since the coven
sank in the dark.

417
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,875
Encounter in the rain.

418
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:32,416
Thousands of puppet strings.
Fragments of malice.

419
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,875
Passing hearts wrap the
darkness in growing hatred.
