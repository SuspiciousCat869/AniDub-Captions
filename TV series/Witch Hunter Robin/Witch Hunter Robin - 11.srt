You must light the

Deliver the power of

...from men of times

This is strange.

I mean, for the Factory

26
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,416
[MICHAEL]
The police tipped them off.

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
The police are actually
cooperating with us?

28
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,625
Well, that's a new one.

29
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,416
[MICHAEL] According to their
regulations, they have to.

30
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,125
Well, they're supposed to...
and they say they do.

31

But don't you
think that deep down,

32
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,791
they figure we're just
a big pain in the neck?

33
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:42,958
[MICHAEL]
If you think so,

34
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,791
why don't you tell
the Factory directly?

35
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,583
[SAKAKI]
What about Amon and the others?

[AMON]
About the victim's condition...

40
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,083
The internal damage is
much worse than the external?

41
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,458
Yeah. Come on;
careful, you guys!

42
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,166
Is this the work of a witch?

43
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,166
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's what we're lookin' at.

44
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,458
[AMON]
Pretty sure?

45
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,791
Yeah, there's an old case here

46
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,250
that sounds pretty
similar to me.

47
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,125
That witch could
create microwaves

48
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,791
that were strong enough to kill.

49
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,291
I'd say it's a good bet
that the witch we're looking for

50
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,916
is very similar--
Hey! Don't touch anything!

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,333
We've still got
a lot of things to check!

52
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,875
[AMON]
You alone?

53
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,875
No, but there's
a lot of traffic right now...

54
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,041
Where's the victim?

55
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,875
They're just starting
the investigation.

56
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,125
Do you want to watch?

57
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,958
[SAKAKI]
Eh...

58
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,291
I think I'll pass.

[gasps]

61
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,208
So that means
this witch would be sort of

62
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,625
like an electric eel.

63
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,791
[SAKAKI]
Yeah, you could say that.

64
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,000
Apparently, this is
not the first time.

65
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,583
There was one years ago.

66
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,916
[MICHAEL] Well, it was 22 years
ago, so it's a bit old, but...

67
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,458
...far as I can tell,
it's basically

68
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,000
the same kind of
thing as this one.

69
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,750
Then shouldn't we be
looking at his descendants?

70
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,541
The probability of
a power like this

71
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,666
being inherited has
to be awfully high.

72
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,791
I don't think that's gonna
help us this time.

73
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,666
You see, back then,
the hunting was different.

74
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,958
So, logically there
shouldn't be any descendants.

75
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,541
[KARASUMA] Could there be a
connection with someone else?

76
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,958
--We know there are incidents...
--What do you have there?

77
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,791
[ROBIN] It was at the
scene of the incident.

78
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,333
At the scene of the...?

79
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,041
You took something away
from there without asking?!

80
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,041
[ROBIN]
Is that bad?

81
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,375
What do you mean,
"Is that bad"?!

[DOJIMA chuckles]

83
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,125
I'd say it's likely... that
the witch is still somewhere

84
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
in that area right now.

85
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,541
Since we don't have any leads,
we'll just have to keep

86
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,166
looking at everything.

87
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,791
[SAKAKI] And how's that gonna
work in a maze like that place?

88
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,333
It might not
in a normal situation.

89
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,500
But we're not looking
for a normal human,

90
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,625
now, are we?

91
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,750
[SAKAKI]
Uh.

[MICHAEL]
150,000 people...

94
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,375
It's amazing to
think that so many people

95
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,250
can actually live in
such a tiny area.

96
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,375
Maybe this is impossible...

97
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,291
I've gotta say, it's an
awful lot like looking for

98
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,583
a needle in a haystack.

99
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,291
Remember,
most witches are loners.

100
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,291
[MICHAEL]
Huh?

101
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,333
It's part of their nature.

102
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,625
Normal humans can
blend into the crowd,

103
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,250
but witches
aren't able to do that...

104
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,666
And that makes them vulnerable.

you will not find what you seek.

107
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,666
What makes you say that?

108
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,625
And how did you know
what I was doing?

109
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,333
It happens
when you grow older...

110
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:34,083
You can see many things
you couldn't see before.

It happens
when you grow older...

112

It's really quite astounding.

113
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,125
What is?

114
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,625
Never mind. Not important.

Let us leave it at that.

You are not from
around here.

117

You should bear that in mind;

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,500
in fact, you might consider
leaving this place.

you should not be...

But, I cannot say the same
for the people around you.

to do with them?

Where's the victim?

00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,958
I figure the people who live
here must have taken him.

129
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,458
Yep, it's that kinda
place, wouldn't ya say?

00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,250
Whatever's happening,
let's keep a low profile

until we can get some backup.

00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,291
I felt this huge burst
of psychic energy here

At least this
was done during the day.

With any luck, there'll be

Well, I certainly hope
something like that turns up.

What about Dojima and Robin?

They're with the
Factory guys right now.

Apparently, they had this
light bulb they wanted

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,916
to get checked out.

at the last crime site.

00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,166
of the burn on top of the bulb.

163
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,416
It's also obvious to
see that it was just made.

164
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,916
Are you saying
is that it was burned off

165
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,166
by the witch's powers?

166
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,958
Well, I wouldn't say directly,

167
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,041
but I wouldn't be surprised
if the microwaves from

168
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,375
the witch created a current

169
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,458
that lit up the bulbs that
had already burnt out,

170
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,666
and then they, in turn, charred
the whole area.

171
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,583
Should we think of it
as some kinda immense power?

172
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,791
Yeah.

173
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,416
[AMON] There's something
else to consider.

174
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,583
We can be pretty certain
that this witch isn't able

175
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,458
to fully control his powers yet.
It's a lot of unfocussed energy.

176
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,958
Sorta like Robin was.

177
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,916
Otherwise, there's
no explanation for

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,916
all the damage to the
surrounding area.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
[MICHAEL]
Is that you, Amon?

180
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,958
Michael, what are you
doing right now?

181
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,166
[MICHAEL] I'm checking the
background of the victims...

182
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,666
[AMON]
You can do that later.

183
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,958
There's something
I want you to do instead.

184
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,416
[MICHAEL]
What's that?

185
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,333
The electrical power where
these incidents took place.

186
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,458
I want you to check
if the voltage was above

187
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,625
regulations at any
of the locations.

188
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,208
[MICHAEL]
Well, okay, but...

189
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,666
[AMON] And hurry.
I need to know right away.

190
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,625
The first victims were
a couple of guys who were

191
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,625
after him, so we
know why he did that.

192
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,666
But the third one
was likely just someone

193
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,958
who lived nearby.

194
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,791
So in other words,
now that he's been cornered,

195
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,166
he's beginning to take it out
on innocent bystanders.

196
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,500
At the moment, he most
likely believes that everyone

197
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,166
he sees is out to get him.

198
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,875
[MICHAEL]
Got it!

199
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,000
Here it is Amon;
somebody's crankin' out

200
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,000
some serious voltage there.

201
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,416
It looks like it's underground.

202
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,958
Sakaki.

203

[SAKAKI]
I got the coordinates!

204
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,291
You want us to get over
there and see if we can

205
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,583
find this witch, right?

206
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,250
[AMON]
That's right. Hurry!

207

What're you doing here so late?

00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,916
[ROBIN] I was over at Harry's

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,125
--What about you?
--[AMON] Oh...

262
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,958
I was just going over
the information that

263
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,083
Michael found on
that witch earlier.

264
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,583
The one from today?

265
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,333
So what did you happen
to find out about him?

266
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,458
Juzo Narumi, 33 years old...

267
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,791
As it turns out,
he was a distant relative

268
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,000
of the witch Michael mentioned.

269
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,541
So you mean
that he was actually on

270
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,958
the STN's list after all?

271
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,875
[AMON]
That seems to be the case.

272
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,458
[ROBIN]
Hmm...

273
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,583
But it's strange.

274
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,000
[AMON]
Hm?

275
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,666
Well, you'd think that
someone with that much power

276
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,208
would be a little closer to
the top of the suspect list.

277
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,291
They said there
were basically no signs

278
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,166
that Narumi had
powers up until now.

279
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,375
What do they mean
"basically no signs"?

280
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,958
And if he had all that power,
how could he hide it?

281
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,791
Do you suppose he was
just awakened to his craft?

282

283

No, it's nothing...

said and done...

286

far too heavy a burden...
