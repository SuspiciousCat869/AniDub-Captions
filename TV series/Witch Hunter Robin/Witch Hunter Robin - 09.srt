Coroner?

10
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,833
Yes, sure.

11
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,208
I understand.

12
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,958
But I... don't know where it is.

13
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,916
So, you're from the STN.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,916
I'm sorry I had to trouble
you so early in the morning.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,791
It's over here.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,541
[WORKER] Looking at the
condition of the corpse,

17
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,416
I'd have to say that
he burned to death.

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,041
But, for some
unexplained reason

19
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,291
his lungs show no signs
of smoke inhalation at all.

20
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,166
I was told there were no signs
of any burning within the room.

21
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,291
Is that true?

22
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,625
Why, yes.

23
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,958
Come to think, the coroner
said that it was as if

24
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,875
he was burned from
the inside using

25
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,583
a microwave oven or something.

[ROBIN gasps]

00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,125
I understand.

28
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,833
Someone will come by later
and pick up the remains.

29
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,250
Thank you.

30
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,916
What a minute!

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,750
You mean you two didn't
come here to pick this up?

32
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,000
[MICHAEL]
We have an ID on the victim.

33
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,291
Tatsuro Oikawa, 34 years old.

34
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,208
His father's the president
of a pretty big firm.

35
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,375
[KARASUMA]
Let me guess.

36
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,916
The stupid son,
playing with fire,

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,291
got himself burned, right?

38
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,000
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I guess
you could say that.

39
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,500
Anyway, about the witch...

40
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,833
Did you find something?

41
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,500
[MICHAEL] Well, there were
three seeds that matched

42
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,416
the database back
at headquarters.

43
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,166
But it turned out that
two of them came from

44
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,041
completely different locations,
so we had to write them off.

45
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,333
In other words, our target

46
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,666
on this one has already
been decided for us.

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,291
[MICHAEL] Looks that way.
I'll send you the data.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,333
[typing]

49
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,000
This really makes
no sense at all.

50
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,125
Why would she do
something like that?

51
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,708
Even you're curious about it?

52
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,833
She was pretty normal
until now, right?

53
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,125
If I recall correctly,
you were born here in Japan.

54
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,500
Yes, that's right.

55
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,250
But I moved to Tuscany when
I was still very young.

56
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,125
All right, but you can't
deny the possibility

57
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,125
that a blood relative
to you still remains

58
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,958
somewhere in this
country, can you?

59
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,208
[MICHAEL] Sakaki and Karasuma
are on their way

60
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,583
to the witch's location.

61
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,500
We'll head over there, too.

62
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,125
Huh?

63
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,416

[footsteps]

00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,791
How's it going?

66
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,708
[SAKAKI] Well, it looks
like she hasn't moved yet.

67
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,750
Is this the only way
in or out of there?

68
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,666
Yeah, unless there's
some secret passage.

69
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,833
[MICHAEL]
What is it?

70
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,333
We're ready to start
the operation.

71
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,208
Have you linked up with
the Factory investigator?

72
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,666
[MICHAEL]
Yeah. I'm ready for you anytime.

73
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,791
So I gather that we're taking
her straight to the Factory?

74
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,083
[AMON]
That's right.

75
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,625
The Factory computer
decided that Aki Yoshioka

76
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,083
needed some questioning.

77
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,666
So that's why we're in a hurry.

78
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,000
But if Aki Yoshioka really
has awakened already,

79
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,458
we could have a problem.

80
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,875
If she resists, then we'll
have to use force.

81
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,583
[yawns]

82
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,458
Huh?

83
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,875
That's strange...

[ROBIN]
Mm.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,750
Michael, it looks as though
she's one step ahead of us.

89
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,166
You'd better contact
the Factory immediately.

90
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,083
And while you're at it,
call the manager, too.

91
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,291
[ROBIN]
Uh?

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,250
[DOJIMA]
Well, sorry, guys,

93
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,500
but I've really
got to go home now.

94
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,833
[DOJIMA] Goodnight, everybody.
I'll see you tomorrow.

95
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,083
[SAKAKI] Hey, I was just
about to go home, too.

96
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,750
Would you like me
to give you a ride?

97
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,500
[DOJIMA] That'd be great,
but I don't have a helmet.

98
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,250
That's all right.
I have a spare.

99
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,833
[computer pings]

100
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,791
[MICHAEL]
I'm through!

101
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,166
Is anything there?

102
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,750
It's too soon to tell.
Let me look around a little.

103
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,416
A message?

104
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,916
Hey, I don't believe it.
This is a confession.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,083
Yes, but wait.

106
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,250
She's says she killed three men.

107
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,083
We already knew that
Oikawa was murdered, but

108
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,416
what about the other two?

109
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,583
[MICHAEL]
Hang on, I'll check this out.

110
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,791

[tires squeal]

113
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,875
[AMON]
We were caught off guard.

114
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,041
[AMON] There's a witch
out there who has

115
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,750
just awakened to her powers...

116
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,666
We should have anticipated
the possibility

117
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,083
that there would be
a series of incidents.

118
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,791
But, Amon, Aki Yoshioka is dead.

119
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,166
Michael's report said
that the DNA patterns

120
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,875
matched perfectly.

121
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,041
Are you saying that this
was done by a ghost?

122
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,041
A ghost?

123
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,166
[gasps]

124
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,750
[AMON]
What's the matter?

125
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,000
[ROBIN] Amon, the sand that
was piled up in that room...!

126
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,541
The sand?

127
00:10:54,416 --> 00:11:01,375
[AKI laughs]

128
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,833
[ROBIN] Sand points north--
the circle of earth.

129
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,791
South is the circle of fire.

130
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,458
Water to the west,
and wind to the east.

131
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,833
And, the complete circle
points to the universe.

132
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,958
So, what's the big hurry?

133
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,916
An astral body
was summoned here.

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,583
[gasps]

135
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,791
That's when the spirit
leaves the body.

136
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,291
The spirit?

137
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,166
I think someone's tried
to make contact

138
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,583
with Yoshioka's spirit.

139
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,833
Okay.

140
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,541
Then that's the person
who murdered Oikawa.

141
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,250
That's why we wanted you here.

142
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,500
There's a chance that
Aki Yoshioka's spirit

143
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,791
is still around.

144
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,625
We want you to check it
out with your scrying.

145
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,875
[MICHAEL]
When I compared Oikawa's

146
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,833
and Matsunaga's backgrounds,
a few things came up.

147
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,500
A few years ago, the two of them

148
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,625
worked together at a
non-profit organization

149
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,791
along with Seiichiro Aramune.

150
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,958
[AMON]
Non-profit?

151
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,000
[MICHAEL]
Yeah, a volunteer group.

152
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a rehab center for victims
of domestic violence.

153
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,666
But, apparently that was just
a front for something else.

154
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,583
The police raided them
soon after they opened,

155
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,916
and shut them down.

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,791
But, that's not the
really interesting part.

157
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,375
You see, Aki Yoshioka was
placed there for a while

158
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,583
and had contact
with all three men.

159
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,416
[AMON]
That is interesting.

160
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,875
Michael, I want
the current address

161
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,166
of the third guy who
was supposedly involved,

162
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,541
and a list of all

324
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,583
[AMON] Yes, that's true,
the witch seems

325
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,416
to be knowledgeable about
many kinds of spells.

326
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,333
[ZAIZEN] And, what about...
the connection to her?

327
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:27,291
[AMON] No, there wasn't
any that we saw.

328
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,250
[ZAIZEN exhales]

329
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,458
[ZAIZEN] Your emotions aren't
getting in your way,

330
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,541
are they?

331
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,125
No, sir.

332
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,125
[AMON]
I understand.

333
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,541
I'll check it out one more time.

334
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,666
[NARRATOR]
Three hundred and twenty years

335
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,458
have passed since the
coven sank in the dark.

336
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,416
A covert mission.

337
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,416
Revenge against an informer.
Deception and remorse.

338
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,958
Cursed blood pulls the redeemed
soul back into the darkness.
