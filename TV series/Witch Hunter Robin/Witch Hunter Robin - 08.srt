You been doin' it for a while.

Hey, buddy. Ya think you
could lend me some change?

The anesthesia's working.

She's not responding to
the operation very well.

skilled surgeon.

[KOBARI]
Yep.

Best thing in the world
when you've got a cold.

00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,458
Warms you right up.

working again last night?

00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,916
Were you outside in the rain?

Just as I thought.

00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,250
That's how you must
have caught your cold.

43
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,833
I think it's time you went
to see a doctor for that.

44
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,666
Here, I'm going to
give you the address

45
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,416
of a really good hospital.

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,708
But first, do yourself a favor
and finish up that tea, okay?

47
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,291
[PA NURSE] Dr. Sherman, please
report to the conference room.

48
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,625
Dr. Sherman...

49
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,500
Ah, pretty swollen all right.

50
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,000
Some antibiotics
should do the trick.

51
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,958
You can get this filled at
the pharmacy on the way out.

52
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,333
Okay.

53

[KUROSAWA]
Any other problems or questions?

No, not really.

[KUROSAWA]
Well, that's good.

58
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,416
You're very lucky.

You never see the kids who just
wish they were healthy enough

to be active, but unfortunately
there are a lot of them.

61
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:44,250
There are quite a few
right here in this hospital.

62

Here you go.
Take this to the pharmacy.

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,791
That'll fix you up.

Thank you.

65
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,541

Scallions.

00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,875
[ROBIN]
What?

69
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,041
Wrap some around your neck.

70
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,541
Sometimes it works
better than medicine.

71
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,083
It certainly can't
hurt, you know.

72
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,750
Scallions...?

73
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,375
[NURSE 8B]
This is three days' worth.

74
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,791
Make sure that you take
it after meals, okay?

75
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,125
[ROBIN]
Okay...

76
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,250
[KIRIHARA]
Oh, sorry, third floor, please.

77
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,791
[DOCTOR 8A] Oh, so how'd it go
down at the police station?

78
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,291
[KIRIHARA]
It was just a heart attack.

79
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,875
No sign of narcotics.

80
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,166
So, how are you doing?

81
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,625
[KUMI]
Well...

82
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,291
I feel like I'm alive!

83
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,791
And it's all thanks
to Dr. Kirihara!

84
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,208
[KIRIHARA]
No, it went well because

85
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,125
you were a very good patient.

00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,625
--[LISA] Doctor...
--[KIRIHARA] Hmm?

87
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,708
I promise I'll be
just as good a patient

88
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,708
I trust you with
my surgery, too.

89
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,291
[KUMI]
You don't have to worry!

90
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,833
All you have to do is believe in
the doctor, and you'll be fine!

91
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,333
Right, Doctor?

92
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,125
Why, yes.

93
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,208
There is no question about it.

94
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,208
[KUROSAWA]
Lisa Kayama...

95
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,375
The patient in room 405.

96
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,291
[KIRIHARA]
Yes. Her operation is next week.

97
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,000
But in her present condition,

98
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,125
I'm not sure if she's going
to make it until then.

99
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,125
She dreams of getting well.

100
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,166
And I want to give her
a real future.

101
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,250
So, please save her...

102
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,250
...with your powers!

103
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,958
Are you sure about that?

104
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,291
[KIRIHARA]
Hm?

105
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,125
[KUROSAWA] If we "cure"
her before the operation,

106
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,041
it won't advance the acceptance
of your work you know.

107
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,166
[KIRIHARA]
Hmph.

108
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,041
I've gotten more
than enough praise.

109
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,708
Thanks to you, that is.

110
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,916
[KUROSAWA sighs]

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,791
I never believed in
the existence of God.

112
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,916
But whatever you call it,

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,041
there's definitely
something out there.

114
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,666
There has to be something.

115
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,083
Something has given me the power
to control life and death.

116
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,208
Whatever it is.

117
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,791
Yes.

118
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,875
[KUROSAWA] If this is
what you call destiny...

119
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,833
Then it means my destiny is...

120
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,458
...to be strong and
lend a helping hand...

121
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,708
To pull back fragile
lives as they dwindle..

122
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,916
I will keep following that
destiny as long as I can.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,708
Do you have any
leads on a donor?

124
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,500
[KIRIHARA] Yes. One of my
old patients, actually.

125
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,833
That is... a man who is
of no use to this world.

126
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,583
[ZAIZEN]
This is the strange corpse

127
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,875
that was found last night.

128
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:31,875
Robin?

129
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:32,916
Uh.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,416
Sorry.

131
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,916
[ZAIZEN clears throat]

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,791
[ZAIZEN] The coroner's
report has it listed

133
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,041
as natural causes
from a heart attack.

134
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,916
Now usually, that'd be the
end of the case of course.

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,125
But this one was a witch.

136
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,666
[ROBIN]
Oh. So that means...

137
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,000
[ZAIZEN] When a corpse
is identified by the police

138
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,583
computer system, that
individual is automatically

139
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,833
cross-referenced with
the STNJ's witch list.

140
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,916
If there's ever a match,
then the STNJ steps in

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,125
and performs its own
autopsy on the corpse

142
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,416
just as a normal precaution.

143
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
But, this time, the result was

144
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,916
not even close to
the police report.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,125
And what happened to him
wasn't natural at all.

146
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,208
Cause of death:
necrosis of the heart.

147
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,875
It was caused by
a witch's powers.

148
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,541
It's not clear whether
another witch got him,

149
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,791
or whether his own powers

150
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,000
just somehow went
out of control.

151
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,708
But why were the
autopsies so different?

152
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,416
We thought it must
have just been some

153
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,041
simple mistake, but it wasn't.

154
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,666
[MICHAEL]
And there are other ones, too.

155
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,875
All you have to do is
dig around a little.

156
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,583
Like this one, for instance,
about three years ago.

157
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,791
Not only that,
but the police autopsy

158
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,458
on that one was run
by the same doctor.

159
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,833
A Kazuhiro Kirihara,
a substitute coroner.

160
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,333
He currently works at

161
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,416
Touto Takanodai

00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,166
improved quite a bit.

323
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:20,083
[NURSE 8D]
It's okay, sweetie...

324
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,208
[AMON] It's still not
clear when Kurosawa's

325
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,625
powers first awakened.

326
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,125
But apparently he used them

327
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,083
very effectively to "cure"
quite a number of

328
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,333
Kirihara's patients.

329
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,583
And Kirihara?

330
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,916
[AMON]
He's... in our custody.

331

[LISA]
It's so great to be out here!

[GIRLS laugh]

333

[KUMI]
The fountain's so beautiful!

[NARRATOR]
Three hundred and twenty years

336
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,958
have passed since the
coven sank in the dark.

337
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,250
The metaphor of death.

338
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:30,291
A summoned spirit.
The sealed past.

339
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:35,416
The darkness takes light away
from the flame of revenge...
