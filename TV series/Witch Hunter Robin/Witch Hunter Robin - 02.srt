It looks as though we've
reached the season when you're

00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,916
going to need a jacket

[MORNING NEWS ANCHOR B] The

Huh?

11
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,083
Oh, I'm sorry, I must
have woken you up.

12
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,291
Well, good morning.

13
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,750
You're up awfully early,
aren't you, Touko?

14
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,333
[TOUKO] All women who
work in company offices

15
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,666
are up at this time.

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,375
I guess everyone where you
work gets up late, huh?

17
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,791
Not necessarily.

18
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,583
[TOUKO] I thought all you
nuns got up really early

guess that's not the case.

I've got to get
going to work now,

00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,500
so I trust you'll lock up
before you leave.

00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,583
Oh.

24
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,750
I made a pot of
strong coffee for you,

25
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,458
though perhaps I shouldn't have?

26
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,583
No. That's all right.

27
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,583
I used to drink it all the time.

If you have any problems today

just feel free to
give me a call, okay?

30
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,291
Your boss informed me that
I should tell you that.

My boss?

I guess you don't even know
who that is yet, do you?

00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,708
Not really. We were...

Just moments ago,

39
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,625
the lawsuit against
Mr. Kazuya Misawa,

40
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,166
owner of an import
retail business,

41
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,833
has been dismissed by the court.

Oh! Mr. Misawa has just
appeared from the courthouse!

43

Mr. Misawa!

44
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,833
You've just won in court.

00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,291
How do you feel right now?

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,750
[MISAWA] I want to
thank everyone who has

47

supported me through
this terrible ordeal.

48
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,583
I also feel tremendous
anger towards

49
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,291
the foolish acts of the police.

Any comment?

[MISAWA] That's really not
what's important here.

I just want to tell
everyone who has been

55
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,416
followed this case that
there is only one truth.

Good morning.

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,125

made it impossible

62
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:44,166
for the court case against
Kazuya Misawa to continue.

63
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
I thought that it would
be all right for him

00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,250
to be tried in a court
of law, but, as you see...

Excuse me, what's this about?

Come on. You must know.

00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,833

No. It stands to reason

she wouldn't know
anything about this.

How do you feel right now?

76
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,583
I want to thank everyone who has

77
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,916
supported me through
this terrible ordeal.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,375
This was this morning.

00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay then, I'll show
you some stuff

80
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,583
from before you arrived.

81
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,166
[MICHAEL] Our target is
Kazuya Misawa, 28 years old.

82
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,958
He's a suspect in the murder
of his business partner.

83
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,541
He acts like a movie star.

84
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,541
[MICHAEL] The victim
was Yukihiro Watanabe,

85
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,041
32 years old.

86
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,875
Apparently, he was never really
on good terms with Misawa.

87
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,958
He's crying, but he's
shedding no tears.

88
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,458
To believe I would curse him
to his death is ridiculous!

89
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,750
[MICHAEL]
The crime happened in an office

90
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,708
in a building that Misawa owns.

91
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,083
Cause of death was
severe bleeding

92
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,125
from multiple organ injuries.

93
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,125
Witnesses reported to
police that Misawa

94
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,375
cursed the victim to death

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,875
without laying so much
as one finger on him.

96
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,500
The coroner's report
said that the only

97
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,875
viable explanation for
the injuries was that

98
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,791
some strong force was
applied from the inside.

99
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,041
Usually data like this
gets forwarded to STNJ,

100
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,958
and we take charge of the case.

101
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,541
However, this time,
the detective in charge

102
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,666
of the investigation
fabricated his report.

103
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,916
Fabricated?

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,708
There would be no court
case if the method

105
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,500
of homicide was a curse.

106
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,208
The DA wouldn't proceed
with a case like that.

107
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,125
Are you some kind of idiot?

108
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
I'll try to make it easy
for you--a witch's power

109
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,166
doesn't exist as far as
society is concerned!

110
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,500
[ROBIN]
Oh, okay.

111
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,916
[DOJIMA]
"Okay"? She's really irritating!

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,916
Now that Misawa
knows that his powers

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,333
can't be controlled by the law,

114
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,333
I'm sure his actions
will get more extreme.

115
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
We'll make sure to get past
the eyes of the media

116
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,333
buzzing around him, and find
a chance to capture him.

117
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,791
Sakaki, Karasuma--you two
investigate his workplace.

118
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,083
I'll look into his private
connections with Michael.

119
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,625
[SAKAKI, KARASUMA]
Yes, sir.

[ZAIZEN exhales]

[ZAIZEN] Is Father Juliano
still doing well?

122
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,333
I didn't know you
knew about him.

123
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,375
I met him back in Solomon
quite some time ago.

124
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,958
It's been... well,
over a decade now.

125
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,416
He's doing very well,
I'm glad to say,

126
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,875
though his powers have
diminished somewhat.

127
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, I see.

128
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,333
[ZAIZEN] How we do things
here may be different

129
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,083
from how they do
them at headquarters.

130
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,583
[ROBIN]
Yes, I've noticed.

131
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,708
[ZAIZEN] We have our own
ways of operating.

132
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,875
I insist you abide by our rules.

133
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:56,250
I assume you mean the fact
that you don't kill the witches.

134
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,333
Look, I'm sure that might seem
a little strange to you,

135
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,583
but we have developed a system

136
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,291
that captures witches
without killing them.

137
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,541
The Orbo.

138
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,791
[ZAIZEN]
That's right.

139
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,875
It does have the
unfortunate downside

140
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,083
of diminishing the
powers of the hunters

141
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,416
but it works to hold back
the enemy's powers

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,250
from affecting our bodies.

143
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,083
You are a master hunter.

144
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:19,208
I'm sure you'll do well here,
but you must keep in mind

145
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,958
that we capture witches--
we do not kill them.

146
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:22,958
[ROBIN]
I will.

147
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,166
But, sir.

148
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,125
I won't be using the Orbo.
It's disgusting.

149
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,625
I see.

150
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,833
Well then...

151
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,208
I want you to stick
with him for a while.

152
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,541
And get to know our system here.

153
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,291
You may go now.

Yes, sir.

155

It looks like she has
no interest in the Orbo.

[ZAIZEN] I don't know
what they're thinking

00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,958
Best be on your guard.

160
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,500
That's all for now.

161
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,666
[AMON]
Right.

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,041
[KOSAKA]
Hm? Ah, well, it's you again!

163
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,125
So it's, uh, Robin, isn't it?

164
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,583
Oh!

165
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,708
Before you sit down, could
you go and get me some tea?

166
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,750
[HATTORI] Uh, Chief,
I already got you some tea.

167
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,000
[KOSAKA]
Oh, sorry about that, Hattori.

168
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,083
Well, now. All right,
Little Robin.

169
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,958
The place where
you're going to work

170
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,791
is right over there.

171
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,333
All right.

172
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,125
[KOSAKA] We finally get
a young girl in here,

173
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,000
and I can't see her
very well from my seat!

174
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:55,958
Little Robin!

175
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,208
If you're ever in trouble,

176
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,291
you know you can always
come to me for help.

177
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,541
[HATTORI]
Uh, Chief.

178
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,333
About how you're calling
her "Little Robin"...

179
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,500
[KOSAKA]
Is that bad?

180
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,416
[HATTORI]
I wouldn't say that it's bad,

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,333
but I think it's just
a little too casual.

182
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,375
And, Chief, about this receipt
from Snack Pub Komadori,

183
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,500
you said that it was
a business expense, but...

184
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,875
[KOSAKA]
Do something about it!

185
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,208
[KARASUMA]
Don't worry about him.

186
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,708
You're gonna find the chief
acts like that all the time.

187
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
You can just pretend
he's nothin' but air.

188
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:31,083
It won't be too long before
you figure this place out.

189
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,916
Well, see ya later,
Little Robin.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,666
[gasps]

191
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,375
I'm going to come, too!

192
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,458
It'd be a lot better for you
if you waited for Amon's orders.

193
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,166
Until then, you can hang out
with Michael, okay?

194
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,916
[SAKAKI] You can pass the time
lookin' over case files.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,875
[KARASUMA]
Wait a minute!

196
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,125
Where do you think you're going?

197
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,875
A little shopping, that's all.

198
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,708
See ya later!

199
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,500
I don't believe her.

200
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,958
[HATTORI]
Hmm...

201
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,583
[clatter]

202
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,791
Oh.

203
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,166
Sorry.

204
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,750
Uh?

205
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,083
What is this?

206
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,000
A church.

207
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,958
Did you take this picture?

208
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,791
[MICHAEL] No, it was
taken by the detective

209
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,250
in charge of the case.

210
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,833
Man, analog people are so bad

211
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,791
at keeping track
of information...

212
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,041
By the way, those materials
haven't been filed yet,

213
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,291
so take a look at
the stuff over here.

214
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,166
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll leave them here.

215
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,708
Where's Amon?

216
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,750
[MICHAEL]
I'm pretty sure he left already.

217
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
[gasps]

218
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,916
[ROBIN] It says in this
report that a few people

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,041
in the office witnessed
the quarrel between

220
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,666
the victim and the suspect.

221
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,375
However, nobody saw the quarrel
from beginning to end.

222
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,000
But then there was one witness

223
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,416
who said he saw Misawa shout,
"I'll curse you to your death!"

224
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,791
at the victim right
after the quarrel.

225
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,833
Stop that! I can't concentrate.

226
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,791
Oh, I'm sorry.

227
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,125
"I'll curse you to your death."

228
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,625
[gasps]

229
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,625
[ROBIN, MICHAEL]
The body...

230
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,916
[ROBIN]
What was it's condition?

231
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,708
Well, it's not
written down anywhere.

232
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,416
But the coroner
who was in charge

233
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,416
is quoted as saying that
the internal organs

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,666
were "twisted off."

235
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,875
The authorities
kept that a secret

236
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,041
and arrested him on charges
of clubbing the victim.

237
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,333
Misawa has been
questioned several times

238
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,541
in the last few years
for destruction of property

239
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,791
and charges of assault.

240
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,083
However, all cases proved to
lack sufficient evidence,

241
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,666
and they couldn't arrest him.

242
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,250
They definitely wanted
to capture him this time,

243
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,083
since it was a murder case.

244
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,291
In the end, the
investigating detective

245
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,250
lied in the report so
he could arrest Misawa.

246
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,666
In other words...

247
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,625
That's the part
that's fabricated.

248
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,500
[MICHAEL] Could you please
stop thinking out loud?

249
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,500
All right, I will.
But it's the truth.

250
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,916
[phone rings]

251
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,625
Hey there, Amon.

252
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,125
[AMON] We got some
information that the media

253
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,333
doesn't have yet.

254
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,166
He'll be getting married soon.

255
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,000
The fiancée is the daughter
of one of his business partners.

256
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,916
So it's a real
good deal for him.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,708
Since the press hasn't
caught on about it,

258
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,166
the preparations
for the ceremony

259
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,125
are going on in
complete secrecy.

260
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,166
[MICHAEL]
Wait a minute!

261
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,250
That thing you found.

262
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,250
[ROBIN]
Hm?

263
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,708
Get the photograph!

264
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,875
[gasps]

265
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,250
[AMON]
The detective?

266
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,458
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I think
he'd caught on to it.

267
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,458
He had a photo and some
information about the chapel.

268
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,666
Michael.

269
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,625
I've already sent
Karasuma and Sakaki

270
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,250
to contact the fiancée.

271
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,458
I want you to get
information about the chapel

272
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,541
and the whereabouts of that
detective, just in case.

273
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,666
Right, I'll check
it out right away.

274
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,541
[AMON]
I'm counting on you.

275
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,583
What should I...?

276
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,708
[dial tone]

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,750
[MICHAEL]
This is it.

278
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,583
[ROBIN]
She's being fooled.

279
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,250
He's lying to her
to get her to marry him.

280
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,833
To get her to love him...

281
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,666
She doesn't even
realize what he is.

282
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,958
[KARASUMA]
That's her.

283
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,875
The fiancée.

284
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah, well, she's pretty cute.

285
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,833
--Maybe on the outside.

Good luck. See ya soon.

[KARASUMA]
Excuse me.

291
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,791
You must be Miss Nakamoto.

292
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,208
Good afternoon, I work
for TN Television.

293
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,291
I was hoping to speak
with you for a moment.

294
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,791
What is it?

295
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,250
You're gonna be getting married
to Mr. Misawa soon, right?

296
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,875
I would like our
station to be granted

297
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,500
exclusive rights to cover
the wedding ceremony.

298
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,250
Well, I don't know.

299
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,666
Miss Nakamoto, shouldn't
your special day

300
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,791
be seen by as many
people as possible?

301
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,583
Well, actually, that
could be interesting.

302
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,666
[KARASUMA]
Please do think about it.

303
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,041
Oh, but if my father should
happen to find out about this,

304
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,958
I'm certain he will
be against it.

305
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,375
Don't call me at home.
I'll call you.

306
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,916
[SAKAKI]
Were you able to see anything?

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,208
Yeah. It's not very pretty.

308
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,750
Right now, all
that's on her mind

309
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,541
is how she can make her
way into the spotlight.

310
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,125
She's not worried at all
about his incident.

311
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,416
Tomorrow, she's trying on
the dress at the chapel.

312
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
[SAKAKI] In a way, she's scarier
than a witch, you know?

She forced them to
schedule it after hours.

Tomorrow night at ten PM.

How about me?

00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,458
Of course, there'll be
something for you to do.

Oh, I see.

was a hunter after all.

Oh, my, my, it's been
a while, Miss Touko.

Yes, indeed, it has
been a while.

Will the usual Sherry
be all right with you?

You must be Mr. Misawa.

Yes, I am.

to wait here like this.

find the chapel

He's with an attendant.

him to the chapel.
