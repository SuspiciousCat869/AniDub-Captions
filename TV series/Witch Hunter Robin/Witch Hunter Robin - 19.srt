1
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,750
So, this thing is the
Fragment of Wisdom, huh?

2
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,041
[exhales]

3
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,333
[gasps]

4
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,291
[snaps]

5
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:55,000
[NAGIRA] It looks to me
like it boosted your power.

6
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,958
[NAGIRA]
This Fragment of Wisdom...

7
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,125
Or rather, the
"Arcanum of the Craft"...

8
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,916
What the hell is it?

9
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,958
Why do you have
something like this?

10
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,333
[ROBIN]
Nagira...

11
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,625
There are some things even
I don't have answers to.

12
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,958
To be very honest, I don't know
if returning this thing to you

13
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,666
is really such a good idea.

14
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,166
I'll admit that
this thing's power

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,958
saved my life back there.

16
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,833
But on the other hand,
I may end up just like that guy

17
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,750
depending on how you're
feeling at any given moment.

18
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,750
The thought of one human being
having such incredible power

19
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,500
gives me the willies.

20
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,833
Can you control it?

21
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,416
This power?

22
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,500
Well, can you?

23
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,833
I don't know for sure myself.

24
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,375
[NAGIRA]
Hmph.

25
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,041
There are some people
that I want you to meet.

26
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,708
They might just know
something about this

27
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,250
"Arcanum of the Craft."

28
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,250
[gasps]

29
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,375
I want to meet them.

30
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,208
[NAGIRA]
I'm sorry to make you guys


31
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,041
come all the way out
here like this.


32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,041
[door clicks, footsteps]


33
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,791
[NAGIRA] This is the girl
I told you about.

34
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,958
[ROBIN]
I'm Robin.

35
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,916
My name is Kannosaki.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,958
[HITOMI]
Uh?

37
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,291
[KANNOSAKI]
And this is my wife...

38
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,250
Huh?

39
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,166
Honey?

40
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,833
[HITOMI]
Uh. Pleased to meet you.

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,083
[NAGIRA]
Well, this is it.

42
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,625
[KANNOSAKI]
I'd heard there was an object

43
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,416
that could bestow the inner
secrets on a Witch, but...

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,666
Is it all right if I
touch the Fragment?

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,375
Um... Of course.

46
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,875
[NAGIRA]
So, what do you think?

47
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,625
I heard that you two
were quite the experts

48
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,166
when it came to Witchcraft.

49
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,750
Well, it just sort of
turned out that way.

50
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,291
Hmm... I believe my wife

51
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,375
might actually know more
about this than I do.

52
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:40,375
Hitomi, have you seen anything
like this in the library?

53
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,375
Hitomi?

54
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,375
Uh. Yes?

55
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,291
[KANNOSAKI]
Well, have you?

56
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,333
Uh. Hm...

57
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,083
I'm very sorry.
I've never seen it before.

58
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,916
I'm terribly sorry.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,708
Oh, no, that's quite all right.

60
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,916
However, I would ask you two

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,666
not to discuss this
matter with anyone else.

62
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,791
[KANNOSAKI]
We understand completely.

63
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,916
We would like nothing more

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,666
than to lead a quiet
and peaceful life.

65
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,291
I'm sorry that we
can't help you,

66
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,916
but we really should be going.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right, Hitomi?

68
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
Oh, I apologize.

69
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,625
[KANNOSAKI]
Well, we're off.

70
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,250
[NAGIRA] If you ever need
any help with anything,

71
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,500
give me a call.

72
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,500
[KANNOSAKI]
Thank you, we will.

73
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:24,750
[door creaks]

74
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,291
[footsteps]

75
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,666
[NAGIRA]
That's too bad.

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,541
Well, sometimes coming up
empty can be for the best.

77
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,916
Don't worry about it.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,791
Nagira, tell me, do I have
something on my face?

79
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,333
[NAGIRA]
Huh?

80
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,708
[ROBIN] The whole time they were
here, that woman was just...

81
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,125
...staring at me.

82
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,750
[NAGIRA]
You're imagining things.

83
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,208
It's true, she was!

84
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,958
[NAGIRA]
You're being self-conscious.

85
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,833
I'm not!

86
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,583
[phone chimes]

87
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,583
[NAGIRA]
Hm? Excuse me!

88
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,708
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,166
[NAGIRA]
I'm heading out for a bit.

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,083
[HANAMURA] You gonna go
play Pachinko again?!

91
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,208
This is an important
business call, okay?

92
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,833
You have an appointment
scheduled for this evening--

93
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Don't worry, I'll be back.

94
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,375
[pachinko machines rattle]

95
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,750
So, whaddya got for me?

96
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,125
[GAMBLER] Word on the street
is that there's this guy

97
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,333
who worked as an errand boy
for old lady Methuselah.

98
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,166
[NAGIRA]
I see.

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,083
[GAMBLER] I figure if anybody
knows about the Fragment,

100
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,916
he'd be the one.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,833
They call him Lazarus.

102
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,625
Rumor has it that the old lady

103
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:47,083
brought him back to life just
as he was about to die.

104
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,791
That's how he got his nickname.

105
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,500
But I hear that
nobody's seen him

106
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,666
around the neighborhood lately,

107
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,666
so if you're trying to find him,
you might want to hurry.

108
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:07,708
[gasps]

109
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:08,833
Amon?

110
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,875
But how did you...?

111
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,750
Amon!

112
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,208
[ROBIN gasps]

113
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,125
[panting]

114
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,208
[HANAMURA]
Hey, Robin!

115
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:32,041
You've got a call from that
woman who was here yesterday!

116
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,708
Are you still sleeping
or something?!

117
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,750
If you don't come down,
I'm hanging up!

118
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,083
You've got 10 seconds!

119
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,583
Nine! Eight!

120
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,041
[ROBIN]
Okay, I've got it.

121
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,875
I'll be right there.

122
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,375
Where is Nagira?

123
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,500
[HANAMURA] He hasn't been
back since he went out.

124
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
I wonder where he's
goofing off now?

125
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,250
At his girlfriend's?

126
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,500
Huh?!

127
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,708
[ROBIN] Somebody said
they wanted to meet him.

128
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,375
Oh, that's right!

129
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,208
I totally forgot about that!

130
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,291
What's wrong with me?

131
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,500
I should've thought
of that before!

132
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,458
I really need to keep
a closer eye on him!

133
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,750
I'm going out for a bit.

134
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:11,958
[HANAMURA]
I wish he'd stop drinking,

135
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,166
gambling, and womanizing
during office hours.

136
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,750
[doorbell chimes]

137
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,166
[ROBIN]
Excuse me.

138
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,916
[HITOMI]
It's open! Please come on in.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,583
Okay.

140
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,791
Hello! I'm so glad
that you came by!

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,250
Please, make yourself at home.

142
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,333
Um...

143
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,208
[HITOMI]
I know! I'll make us some tea.

144
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,958
Do you like black tea?

145
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,875
Sure.

146
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,708
[HITOMI] I received some
wonderful black tea a while ago.

147
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,250
But my husband doesn't
notice that kind of thing,

148
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,916
so there's no
point in making it.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Um...

150
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,416
[HITOMI]
Would you like something sweet?

151
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,916
I made you some of your
favorite orange cake today!

152
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,416
Um, about the Fragment, I--

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,666
[HITOMI]
Oh, could you wait a moment?

154
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,166
[HITOMI]
Sorry about that.

155
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,791
All right. Here we are.

156
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,958
This is the one-piece dress
you kept telling me you wanted.

157
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,791
Good thing I got a size 9, huh?

158
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,166
[KANNOSAKI]
Stop that, Hitomi. Please.

159
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,875
But, honey...

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,250
Would you please stop it, Dear.

161
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,500
That girl isn't Aya.

162
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,833
[KANNOSAKI]
What are you doing here?

163
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,083
She said that she remembered
something about the Fragment.

164
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,083
Could I have a word
with you alone, please?

[door opens]

166
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,958
[KANNOSAKI]
This was our daughter's room.

167
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,583
We don't use it anymore.

168
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,166
[ROBIN]
What happened to her?

169
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,625
[KANNOSAKI] Well, chances
are that she was hunted.

170
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:56,875
You see, Aya was a Witch.

171
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,125
You remind my wife of...

172
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,708
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,916
[KANNOSAKI] I've heard
about you from Mr. Nagira.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,416
This place is
under surveillance.

175
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,458
You shouldn't associate
with us anymore.

176

178

[TECH]
We've been expecting you.

179
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,333
[TECH] How has Solomon HQ
reacted to the attack?

180
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,250
[ZAIZEN] They've done
nothing whatsoever.

181
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,125
[TECH] Perhaps they're waiting
to see what move we will make.

182
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,333
[DIRECTOR] I sincerely doubt
they give us that much credit.

183
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,250
There are rumors that
the attack on the STNJ

184
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,375
means that Solomon headquarters
has cut you loose.

185
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,416
If any more of these negative
rumors continue to spread then

186
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,583
there's a good chance that we'll
end up losing our sponsors.

187
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,625
You'd like to replace
me that badly?

188
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,125
No, sir.

189
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,250
What I'm trying to say is
that perhaps you should refrain

190
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,500
from any overt activity for a
while until things calm down.

191
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,291
The STNJ is safe for now.

192
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,083
But if this place were
ever attacked...

193
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,750
Director. Clearly your true
motivating factor in this

194
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,291
is that you value your life.

195
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,833
And yet, what you don't seem
to understand, Director,

196
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,625
is that this place
is a fortress.

197
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,458
It's not easily captured,
even by an organization

198
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,000
such as Solomon Headquarters.

199
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,625
I realize, but...

200
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,083
[ZAIZEN]
It's time to make a decision.

201
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,458
We will speed up the project.

202
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,583
But certainly you
can't be serious!

203
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,166
[ZAIZEN] Solomon's views on
things will have to change

204
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,041
once they see the results
of the evolved Orbo.

205
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,583
We will no longer need to have
Witches' powers on hunts.

206
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,583
Now is the time to take that
first step towards our ideal.

207
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,875
What's our development status?

208
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:23,208
We're now getting results
in 97% of our simulations.

209
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,833
Give us authorization
to gather data in combat

210
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,583
and we will move out at once.

211
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,458
[ZAIZEN]
You are so authorized.

212
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,416
I'll forward the STNJ's
hunt list to you.

213
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,250
Begin your preparations.

214
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,958
Yes sir, right away.

215
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,958
I'll expect better
results this time.

216
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,041
[ROBIN]
Huh?

217
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,208
Why am I crying...?

218
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,250
[NAGIRA]
Uh, dammit!

219
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,916
That was close...

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,291
Is this guy really down here?

221
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,250
What's that?

222
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,708
Is that it?

223
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,791
Hey there, Lazarus?

224

[NAGIRA]

225

So that was just a warning, huh?

[doorbell chimes]

I was just passing by.

[KANNOSAKI]
It's you...

245
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,041
[ROBIN] I'd like to talk some
more, if you don't mind.

246
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,416
Please, come in!

247
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,541
Honey? She can come
in for just a little bit, right?

248
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,625
[HITOMI] I was just starting
to make us some dinner.

249
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,041
Is there anything
you don't like?

250
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,833
No, not really.

251
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:07,916
[HITOMI]
Oh, good!

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,333
In that case,
I'll make my specialty!

253
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,708
Thank you very much.

254
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,625
Huh?

255
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,291
[KANNOSAKI] It seems like
it's been forever since

256
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,458
I last saw her this happy.

257
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,041
You see, she's been crying
ever since you left yesterday.

258
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,875
Actually, she's been crying ever
since we lost our daughter.

259
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,958
Maybe I've been pretending
not to notice all this time...

260
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,625
I ignore it...

261
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,333
Because there's nothing
at all I can do to help.

262
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,500
[ROBIN]
Would you mind if...

263
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,708
...I asked about Aya?

264
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,291
[KANNOSAKI] It was three years
ago that her powers awakened.

265
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,833
Her abilities were very weak,

266
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,083
hardly enough to make
a pencil roll around.

267
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,125
But it was an unwanted power.

268
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,375
So we used every means
at our disposal

269
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,541
to find out if we could
make it go away.

270
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:08,041
In the end, we were
never able to find a way.

271
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,708
And then one day, she went
off to school as usual,

272
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,541
and we've never seen
our daughter since.

273
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,625
The STNJ calls
people like us "Seeds"

274
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,166
and keeps us under
constant surveillance.

275
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,208
And if we show signs
of powers, however faint,

276
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,750
we're ratted out, and our
very existence is erased.

277
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,416
Did you look for her?

278
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,666
We looked everywhere.
For months and months.

279
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,375
We even asked the media
and the police to help.

280
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,000
But all of them ignored us.

281
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,583
The only person who ever
offered us a helping hand

282
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,250
during that time was Mr. Nagira.

283
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,916
[KANNOSAKI]
My wife...

284
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,416
She had been fighting with
Aya over whether or not

285
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,000
to buy this new
dress right up until

286
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,208
the morning she disappeared...

287
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,833
My wife has regretted not
buying it for her ever since.

288
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,958
[HITOMI]
I'm so sorry.

289
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,125
I've neglected to entertain you.

290
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,000
[ROBIN]
Um... Let me help you.

291
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
Thank you.

292
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,291
But do you think you
might be able

293
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,333
to do something else for me?

294
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,583
[ROBIN]
Hmm?

295
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,875
I wonder if she'll
like this or not?

296
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,833
She just might.

[KANNOSAKI]
I'm sorry.

for much longer, I'm afraid.

Just, "Yeah"?

Oh! You stink!

308
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,708
Mr. Nagira, where did you
pick up that stench?!

309

I'm sending that to

Where's Robin?

She went out to see that
couple from yesterday.

312
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,875
What did you say?

313
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,083
[ZAIZEN] They tell me you'll
be able to leave soon.

Where's Amon now?

You'd do best to forget him.

Don't go after him.

317
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,916
So then what do you
plan to do with him?

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,875
He is very different from us.

319
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,541
He's still a human being.

320

I have a special duty to
preserve the purity of humanity.

00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,416
[ZAIZEN] I've put together
everything you'll need.

322
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,791
Touko, put this behind you

323
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,416
and make a new
life for yourself.

324
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,000
[ROBIN] I'm sorry for intruding
on you this evening.

325
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,958
[HITOMI] I'd like for you
to have this dress.

326
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,416
Please, keep it.
I'll come visit again.

327
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,833
Of course!

328
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,250
Well. Goodbye.

329
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,541
[door closes]

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
--Uh!
--[breaks squeak]

331
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,791
I forgot my--

332
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,291
Do you really think she'll
come by to visit us again?

333
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,208
It's going to be
all right, honey.

334
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,083
I'm sure she--

335
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:45,916
[KANNOSAKI]
Hm?

336
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,125
[footsteps]

337
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,333
Hitomi, go out
the back, quickly.

338
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,208
No, I won't.

339
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,291
[KANNOSAKI]
Hm?

340
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,375
[HITOMI] I'm staying. I refuse
to lose anyone else.

341
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,000
Hitomi...

342
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,166
[knocking]

343
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,000
[gasps]

344
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,250
[ROBIN]
It can't be...

345
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,375
Those people were just...

346
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,875
[NAGIRA]
Robin!

347
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,583
What are you doing?

348
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,250
Nagira...

349
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,541
They've both disappeared.

350
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,333
[ROBIN]
That couple, they...

351
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,750
They were just here,
and now they're gone!

352
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,958
[ROBIN cries]

353
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,958
[NAGIRA]
And then?

354
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,625
[ROBIN] I was sent to Japan
by Solomon headquarters

355
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,625
in order to retrieve
the Fragment of Wisdom.

356
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,791
Working as a hunter at
the STNJ was camouflage.

357
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,500
It was my cover
for that mission.

358
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,250
[NAGIRA] So in other words,
nobody outside of headquarters

359
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,666
was supposed to know
about you, right?

360
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,416
[ROBIN]
I retrieve the Fragment,

361
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,958
hand it over to a messenger
from headquarters,

362
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,333
and my mission
would be complete.

363
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,458
That's how it was
supposed to work.

364
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,166
However...

365
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,250
...it didn't end up
working out that way.

366
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,416
You're saying the
attack on the STNJ

367
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,791
wasn't because
of the Fragment?

368
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,625
If they wanted it,
all they had to do

369
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,083
was wait for me
to give it to them.

370
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,958
[NAGIRA] So you have no
idea what kind of power

371
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,083
this thing actually contains?

372
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:17,291
I was only assigned to retrieve
the Fragment and bring it back.

373
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,166
There was no need for me
to know what was in it.

374
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,041
[NAGIRA sighs]

375
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,625
Nagira...

376
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,791
...look after it for me.

377
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:36,000
Hey, wait a minute,
this is your wild card.

378
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,875
[ROBIN]
I know that.

379
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,333
But, right now,

380
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:44,125
I know I won't be able to
keep that power in check.

381
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,666
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

382
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,375
since the coven
sank in the dark.

383
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,416
The visitor of death.

384
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,208
The nightmare of
the sacred goblet.

385
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,833
Lost hopes.

386
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:35,708
The silent hunter chuckles at
last from within the darkness.
