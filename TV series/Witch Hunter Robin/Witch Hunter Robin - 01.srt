Today's Tokyo Stock Exchange

00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,458
has exhibited an
overall downward trend.

Looks like he's on the move.

00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,166
Michael, what's
happening over there?

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,041
[MICHAEL]
Okay. I got 'im.

00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,250
[KARASUMA]
Can you confirm?

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,000
[MICHAEL] The ID system
gives me a positive.

9
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,583
I'm sure it's him.
Just like we planned.

Haruto, do you copy?

[SAKAKI] Hey, Michael,
you sound really distant.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,833
What's wrong?

16
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,833

It must be your channel.

Michael, do you read me?

20
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,958
[MICHAEL breaking up]
Yeah, but there's some static--

21

[KARASUMA]
Wait, he's here!

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,208
We'll begin as planned.

23
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,166
[KARASUMA]
Wait! He changed directions!

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,416
He's about to turn the corner

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,750
at the drugstore
in neighborhood 3.

26
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,166
[MICHAEL]
Haruto, did you catch that?

27
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,000
He's acting suspicious.

28
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,958
Hey, Haruto.

29
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,541

Get outta there! He's coming!

[MICHAEL]
No! You can't go that way!

32
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,583
Get away from there!
He must'a figured out our plan!

happened last night.

Please inform the Factory

About next year's budget.

The negotiations with
the police department

80
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,250
should be handled by
a management officer

[MICHAEL] The witch that
Amon hunted last night

88
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,291
apparently had a
partner with him.

This came out of the

That's right.

93
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,750
might have powers that
could pose a problem for us.

Well, Mr. Amon is...

Uh, he's in a meeting right now.

00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,541
[HATTORI]
Yeah, that's fine.

100
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,833
Just have her wait there then.

101
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,625
That's strange.

102
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,208
[MICHAEL]
All right, now.

103
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,750
I'll show you the
other witch's dossier.

104
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,000
Name: Yuji Higashi,
25 years old. Unemployed.

105
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,416
He met Kent Nishiyama,

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,750
the witch we nabbed last night,
about ten months ago.

107
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,416
It was down at the waterfront.

108
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,958
Oh, regarding those
problematic powers,

109
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,166
Nishiyama claims that he
got his powers from Higashi.

110
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,375
Of course, we know that's
impossible, don't we?

111
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,458
It's most likely a case
of the perpetrator

112
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,291
coming to a realization
about his powers.

113
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,000
After meeting someone
with the same abilities,

114
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,708
he simply assumed the rest.

115
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,375
So Nishiyama and Hagashi
have the same powers?

116
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,875
Looks that way.

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,791
We have to get on
his trail right away.

118
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,208
I'm afraid that he
might have gathered some

119
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,750
information about us
and how we work.

120
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,083
We have to hunt him down
before he completely vanishes.

121
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,125
All right, this hunt is
now a higher priority

122
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,708
than any other project.
So get to work.

123
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,791
Amon, come with me.

124
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,583
[GUARD]
A wonderful rendezvous.

125
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,166

00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:25,583
Do you have any idea what
time it is, Miss Dojima?

129
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,041
Who's that?

130
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,541
[GUARD] Huh? Oh, uh, she's
just a visitor for Mr. Amon.

131
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,125
Uh, could you please
remind them about her

132
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,375
when you go upstairs?

133
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,208
So Amon goes for that
kind of girl, huh?

134
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,583
[GUARD]
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,750
Come on, now.

136
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,416
If you don't hurry up
and get up there,

137
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,291
the chief is gonna
get mad at you again.

You don't have to
push me you know!

Dojima hasn't arrived yet.

141
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,291
[KARASUMA] Well, we can't
do anything about that.

142
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,833
She's special, remember?

143
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,666
[SAKAKI]
I wanna be special, too.

144
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,583
It seems as though the members'
morale is down lately.

145
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,458
Do you think it's
because we lost one?

146
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,500
[AMON]
It could be.

147
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,416
I see.

148
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,333
Apparently, Solomon has decided
to send us a replacement.

149
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,166
They've sent a replacement?

150
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,625
Six months after what happened?

151
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,916
Do you think that they
might be up to something?

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,625
We're gonna need a
little bit more data

153
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,458
in order to convince them
of Orbo's usefulness.

154
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,750
I want to keep Headquarters
out of the loop until then.

155
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,125
You need to be on
your guard, Amon.

156
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,208
I understand.

157
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,041
[phone rings]

158
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,500
Yes, it's me.

Yeah. I see.

160
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,458
The hunter that
Soloman is sending us

161
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,333
is apparently a Craft User.

162
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,125

So what's going on with her?

222

She apparently got onto
a different flight

223
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,500
than the one
headquarters told us

she would be arriving on.

as to where we are?

[SAKAKI]
Pressure level, maximum.

323
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,875
Here we go!

324
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,166
[MICHAEL] Haruto and
Miss Karasuma are on the move.

325
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,958
Timing is according to plan.

326
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,416
How is it over there?

327
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,208
[AMON]
I'm on schedule as well.

328
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,166
We'll proceed as planned.

329
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,958
[MICHAEL]
Amon went in. Where are you?

330
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,500
Haruto and I are
just about to go in.

331
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,166
[MICHAEL]
Be careful.

332
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,041
Something's knawing on
my brain a little bit.

333
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,375
We're makin' a pretty bold move,

334
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,791
but there's no reaction
from the witch at all yet.

335
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,958
It's a little strange.

336
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,000
What about this isn't strange?

337
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:17,791
Ready?

338
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

339
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,208
[SAKAKI yelps]

340
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,416
[AMON]
What's wrong?!

341
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
[MICHAEL]
I don't know!

342
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,583
He's somewhere around
the rear pillar!

343
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,791
It's nothing, really.

344
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
My feet just
slipped in the sand.

345
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,875
[MICHAEL] Haruto, don't
scare me like that!

346
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,500
A Craft.

347
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,125
[WITCH B]
Idiots...

348
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,583
The ancient tree of Yil
dictates true power.

349

[gasps]

351
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,291
The Orbo isn't working!

352
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,750
A Craft.

353
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,083
[WITCH B]
Yil!

354
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,916

[ROBIN]
Hm?

358
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,916
The ring of Ogam, and the
eight letters of Hagall.

359
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,458
But, this is incomplete.

360
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:53,333
[sniffs]

361
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,625
Wait are you--

362
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,333
[ZAIZEN] How about we
just have her show us

363
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:03,666
how a real Craft Master
does it back in their homeland.

364
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
[WITCH B]
Yil!

365
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,916
[WITCH B growls]

00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,166
What?!

What the...?!

368
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,833
[AMON]
A Craft User?!

369
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
[AMON]
The replacement...

370
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,583
It appears that the result
of the ring of Ogam

371
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,541
has been rewritten into Sig.

372
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,291
This is my field.

373
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:45,125
[growls, yells]

Damn you all!

[grunts]

[gasps]

380
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,625
Looks like the brain
distortion value

381
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,375
is below the red line.

382
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,583
Michael, you can let
the Factory guys in now.

383
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,250
Okay?

384
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,458
So I guess you must
be the replacement.

385
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,125
What exactly are you doing?

386
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,250
[KARASUMA] Unlike our
friends at headquarters,

387
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,291
we capture witches
without killing them.

388
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,416
I guess that makes us humane.

389
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,666
You capture?

390
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,458
And I believe that we
have gotten ourselves

391
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,708
someone special
as a replacement.

392
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,416
Isn't that right, Amon?

393
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,708
Amon?

394
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,291
Could you use your power
a little bit more efficiently?

395
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,041
[gasps]

396
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,541
It's a pain in the neck
putting out fires.

397
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,375
[KARASUMA]
Amon, wait a minute.

398
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,416
[KARASUMA]
I'm sorry he's like that.

399
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,333
[ROBIN] It seems that
the seeds of the Craft

400
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:18,375
have been planted on
this land after all.

401
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,000
[KARASUMA]
What are you doing?

402
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,291
Let's get going.

403
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,083
[ROBIN]
Uh, Sure.

404
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,041
I would like to welcome
you to the STNJ.

405
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,041
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

406
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,000
since the coven
sank in the dark.

407
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,583
Witch. Awaken power.

408
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,916
Bounds of jurisdiction.

409
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,291
Cannot turn a blind
eye on to those

410
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:36,583
infatuated by unforgiven power.
