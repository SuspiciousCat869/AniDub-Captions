Is it a rush?

[NAGIRA] Yeah, I've heard
something about that.

You mean the old lady that
people used to think

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,166
was immortal.

Yeah.

Oh, c'mon now, is that
all the information

43

that you've got for me?

44

Just give me a second.

45
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,625
Well, then how about
the fact that the old woman

46
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,458
happened to be
a pretty good informant

47
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,833
when it came to witches?

48
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,625
[NAGIRA]
She wasn't just "pretty good."

49
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,625
Rumor has it that the old lady
knew everything

50
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,208
that there was to know
about witches and then some!

51
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,458
Yeah, well after the
old woman finally gave up

52
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,541
the ghost, it seems
she left a little thing

53
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,500
called the Fragment of Wisdom.

54
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,500
The Fragment of Wisdom?

55
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,416
What the hell is
that supposed to be?

Who knows?

57
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,916
But the rumor around
town is that Solomon

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,166
is looking for it...

59
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
--[NAGIRA] Solomon?!
--Ugh.

00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,875
This isn't some
sort of hoax, is it?

61
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,416
I told you before,
it's just a rumor.

62
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,000
Well then, if Solomon
is actually looking

63
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,500
for this thing...

64
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,666
Does that mean it has
information on witches?

65
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,541
If something like that
were to fall into their hands...

real messy real fast.

interested, aren't you?

of you this time.

But you're gonna
have to work a little

before I pay you for it.

What do you mean, "work"?

73
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,333
I want you to go
and find out for me where

74
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,625
that little Fragment
of Wisdom is now.

then the story ends here.

who sells information.

94
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,291
Do you remember the Walled City?

95
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,375
You know, that area where we
hunted that witch a while back?

96
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,708
Well, it seems
that there have been

97
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,208
quite a few murders there
in the past few days.

98
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,458
So you think it
might be a witch?

99
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,583
[MICHAEL] Turns out, one of
the victims just happened to be

100
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,125
on our list.

101
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,416
So, we looked up
the other ones, too...

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,708
So what? Some of
the others are witches?

103
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,625
[SAKAKI]
No, more like all of them.

104
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,958
All of 'em?!

105
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,041
C'mon, you guys make it
sound like the witches are

106
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,083
out there fighting each
other or something!

107
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,750
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Chances are
that's what's happening.

108
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,166

114

00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,666
But I have to...

116
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,541
[ROBIN]
It's gone...

[pantin]

119
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,625
You mean that someone
else is looking for it, too?

120
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
[SUZUKI] There's something
bad going down.

121
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,333
It's better you stay out of it!

122

Who is it?!

123

[SUZUKI]
Are you sure?

124
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,208
[NAGIRA]
Spit it out!

125
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,541
All right, then,
I'm gonna tell you...

126
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,166
It's the Professor.

127
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,708
The Professor?

128
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,750
And there seems
to be a few other people

129
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,375
that are after it, too.

130
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,666
So it's not just Solomon,

131
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,708
but it looks like the
ever-cautious Professor

132
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,000
is on the move as well...

133
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,000
I guess that means
this thing is pretty important.

134
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,833
Hey, let's leave
this one alone, okay?

135
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,041
There are rumors flying around

136
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,250
that people are
dying for this...

137
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,833
They're dying for it?

138
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,500
You mean they're
killing each other?

139
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,916
I'm sure the allies
betrayed one another.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,416
What do you mean, "allies"?

141
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,541
'Cause from what I've heard,

142
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,500
the Professor always
works by himself.

143
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,750
Well, that's true enough--

144
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,125
In any case, just keep up
the investigation.

145
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,750
That's easy for you to say--

146
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,000
And in return, I'll be very
generous with your reward.

147
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,333
Well, okay then. All right...

148
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,708
[NAGIRA]
See ya.

150

[KARASUMA] Hey, Michael, I read
that report from this morning...

151
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,916
Maybe we should
check out this case

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,916
and see if there's anything--

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,916
[MICHAEL]
I can hear you.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,833
Yeah, the Walled City

155
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,208
I guess you got a point.

156
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,541
But isn't it too dangerous
to go in alone?

157
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,416
I'm just gonna go over there and
see how things are going.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,458
[MICHAEL] I see... In that
case, I'll retrieve the data.

159
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,958
I appreciate it.

00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,250
I guess the rumors
about people dying

162
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,333
for this are true after all.

163
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,375
Well, Professor, it's
not like you to be in

164
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,500
such a rush to get something.

165
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,958
[knocking]

166
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,125
Who is it?

167
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,458
[NAGIRA]
It's me. Can I come in?

168
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,333
Oh, sure.

169
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,875
[ROBIN]
What is it?

170
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,125
There was something that I
wanted to ask you about...

171
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,291
About a month
and a half ago now,

172
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,583
a certain old lady died
in the Walled City area.

173
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,166
[gasps]

174
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,625
I see, then...

175
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,250
So they were watching
her after all.

176
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,041
But how did you
manage to find out about

177
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,625
that old woman's death?

178
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,625
It wasn't that hard--there
were all those insane rumors

179
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,916
going around that she was
immortal and would never die...

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,083
But even if it
turned out she was a witch,

181
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,833
I wouldn't put much
stock in those rumors.

182
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,541
Anyway, that's beside the point.

183
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,375
The problem now is
that after she died,

184
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,708
she left behind something
called the Fragment of Wisdom.

185
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,833
The Fragment of Wisdom?

186
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,250
Yeah. And because of that thing,

187
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,958
the Walled City is a bit
of a mess right now.

188
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,166
So I was wondering if
you'd heard anything about it.

189
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,875
Nothing...

190
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,166
Being sworn to secrecy.

191
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,166
Don't tell me that you're still
tied down to that syndicate.

192
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,125
Never mind, then.

193
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,750
I don't have to hear
about it from you,

194
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,500
I'll just look for it myself.

195
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,041
Sorry to have bothered you.

196
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,041
How did you hear about it?

197
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,875
I've heard that Solomon
is looking around

198
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,375
for this thing as well.

199
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,875
[ROBIN gasps]

200
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,666
I can't just let myself stand
by and watch as people are

201
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,458
being killed and not
do anything about it.

202
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,250
[ROBIN]
The Fragment of Wisdom...

203
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,041
[ROBIN]
The Secrets of the Craft...

204
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,375
She clearly knows
something about all of this.

205
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,083
This could turn
out to be a bigger case

206
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,958
than I had imagined...

207
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,291
[gasps]

208
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,875
[HANAMURA]
Oh, good morning.

209
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,833
Where's Nagira?

210
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,250
Hey, what's with the hairdo?

211
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,583
Well...

212
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,125
I really don't think
he's come in yet today.

213
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,708
[DOJIMA]
Hey, where's Miho?

214
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,958
[SAKAKI]
Dunno...

215
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,041
She went to go
check out the Walled City.

216
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,458
She went to the Walled City?

217
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,875
[SAKAKI]
She checkin' out the murders?

218
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,125
[MICHAEL]
Yeah.

219
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,708
--[DOJIMA] Hmm?
--[SAKAKI] You forgot already?

220
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,625
We were just talking
about it yesterday...

221
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,291
Oh, you mean the
place where the witches

222
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,666
are fighting each other...

223
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,541
Unbelievable...

224
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,000
[DOJIMA] Hmm, but is
she gonna be all right

225
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,958
going in there by herself?

226
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,458
[NAGIRA]
A guy who knows where

227
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,583
the Fragment of
Wisdom is located?

228
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,083
[SUZUKI]
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,250
[giggles]

230
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,333
Right. So tell me-- what
happened to your face, anyway?

231
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,458
My face? What?

232
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,083
It's no big deal.

233
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,541
I just had
a little girl trouble.

234
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,000
Anyway, what do you wanna do?

235
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,541
Do you wanna meet him?

236
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,708
Huh.

237
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,791
All right, then. Let's go
ahead and do this thing.

238
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,541
But if it's a hoax, you're
gonna need some more band-aids.

239
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,833
Huh?

240
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,458
What? This is no hoax,
trust me on this one.

241
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,166
And spare me from your wrath!

242
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,916
[guffaws]

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,541
[phone ringing]

244
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,500
[HANAMURA]
Well, that's strange...

245
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,125
He's not picking up...

246
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:53,250
Usually he calls to
check in with me at least...

247
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,875
I don't have to
hear about it from you,

248
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,041
I'll just look for it myself.

249
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,708
I can't just let myself
stand by and watch as people are

250
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,583
being killed and
not do anything about it.

251
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,250
I'm going to go look for him.

252
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,583
What? Look for him?

253
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,708
Do you mean to say
you know where he went?

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,625
[ROBIN]
I don't really know...

255
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,375
...for sure.

256
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,916
But on the other hand...

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,416
...I do.

258
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,291
What does she mean by that?

259
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
Is this it?

260
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,208
[NAGIRA] Is this where I'm
supposed to meet this guy?

261
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,458
[PROFESSOR]
That's right.

262
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,708
[NAGIRA gasps]

263
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,958
The Professor...

264
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,208
I see now.

265
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,666
So you're the one
who invited me here.

266
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,208
[NAGIRA]
Tch. That idiot...

267
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,458
[PROFESSOR] You have a sensitive
nose for sniffing things out.

268
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
However...

269
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,250
It seems you're
not quite as aware

270
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,500
when it comes to matters
concerning your own life.

271
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,708
[NAGIRA]
Ugh!

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,375
[ROBIN]
Michael...

273
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,500
Michael...

274
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,666
Huh?

275
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,958
[ROBIN]
Are you're there, Michael?

276
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,291
Robin...

277
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,125
--Are you in there?
--[ROBIN] Be careful!

278
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,166
Act as if nothing's going on.

279
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,541
[MICHAEL groans]

280
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,958
This well seems to have a lot
more to it than I thought.

281
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,875
Anyway, what have you
been doing for the past month?

282
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,208
[ROBIN]
I'm sorry...

283
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,208
I was worried about
all of you, but...

284
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,791
Yeah, I understand...

285
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,166
Although, I'm not sure what's
going on around here nowadays.

286
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,416
So, what is it
you'd like me to do?

287
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,625
[ROBIN]
Huh?

288
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,833
You took a big risk
coming here to see me.

289
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,791
So tell me what
I can do for you.

290
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,208
About the Walled City?

291
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,458
You mean that guy really
went in there to try to find out

292
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,166
about the missing witches?

293
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,541
[ROBIN]
Most likely.

294
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,291
That's probably not the
safest thing for him to do.

295
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,333
It looks like there's
a huge war going on

296
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,000
between all the witches
in the Walled City.

297
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,666
There's a war?

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,500
It's about the secrets...

299
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,666
Michael, do you
think you can track down

300
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,083
his current location?

301
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,958
I'm searching for
him right now.

302
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,166
[ROBIN] I'm sure he has
his cellphone on him.

303
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,666
Maybe you can trace that.

304
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,250
Well, that's
not impossible, but...

305
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,875
This place is like a rat's nest,

306
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,458
it's a maze of
buildings and alleyways.

307
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,666
Even so, if someone
with one of our terminals

308
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,375
was nearby the place,
I could track him

309
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,333
using their connection...

310
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,666
That's right, Miss Karasuma!

311
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,541
She was headed
that way earlier this afternoon.

312
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,666
If she's still there,

313
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,791
I should be able to
use her terminal.

314
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,125
Robin, what's that person's ID?

315
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,208
It's really hot down here.

316
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,875
Do you think you could at least
turn on the air conditioning?

317
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,958
So you're still trying
to play the wise-guy.

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,291
I did a little bit
of research on you...

319
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,750
It looks like I was completely
mistaken in thinking

320
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,958
that you knew anything
about this matter.

321
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,875
It's vexing how you made me
waste my valuable time.

322
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,083
[NAGIRA chuckles weakly]

323
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,375
You contemptable fool.

324
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,750
[gasps]

325
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,583
A woman?

326
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,125
[PROFESSOR snarls]

327
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,333
What's that?!

328
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,125
[gasps]

329
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,625
[gasps

330
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,375
[ROBIN]
Nagira...

331
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,166
[ROBIN]
Impossible...

332
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,250
[NAGIRA]
That's hot!

333
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,625
[NAGIRA grunts]
Forget it.

335
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,166
[NAGIRA]
Thanks...

336
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,750
It's nothing...

337
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:06,416
[NAGIRA grunts] I gotta say your
powers are pretty impressive.

338
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,791
Must be pretty nice
to be a hunter.

339
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,708
That guy you just
killed--the Professor--

340
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,833
he happened to be the most
powerful witch around here.

341
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,458
And you were able to
take care of him so easily!

342
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,750
[ROBIN]
I didn't.

343
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,166
[NAGIRA]
Hm?

344
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,166
That was a power that
was not controlled by my will.

345
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,333
I didn't intend to send
that much power out.

346
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,916
[ROBIN gasps]
The secrets...?

347
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,208
[NAGIRA]
What's that thing?

348
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,250
[ROBIN] This is the deepest
knowledge of the craft

349
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,541
that was given to
me by Methuselah.

350
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,833
It's the Secrets of the Craft.

351
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,500
The Secrets of the Craft?

352
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,375
And, most probably,
it's the Fragment of Wisdom.

353
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,875
What?!

354
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,416
You mean you had the Fragment
of Wisdom this whole time?

355
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,208
Dammit, what the hell
have I been doing then?!

356
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,208
[ROBIN]
I'm sorry...

357
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,708
Wait a second.

358
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,958
If the secret that you have in
your hand there really is

359
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,541
the Fragment of Wisdom,
then the power you just used...

360
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh. I get it now...

361
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,083
So that's the reason they
were killing each other--

362
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,583
to get their hands
on that dried-up stick.

363
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,875
Solomon...

364
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,750
Robin.

365
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,750
I was just thinking about
something.

366
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:19,958
The reason that you
were being chased

367
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,958
by the guys from Solomon...

368
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,416
Do you think it might
actually have been

369
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,208
because of that thing?

370
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:21,333
[NARRATOR] Three hundred and
twenty years have passed

371
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,000
since the coven
sank in the dark.

372
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,000
Forbidden knowledge.

373
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,916
Endless Remorse.

374
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,500
One ideal.

375
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,583
Those without a future aren't
even allowed to think now.
