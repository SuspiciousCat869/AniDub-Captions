1
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,500
[ROBIN]
A witch...

2
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,375
[DOJIMA] Maybe Amon was
the one that hunted Kate?

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,208
Amon...?

4
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,750
So you're simply a human being?

5
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,583
Just another descendant
of Saturn, not hing more?

6
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,625
I'm leaving Japan today, and I
doubt that I will see you again.

7
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,666
[AMON]
I'm sorry.

8
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,875
What the heck do ya think
you're staring at, buddy?

9
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,541
[GUARD] Unless you
got some business here,

10
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,833
you better beat it.

11
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,375
I'm gonna call the cops if you
don't get outta here right--

12
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,625
What the hell was that about?

13
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,333
Yes, I've heard.

14
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,250
I can't believe they
went off on their own...

15
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,250
You do understand
that this office is not

16
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,041
some sort of hostel, right?

17
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,291
[KARASUMA] Yes, of course, but
Robin was assaulted last night!

18
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,583
[KOSAKA]
Yes, I know that.

19
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,416
But does she have to stay here?

20
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,625
I don't want you dragging
the rest of the office

21
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,875
--into this mess.
--How could you?!

22
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,875
In any case, you're gonna have
to deal with this problem.

23
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,041
I don't wanna know
anything about it.

24
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,125
He's just avoiding
responsibility.

25
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,125
Hey, do you have any idea what
happened to the food I had here?

26
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,333
Oh, that's right, what
about Robin's breakfast?

27
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,625
That's right! I forgot!

28
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,333
I have a feeling
she's doing just fine.

29
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,500
[SAKAKI, KARASUMA]
Hm?

30
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,791
I see. Maybe our concern
was a little wasted.

31
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:03,916
[SAKAKI]
Mm.

32
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,250
You mean the STNJ?!

33
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,875
Well, this is the first time
that I've ever heard about it.

34
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:26,125
I understand. In that case,
just give me a little more time.

35
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,375
Yeah...

36
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,500
[MICHAEL] After analyzing
that bullet from Robin,

37
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,000
I was able to narrow it down
to these three suspects.

38
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,166
But I've reached my limit.

39
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
[KARASUMA]
Why's that?

40
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,458
[MICHAEL] These three guys
are part of an elite class

41
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,333
of hunters and their
info is heavily classified.

42
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,000
There's some really
nasty file protection.

43
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,291
I've tried my best,
but that's as much as I can get.

44
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,083
[SAKAKI] But don't we need to
get the rest of their info?

45
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,333
It's not that
important actually.

46
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,625
But, if we could just
figure out whether or not

47
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,041
any of them had entered
Japan recently,

48
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,208
then maybe then we could...

49
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,208
Oh, is that the only
thing stopping you?

50
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
[GROUP]
Huh?

51
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,000
[KOSAKA] So tell me, how far
back do you want to go?

52
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,333
Well, I'd say probably
about two or three years...

53
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,166
But getting info on
hunters, even at HQ--

54
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,916
Oh, hello there.
It's me, Kosaka.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
Sorry to bother you,
but can I speak to Takahashi

56
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,208
in the second
investigation unit?

57
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,833
You guys are
obviously not giving

58
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,166
the Japanese police
force enough credit.

59
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,208
Oh, is that you, Takahashi?
Yes, it's me.

60
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,791
I-I'm sorry to call so
suddenly like this,

61
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,125
but I have something I'd
like you to look up for me.

62
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,625
[KOSAKA laughs]

63
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,750
Yeah, you sure got that right.

64
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,625
This morning?

65
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,541
Yes. He arrived before the
normal visiting hours,

66
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,500
but he was just so insistent.

67
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,833
This way.

68
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,125
[gasps]

69
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,708
This visitor...
He didn't mention his name?

70
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,291
[MALE NURSE]
No...

71
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,333
But he was a very tall, slightly
ominous-looking sort of person.

72
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,666
[ZAIZEN]
Hmm...

73
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,250
[MALE NURSE] Oh, was that
a mistake? I'm sorry.

74
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,625
No, it's all right.
Thanks anyway.

75
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,916
[MALE NURSE]
You're welcome.

76
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,375
Amon...

77
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,125
[ZAIZEN sighs]

78
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,458
You must hate me right now...

79
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,708
It's not as if I've been
a very dutiful

80
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,166
or protective father
to you recently.

81
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,583
[ROBIN]
Oh, that's right, that letter.

82
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
[ROBIN gasps]

83
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,250
I just... can't do it now...

84
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,791
[phone ringing]

85
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,583
[ZAIZEN]
It's me.

86
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:35,791
All right, then. I'll pretend
that I didn't see any of it.

87
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,333
But that is merely
the STNJ's way...

88
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,166
[KOSAKA]
Is this the guy?

89
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,458
He's got a different
name and face,

90
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,458
but, yeah, the DNA
looks like an exact match.

91
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,666
Efgeny Kitaenko. It says
here that he was born

92
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,666
in St. Petersburg, Russia.

93
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,583
Looks like he entered
Japan about two years go.

94
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,875
Two years ago?
I wonder if he's still here.

95
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,875
It's highly unlikely he's gone.

96
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,166
There's no record
of him leaving.

97
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,750
So then, can we trace his path?

98
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,250
I thought I already told
you not to underestimate

99
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,625
the power of the police force.

100
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,625
Just leave it to me.

101
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,416
I'm friends with all
the guys who handle

102
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,458
the illegal immigrants.
Don't worry about a thing.

103
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,625
Could you give us a breakdown
of all your friends right away?

104
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,833
Huh?

105
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,291
W-Well, I guess so...

106
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,083
I would really appreciate it.

107
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,208
It's imperative that we
find this guy quickly

108
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,291
before he has a chance to act.

109
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,708
Karasuma and Sakaki, you guys
should stay here at the office.

110
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,291
We have to make sure we look
after Robin, too, you know.

111
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,208
[BOTH]
Uh. Right...

112
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,333
--[DOJIMA] Let's go.
--[KOSAKA] U-Uh?

113
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,875
Now, Chief, I know
this might be tough,

114
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,083
but I'm sure you'll do fine.

115
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:47,208
[KOSAKA]
U-Uh... Hey, take it easy...

116
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,333
[GUARD]
Let's see, Virgo today.

117
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,833
Watch out for guests
wearing black... Hmmm...

118
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,583
[GUARD]
Miss Robin!

119
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,750
It's all right,
you can come on out.

120
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,250
Your guest--
he's waiting for you.

121
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,291
[KOBARI]
I heard what happened from Amon.

122
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,875
So I thought I'd come by
and check up on you.

123
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,750
[ROBIN]
From Amon?

124
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,750
He told me that,
unfortunately, Miss Touko

125
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,833
is still in a coma,
but there's no need to worry.

126
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:34,416
He assured me that Miss Touko
will make a complete recovery.

127
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,541
[gasps]

128
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,583
I'm sorry... It's just...

129
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,708
I don't understand...

130
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,166
Amon was...

131
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,625
[KOBARI]
That's no good.

132
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,791
When you don't trust in someone,
then you can't do your best.

133
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:00,125
Listen. Mr. Amon is
a man you can believe in.

134
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,708
He will never betray anyone...

135
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,083
So you must trust him, Robin.

136
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,541
[KOBARI] Now then, I brought you
a special treat to cheer you up.

137
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,458
I made it myself.

138
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,583
[gasps]

139
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,500
You'd better eat it
while it's still warm.

140
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,791
[DOJIMA]
Hey, Michael? It's me.

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,125
It's from Miss Dojima.

142
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,500
[MICHAEL]
Yeah?

143
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,708
[HATTORI]
Huh?

144
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,791
[MICHAEL]
Just as we thought... And?

145
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,166
What? The guy was murdered?

146
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,625
Wait a minute, then you're
saying he was killed

147
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,583
two years ago, right after
he came into the country?

148
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,708
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

149
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,250
I even looked through all
the autopsy reports as well...

150
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,500
And the coroner's DNA data
matched his exactly.

151
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,083
[MICHAEL]
But then, what's going on here?

152
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,958
Michael, I hate to
say this, but there was

153
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,541
one other person that could
use that bullet, right?

154
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,250
One other person?

155
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,416
It's Amon.

156
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,333
[MICHAEL]
Well, yeah, I guess so...

But that's impossible!

158

Why would Amon do such a thing?

159
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,708
[KARASUMA] I dunno...
But I've been thinking about it.

160
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,916
Maybe we're just in denial
and we're unwilling

161
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,416
to realize the truth
about all of this.

162
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,375
There's a single
undeniable fact about Kate.

163
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,166
She was hunted
by someone close to us.

164

And if so, then who?

[ROBIN]
No! That can't be true!

Why not?!

00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,083

so sure I'm wrong?

[ROBIN grunts]

169

you might want to defend him.

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,000
But... where has
Amon disappeared to?

171
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,166
We haven't seen him
at all since yesterday.

They've come.
They're here to hunt you.

It's been decided that

Come on!

[ROBIN] Amon, are you
the one who hunted down

00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:59,458
the person that I replaced?
The other craft user?

236
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,291
[AMON] That's right.
I was the one who hunted Kate.

237
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,833
She had tried to expose
the secrets of the STNJ...

238
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,625
...in order to satisfy
her own greed.

239
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,750
No, that's not it.
That's not the whole truth.

240
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,791
She betrayed us to
try to escape from herself.

241
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,166
Kate knew, even while she
was losing her mind

242
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,458
that she had become unable
to control her power--

243
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,791
the power of her Craft...

244
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,333
That meant that someday,

245
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,958
she'd be hunted down
as a witch herself.

246
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,416
She couldn't bear
the thought of that,

247
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,916

one of your colleagues...

249

The truth is...

250
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,041

that you actually trusted in me

316
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,208
[LAB 15C] The network is
now a standalone system.

317
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,291
[GUY 15A] I'd like to get this
shift change finished quickly...

318
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,750
[LAB 15B] Take the security
system bus offline.

319
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,958
[LAB 15A] I'm listening
for the shift change.

320
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,333
First off, thanks for
all your hard work.

321
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,041
I'm glad no one got hurt.

322
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,791
[GUY 15A]
Thank you very much.

323
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,375
[AMON]
This wasn't...

324
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,000
a hunt...?

325
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:15,291
[footsteps echoing]

326
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,208
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

327
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,458
since the coven
sank in the dark.

328
00:25:55,541 --> 00:26:00,000
A detached past...
An unknown future...

329
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,250
The sealed present...

330
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,958
The forgotten past keeps
whispering the words

331
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,208
of darkness in a dry cage.
