Zaizen started now?

did you learn

about Zaizen at headquarters?

00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,041
[AMON]
Hmm...

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,333
Do you know his intentions?

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,291
I thought it was to hunt
witches using Orbo.

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,208
Well, that's only half of it.

13
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,791
[AMON]
Hmm?

14
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,458
[DOJIMA] His real objective is
to develop a new type of Orbo

15
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,291
that would allow an ordinary
human to hunt witches.

16

[gasps]

17
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,666
It's true.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,833
Zaizen's working
on it as we speak.

19
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,333
[AMON]
Now that you mention it,

20
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,083
there has been a sudden
spike in Factory activity.

21
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,458
[DOJIMA]
You've been watching?

22
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,166
[AMON]
I keep my eye on them.

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,125
[DOJIMA]
Hmm...

24
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,083
There's something about this
I still don't understand.

25
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,375
Why would headquarters
be afraid of this?

26
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:18,291
It seems to me that using
normal humans to hunt Witches

27
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,375
is right in line with
Solomon's ideology.

28
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,166
Are you gonna stake them out?

29
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,750
[DOJIMA] We need to find out for
sure whether or not the Factory

30
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:32,875
has started using Orbo that can
be used by normal humans.

31
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,000

[MICHAEL]
It looks like there was

54
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,750
an intensive genetic
research program

55
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,833
being conducted at Solomon
HQ's special R&amp;D facility.

56
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,916
[SAKAKI]
At Solomon?

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,875
[KARASUMA] Yes, but over the
past few years, there's been

58
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,791
a huge boom in genetic
research all over the world.

59
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,125
It's hardly surprising
that an organization


60
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,666
with Solomon's financial muscle
got involved in it as well.


61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,250
Only if their goal was the same
as other research agencies.

62
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,208
What do you mean?

63
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,833
[MICHAEL]
Apparently, Solomon succeeded

64
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,208
in mapping the human genome
more than five years

65
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,833
before any other research
agency could do it.

66
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,958
However, it turns out
that their research project

67
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,833
was disbanded right
after the discovery

68
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,833
and their findings were
never published.

69
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,958
That order came
from Solomon, right?

70
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,416
I can understand why they
wanted to go public,

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,375
but why was the project
itself suddenly aborted?

72
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,000
See, strange isn't it?

73
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,750
You think it's related to Orbo?

74
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,500
Bingo! That's exactly
what I was thinking!

75
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,125
[KARASUMA]
So let me get this straight.

76
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,875
What you're saying, Michael, is
that headquarters attacked us

77
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,791
because they don't approve
of Orbo development, right?

78
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
It's not like I have
any hard evidence,

79
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,416
but after digging around
here and there,

80
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
I have to come
to that conclusion.

81
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,625
[KARASUMA] But I still don't
understand what would make them

82
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,625
hate the very idea of Orbo?

83
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:41,958
Beats me.

84
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,125
But if you think about it,
we use Orbo all the time

85
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,750
for hunting even though we
don't really know what it is.

86
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,958
I never really thought
about that before.

87
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,416
[KARASUMA]

--[SAKAKI] Hm?
--[MICHAEL] Huh?

90

I was...

91
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,875
I was just thinking that
if it really was HQ

92
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,541
that attacked us that day,

93
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,041
then they think the
Orbo is dangerous

94
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,041
and they'll probably go to any
length to stop us from using it.

Hey, stop that.

00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,750
We believe that the
character of the test subject

160
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,541
is rejecting the
lingering traces

161
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,375
of Witch individuality
present in the Orbo.

162
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,416
This causes the symptoms
we have seen to manifest.

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,291
[ZAIZEN] Is there any
way to confirm this?

164
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,833
[TECH] Not unless we are able to
get a little more clinical data.

165
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,958
So you're saying that we should
continue our human testing.

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,458
Humans aren't the
same as Witches.

167
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,833
But, sir--

168
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,500
[ZAIZEN] At any rate,
I'll have to give the order

169
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,833
to restrict Orbo usage to known
safe levels for the time being.

170
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,375
Even with the lower levels,
our results ought to be enough

171
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,708
to shut up the skeptics that
keep raising such a stink.

172
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, sir.

173
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
If you'll excuse me...

174
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,541
[ZAIZEN grunts]

175
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,916
I should get back to work.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,666
I can't afford to
waste any more time

177
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,958
dealing with this matter either.

178
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,000
[NAGIRA]
So tell me.

179
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,333
Do you still hate Dad as much?

180
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,500
[AMON]
Our father?

181
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,708
I'd be lying if I said
that I wasn't bitter,

182
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,708
but I suppose you can't
really hold a grudge

183
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,500
for years against a man
you've never even seen.

184
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,291
I'd forgotten all about him
until you brought him up.

185
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,833
So you're angry with
your mother, then?

186
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,875
I'll be honest with you, she was
a complete stranger to me,

187
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,625
but from what I did
know of her she

188
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,583
seemed like a pretty nice lady.

189
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,500
Even if she was a Seed.

190
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,375
Is it because

191
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,708
the man your mother
chose to be your father

192
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,750
happened to be a Witch?

193
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,666
[AMON]
She was...

194
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,750
She was always kind to me.

195
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:09,000
The life of a Seed never
really seemed that bad.

196
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,333
Even if my father wasn't there,

197
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,041
it was enough as long
as she was with me.

198
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,833
But I was wrong.

199
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,833
[NAGIRA]
That little incident, huh?

200
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,541
[AMON]
Yes...

201
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,500
My mother awakened as a Witch.

202
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,541
And she did it right in
front of my very eyes.

203
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,583
And after that day,

204
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,750
I just couldn't get
through to her anymore.

205
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,625
And that's why you
hate your mother.

206
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,708
No, that's why you hate all
witches in general don't you.

207
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,291
[AMON]
I doubt you'd understand.

208
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,041
How could you possibly
understand the fear of her blood

209
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,458
that's lying dormant inside me.

210
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:45,791
It could awaken at any moment,
just like hers did.

211
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,291
Because I'm human
I can't understand?

212
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,208
Witches, Seeds,
whatever you call 'em,

213
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,625
they keep showin' up at my door

214
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,708
for some reason one
right after another,

215
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,458
and of all the ones
that have come to me,

216
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,000
none of them look
any different than humans.

217
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,250
Besides, I'm your bother
and I have Dad's blood

218
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,666
pumping in me, just
the same as you.

219
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,291
It's not as simple
a thing as saying,

220
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,000
"That person's a witch"
and "this person isn't one."

221
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,208
Your mother chose Dad
as much as he chose her.

222
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,125
So doesn't that prove
to you just how much

223
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,416
she was really in
love with the guy?

224
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,166
[NAGIRA] So... What are you
gonna do about the girl?

225
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,250
Remember now,
you were the one

226
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,250
who asked me to help
her in the first place.

227
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,583
That's why I hired
her as a messenger.

228
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:34,291
I thought you'd
finally realized that.

229
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,958
[AMON] The situation
has changed since then.

230
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,583
[NAGIRA]
What situation?

231
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,916
[AMON]
You see...

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,791
There's a secret that Robin
knows that we don't.

233
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,875
A secret, huh?

234
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,791
So that's the reason you've
stayed hot on her trail.

235
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,166
But I have a funny feeling

236
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,625
that Robin doesn't know
what that secret is herself.

237
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,458
[AMON]
Just as I thought...

238
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,166
[NAGIRA]
What's making you hesitate?

239
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,666
They're hunting her.

240
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,916
Solomon is chasing Robin
and she doesn't know why.

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,875
In order to hunt her, I have
to know about everything.

242
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,833
I need to know the truth.

243
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,833
[NAGIRA] Assuming you
find out this "truth,"

244
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,541
would you be able to hunt her?

245
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,958
Forget it.

246
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,541
With her power, you're nowhere
near a match for Robin.

247
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,958
Yes, I know that!

248
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,208
But it doesn't matter.
I have to find the answer.

249
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,666
[NAGIRA]
Hmph.

250
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,666
Get goin'.

251
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,875
Robin's too much
for me to handle now.

252
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,083
I'm givin' her back to you.

253

Uh. Hey, wait a minute, what
do you think you're doing?!

257
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,833
You're tailing Amon, right?

258
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,416
Wrong answer.

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,666
Too bad. I guess you can't trust
a lawyer's intuition, either.

260
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,625
Hey, cut me some slack!

261
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,083
Well, where are you going then?

262
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,750
To the Factory.

263
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,166
[NAGIRA]
The Factory?

264
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,666
That's right. Does it scare you?

265
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,583
[NAGIRA]
Huh?

266
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,958
Nah, let's get outta here.

267
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,083
[SAKAKI]
I'm gonna head home now.

How about you, Ms. Karasuma?

269
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,166
I think I'm going to stay
and do a little more digging.

270
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,166
I'll see if the police
know anything about this.

271
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,000
[SAKAKI]
I don't think it'll do any good.

272
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,666
I'll check, just in case.

273
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,166
[SAKAKI]
If you say so. Well, good night.

274
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,875
See ya later, Michael.

275
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,041
[MICHAEL]
Yeah.

[tires squeal]

277
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,250
I guess I should...

278
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,083
I should go over there and
ask about that picture...

279
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,625
Nagira might have gone over
there to do some digging, too.

[gasps]

[AMON]
If you use your Craft...

286
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,041
...you could incinerate
me before I shoot.

287
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,416
Amon...

288
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,375
I can't believe you'd actually
do something this illegal.

289
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
This organization of
yours is really--

290
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,333
[DOJIMA] It's not my
organization, okay?

291
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,458
Huh?

292
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,833
[ROBIN] You saved me from
being captured back then.

293
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:45,208
[AMON] That's true, but that
may have been a mistake.

294
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,625
So you think that I'm a Witch?

295
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,166
[AMON] That's what
headquarters believes.

296
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,375
[ROBIN]
What do you believe, Amon?

297
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,750
My instructions come from
a special person at Solomon.

298
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,833
He ordered me to hunt you.

299
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,458
That person is the most
influential hunter trainer

300
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:06,083
at Solomon. He's also the man
who raised you, Juliano Colegli.

301
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,833
He was the one
who ordered the hunt.

302
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,458
You're lying...

303
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,166
[AMON]
It's not a lie.

304
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,875
Father Juliano gave
me specific orders.

305
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,416
There was no hesitation
in his voice.

306
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,541
"Robin has gained
dangerous power

through the Craft Arcanum.

00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,750
She must be hunted."

00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,541
That can't be...

310
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,458
Father would never say...

311
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,916
But that's--

312
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,708
You were the one who
took the letter Amon?

313
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,125
[AMON]
If I hadn't read this letter

314
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,708
right before they attacked
you at your apartment,

315
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,291
I might not have saved you.

316
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,250
[ROBIN]
Uh.

317
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,041
I can read it?

318
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,500
Father...

319
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,916
But, this letter is...

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,208
[AMON] A confession
to one about to die.

321
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,875
At first, I wasn't able to
understand it, either.

322
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,208
What the Father wrote in there

323
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,833
is a jumbled mix of
fear and love for you.

324
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,125
As well as regret.

325
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:11,000
Father Juliano is afraid of me?

326
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,750
But... why?

327
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,208
How could he be afraid of me?

328
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,833
[AMON] When I stood in front
of him at headquarters,

329
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,750
I could feel that
something didn't add up.

330
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,250
How could the man who
wrote you that letter be

331
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,458
the same person who
coldly explained to me

332
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,000
the need to hunt you.

333
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,791
The Arcanum has given
you a dangerous power.

334
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,666
And it's clear from that letter,

335
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,333
that the Father was
afraid of something.

336
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:39,416
But despite that,
it seemed that his fear

337
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,041
stemmed from your
very existence.

338
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,875
[ROBIN]
My existence?

339
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:48,083
I had to find out for myself
what his intentions were.

340
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,208
I tracked Toudou and
found out about your past.

341
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,541
[ROBIN]
So that Toudou person

342
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,208
has something to
do with my past?

343
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,000
[paper crinkles]

344
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,166
I'm sorry Amon, but if you
can't have faith in me...

345
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,500
...and if you honestly think

346
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,500
that I'm such a dangerous
Witch, then go ahead.

347
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,458
[ROBIN]
I have faith...

348
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,333
I have faith in
your heart, Amon.

349
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,333
[AMON grunts]

350
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,666
I suppose that is my answer.

351
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,791
That's your answer, Amon?

352
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,750
[phone rings]

353
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,083
What is it?

354
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,166
Hey, Amon. They look like
they're on the move.

355
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,125
They just drove out of the gate.

356
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,041
[AMON]
I see.

357
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,833
Try to follow them, Dojima.

358
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,166
I'll make sure to
meet up with you soon.

359
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,500
[ROBIN]
Did something happen?

360
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,916
It's the Factory.

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,666
"The Factory"?

362
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,500
[AMON]
An assault team just left.

363
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,125
You coming?

364
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,333
[DOJIMA] One of the vans split
off in a different direction.

365
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,333
The one we're following
seems to be tailing a bike.

366
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,083
I wonder if they'll keep
heading towards the coast?

367
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,625
Our location is--

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,083
[ROBIN] A technology to hunt
Witches without using hunters?

369
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,875
That's what Zaizen's
trying to do?

370
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:17,083
Solomon Headquarters is nervous
about his activities, as well.

371
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,625
If they don't need
hunters to hunt...

372
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,875
Then...

373
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,583
Hunters will...

374
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,291
[DOJIMA]
No way! Sakaki?!

375
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,541
Why is the factory after him?

376
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,750
Great. Here they come!

377
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,083
[FACTORY HUNTER 21 A groans]

378
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,375
[DOJIMA]
Robin!

379
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,208
Sakaki?

380
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,000
Why is the Factory
going after a hunter?

381
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,916
[SAKAKI groans]
That hurt...

382
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,958
[gunshots]

383
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,875
[FACTORY HUNTER 21 B grunts]

[ROBIN gasps]

385
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,916
Thanks, Amon!

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,083

[wind howls]

390
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,583
[AMON]
Wait.

391
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,000
[DOJIMA]
Why did you let them go?

392
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,958
Calm down Dojima, we know
where they came from.

393
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,166
Plus, they seemed to be
having some sort of trouble.

394
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,625
And don't forget him...

395
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,625
[DOJIMA]
Oh, yeah! That's right!

396
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,708
[NAGIRA]
Hey there.

397
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,791
[ROBIN gasps]

398
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,166
Nagira?

399
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,583
What are you--

400
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,500
I guess you two came
to an understanding.

401
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,416
[DOJIMA]
Are you okay?

402
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,291
[SAKAKI] Dammit! What
the hell was that all about?

403
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,083
That was a Factory
assault team.

404
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,208
That's exactly my point! Why
would the Factory attack me?!

405
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Come on, take it easy!
I don't know why, either!

406
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,875
Wait a sec. Dojima?

407
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,041
What on earth are
you doin' here?

408
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,375
There's Amon...

409
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,291
And Robin's here, too...

410
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,333
Hey, what the hell's
goin' on here?!

411
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,375
I'll explain it all later.

412
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,958
But the real question is why
would the Factory attack you?

413
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,166
[AMON]
Karasuma...

414
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,166
What?

415
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,833
Sakaki, where's Karasuma?

416
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,375
Huh?!

417
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,500
She said that she was gonna
be leavin' a little after me.

[ringing continues]

421
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,083
[NARRATOR] Three hundred and
twenty years have passed

422
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,958
since the coven
sank in the dark.

423
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:28,083
A broken shell.
A forbidden power.

424
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,958
A prisoner.

425
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,541
The name of the sacred
mother brings back

426
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,125
an awe carved in the darkness.
