Do you wanna come up?

Well, from the looks of things,

I'd guess that you're the one
who cleaned the place up.

[ROBIN]
Ah. Yes.

17
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,583
[TOUKO] So you're sort of
a neat freak, huh?

It's not that I like it.

You've captured the mood well.

00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,791
I was just curious, that's all.

About what kind of picture
you were painting.

[ROBIN]
Hm?

32
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,625
I was curious about you.

00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,958
It seems you're
here every morning.

34
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,500
And so I am. For a
little prayer time.

35
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,666
[SAYOKO]
For prayer?

36
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,458

Hm...

00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,083
It's sort of a habit.

39
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,875
I see. Well, I believe in Him.

40
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,291
Because He was the one who

41
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,541
brought me into such an
incredibly beautiful world.

42
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,375
[SAYOKO] And that's why
I'm preserving it like this:

43
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,958
the world as its beautiful self.

Robin.

49
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,750
Yes?

50
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,541
I've just received
a telephone message

51
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,375
from Amon about you.

52
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,583
You should memorize the
contents of these files

53
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:18,958
as soon as possible.

Files?

55
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,166
[KOSAKA] They're reference
files for unsolved crimes.

56
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,458
There are abstracts in here
for the last two years' worth.

57
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,916
Each and every one of them have
a 50 percent chance or greater

58
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,083
of a witch being the culprit.

59

[KOSAKA] I'm sure that just
seeing how the initial

60

be quite a learning experience.

[HATTORI] It wouldn't be bad if
he took her along, would it?

Well, I guess that's true.

to be his partner.

Thank you, Dojima.

to get all your work done yet?

[DOJIMA] Ugh! What's
that supposed to mean?

Of all the nerve.
As a matter of fact,

I'm doing it
right now, so there.

[KOSAKA]
Oh, really?

74
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,333
Then what's that
magazine on your desk?

75
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,166
[DOJIMA]
Well, to you it might look

76
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,083
like a fashion magazine,
Chief, but it's actually

77
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,750
reference material
for one of our cases.

78
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,125
So you don't believe me, huh?

00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,583
[MICHAEL] These cases are
all horrible, aren't they?

80
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,666
Whether the perpertrator
was a human or a witch.

81
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,166
They still happened.

82
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,166
There are people as bad
or worse than witches

83
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,458

[MICHAEL]
Hm?

86
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:00,583
Oh, that one. The
Yotsuga Lake murders.

87
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,791
Three victims, with no
discernable patterns

88
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,166
of age or occupation
or anything.

89
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,833
The only similarity
is that they all

90
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,625
bled to death from
external wounds.

91
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,416
[MICHAEL] Each of them
had several dozen wounds

92
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,750
all over their bodies from
an undetermined weapon.

93
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,333
But how they were
killed or what might

94
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,125
have led to their deaths
is still a mystery.

95
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,500
[ROBIN]
This park...

96
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,708
It's the same park I walk
through every morning

97
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,916
on my way to prayer.

98

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,708
I never would've thought

100
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,250
that something like that
could happen there.

101
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,625
[MICHAEL]
Of course not.

102
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,708
The last of the three...

103
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,375
...was a whole four months
before you got here.

104
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,750
[ROBIN] So the killer might
still be in that area.

105
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,916
[ROBIN]
A witch.

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,416
Or just some insane person.

107
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,458

find something there.

111
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,250
But how about getting some
lunch before we do it?

112
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,541
If it isn't already too late.

00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,833
Huh?

117
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,041
What I'm thinking right now.

118
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,625
Who knows?

119
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,708
Please try reading.

120
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,541
What's on my mind right now?

121
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,166
It's Amon.

00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,041
Left behind...

124
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,250
Why's it always like this?

125
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,375
That's amazing!
You're absolutely right.

126
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,833
You really can see
into people's hearts.

127
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,625
Well, that wasn't from
using any of my powers.

128
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,416
Huh?

129
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,458
Oh, that was easy
enough to see.

130
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,250
Without much help.

131
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,791
[KARASUMA] Besides, the only
things that I'm able

132
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:13,541
to read are strong feelings
left behind in objects.

133
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,041
I'm not able to see
what's happening

134
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,875
in someone's heart.

135
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,708
But you're an S-class.

136
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,958
Oh.

137
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,166
I see, so even a Craft
master's has concerns

138
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,083
about someone else's
power class?

139
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,791
I wouldn't say
I'm actually worried.

140
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,583
I believe you're an
A-class, aren't you?

141
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,333
Huh?

142
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,833
You could become one.

143
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,041
You just need to
hit your targets

144
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,541
with a bit more precision

145
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,458
That's all you'd really have
to do to become an S-class.

146
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,916
Why do you think you
can't hit your targets?

147
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,208
I'm don't know.

00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,375
for us to hang out together
in our off hours.

165
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,166
Yes, I know that, but it
doesn't really matter.

166
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,791
Might not be a bad idea.

167
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,416
[KARASUMA]
It's so peaceful...

168
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,750
I can't believe
a thing like that

169
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,083
happened right here.

170
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,875
The press made such a big deal
out of the whole thing, too.

171
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,208
They're so heartless sometimes.

172
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,583
It was just four months ago.

173
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,500
It's as if it wasn't real.

174

[gasps]

175
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,625
You know her?

176
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,833
No.

177
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,416
I just happened to talk
to her one morning.

178

[pants]

179
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,958
Well, that wasn't
incredibly productive.

180
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,250
My feet are about
ready to fall off.

181
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,041
[MICHAEL]
Robin's not here right now.

182
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,291
I think she went
to check out the

183
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,541
Yotsuga Lake Park
with Miss Karasuma.

184
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
[whistles]

185
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,583
Fancy that: speaking
of Yotsuga Lake Park.

186
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,458
[gasps]

187

[SAKAKI]
Amon?

188
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,041
Just as I thought--
there's nothing here.

189
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,666
Well, that's not surprising,

190
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,625
since the police did give it
a pretty thorough search.

191
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,416
What do you think, Karasuma?

192
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,666
Who do you think did it?

193
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,166
A psychopath? Or maybe...

194
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,416
[KARASUMA]
I'd say it was probably a witch.

195
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,166
The wounds on
the victims' bodies

196
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,375
were not inflicted
after their deaths.

197
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,833
In other words,
they were hacked up

198
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,250
while they were still alive.

199
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,833
There's no evidence to suggest

200
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,250
that they might
have been drugged

201
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,416
or tied up or
anything like that.

202
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,875
Yet there's no sign that
they resisted either.

203
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,166
Or rather, that

204
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,875
there was time enough
for them to resist.

205
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,375
Either way, I can't bring myself

206
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,666
to think of this as
just an ordinary case.

207
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,791
But that's just my opinion.

208
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,500
Either way, we might as well
have another look around.

209
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,875
[ROBIN]
Well, if it's okay,

210
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,416
I'd like to check
something out myself.

211
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,625
That's fine. I guess I'll
just have a look around

212
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,458
by myself. See ya.

That means they didn't
have her targeted at all.

253
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,625
Yes, and it also means there are

I feel a little sorry
for the victims, though.
