[KARASUMA grunts]

00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,833
Hey, Michael, it looks
like we lost Muroi.

6
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,041
Can you do anything to find him?

7
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,916
[MUROI chuckles]

8
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,458
[MUROI]
Hm?

9
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,500
Well, now who the hell are you?

10
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,375
I get it. You're one of them!

11
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,750
[growls]

12
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,375
Why--?

00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,083
[MUROI groaning]

[rustling]

15
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,750
[MICHAEL] It seems like we
haven't been on very good terms

16
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
with HQ since the attack.

17
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know what's
goin' on over there.

18
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,250
[ROBIN]
But there's nowhere else

19
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,041
that Amon could be
right now, is there?

20
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,541
Well, you may be
right about that...

21
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,458
[ROBIN] You told me before that
there was a large bloodstain on

22
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,875
the ground from where
Amon was dragged away.

23
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,750
That's true...

24
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,041
But afterward,
Karasuma and the others

25
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,208
assured me that it wasn't
enough to be life-threatening.

26
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,458
So he's at headquarters, then.

27
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,666
That is, if he's still alive.

28
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,833
[ROBIN]
Michael, you just--

29
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,333
[MICHAEL]
Shh!

30
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,958
[MICHAEL]
We're clear.

31
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:58,958
[ROBIN]
He's alive.

32
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,541
Eh?!

33
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,708
Amon just can't be dead.

34
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,875
But how can you be so sure?

35
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,541
I don't know.

36
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,958
I guess... He could...

37
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,291
But, I can't accept that.

38
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,666
I can't believe Amon
could be dead.

39
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,416
Robin...

40
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,625
I guess you have a point.

41
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,666
Heh.

42
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,083
Hey, that reminds me,

43
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,166
I came across some
interesting information

44
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,291
while I was accessing
Headquarters' Database.

45
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,958
It looks as though they're
going to be sending us

46
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,750
a new hunter very soon.

47
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,958
[ROBIN]
A replacement?

48
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,333
Not quite, I didn't
get that impression.

49
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:35,416
[ROBIN]
But you said you guys

50
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
and headquarters
weren't getting along.

51
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,666
Yeah. It's strange.

52
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,041
And as if that weren't enough,

53
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,750
the fact that I was
able to snoop out

54
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,916
that particular piece of
intel is awfully suspicious.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,083
[ROBIN]
It was intentional?

56
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,250
[MICHAEL]
Yeah... Probably.

57
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,416
Hey. Do you know anything
about a hunter named Sastre?

58
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,375
[ROBIN]
Sastre!

59
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,458
[camera clicks]

60
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,666
They said that
Muroi's been killed?

61
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,041
Other than a puncture
wound from a sharp object

62
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,958
there's apparently nothing
unusual about the body.

63
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,250
We can't get involved
in this yet.

64
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,666
[DOJIMA]
What's Michael say?

65
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,666
I've been trying to
reach him for a while.

66
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,750
He's not there?

67
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,000
That's unusual.

68
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,750
Maybe he's sleeping.

69
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,250
[KARASUMA]
We've gotta get the corpse

70
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,291
to the Factory before it gets
taken away for an autopsy.

71
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, don't look at me.

72
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,416
You know I'm no good
at that sort of thing!

73
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,791
Oh, calm down, no one's
asking you to do anything.

74
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
[DOJIMA laughs]

75
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,291
Uh.

76
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,708
[phone rings]

77
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,625
[HANAMURA] Good morning,
Nagira Law Offices.

78
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,416
May I help you?

79
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Mr. Nagira?

80
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,000
Um, I'm sorry, but he's...

81
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,083
[pachinko machines rattle]

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,875
[GAMBLER] She's an acquaintance
of yours, that right?

83
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,666
Not really.

84
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,208
All right then. I'll buy it.

85
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,583
[GAMBLER] Apparently, there
was an origami crane

86
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,416
left next to the body that
was found last night.

87
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,166
And this name was written on
the inside of that little crane.

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,625
[NAGIRA]
Hmm...

89
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,708
[ROBIN] Sastre...
Is he here to hunt me?

90
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,916
[ZAIZEN] If I understand you
correctly, you're telling me

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,916
that the Orbo's
effectiveness on humans

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,791
is still limited at this stage.

93
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,000
Based on the results
of the analysis of the

94
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,208
most recent hunt, we have
clearly observed a 30% drop

95
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,541
in efficiency in comparison to
the use of normal hunters.

96
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,500
In addition...

97
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,500
What else?

98
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,958
[TECH]
We've observed some damage

99
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,666
to certain members of the team.

100
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,708
It seems to be an unwelcome
side-effect of Orbo use.

101
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,916
Damage?

102
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,791
So we can't do without
the hunter's powers.

103
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,875
We'll need them for
a little while longer yet.

104
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,000
You're off your crutches?

105
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,416
Yeah. I'd like to say

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
that I'm back up to 100%,

107
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,250
but I guess I'm still
just a little slow.

108
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,416
Where's everybody?

109
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,291
[MICHAEL]
I think Karasuma and Dojima

110
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,125
are still working
last night's case.

111
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,583
What about the Chief
and Hattori?

112
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,166
[MICHAEL]
Beats me.

113
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,083
The two of them have been going
out of the office a lot lately.

114
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,375
[SAKAKI]
Hm?

115
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,375
[HANAMURA]
Hi, Boss. Welcome back.

116
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,083
Hey.

117
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,416
Hana, have you seen
Robin around today?

118
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,333
No, I haven't seen
that girl at all today.

119
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,291
But, since you happened
to bring her up,

120
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,750
all I hear is Robin
this and Robin that!

121
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,500
Could you stop chasing
skirts for a second

122
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,833
and do a little work?!

123
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,875
For instance, how many
cases have you personally

124
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,916
worked on these past
few days? Any of them?

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,458
The clients have been
complaining about--

126
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,333
[water running]

127
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,750
[knocking]

128
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,708
[knocking]

129
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,541
[NAGIRA]
It's me. Can I come in?

130
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,958
That was last night?

131
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,125
[NAGIRA]
Yeah.

132
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:58,791
The cops found a guy
who had been killed.

133
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:02,250
[ROBIN]
Why are you telling me this?

134
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,958
Apparently, an origami
crane was left by the body.

135
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,625
I have no idea if
this is true or not,

136
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,375
but I've heard a
rumor that your name

137
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,375
was written on the inside of
that crane for some reason.

138
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,791
[ROBIN]
It's Sastre.

139
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,666
[NAGIRA]
"Sastre"?

140
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,708
Never heard of him. Who is he?

141
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,166
A hunter from
Solomon headquarters.

142
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,666
[NAGIRA] From headquarters?
So what's he doin' here?

143
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,208
It was a message.

144
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,083
A message?

145
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,791
[ROBIN]
Yes. It's Sastre's trademark.

146
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,666
It's how he hunts down witches.

147
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,375
He hunts a witch
who's unrelated,

148
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,333
and then leaves his message.

149
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,500
"You're going to
end up like this."

150
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,708
[NAGIRA] So you're telling me
that last night's killing

151
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,833
was just his way
of saying hello?

152
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,250
Hey, wait a minute.

153
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,041
Then that must mean the
person he's really after is...

154
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,041
[NAGIRA]
Damn...

155
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,375
In any case,

156
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,875
I'm gonna go do some more
digging on this murder.

157
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,583
It's too early to get
depressed about it.

158
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,291
[ROBIN]
No doubt about it.

159
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,458
Sastre is out there.

160
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,375
[ROBIN]
I'm being... hunted...

161
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,625
The Fragment...?

162
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,916
That's it.

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,166
The Fragment is my
only hope right now.

164
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,791
[NAGIRA]
Looking for the Fragment?

165
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,125
[NAGIRA] If you had the
Fragment, then you might just

166
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,333
be able to beat that
Sastre guy, right?

167
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,125
[NAGIRA]
I see.

168
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,416
That thought had occurred
to me, too, but...

169
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,833
[NAGIRA]
I should've seen this comin'.

170
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,000
To this day, that thing
is still thought of as

171
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:33,208
the Holy Grail of
artifacts to witches.

172
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,000
[ROBIN]
It was stolen?

173
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,666
[NAGIRA]
What else could it be?

174
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,833
But then...

175
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,708
It's too early to
throw in the towel.


176
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,208
I have a good idea
where it went.


177
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,666
[MAN 20A pants]
Hey, wait a minute!

178
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,833
You wanna know
about the Fragment?

179
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,500
You're one of the people
who's lookin' for it, right?

180
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,625
[SASTRE grunts]

181
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,333
Yeah. That's what I thought.

182
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,958
All right, I'll talk!

183
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,958
I promise, I'll tell ya
everything I know.

184
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,041
So let me go, okay?

185
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,416
[SASTRE grunts]

186
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,416
[engine revs]

187
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,000
[SAKAKI] Is it another crane
with Robin's name on it?

188
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,750
Most likely.

189
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,375
Well, it looks like
your leg is healed up now.

190
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,666
[SAKAKI] Yeah. It still
hurts, though. Heh.

191
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,166
It's all the rehab.

192
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,791
Do you think they're supposed
to mean our Robin?

193
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,166
I don't really know.

194
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,791
But I think it would
be crazy to think

195
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,041
there isn't some connection
between them.

196
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,208
[SAKAKI]
By the way, where's Dojima?

197
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,666
Her? I have no idea
where she is.

198
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,958
[SAKAKI]
Jeez... So, what's the hold up?

199
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:07,000
When is this case gonna come
under our jurisdiction, anyway?

200
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,375
[KARASUMA]
It can't be helped.

201
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:09,958
Other than the fact
that the victim

202
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,166
happened to be a witch, there's
no grounds for us to step in.

203
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,958
[SAKAKI] Yeah, but if the
Administrator were here...

204
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,041
[beeping]

205
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,625
What is it?

206
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,000
[MICHAEL] I've tracked down the
victim's most recent movements.

207
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,916
It looks like the Walled City
was his base of operations.

208
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,208
[SAKAKI]
The Walled City?

209
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,708
Michael, could you do
some more digging for us

210
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,500
and find out what
he's doing in there?

211
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,166
[MICHAEL]
I figured you'd ask that.

212
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,375
I'm looking into his
known associates now.

213
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,208
You should probably
head over there yourself.

214
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,041
Roger that.

215
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,458
[NAGIRA]
Hm?

here, you bastard!

All right, you
out-of-shape jackass!

221
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,750
I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!

222
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,375
I see. I had a feelin'
that it was you.

223
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,750
You're the worm
who told everyone

224
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,000
that the Fragment of Knowledge
was at my place.

225
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,416
No, it wasn't me! Uh.

226
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,625
I didn't spread any rumors!

227
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,166
You see, I just...

228
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,875
Just what?

229
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,250
Well? Who did you
sell it to then?

230
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,541
Uh...

[HANAMURA] Hello, Nagira Law--
Oh, hello Mr. Nagira.

00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,250
Huh? The girl upstairs?

234
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,416
No, she hasn't come
out of her room yet today.

235
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,583
[NAGIRA]
Robin, are you there?

236
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,666
I found it. It's in the
Walled City like I thought.

237
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,041
It looks like this guy they call
the Priest has the Fragment.

238
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,250
Stealing it from me was
one thing, but the idiot

239
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,458
must not have any clue of how
to actually use the damn thing.

240
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,625
Apparently, he's poking
around the old lady's place

241
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,583
tryin' to find the secret to it.

242

[BRUISER A]
If we put the rumor out there,

243
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,041
they'll come flocking
to us, right?

244

Yes, just like hyenas.

00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,333
Well, what do we have here?

248
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,208
It looks to me like
another pathetic fool

249
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,625
was drawn out by this thing.

250
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,750
Idiot. He doesn't seem to know
how to introduce himself.

251
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,541
Go teach him some manners.

take good care of him.

323
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,750
Amon...

324
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,541
What're you doing...?

325
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,375
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

326
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,125
since the coven
sank in the dark.

327
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,958
A hunter who waits for his prey.

328
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:30,500
The footprints.
Endless darkness.

329
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:35,166
The child of darkness still
wishes to see tomorrow.
