1
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,000
[AMON]
He's 20 minutes late.

2
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,458
You must be Inquisitor Cortion.

3
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,500
I'm Amon from STNJ.

4
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,541
We'll be the one's escorting
you from here on-- Ah.

5
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,000
[AMON]
Sir.

6
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,500
I can carry your bags for you.

7
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,000
The air tonight...

8
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,583
...is heavy.

9
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,875
[SAKAKI]
Check that one out.

10
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,333
[MICHAEL] Hold on. I gotta
test the link out first.

11
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,458
[SAKAKI] I'm telling you,
that's just a waste of time!

12
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,958
[KARASUMA grunts]

13
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,625
[MICHAEL] If you know so much,
then why don't you do it?

14
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,708
[SAKAKI] Why should I have to?
Come on, check out the next one.

15
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,750
[MICHAEL groans]
Fine.

16
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,875
[KARASUMA grunts]

17
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,291
Problem?

18
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,208
No, we're good.
Everything's fine.

19
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,166
You can go back
to sleep, Miss Karasuma.

20
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,083
Are you looking at websites that
you know you shouldn't be?

21
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:57,166
Of course not.
The chief does that, not us.

22
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,750
[KARASUMA]
Careful now.

23
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,541
The Inquisitor?

24
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,250
--[SAKAKI] Yep.
--Are you looking into

25
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,125
the inquisitor that's
coming today?

26
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:09,750
[SAKAKI] Well, you know how
none of the information

27
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,166
ever gets passed onto us.

28
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,083
So we thought we'd
check things out ourselves.

29
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,166
[MICHAEL groans]

30
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,291
[SAKAKI]
No good, huh?

31
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,208
I can't get anything
on the inquisitor.

32
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,583
This is isn't normal. This guy's
got some tight security.

33
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,208
[SAKAKI] That means we
got a really big fish then,

34
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,000
doesn't it? Why do you think
they're sending us

35
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,541
such an important guy?

36
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,833
[KARASUMA] 'Cause he's here
for the inquisition of a witch.

37
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,333
To see if we can
use the witch as hunter.

38
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,833
[SAKAKI]
Who is it?

39
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,000
[KARASUMA] Well, if you're
really that curious about it,

40
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,000
then why don't you
just ask him yourself?

41
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,333
[SAKAKI] If I could,
I wouldn't be here right now.

42
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,583
If you ask me, the whole
thing's a little funny.

43
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,875
[SAKAKI] Hey, maybe we
can trace the Inquisitor

44
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,916
by using this witch
as a starting point?

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,208
[MICHAEL] I dunno...
That might be tough.

46
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,166
[KARASUMA]
A heretic inquisition...

47
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,375
[SAKAKI] Well, it's at least
worth a try, isn't it?

48
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,083
--[CORTION] You.
--[gasps]

49
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,708
[CORTION] I want you to pull
over just past the next light.

50
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,208
But St. Sebastian Church
is just a few blocks away.

51
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,125
As you wish, sir.

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,791
Is this where you wanted me to--

53
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:26,916
Ah.

54
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
[AMON]
Just a moment. Where are you...?

55
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,333
Those who seek this
moment will forever...

56
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,458
Hmm?

57
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,875
[gasps]

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,541
[ZAIZEN]
Are you the only one here?

59
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,666
Huh?

60
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,708
[gasps]

61
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,000
O-Oh, yeah. I just got a call
from Amon a few minutes ago.

62
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,500
What'd he say?

63
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,583
[MICHAEL] He was lettin' me know
the Inquisitor has entered

64
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,916
the church where
he'll be staying.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,458
[ZAIZEN]
I see.

66
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,500
[MICHAEL] He also said that
the Inquisitor wants to begin

67
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,375
the inquisition
as soon as possible,

68
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,041
so he sent Miss Karasuma
and Sakaki out

69
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,625
to get the suspect.

70
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,875
I suppose that's the one that's
going to be questioned, then?

71
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,458
[MICHAEL]
Yes.

72
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,208
I checked him against our list,
but there weren't any matches.

73
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:01,250
So, uh... how'd the
Inquisitor find this guy anyway?

74
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,166
From what I understand,
they have a system

75
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,416
for finding witches that is
completely different

76
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,166
from what we're used to.

77
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,833
[MICHAEL]
What kind of system?

78
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,041
It's old. It dates back
to the middle ages.

79
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,708
I'm sure this case will
be dealt with entirely

80
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,291
through their system.

81
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,916
Michael, when you get a chance,
I'd like for you to forward me

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,375
all the data you've
found on this man.

83
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,833
You got it. No problem.

84
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,208
[KARASUMA] Artificial
Intelligence can only determine

85
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,333
to a certain point
whether or not a person

86
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,375
is suitable as a hunter.

87
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,833
It's the final decision
that's the most important,

88
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,083
and that has to be
made by a human.

89
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
Understand?

90
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,083
I think I got it.

91
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,458
[KARASUMA] And, the only
ones that are authorized

92
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,750
to make that decision...
are the Inquisitors.

93
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,375
[SAKAKI] So in other words,
it all comes down to him...

94
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,541
Whether you end up
becoming the hunter...

95
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,125
...or the hunted.

96
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,625
That's what makes
this guy so important.

97
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,833
[SAKAKI]
That kinda bothers me.

98
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,458
Over there.

99
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,708
[CORTION]
So, you are here.

100
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,000
[CORTION]
See this?

101
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,208
It's an inquisition machine.

102
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,625
We're here on behalf of the
Shinjuku Temporary Agency,

103
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,666
regarding the request you made.

104
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,416
--[SAKAKI grunts]
--[MASUDA] What is it?

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,708
[KARASUMA]
You're Shirou Masuda?

106
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,416
Y-Yes, I am, but--

107
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,375
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

108
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,916
Whaddaya want?

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,875
[KARASUMA] We'd like you to
come with us for a little while.

110
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,291
[MASUDA]
What for?

111
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,041
[gasps]

112
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:41,541
[MASUDA]
This is...

113
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,708
[CORTION] I don't think
this device is necessary,

114
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,333
but those at the
Factory disagree.

115
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,333
[ROBIN] When they tested me,
they just used words.

116
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,791
[CORTION]
Just words?

117
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,041
I see, so that is how
you felt about it.

118
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,875
What do you remember?

119
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,541
Can you recall the symbols
I gave to you when

120
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,708
I put you under the inquisition?

121
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,833
The Hagal's Eight.

122
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:08,416
The sacred runes that will lead
you to the depths of the Craft.

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,333
However... that is all
forbidden fruit I'm afraid.

124
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,291
By passing along
the power of God,

125
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,000
we separate the lambs into
angels and fallen angels.

126
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,625
"Power of God"?

127
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,666
Symbols?

128
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,166
[CORTION]
Of course, at the time,

129
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,541
you were completely
unaware of the true identity

130
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,375
of the forbidden fruit
of knowledge

131
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,416
that I passed on to you
on that very day Robin.

132
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,208
[AMON]
He's here.

133
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,333
Then we shall begin immediately.

134
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,791
Have them bring him to me.

135
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:40,916
Right.

136
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,916
[MICHAEL]
Looks like they're gonna start.

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,083
I see...

138
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,416
Can you forward the
video to my office?

139
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,541
[MICHAEL]
Done.

140
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,083
[CORTION] Two years ago,
in Tokyo, a corpse was found.

141
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,875
The body had been brutally
crushed beyond recognition.

142
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,583
Because the corpse was
so badly damaged,

143
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,041
the police eventually filed
the death as an accident.

144
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,500
However, the truth is that
it was far from an accident.

145
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
What are you trying to say?

146
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,250
[CORTION]
You know the truth.

147
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,458
You know exactly how
that man was crushed to death.

148
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,958
You're wrong. I've no idea
what you're talking about.

149
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,958
[CORTION]
The Hagall for the stone axe.

150
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,250
Does it look familiar?
You used this rune.

151
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,375
The realization of evil, to
unleash your own Craft,

152
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,750
in accordance with the Gematria
in the Sepher Yetzirah,

153
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,250
the Book of Creation.

154
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,458
Wh-Who are you?
Wh-Where do you come from?

155
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,708
[CORTION]
Destruction, ruin, revenge...

156
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,791
You unleashed the dark desires
that lay deep in your soul.

157
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,208
[MASUDA]
It's not true. It's not true...

158
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,625
--Did you enjoy it?
--It's not true...

159
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,541
[CORTION] Did you like watching
a human body crushed to death

160
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,125
by your own will?

161
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,666
No!

162
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,750
That's not what happened!

163
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,208
[THUG]
Quit messing with us, fool!

164
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,291
[MASUDA]
I only did it to protect myself!

165
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,875
I just wanted to get
out of there alive!

166
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,000
[CORTION]
To protect yourself?

167
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,333
That's right!

168
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,833
That's right. I just
wanted to get out of there.

169
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,333
You want me to believe
that you killed someone

170
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,541
to protect yourself?

171
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,125
That's very convenient.

172
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,333
[THUG groaning]

173
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:57,125
[MASUDA]
He wasn't human. He...

174
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,708
He tried to...!

175
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,875
[CORTION] Do you have the right
to kill if they're not human?

176
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,958
And... do you think that he
really wanted to kill you?

177
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:12,500
[MASUDA] Not human.
He wasn't human...

178
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,333
If I hadn't done it, he
would have killed me!

179
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,000
[CORTION]
Perhaps your imagination

180
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,375
is running a little wild.

181
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,208
Can you honestly tell me
that you weren't wishing

182
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,208
for his death from
the very beginning?

183
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,041
Not true! Not true! Not true!

184
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,666
[CORTION] But death has always
seemed to surround you.

185
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,375
[MASUDA] It's not me!
That was... That was...

186
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,666
[CORTION] Is it your wish
to confront anything

187
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,000
that chooses to challenge you?

188
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,416
[MASUDA]
I wasn't... It's not true..

189
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,750
No! I'm not a monster!
I'm... I'm...

190
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,208
[CORTION] But you have wished
for the power of God.

191
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,416
And although you are human,
you still seek divine power

192
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,083
by enslaving yourself
to the heretics.

193
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,625
[MASUDA]
Heretics?

194
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,458
Are you saying that
I work for the Devil?!

195
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,500
[CORTION] It's nobody's
fault but your own.

196
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,583
You fell of your own free will.

197
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,583
Of my own free will?

198
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,291
[CORTION] I insist that you
reveal your true self to me!

199
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,375
My true self...

200
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,708
[MASUDA] I'm not a monster!
I'm not a monster!

201
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,125
I'm not a monster!
I'm not a monster!

202
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:20,041
[MASUDA] My power...
My... My true power...

203
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:24,583
[MASUDA] No! Don't come out!
Don't come out! No! Stop it!

204
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,083
[MASUDA]
K-Kill... I can't...

205
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208
I'm gonna kill... No...

206
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,958
I will kill! I can't!
It's all right to kill.

207
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,458
[MASUDA]
Stop it! I can't!

208
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,625
[MASUDA]
NO!!!

209
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,583
[MASUDA]
I'm gonna kill you!

210
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,708
[CORTION grunts]

211
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,291
[MASUDA grunts]
Die!

212
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,291
[CORTION groans]

213
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,750
Amon!

214
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,333
[AMON]
Calm down. Just wait.

215
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,375
[MASUDA pants]

216
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,250

[yells]

218
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,875
[MASUDA groans]

219
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,041
I didn't want to kill you...

220
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:38,000
I mean it...
I didn't want to kill anyone.

221
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,916
[CORTION]
Hmm...

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,041
[sighs]

223
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,583
The inquisition's over.

224
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,916
[AMON]
Let's go.

225
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,916
I didn't wanna kill... anyone.

226
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,000
[ROBIN]
But he was able to control it

227
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,708
during the inquisition.

228
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,958
[AMON] You're right.
It did appear that way.

229
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,333
However, the darkness that
was hidden inside his heart

230
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,416
has now been revealed.
You can't ignore that.

231
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,750
The Inquisitor
feels the same way.

232
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,708
[ROBIN] Yes, but everyone has
at least some darkness

233
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,750
in their heart.

234
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,208
[AMON]
Perhaps.

235
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
But the distinction
lies in whether it is

236
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,833
a shade of gray or truly dark.

237
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,833
But...

238
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,250
[AMON]
Wait. He's coming out.

239
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,416
[AMON]
Michael! Masuda is on the move!

240
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,791
[MICHAEL] Okay. This guy
looks like a tough one,

241
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
so be careful.

242
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,125
[AMON]
The Fourth district.

243
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,333
[AMON] We've got him
pretty much cornered.

244
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,875
[gasps]

245
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,958
[CORTION] Overwhelming
power will guide humans

246
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,708
to eternal darkness.

247
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:22,000
That is why one must always
maintain constant vigilance.

248
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,083
So those that have
awakened to the Craft

249
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,083
must endure whatever
treatment they receive?

250
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:31,708
They must try, if they wish to
continue living in this world.

251
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,208
[gasps]

252
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:38,041
[CORTION] However, in the end,
it will prove impossible.

253
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,375
[ROBIN]
Then how... do you...

254
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,000
[CORTION]
You should know.

255
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,333
You must relinquish
yourself to us

256
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,083
and leave everything
to our doing.

257
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,541
I don't have the powers of a
witch because I wished for it.

258
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,250
Why is it that you
use those powers?

259
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,458
I don't know. I... I just do.

260
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,125
[ROBIN gasps]

261
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,250
[MICHAEL] It looks like this
guy hasn't had a real job

262
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,583
for over two years.

263
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,875
[AMON]
Two years?

264
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,541
[MICHAEL]
Yeah, what's up?

265
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,625
[AMON] That's right about
the same time he started

266
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,500
showing signs of his craft.

267
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,833
[MICHAEL]
No way.

268
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,708
[AMON] Do you really think
it's out of the question?

269
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,375
Forcing someone
out of society...

270
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,958
...just to awaken their powers.

271
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,333
I wouldn't put something
like that past Solomon.

272
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,833
For a new hunter...
I could see them going that far.

273
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,166
We're just tools.

274
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,083
[AMON]
You disagree?

275
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,541
Regardless, let me
know what you find.

276
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,208
[MICHAEL]
You got it.

277
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,958
[AMON]
The truth can be difficult.

278
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,083
But if you don't face it,
you may as well stop living.

279

I'm so bummed, man. I've
spent like 20,000 yen

282
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,166
on my cell phone this month.

283
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,208
Hey, man, that's your own
fault for tryin' to pick up

284
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,750
so many chicks.

285
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,375
I bet if I look, I'll find a

00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,500
[BOY B gasps, grunts]

314
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,708
[MASUDA chuckles]

315
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,291
[ROBIN grunts]
It's over.

316
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,416
[AMON grunts]

317
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,125
[AMON gasps]

318
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,500
[MASUDA]
What do you want from me?

319
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,708
Who are you?

320
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,166
Are you going to try
to attack me as well?

321
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,833
[chuckles]

322
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,125
[AMON groans]

323
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,166
Do you really derive
that much pleasure

324
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,833
from crushing people?

325
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:07,958
[MASUDA]
Huh?

326
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,000
Fallen angel...

327
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,833
Are you like me? Are you?!

328
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:15,958
Answer!

329
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,875
[gasps]

330
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,708
I won't allow it.

331
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,916
[MASUDA screams]

332
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
Robin... You...

333
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,375
[ZAIZEN] That headstone
that he stopped to see...

334
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,583
According to legend,
it's there to calm the souls

335
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,708
of those who've died,
betrayed by their followers.

336
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,208
[AMON]
Martyrs.

337
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,958
What it most likely
refers to is a witch.

338
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,750
How is she?

339
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,333
I see.

340
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,333
You think something's
wrong with her?

341
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:20,083
I'm leaving Japan today, and I
doubt that I will see you again.

342
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,666
Huh?

343
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,583
[CORTION] It appears as though
you may finally have awakened.

344
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,208
[ROBIN]
What do you mean?

345
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,833
[CORTION] To the rapture
one receives from using...

346
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,458
...their craft.

347
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,541
What do you mean by that?

348
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,958
What do you...?

349
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,000
Inquisitor...

350
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,375
Robin is--?!

351
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,708
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

352
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,541
since the coven
sank in the dark.

353
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:27,458
A bullet in the dark.
The letter from the past.

354
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,125
A smeared bond...

355
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,083
The nightmare without
a vanishing point

356
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:35,458
visits from the
abyss of darkness.
