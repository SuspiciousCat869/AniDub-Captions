That's the pot calling
the kettle black.

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,666
Come on, tell me Amon.

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,833
I'd like to know how what
I did was any different

00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,916
from what you're doing now.

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,041
Unlike you, I would never
sell out a friend.

[NAGIRA]
So, find anything?

[NAGIRA]
It's me. You in there?

00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,083
Uh, yes.

15

[NAGIRA]
Can I come in?

16
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,958
[ROBIN] Oh, sorry. Come on in.
The door's unlocked.

17
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,250
[NAGIRA]
I found a guy

18
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,875
who says that he saw somebody
who resembled Amon.

19
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,458
He saw Amon?

20
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,583
Yeah, he did and twice
in the same place, to boot.

21
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,541
Amon was scoping out
a house all day

22
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,916
from a car parked on
the side of the road.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But why?

24
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,291
Beats me.

25
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,375
But if we go snoopin'
around that house,

26
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,291
I bet we'll find out something.

27
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,958
What do you say? Wanna
go check it out with me?

28

[door clicks]

29
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,750
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

30
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,791
But the Commissioner is still
in a meeting at the moment,

31
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,458
so can I ask you to please
wait here for a few minutes?

32
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:48,166
Oh... Yes, of course I will.

33
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,125
[door opens]

34
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,208
[ROBIN]
Mm?

35
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,250
Looks like we're back
to square one.

36
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,583
So you didn't find anything?

37
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,041
[NAGIRA]
Nope, not really.

38
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,000
There's an old lady that's
been living in that house

39
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,125
for a long time now,
but that's about it.

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,875
Amon must've tailed
somebody back to this place.

41
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,541
There's no doubt about it.

42
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,500
That's what I think, anyway.

43
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,208
If you think that's really true,
then maybe Amon came here

44
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,583
to ask that lady about
somebody else.

45
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,208
The only thing that
old lady could tell us

46
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,500
about is ancient history.

47
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,083
Who could he possibly
ask her about?!

48
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,333
Overconfidence...

49
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,875
I'm talkin' about me.

50
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,833
Up until just now, everything's
been comin' really easy.

51
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,458
Maybe I've been jumpin'
to conclusions

52
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,916
and simplifying Amon's motives.

53
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,250
Where are we going?

54
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,708
To do a little digging.

55
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,750
If he really came here to
ask that old lady something

56
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,208
then we need to make sure
we clear the decks first.

57
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
"Clear the decks"?

58
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,666
Yeah. We'll find out who
that old lady might know.

59
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,333
Whoever she's connected
to attracted Amon's attention.

60
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,041
Then we'll track him down.

61
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,375
[COMMISSIONER] I called you
here today for a reason.

62
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,541
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,041
[COMMISSIONER]
You drink tea, don't you?

64
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,708
Y-Yes, of course, tea
is fine, thank you sir.

65
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,083
[COMMISSIONER] Excuse me,
could you bring some

66
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,500
hot tea for myself and
Inspector Kosaka?

67
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,000
[CLERK]
Right away, sir.

68
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,458
It will be here in a minute.

69
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,458
Yes, sir. Thank you
very much, sir.

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,125
Let us now get back
to the point at hand.

71
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,500
The reason why I asked
you to come down here

72
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,250
is because your reports suggest
that Administrator Zaizen

73
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,750
hasn't been seen at your
office for some time now.

74
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,125
Is that true?

75
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,625
Yes.

76
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,166
It would seem that various
matters, of which I am unaware,

77
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,125
have kept the Administrator busy
since the attack on the STNJ.

78
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,041
So, there has been
no word from him?

79
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,041
[KOSAKA]
Not for the past month or so.

80
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,791
[COMMISSIONER]
Hm... Now I understand.

81
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,750
Is the Administrator in
some sort of trouble, sir?

82
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
[COMMISSIONER]
Hmm...

83
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,333
It looks like there may be some
trouble brewing between

84
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:04,166
Mr. Zaizen and
Solomon headquarters.

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,458
It's still merely a
possibility at this point,

86
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:11,083
but Administrator Zaizen's
standing within Solomon Japan

87
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,208
may undergo some changes
in the near future.

88
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,958
Naturally, we have no
intention of making an enemy

89
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,833
of him just yet.

90
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,250
For the time being,
we will need to keep

91
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,958
a very close eye on
their power plays.

92
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,250
And that brings me
to a small matter

93
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,875
which will require your
cooperation, Inspector Kosaka.

94
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,083
Huh?

95
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,958
A 40% cut in the
project budget?!

96
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,666
What's going on here?

97
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,083
[SECRETARY]
Yes, sir?

98
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,416
Connect me to the
chief accountant

99
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,916
at Solomon's Japan branch--

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,791
No, wait.

101
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,583
Get me CFO Sugimura immediately.

[SECRETARY] CFO Sugimura
of the Japan branch, sir?

103
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,375

I'm very sorry Administrator,

106
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,250
but Mr. Sugimura doesn't seem
to be answering my call.

107
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,833
What's going on?

108
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,416
[SECRETARY]
I'm not sure, sir.

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,000
Just to make certain, I tried
calling the other departments,

110
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,708
but there's no answer
from any of them.

111
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,833
I see then...

112
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,583
I hate to trouble you,
but wait a while

113
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,291
and then try reaching
them again.

114
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,666
[SECRETARY]
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,708
Is it pressure
from headquarters?

116
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,583

So they're planning to
oust me now, are they?

I'd like you to get me
some verification

on a very important matter.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,541
Yeah. I did some diggin'
around and found out

00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,375
that the old lady had a son
that lived there for a while.

134
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,291
So, you think Amon was
looking for him?

her son did live there,

but as it turns out,
the guy actually died

Maybe not.

00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,125
The Orbo!

322
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,375
Or--? What the hell is "Orbo"?

323
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,458
Um, It's nothing.

324
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,333
By the way, Nagira,
I was wondering

325
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,916
if maybe you had come across

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
anything in the diary that talks
about a priest named Juliano?

327
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,875
"Juliano"?

328
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,833
Nah. Doesn't look like it.

329
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,208
Oh.

330
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,875
What are you hiding? Who is
this Juliano guy anyway?

331
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,500
Nobody. Forget about it.

332
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,833
At any rate, it looks
like we're still gonna

333
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,458
have to look a little deeper
into this thing after all.

334
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,583
But it's a little too late to do
anything about it today.

335
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,833
[yawns]

336
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:21,166
I think I'm gonna adjourn our
meeting for a little while.

337
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,500
You should call it a day
and get some sleep, too.

338
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,291
Yes, I know.

339
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,666
[thunder rumbles]

340
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,500
But why...?

341
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,166
Why on earth would he
have been there that day?

342
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,708
Why him...?

343
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,625
Juliano...

344
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,583
Damn it, it's really
startin' to-- Huh?

345
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,875
I knew I was right.

346
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,625
Admit it. You deliberately
left us a trail.

347
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,250
You wanted us to
follow you, didn't ya?

348
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
What the hell are you up to?

349
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,625
I have come here to hunt Robin.

350
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,166
What's that? What the hell
did you just say?

351
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,583
I've come here to hunt Robin.

352
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,000
Amon. Are you completely
out of your mind?!

353
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,750
No, not really.

354
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,041
Robin Sena has become the most
dangerous Witch in existence.

355
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,500
What're you talking about?!
You're calling her a Witch now?

356
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,041
She's only a witch
because Solomon

357
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,041
has decided to see her that way.

358
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,541
Wait a second, this
isn't because of some

359
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,708
unresolved issues with
your mother, is it?

360
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,750
It is not.

361
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,375
Then what's the deal?

362
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,833
You must have seen it...

363
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,041
...Robin's power.

364
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,458
So what. That doesn't
matter to me at all.

365
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,000
Robin is still Robin.

366
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,666
And that girl hasn't
changed one bit

367
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,000
since the day you first
left her with me.

368
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,958
[NAGIRA] Listen to me,
it's not a person's past

369
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,958
that tells you whether
or not to trust 'em.

370
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,000
It's whether you can trust that
person's heart that matters.

371
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,333
At the very least, you must've
believed in her back

372
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,541
when you told her to
come to me for help.

373
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,166
I thought that you wanted me
to take care of her!

374
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,458
Are you trying to tell me now
that that was all a mistake?

375
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,750
Well, I'm gonna protect Robin!

376
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,833
Even if I have to
take a bullet--

377
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,541
[NAGIRA]
Amon...

378
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,458
[thud]

379
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,541
[NARRATOR] Three hundred
and twenty years have passed

380
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,291
since the coven
sank in the dark.

381
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:28,125
Reunion. Hatred for blood.

382
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,166
A dead-end alley.

383
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:35,041
The forbidden encounter restarts
a stalled spinning wheel.
