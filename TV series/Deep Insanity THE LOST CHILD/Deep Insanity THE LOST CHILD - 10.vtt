Is she that important to you?

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.557 position:50% align:center
She's bet everything on
this plan ending in victory.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How come?

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
But I can tell she's
pretty desperate.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.315 position:50% align:center
And I want to help her by
making sure it gets done.

[SHIGURE grunting]

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
Just a dream. Huh.

Tomorrow's mission is set.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.237 position:50% align:center
We'll be heading
to area 4-7-1-3.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.741 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you the objective
once we get there.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.159 position:50% align:center
That is all.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
U-Um.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.494 position:50% align:center
Yes, what?

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.330 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't we tell
Shigure about this?

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:46.916 position:50% align:center
He has been dismissed
from the platoon.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.460 position:50% align:center

What?

[JAMES]
Shigure Daniel Kai.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.928 position:50% align:center
As you've no doubt
been informed by now,

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.639 position:50% align:center
you're being removed
from Platoon Eleven.

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:03.725 position:50% align:center
I would like to know why, sir.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
You entered the Asylum
without permission.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.148 position:50% align:center
And what's more, you did so
using an unauthorized route.

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
We were given a report
of your transgression.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
Well, do you deny it?

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.408 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS]
A violation of contract

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.202 position:50% align:center
is grounds for dismissal.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:26.456 position:50% align:center
Do you require any further
explanation than that?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.375 position:50% align:center
No, I understand.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
They know.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
But how did they find out?

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
[SOLVEIG]
It's a shame, really.

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh...

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
From the start,
Commander Rustamova

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
seemed to have a particular
interest in you.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm? Wait, she did?

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
You mean that you
weren't aware?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
She might not have told you,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.952 position:50% align:center
but she specifically wanted
someone like you for her team.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Squad Eight commander.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50% align:center
Report to the commissary
immediately.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] You're leaving.
I can't believe it.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I'll miss you guys.
Thanks for everything.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50% align:center
[LARRY grunts]

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.383 position:50% align:center
So, what route are you
taking to get home?

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
I'm going through
Southern Cross.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
But given the situation,
I'm not exactly in a hurry.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
So I'll probably
be staying there

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
for a little while at least.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
You didn't want to
go straight back?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Everything happened so suddenly.
I couldn't get a plane ticket.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
And besides, I could use some
time to adjust, you know?

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.069 position:50% align:center
If you don't have a ticket,
why leave now?

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
You could hang out here a bit
longer if you wanted, right?

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.532 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I guess, but, why?

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
Duh. So we can throw you a
farewell party, of course.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right!

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
We need to say goodbye
to you properly.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.667 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thanks, I'd like that.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:59.299 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] I informed the brass.
You sure about losing your pawn?

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
Seems like a waste.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sure.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:06.431 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Their primary concern is
whether the plan can continue.

00:05:06.514 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
[VERA] We won't be calling
it off. Tell them that.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Understood.
Next matter of business.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Have you recovered the item?

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:21.071 position:50% align:center
Not yet. But soon.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Unfortunate.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
I suggest turning "soon"
into "immediately."

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] All right everyone,
let's raise a glass

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
and wish Shigure a safe trip.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
Is it too early to
start listing regrets?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
Nah, let's hear them.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
I love that we opened
up to each other,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
but it's kind of a
shame we never got

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50% align:center
to a first name basis.

00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
But if we did, I'd
call you "Kai," right?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
No. Actually, that's my last
name, and Shigure's my first.

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
I guess we can cross
that one off of the list.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
Come out and say what's
on your mind, Larry.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
None of this makes any sense.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Booting you out so suddenly.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.578 position:50% align:center
The thing is, they found
out that I went down

00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50% align:center
to the Asylum
without authorization.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] That doesn't
make me feel any better!

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
Tons of other Sleepers do

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
the exact same thing,
me included!

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
No reason to get riled up.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Calm down.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
Here you go.
Compliments of the house.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.678 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What's the occasion?

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
I heard the good news.
I'm going to miss you,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
but I wish you the
very best of luck.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you were a
regular at this bar, Shigure.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.229 position:50% align:center
I'm not. The XO took me here

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.858 position:50% align:center
a while back to
have a talk, but--

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.985 position:50% align:center
It was their old haunt.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] They said the mission
will proceed as planned.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.827 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
You're absolutely certain?

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
'Cause that's a
little bit different

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
from what Hayden
mentioned, I think.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.042 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Look, I know what I heard.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
Whether you believe it or not,
that's entirely up to you.

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:02.589 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
And another thing.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
I believe the Aruka
is in Vera's possession.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
For the time being, at least.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.014 position:50% align:center
[MAN A gasps]

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.017 position:50% align:center
You know, I've been curious
what sort of person

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
you would blossom into
ever since we first met!

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
You wanted to be a hero, right?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
A lot of people join
for a lot of reasons,

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
but that's got to be a first.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll get the chance
in another life.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
Um, are you okay?

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.908 position:50% align:center
Was it something I said?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
I want you to tell me the truth.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
The truth?

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
What have you really
been up to lately?

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
Sorry, um, are you asking why

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
I went down into the
Asylum by myself?

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
I'm talking about the
larger picture here!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
Larry, how much have
you had to drink?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
Maybe you ought
to switch to water.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.510 position:50% align:center
Will you stop? I'm not drunk!

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
'Cause in case you forgot,
I'm underage!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.515 position:50% align:center
So what, this is you sober?

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.767 position:50% align:center
It must be the bar's
intoxicating atmosphere.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50% align:center
This isn't a joke to me!

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
Hey... Dude, relax.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
Stop underestimating me just
because I have a brain injury!

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:09.114 position:50% align:center
Sure, I don't experience fear
and pain like regular people do.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't
make me oblivious.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
No, of course not.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:15.203 position:50% align:center
So I can tell that you're
in pain right now!

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
Not to start a fight,
but I'm doing fine.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking
about physically!

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.668 position:50% align:center
I mean here, in the heart!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
[BOTH grunt]

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] You've been up to
something. I know it.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
Anyone with half
a brain could tell

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.304 position:50% align:center
you've been different
since the XO died.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.849 position:50% align:center
No offense, but if someone
with your temperament changed

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
that dramatically, whatever
happened had to have been major.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.648 position:50% align:center
That was a little offensive.

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
Enough secrets. Did you have
some important assignment

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
you were trying to accomplish?

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
You may be leaving, but
we're still your teammates!

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
If it's not finished,
we can take over for you

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.412 position:50% align:center
and make sure it gets done.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.122 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Mm-hm!

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.918 position:50% align:center
Sorry, you're wrong.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
There wasn't anything
I was trying to do.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
Be right back.

Yeah, he's a weirdo and all.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
And he can be childish,

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center

repeated this same timeline

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center

out the same way.

And every time,
you got them killed.

and died again,

tried, they did what you asked.

was always the same.

00:18:57.554 --> 00:18:59.431 position:50% align:center
I'm probably
overthinking things,

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
but what was our location
for this mission?

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
It's area 4-7-1-3, right?

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
It should be. Why?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.023 position:50% align:center
I'm not positive,
but it feels like we've been

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
heading in a
different direction.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Mochiki!

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:21.911 position:50% align:center
Huh? Shigure, you're back?
I thought you left!

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Where's the Commander?

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
I've got to find her
and the squad now!

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
Well, the situation
is kinda bizarre.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
The Commander said they were
headed to area 4-7-1-3,

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.717 position:50% align:center
but for some reason,
they're traveling the wrong way.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
All right. I'm going after them.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
Keep me updated
on their location!

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.724 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Uh! What's going on?

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.082 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
So, uh, what're we doing here?

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:17.926 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN chuckles]

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you
made it this far.

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't be.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
Your number one subordinate
showed me the way.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
Is that so? You must
have placed some kind

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
of tracker on him.
Useless idiot.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Don't just stand there,
find the girl!

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
As soon as you do, kill her!

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
[LARRY, KOBATO]
Kill her?

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.862 position:50% align:center
I gave you an order!
Now, hurry!

00:20:37.946 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
You think I'd let you
interfere with our goal?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN grunts]

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Nothing will stop me
from fusing with EL-Cee.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Over my dead--

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE panting]

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.088 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE yells]

00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
Out of my way!

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
I was too late.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Sorry, kid, but looks
like you can forget about

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
being a hero.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.946 position:50% align:center
The Doctor is about to
return the world back

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:25.201 position:50% align:center
to the way it was meant to be--
using the power of God.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:22:02.739 --> 00:22:05.909 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasping]

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:13.917 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A dream...?
