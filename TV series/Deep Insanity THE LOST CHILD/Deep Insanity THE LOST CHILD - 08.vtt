00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.891 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] We understand you
visited the Asylum yourself.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
Is that correct?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.771 position:50% align:center
Surely you can see why
we would be concerned,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center
if even you failed to
eliminate the target.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
No one likes defeat, but you
must learn to accept it.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
Discretion being the better
part of valor and all that.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to say?

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
We've been informed you weren't
able to locate the target,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
even after you
personally went in.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.663 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS]
They fled to who knows where.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:40.123 position:50% align:center
In other words,
doesn't that mean

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
the operation was
a complete failure?

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
[VERA] I can't help it
if that's how you assess

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:49.174 position:50% align:center
the current situation. It was
a risk I was willing to take

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
when I stepped foot
in the Asylum.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
I see. So, not only

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.763 position:50% align:center
did you manage to fail
on multiple fronts,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
your single-minded obsession
clouded your judgment

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
to the point one of
your crew was killed.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.353 position:50% align:center
And in your considered opinion,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.938 position:50% align:center
these were risks
worth taking? Huh?!

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
Let me ask you this.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
If a plan was put forward
that included zero risk,

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
would you have trusted it, then?

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
I know what you're doing--

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.199 position:50% align:center
stop trying to
change the subject!

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.703 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
Commander Rustamova,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
the assassination of the Exiles'
precious "Child of God."

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
This isn't your
personal project.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.627 position:50% align:center
It was a plan approved in light

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.171 position:50% align:center
of the situation
at Antarctica Front.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.590 position:50% align:center
The goal is to remove a
factor that has proven

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
to be an obstacle.
It's purely political in nature.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.346 position:50% align:center
I'm very much aware.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.848 position:50% align:center
[SOLVEIG] You must also be aware
that when you make a move,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.184 position:50% align:center
the other Sleepers
take an interest.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.852 position:50% align:center
If they get wind of the plan,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
all the work that went
into it will be for nothing.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS] In short, if you
go down into the Asylum,

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
try not screw up again.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.696 position:50% align:center
I will do my best.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.281 position:50% align:center
I assure you, I don't
enjoy repeating mistakes

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.118 position:50% align:center
or wasting what
precious time we have.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
You've offered us a ship,

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.500 position:50% align:center
and now that we've boarded it,

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.044 position:50% align:center
we can't afford
to have it capsize.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
Further setbacks
will not be tolerated.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.342 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.404 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.655 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.201 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Welcome back.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
I heard about our mutual friend.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Word travels fast.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
My sympathies for your loss.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
You must have known
them a long time.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.298 position:50% align:center
The XO, I mean.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
No, I'm afraid not.
They stopped by the bar, sure,

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
but it wasn't like this
was their regular haunt.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
Oh, I just assumed.

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
It sorta seemed like
you two were close.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
Well, that was the XO.
They made you feel that way.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.441 position:50% align:center
Even if you had only
met 'em one time,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
you'd never forget 'em.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE laughs]

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.321 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You said it.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
They were unique.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.075 position:50% align:center
Especially the way they talked.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.583 position:50% align:center
Sometimes they would head
straight to the back

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
without saying a word to me.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.462 position:50% align:center
They'd just sit down,
pull out a notebook,

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
and start scribbling away.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm? Oh, I-- I had no idea.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Kinda surprising, right?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
Maybe they dreamed
of becoming an author.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that be something.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.896 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
To business.

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
I know you didn't come
here just for a drink.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Hm? Uh, right.
Would you take a look at this?

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Do you recognize
this sequence of numbers?

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
What they go to?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A] Hm... No not off
the top of my head, I'm sorry.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
Maybe it could be a credit
card number or something?

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
A little jumpy, aren't we?

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
I don't think we're
being followed.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
Least, not now.
The typhoon has passed

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
and we've made it
to safer shores!

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.866 position:50% align:center
No, I doubt it.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
Basically, as long as we
have the Child of God,

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.872 position:50% align:center
it's safe to assume we're
being targeted at all times.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear. But you do have
a plan to escape capture,

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.132 position:50% align:center
Split the bodyguards
into three units.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Split up,
surely you jest, good sir!

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
I don't pretend to
be a strategist,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.932 position:50% align:center
but doesn't that mean fewer
people protecting the child?

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.101 position:50% align:center
Before we meet up
with the main unit--

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
and hand EL-Cee over to them--

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.064 position:50% align:center
we'll surely already
be slaughtered!

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
Honing in on El-Cee now.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't be long.
At least, I think not.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
No, hold on a sec,
it isn't going to work.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
Blake Ron has chosen to split up
the security detail into three.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
Then there'll be fewer
people protecting her.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
Which is good for us, I think.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.092 position:50% align:center
Think again.
He's not being subtle,

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
which means he wanted
us to know what he was doing.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.389 position:50% align:center
So ask yourself, why is that?

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
I'm way too tired to care.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50% align:center
Because he's well aware
that only a few of us

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
are pursuing the Child of God.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
How can you be so sure
there are only a few enemies?

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
It's simple. Back when they
attacked the mansion,

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
they opted for confusion
and infiltration.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a defensible location.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:36.122 position:50% align:center
So why not launch
a full-scale attack?

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
Because they didn't have
the necessary strength

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
to storm through the doors.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
If we head in
different directions,

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
we'll be harder to track.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
Thus lowering their
chances of finding her.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
Now this is making sense!

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
And if they do decide
to attack us,

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
they'll be outnumbered.
And easily crushed.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.980 position:50% align:center
Only a fool would
gamble when the odds

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
are so stacked and you only have

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
a one in three chance
of locating your target.

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
Especially when combat
would mean death.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.739 position:50% align:center
Ah! He who chases
not two rabbits,

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
but rather a trio of them,

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
has even less chance
of catching one. Clever!

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:18.081 position:50% align:center
All right now. We've got
one shot at catching her.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:20.083 position:50% align:center
And that's by getting
ahead of her bodyguards

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
before they can
make the handoff.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
I got it. And not to be a
naysayer or anything, but still.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
Finding out where the
exchange will take place

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
is beyond even my capabilities.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.306 position:50% align:center
Fine. You got any ideas?

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:37.851 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.273 position:50% align:center
Yes. I understand you.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
The doctor is calling.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
We should head somewhere
with a better connection.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] To all employees.
R and R begins now...

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Aha! There you are!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey Larry.
Is anything the matter?

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.709 position:50% align:center
Actually, I came to ask if
you want in on something.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.711 position:50% align:center
Sumire, Kobato,
and I were talking,

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.546 position:50% align:center
and decided we should
put together an album

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
of XO Leslie's photos.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
But don't you need photos?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
Yeah, duh.
But that's no problem.

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
We've got access
to a bunch of 'em.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Remember the ones we
found on the computer?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:22.187 position:50% align:center
It could be a fun thing to do.
Plus I figured that this way,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
we'd have something nice
to remember them by.

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:29.736 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good idea.
I'll help out any way I can.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Hm... There aren't
that many to choose from.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.580 position:50% align:center
Really, you think so?
I assumed there'd be plenty.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
Seemed like a ton the last time

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.708 position:50% align:center
we were here looking
through the album.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
No, I didn't mean that.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
What I meant was none of
the photos feel authentic.

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] You got that right.
I would kill for a candid shot,

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.719 position:50% align:center
but they're striking a pose
in every single one of 'em.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:56.513 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] They didn't like
being caught off guard.

00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
Regardless of the occasion.
Which is just like the XO.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
[GROUP groans]

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] That's right.
When it came to the XO,

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.319 position:50% align:center
they were always
on top of things.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.530 position:50% align:center
It'll tell you what to
do if you get separated

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
from the rest of the squad.
Hey, no dying, okay?

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.703 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] They'd never write
meaningless numbers

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
on a message that was
meant to help me survive.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.581 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Hello?

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.042 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Maybe it's some kinda code.

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.962 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Shigure? Are you still with us?

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:32.674 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Oh, uh, yeah,
sorry. I'm here.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
You're gonna need the
management department's

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:36.469 position:50% align:center
permission to output any data.

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:39.639 position:50% align:center
So write down the numbers
on the photo file names.

00:10:39.723 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Got it.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:49.190 position:50% align:center
This one here is 16 digits.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.650 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
Hey! I remember when
we took this photo.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
Huh?! How long have you been--?

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[LARRY chuckles]

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
So, uh, where was
this photo taken?

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
We went there on a mission

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
about six months ago, I'd say?

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.902 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Why there, of all places?

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Mm...

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kobato, why this spot?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
Maybe because it's got a nice
vantage point or something?

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.334 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Or it could just
have been on a whim.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
I mean, the XO always
was the mysterious type.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Very true.
The XO had a lot of secrets.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
When we'd snuck into
the Asylum, they saved us

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
by following some unknown route
they never ended up explaining.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
And then, just before they died,

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:10.814 position:50% align:center
they were doing
something different

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.983 position:50% align:center
than the mission's objective.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
I didn't start putting the
pieces together till now,

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
but the more I think about them,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.242 position:50% align:center
the more of a mystery
they become.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
A message from Commander Vera!

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
We've got a new mission.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Well, let's go!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.091 position:50% align:center
Is that right?

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
No luck with EL-Cee
or the other objective.

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
No sir, I'm sorry.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.224 position:50% align:center
Hayden. I'm just curious.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
Did I perhaps place
too much faith in you?

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:53.940 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
Never mind.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:56.192 position:50% align:center
There's no point in asking
an ordinary person

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
like yourself to
redo their past.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
Let's look to
the future instead.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
Just so we're clear,
from now on,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
you'll do exactly
what I tell you to.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Understood.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
No, I just-- I thought...

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.299 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
Oh, um. It's nothing, I'm sorry.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] You're approaching
the destination.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Okay. Stay here till I get back.

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.063 position:50% align:center
I'll have a look around.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Roger!

00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
I knew it.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.278 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
You noticed, too, huh?

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.530 position:50% align:center
You guys wanna tell me
what's going on?

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
Weirdly enough, we're really
close to that place

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
where we took that photo
you were looking at.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.036 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] I'm sure it's
just a coincidence.

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Shigure.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.000 position:50% align:center
Huh? Yes? I'm here.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Come.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:00.090 position:50% align:center
[VERA] You don't need this
spelled out for you, right?

00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Get ready. The target will
cross our path very soon.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:07.305 position:50% align:center
They're going to hand her over
from one escort to another.

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
And when that happens,
you know your job.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
Aim my gun and shoot, ma'am.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
In terms of an
ideal vantage point,

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
the top of this building
is your best chance.

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:22.028 position:50% align:center
That said, it still
won't be an easy shot.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
Isn't this...?

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.917 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
What?

00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
Nothing. And what will you
be doing while I'm up here?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:43.091 position:50% align:center
Getting the target as far away
from her escort as possible.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50% align:center
So don't miss, okay?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.555 position:50% align:center
Right. I won't.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
Good luck.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:01.985 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
Nope. A silver necklace,
as a matter of fact.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
I left it behind because
I didn't want to lose it.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
They'd just sit down,
pull out a notebook,

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.418 position:50% align:center
and start scribbling away.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
"If this little notebook
of mine has found its way

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
into someone else's hands,"...

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] ...then it means
that I am already dead.

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:32.390 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
The XO's writing!

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] I can only hope that
the person reading this now

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
is someone worthy of
carrying on in my stead.

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
Someone determined
and persistent.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Someone I trusted enough
to guide to this location.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
and the secrets herein.

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasping]

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.705 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
XO...

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.919 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE, LESLIE]
What's written in here

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:06.174 position:50% align:center
is the truth I discovered
investigating Vera Rustamova.

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
Just what did they
find out about her?

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
A Scarred attack?

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] Looks like it, sir.
Came out of nowhere!

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.737 position:50% align:center
[BLAKE] The Child of God
is our first priority.

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
Don't fight if you
don't have to.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Yes, sir!

00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
Get her away from here at once.

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
Huh? Now what?

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
Why are things different?

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Commander! You see?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
We've got a Scarred attack!
What're your orders?

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Stay where you are.

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do, don't miss
your window, got it?

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.519 position:50% align:center
I'm changing part of the plan.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
I'll lure the target to
a location for the kill.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.317 position:50% align:center
[VERA] When you have
the shot, take it.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm on it... Huh?

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Crap! Larry and Kobato
are down there!

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.785 position:50% align:center
Is it just me, or has this
been happening a lot lately?

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
Try shooting your gun off
instead of your mouth!

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I'm afraid
you're not going anywhere.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
Ol' one arm!

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
You oughta show more
respect than that.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
I used to be part of
your squad, after all.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Okay.

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
Commander! The others
are in danger! Commander?

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
If I focus on saving them,

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
I'll fail the mission again.

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
But if I don't act now,
Larry and Kobato could die.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
C'mon! Think!

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
If the XO were here,
what would they do?

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sumire. Do you copy me?

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Sorry to disappoint you,
but that won't work twice.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
Drawing my focus with
a long-range attack

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
so you can get in close
enough to kill me.

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a plan Leslie
would come up with.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
But you left your position.
Sure that was a good idea?

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I could've sworn
your job was to kill EL-Cee.

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
We're a team.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
So while I'm here drawing you
away, they're stepping in.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.827 position:50% align:center
They can do my job for me.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
This is it. The spot where
we took that picture.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
Sumire, what's the plan?

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.376 position:50% align:center
Just hold your
positions for now.

Shigure says you're to support
the commander from up there.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
Okay, we've got it.

[gasps]

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
Enough of your games!
Just who are you?

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
And why are you after EL-Cee?

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
What about you?

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea
what her assassination

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
would lead to? I'm guessing not.

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
If you want to get involved,
go right ahead.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.652 position:50% align:center
But give it some thought.

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Ask yourself
if this is really worth

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
giving your life for.

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
You made a bad call.

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:02.345 position:50% align:center
[VERA grunts]

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.022 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] That's right,
I'll be taking El-Cee.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
And you'll fail, no matter
how many times you try.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
I would not be so sure.

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
I only have to wait
for my next chance.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.991 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
Not anymore.

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
You may not have
realized just it yet,

00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
but that incredible
power of yours

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.833 position:50% align:center
to make time repeat ends now
with this final, fruitless take.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.235 position:50% align:center
You have lost, Vera Rustamova.
