[alarm beeping]

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
Today is the 956th day.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
My memories of the plan failing

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.080 position:50% align:center
are clear for the most part.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
I don't remember every
single detail, but--

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.713 position:50% align:center
Three, two, one, and--

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
[COMM A]
Commander Rustamova.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
The Steering Committee
wants to speak with you.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Eventually,
you just get sick of it.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS]
What the hell is going on?

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.819 position:50% align:center
You've botched the
assassination attempt

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:34.821 position:50% align:center
not once, but twice now!

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Please, remain calm.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
Please, remain calm.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.951 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS]
Yes, but--

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:43.997 position:50% align:center
[VERA] We have to remember
this whole plan was her idea.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] We have to remember
this whole plan was her idea.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.754 position:50% align:center
[VERA] I think we ought to hear
what she has to say for herself.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] I think we ought to hear
what she has to say for herself.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.718 position:50% align:center
Commander? What can you tell us?

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
Sir. According to the
intel we've gathered,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.098 position:50% align:center
we have three chances
to take down our target.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.184 position:50% align:center
As you know, the
first two have failed.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
Which means we need to ensure
the last attempt succeeds.

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
And that is all.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
You are completely missing
the most important issue!

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.277 position:50% align:center
You guaranteed success,
and have come up short twice!

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
Is the plan even worth
continuing at this point?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.573 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Wait a moment.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
Your coworker
is about to explain

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
why you should stay the course.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
Stopping at this point
would be a grave error.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.663 position:50% align:center
Meaning?

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:26.998 position:50% align:center
There's no denying
that the failure

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
of this mission is
a serious concern.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
But that said,
the Commander's information

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
has proven to be correct
time and time again,

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:37.801 position:50% align:center
and she hasn't used up
her three chances yet.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
Even though there have
been a few setbacks,

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.263 position:50% align:center
I believe we should place
our trust in her.

00:03:42.347 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
Yes, I agree. The plan will
continue as scheduled.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:49.854 position:50% align:center
However, you cannot afford
to miss this final chance.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
Or we will have exhausted
all possible options.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50% align:center
I can't be the only one
who thought it was bizarre.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:05.203 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What're you talking about?

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
Eh, we've been going
over our recent missions.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
Originally, our objective was
to conduct investigations

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.503 position:50% align:center
in the Asylum. So it made sense
why mission parameters

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
were always on the vague side.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] But lately, you notice
how our assignments

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50% align:center
have been specific
and kinda strange?

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever her reasons are,
I'm sure that our fearless

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
Commander knows
what she's doing.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.058 position:50% align:center
Why not just ask her?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
I don't see the point.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
It's not like there's any chance
she'll tell lowly soldiers

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
what her intentions are,
or what the larger mission is.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
So? You're really okay with
being kept in the dark?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
You do realize the
next time you go on

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
one of these weird errands,
we could all wind up dead.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
Just like the XO did!

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
You may be fine with that,
but I'm not!

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, LARRY grunt]

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
Actually, I have an idea.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
[VERA] After experiencing
the same conversation

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
with them again and again,
they're easy to read.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
I know of a future.
One I can't share with the rest.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
They don't want accomplishments.
The three of them desire

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.394 position:50% align:center
information to bolster
their own careers.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
Which can be extremely useful.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
Especially when
it comes to getting

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
promotions or
missions approvals.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
The problem lies with
the assassination.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
No matter how many attempts,
it always ends in failure.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:31.289 position:50% align:center
But I've never encountered the
events that occurred yesterday.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
Not to mention,
the warning he gave me.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:38.546 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] Not anymore. You may
not have realized it yet,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50% align:center
but that incredible power of
yours to make time repeat

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
ends here and now with
this final, fruitless take.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
It begs the question.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.767 position:50% align:center
How does he know I
am able to rewind time?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
The only possibility
I can think of is that

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.855 position:50% align:center
he has the same power I do.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
Either way, despite being
able to repeat time,

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
this is the first instance where
they've had the upper hand.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
Which means going forward,
I should prepare for anything.

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Commander. May I
have a word? If you're free.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.549 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Shigure Daniel Kai. I
heard about his skills early on.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
He started off in
a different squad--

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
where he achieved considerable
success as a marksman.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
For the assassination
plan to work,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
I needed a sharpshooter
with incredible concentration.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
Someone who could focus
no matter the mission.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.860 position:50% align:center
He hit his stride quickly after
joining Platoon Eleven,

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
and I knew I'd found the
sniper I was looking for.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
There was one
major problem, though.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.869 position:50% align:center
He was too
psychologically immature.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
In fact, he's going to come
and say he wants

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
to withdraw from the
plan any minute now.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Permission to enter?

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
I've already discovered what
happens if I force him to obey.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
When I push him to take part,
the mission ends in failure.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:11.181 position:50% align:center
So, how should I play this?

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.599 position:50% align:center
Commander?

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Whenever he feels
cornered, the target survives,

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
and we achieve nothing.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
Perhaps granting his request
is the right move for now.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
Well, talk. But make
sure it's quick.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
Right. Here goes.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
Will you come have dinner
with the rest of the platoon?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.038 position:50% align:center
Very well. Huh?

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
You will? Great!

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.333 position:50% align:center
'Cause I was
positive you'd refuse!

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go and
let the squad know!

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.051 position:50% align:center
[VERA] No, no, no.
How did this happen?

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:52.972 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I just agreed
to break bread with the platoon!

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.474 position:50% align:center
Now what?

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] It's Sumire! I'm so
happy you're gonna join us!

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.603 position:50% align:center
We're having the
barbeque in the hangar!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
See you there!

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
Just how screwed up is
this particular timeline?

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
Wow! The man is fearless!

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you
had the guts to invite

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
the Commander to a barbecue,
and right to her face, too!

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
I figured she
would've ripped you

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
in two just for
bringing up the idea!

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
Not only did she let you
live, she also accepted!

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:21.001 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I know! It's a miracle!

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.627 position:50% align:center
Around here,
we've gotta make our own

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.254 position:50% align:center
instead of waiting for them.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:27.298 position:50% align:center
Yup, yup! Where did you
get the crazy idea

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
to ask her to come
eat with us, though?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
Uh? I suppose 'cause
it was something

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.389 position:50% align:center
the XO would come up with.

00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
Never mind! Forget I said that.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.688 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it was a
huge accomplishment

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
getting her to agree.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
I'm just doubtful she'll keep
her promise, though.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
She already said yes.
Do you really think she would go

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
and cancel on us at the
last minute like that?

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but I'll have
to pass on the barbecue.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Imagine if she did it
in a super-moe kind of way.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:00.248 position:50% align:center
I love the idea
of her being moe!

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.001 position:50% align:center
I think you're letting your
imaginations run away with you.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
Well, now that the first
hurdle's been cleared,

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
we just have to make sure
she shows up, no matter what!

00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.382 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
How do we do that?

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
We get rid of any
obstacle that'll give her

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
a reason to renege.
Like the Steering Committee,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
sudden missions, et cetera.
There are a ton of excuses

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
she could magically
invent if she wanted to.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see! We just have
to alter her schedule

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
and clear anything that
interferes with the barbecue!

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.901 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly! And after that,
we make sure nothing gets added

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
to her calendar for
the afternoon, either!

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
And I can't think of
anyone more qualified

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
to handle the job than Sumire!

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
We're kinda short on time.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
If I do that, someone else
has to buy the ingredients.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Oh! I can pick them up
for you, if you want.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.333 position:50% align:center
Shigure coming in clutch!

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.336 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone!
Let's get to work!

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, SUMIRE]
Roger!

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
You're awake. Child of God.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Or, if you would prefer,
I could call you EL-Cee.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.313 position:50% align:center
Who're you?

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
Someone who desperately
requires your power.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50% align:center
When the Day of
the Oracle arrives,

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
the two of us will be fused.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
Huh? Fused?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
I know you don't understand
your own abilities.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
Rest assured,
there's no need to worry.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
All of us are eventually
shown the path we will take.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.628 position:50% align:center
Guided by this life.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] Are you gonna take
my money, or what?

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.010 position:50% align:center
[DEALER A] Look, I already
told you my supply's run out!

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
Even if it hadn't,
there's no way you could get

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
a Vista Patsa for that
price these days, anyway.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
Now scram.

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.103 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Excuse me.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:50.150 position:50% align:center
I said I don't have any
on m-- Wait. I know you.

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
[VERA] A meal with my squad.
And a barbeque no less.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
Impossible! Imagine
what would happen

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
if I spent more time
with the platoon

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
and opened up around them?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
They might stop respecting me
and doing what I tell them!

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
Also, it's possible they're
trying to gather

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
more information on me.

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50% align:center
Especially that Shigure Daniel
Kai. Unlike previous iterations,

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
he's let Leslie's death
affect him emotionally.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.429 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's why he's
been more insistent

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
about learning the
details of the plan.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
The last thing I need is to
form a bond with the squad.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
But then again, anything
that would hurt morale

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
could prove fatal.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Wait. I know.
A surprise training session.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
The hardest one they've had.
That ought to exhaust them.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
They'll have to call off
the barbecue.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.083 position:50% align:center
[AI A] Due to scheduled
maintenance, the system will

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:51.544 position:50% align:center
be offline until 1200
hours tomorrow.

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Training's off the table,
but I have options.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
What task can I assign them?

00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
There's the Gate. I could
put them on cleanup patrol.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[WORKER A] Never a break. Who
even put this schedule together?

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
[VERA] All right. Plan C. I'll
assign a last-minute mission.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
[AI A] The system will
be offline until--

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:29.749 position:50% align:center
[WORKER B] Last chance!
Sure you wanna go in alone?

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
Your funeral, pal.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.513 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
When did this all begin?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:48.476 position:50% align:center
I suppose it was shortly
after I met Vera.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
On one of our early missions,
she said something

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:56.276 position:50% align:center
curious to me. "I'm counting
on you this time, too."

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Just a simple phrase,
but it stuck with me.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
It felt like she was
talking to an old comrade

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
she'd shared the
battlefield with before.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
I wrote it off as odd
phrasing at the moment.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
But later, I realized
how much she went out

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
of her way to avoid
the rest of the platoon.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
After that slip,
she started to choose her words

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
more carefully around me.

00:13:19.174 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
She grew distant and
kept her thoughts brief.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
Stayed emotionally removed.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
But behind her eyes,
I caught a glimpse

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
of vulnerability
and desperation.

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.312 position:50% align:center
Eventually, something
dawned on me.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
In the Asylum, Vera was familiar
with her surroundings,

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
like she'd been there
countless times.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
That's right.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.742 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
The same Scarred as last time!

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
No good! Gotta run!

00:13:57.337 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A squawks]

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A grunting]

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You're the ones from before.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[VERA] What's going on here?
It's strange.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
Almost like the flow of time

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
is different than how it's
usually been behaving.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:32.038 position:50% align:center
Sure, there were minor
differences before.

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.916 position:50% align:center
But something feels
fundamentally changed.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
Like I don't know
the rules anymore.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:42.298 position:50% align:center
Example. Iceman and
his cronies showing up.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
No, wait. There's another layer.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.554 position:50% align:center
Something I can't
put into words.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Never thought you'd see
fireworks at the South Pole,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.769 position:50% align:center
did ya? Or maybe you're
too focused on this

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
plan of yours to
appreciate them.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
Don't know why,
for the life of me.

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
Obviously.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Just saying, however
many times it fails,

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:06.406 position:50% align:center
or if I wind up
dying in the end,

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:09.492 position:50% align:center
I'll always be by your side.

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
I'll die as many times as I
have to. If it's for your sake.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:20.795 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Thank you.
I'd be dead without your help.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
It's quite all right.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:26.134 position:50% align:center
If I may ask, the two of us
have met before, yes?

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.137 position:50% align:center
We have. I wanted to
ask you about the woman

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
who was with me the
last time I visited here.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.018 position:50% align:center
You mean the one who
was giving the orders?

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
We'd never met her
before, so I'm afraid

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
I don't know how helpful
I can be on the subject.

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.652 position:50% align:center
Oh, um. I asked because
you knew about the ring.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50% align:center
So I thought maybe she had some

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
sort of connection
to this village.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
Sorry, a ring? Yes, I believe I
know the item you speak of.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Interesting how it
seems to have attracted

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.998 position:50% align:center
your attention.

00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.377 position:50% align:center
People are often
fooled even when

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
the truth is right
in front of them.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
Perception is a tricky thing.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
If you don't know what's
actually required

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:10.261 position:50% align:center
you'll find you cannot judge
the true nature of something.

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
I don't really understand.

00:16:12.055 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
I'm speaking of the vessel
and the power it contains.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
Righteous power
dwells righteously

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
within its appointed vessel,

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
but that vessel can still be
threatened or destroyed

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.982 position:50% align:center
by evil forces from without.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.484 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
U-Uh...

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:28.196 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] I'm curious. What
brought you back to this area?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
I guess you could say that
someone guided me here.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, LARRY, SUMIRE laugh]

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
That's what I call a great
example of solid teamwork!

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
And it was all thanks
to Kobato's scheming!

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.084 position:50% align:center
I just made a list of all
the ways the Commander

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
could invent scenarios
at the last minute

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:45.088 position:50% align:center
to get out of showing up
for the dinner.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
It was Sumire who actually
hijacked the system and

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
made sure there were no
unexpected interruptions.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.137 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure, I did
the operations work,

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.014 position:50% align:center
but that stuff's
pretty cut and dry.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
Larry deserves credit
for the clever idea.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
Mission accomplished!

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
Now the Commander
won't have any choice

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.980 position:50% align:center
but to stuff her face
with the rest of us!

00:17:02.063 --> 00:17:05.191 position:50% align:center
All that's left is
getting everything ready.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Problem is, we still need food.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.322 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Maybe it's just taking
him a while 'cause he

00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
bought so much.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
Don't you think
it's kinda weird?

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
Him going alone.
He's not usually the type

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
to take off on his own
like that, you know?

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It kinda makes you
wonder what he's up to.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.796 position:50% align:center
And the way he
acted this morning.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
Almost like he was hiding
something from the rest of us.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Where are you, Shigure?!

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay, back up!
This doesn't make sense!

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
The plan was for him to go and
buy barbeque ingredients, right?

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.493 position:50% align:center
So why the heck are you guys
looking for him out at the Gate?

00:17:56.576 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you've got a point.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.246 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] You're out here,
too. Why'd you come?

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.082 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not quite sure either.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What're you guys doing out here?

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I was late.
I sorta got caught up.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, SUMIRE]
Uh--

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.675 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
She didn't show.
I can't believe it.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.685 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, LARRY exhale]

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:25.438 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, guys.
I thought maybe the XO

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
would've acted like
the bridge between us

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
and the Commander, but I
guess at the end of the day,

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
I'm just not the XO, am I?

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
C'mon. Let's wait
just a little longer.

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
We'll light some fireworks
until she arrives.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
Sounds great!

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
Like we did that time before!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.009 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I can't stay here!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
I've gotta go talk
to the Commander!

00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.098 position:50% align:center
This is Shigure Daniel Kai!

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
Commander. Permission
to enter, please.

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are you doing?

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:29.085 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nothing, I'm sorry.
I figured this is what

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
the XO would do
if they were here.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
Can you forgive me?

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Before. When I shouted.

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:46.936 position:50% align:center
This whole thing was your idea!
And the XO's dead 'cause of it!

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
Admit it! You're upset!

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
I let my emotions control me.
And I wish I could take it back.

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.528 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Don't worry.
It's a common occurrence

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
when a new soldier at
the Front encounters death.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.824 position:50% align:center
Especially a comrade's.

00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
It wasn't just that.

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.412 position:50% align:center
I could tell you were lying
about not being sad.

00:20:04.496 --> 00:20:06.831 position:50% align:center
There was something
behind your eyes.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
[VERA] I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
It's true.

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
When it comes to the Asylum,
death can't be prevented.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:16.716 position:50% align:center
So you can't let
every one affect you.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
I know. But still...

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
I thought that maybe
you were dealing

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
with feelings that you
hid from the rest of us.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
If you truly weren't
bothered by their death,

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't be someone
they could care so deeply for.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:34.484 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Ridiculous.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I don't really know why this
plan is so important to you.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
But I do know this:

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.995 position:50% align:center
I swear. No matter how
many times it fails,

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.164 position:50% align:center
I'll always be by your side.

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
[VERA] I think I understand
why this timeline

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:13.356 position:50% align:center
feels so different.
It's because of them.

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:19.154 position:50% align:center
[VERA] It's the relationship
between the members of the team.

00:21:19.237 --> 00:21:21.031 position:50% align:center
How they interact.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
[VERA] A closeness that
hasn't existed until now.

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You came.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.766 position:50% align:center
Did I make it in time?

00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.477 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO chuckles]

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes!

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:03.448 position:50% align:center
Huh? She wants to see me?

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
It's Shigure Daniel Kai.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:06.701 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Enter.

00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.204 position:50% align:center
Yes, Commander?

00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
I'll make this as
short as possible.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:14.292 position:50% align:center
I'm removing you
from the platoon.
