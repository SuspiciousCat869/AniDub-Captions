[ANNOUNCER B] Squad Eleven
is returning to base.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
Gate personnel,
you are to prepare

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.314 position:50% align:center
for animation procedures.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
How is this happening?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.110 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Squad Eleven
is returning to base...

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
[NURSE A]
Here are their possessions.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
We know their cause of death,

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
so normally this wouldn't
be necessary.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
But rules are rules, so
we'll have to investigate.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.874 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Fine.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.019 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:05.607 position:50% align:center
[NADIA] I should ask,
I think. Are you okay?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.444 position:50% align:center
Perfect. Don't worry about me.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:12.989 position:50% align:center
Where are you going?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
This job's far from
being completed.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
[gunshot]

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Good evening to you all.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
Sorry to crash your party,
but all of you are my prisoners.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.982 position:50% align:center
[HOTEP] We should be far from
danger now, thank goodness.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.569 position:50% align:center
Honestly, we were lucky
to make it out alive!

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:15.904 position:50% align:center
Where's the child?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
The poor girl is exhausted.
But safe, at least.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center
Good to hear. We should
keep on moving.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
What? You mean we're not
out of harm's way yet?

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.414 position:50% align:center
Based on the nature
of that attack,

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.333 position:50% align:center
Iceman was behind it.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
And he's the persistent type.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
One of the worst character
traits you can have.

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
Always know when to
throw in the towel.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
That's my motto.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.942 position:50% align:center
I wonder...

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
What's going to happen
to Squad Eleven now?

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:03.743 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Excuse me.
XO Leslie Blanc's possessions.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
I've been sent
to gather them up.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
I don't think there
are any in here.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.626 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] You may want to try
looking in the officer's lounge.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.255 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll go check
there. Thank you.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:16.589 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
One sec.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
What is it?

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.387 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just-- Would you
mind if I helped you out?

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess that's okay.
You ready? C'mon then.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.320 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
I suppose that's all.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
Only thing left is to
pack them all into boxes.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.701 position:50% align:center
But let's take a break first.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] The XO, did you
know them a long time?

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
Uh-- No. Only for a few months.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's surprising.

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.629 position:50% align:center
Offering to help
pack their things

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.424 position:50% align:center
made me think you were closer.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
Where are you going, Larry?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Dunno. Out.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
also gonna leave.

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
Just for a little while.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
Wait, what're you--?

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
Seriously! Thank you
guys for all the help!

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.487 position:50% align:center
It would've taken a lot longer
if I had to do it by myself.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.948 position:50% align:center
Your platoon's really got
the teamwork thing down.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
Right. Wait here.
And I'll go get the cart.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.206 position:50% align:center
I'm glad we were able to
pack up their things together.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
So, do we get the chance to
meet with their family now?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
I'm not really sure.

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:18.878 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
We've been over this before.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Around here, death is
a common occurrence.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.262 position:50% align:center
When someone dies,
the body is returned to base.

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
Their things are
packed up and

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
in a few days, a new
Sleeper replaces them.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.477 position:50% align:center
Then the missions begin again.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.981 position:50% align:center
That's what counts as normal
at the Antarctic Front.

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
You can't let every
single death get to you,

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
otherwise your mind
won't last very long.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
I've never gone through a dead
person's personal stuff before.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
I get what you're saying,
but why'd you help out, then?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
Shigure reporting.

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Enter.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
I'll cut right to the chase.
We're trying the plan again.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
So, you're still on standby.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
The new date and details
will be sent over later.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.309 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
That will be all. Dismissed.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Um...

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
What is it?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.067 position:50% align:center
I would like you to tell me what
the point of this mission is.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
That's on a need-to-know basis.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:31.368 position:50% align:center
No, I-I deserve an answer.
Because of this plan, they're--

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.124 position:50% align:center
[VERA] "Because of this
plan, they're" what?

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
Listen. All I want to
know is the reason

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.088 position:50% align:center
why we have to execute EL-Cee.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
Whether it was worth
the XO giving their life.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
[VERA] We planned out
the assassination.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
Attempted it.
And ultimately failed.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.016 position:50% align:center
Their death meant
no more, no less.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that make you sad?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Why should it?

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
This whole thing was your idea!
And the XO's dead 'cause of it!

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
Admit it! You're upset!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.540 position:50% align:center
If I said I was,
would that satisfy you?

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Is that going
to bring them back?

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.720 position:50% align:center
You're right. I apologize.

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Returning to the point.

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:35.598 position:50% align:center
The plan still has
the greenlight.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.810 position:50% align:center
If you want out,
then now's the time to say.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
So refusing the job
is an option?

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.731 position:50% align:center
Of course it is.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
All right. Then,
let's say that I do.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
What would happen after that?

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
I can't force you
to change your mind.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Let me think about it.
For now, that's my decision.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
[VERA] You have three days.
Give me your answer by then.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
XO... Why?

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
Why are you so committed

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
to making sure this
mission succeeds?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
Because it's an order
and I'm a loyal soldier.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.789 position:50% align:center
But you could also say
it's all for Vera.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
Is she that important to you?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
She's bet everything on this
plan ending in victory.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How come?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
But I can tell she's
pretty desperate.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
And I want to help her by
making sure it gets done.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] The Commander,
acting desperate.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:57.764 position:50% align:center
It's hard to imagine that.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.808 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] She can be kind of
sweet when she puts in

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
the effort. Even gave me
a good-luck charm

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
to take along specifically
for this mission.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
Sorry? The XO's possessions?

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
As far as I know, they haven't
been shipped out yet.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.115 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] There's something
I wanted to look for.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No, I don't mean anything weird!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
It's sort of a gift.

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
They said our Commander gave
it to them for good luck.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
Normally, that goes
against our protocol.

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
But I guess you can look.
Make it quick, though.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
I really appreciate this.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:39.055 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but did you find it yet?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
Still looking.
I'll pack this up.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] The XO didn't say
they were keeping it safe

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
in the officer's lounge either.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.985 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Shigure, come in.
We've got a mission.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
Uh, right, understood.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Caution. Please
stay within the designated

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
section. Do not touch the
railing while in motion...

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
Your attention! You'll be
heading into Area 306.

[GROUP gasps]

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:08.918 position:50% align:center
You object?

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] No, but... It's just
the XO isn't here to lead us.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
Who's gonna take
command down there?

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
I would volunteer, but--

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
I will accompany you.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.764 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.440 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Huh? Wait a sec.
I know this place.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Aren't you all the
travelers from before?

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
You remembered us!

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.702 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're
having some problems.

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Actually, yes.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.918 position:50% align:center
The village chief
is still missing?

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
Yes. Ever since I
guided all of you

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
to that mansion last week,
he still hasn't come back.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.802 position:50% align:center
You think he got caught up in
all the chaos after we left?

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
It's a strong possibility.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
We will head to this
mansion and investigate.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
The commander is
offering to help?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
Who could've seen that coming?

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
Hey, Commander. Are we--?

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
You can relax. There's
probably no convincing you,

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
but I'm not the fool
you think I am.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
I never...

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Regardless, the
target's not here anymore.

00:12:35.797 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Commander!

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
This hall was filled with people

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.179 position:50% align:center
the last time we were here.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Well, they aren't here now.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
You think they made a run for
it after things went south?

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:50.812 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] If they did, the chief
should have made it back

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
to his village by now.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
The attacker must
have had a goal.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.492 position:50% align:center
Who's to say that taking those
people wasn't part of it?

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
We can't rule that out yet.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.581 position:50% align:center
Let's look around and see
if we can find any clues.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center

do if you get separated

from the rest of the squad.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Shigure! Come and see this.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
Um, right!

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
It appears that someone
took the car.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You're kidding.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Nope. Looks like
they had trouble, though.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
Seems the tires must have
gotten stuck in the mud.

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
Kobato's right.
Whatever happened here,

00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
it's giving me a creepy vibe.

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
[VERA] The three of you
follow the tracks.

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.134 position:50% align:center
You're staying?

00:14:03.218 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
There's something I have
to take care of on my own.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.645 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I think it's time
one of you told me already.

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
Where's the Child of God?

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.733 position:50% align:center
We're telling you the truth--
we really don't know!

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:19.984 position:50% align:center
We're merely guests!

00:14:20.068 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
Meant to celebrate her
birthday, nothing more!

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center

like I should care.

the matter, Nadia?

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
Platoon Eleven is here.

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
Are they? Just the three
kids from last time?

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
[NADIA] No. There's four
of them, I think.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's a full squad.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.880 position:50% align:center
Then the Commander
herself is with them.

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
This is dangerous, I think.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
Especially since
you're minus one arm.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Point taken.
Let's call it a day.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
I'm heading home now.
I'm gonna go and get some rest.

Then, we're free to go?

Are they here by

00:15:18.209 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
Hardly.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
It was the two of them.

in close quarters.

We can't use our FIBEs in here.

Then we won't, but we can't
let those people die!

what is our next play?

What would the XO do?

[gasps]

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.458 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sumire?

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Yes. I'm here.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Is there any position
around here that's located

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
on higher ground and would make
for a good sniper's nest?

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.759 position:50% align:center
Stand by while I look.

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
I found two locations. To
the southeast, 120 meters.

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
Then to the south-southwest,
200 meters away.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Of the two,
which is the safer position?

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.523 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] In my opinion,
south-southwest.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:46.983 position:50% align:center
It's pretty high up.

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:47.984 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Understood.

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
That's pretty clever of you.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
It sounds like we may have found
where the enemy's hiding out.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
Seems so. I'll lay down
suppressing fire near the spot.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
While I'm busy doing that,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center
you go ahead and use
that shield of yours

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
to make us a defensive base.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.582 position:50% align:center
In other words, we can
launch a counterattack

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
on the sniper's nest by
keeping them pinned down.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Only problem is they
have the high ground.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.297 position:50% align:center
We're at a huge disadvantage.

00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
What choice do we have?

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.885 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No, this is gonna work.

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
What a bunch of idiots.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that would be the safer
spot for me to shoot from,

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
but the view is too narrow
for a good sniper's nest.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
That's why you chose this point.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Ah, you took
the chance I was up here.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center
Are you a gambler?

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a gamble.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
It's because my XO
taught me well.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
You don't care whether
you live or die,

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
and wouldn't pick
the safer option.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
So you're a psychologist.
All right.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
If I don't care about living,

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
you think jumping me
from behind would matter?

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
Now I understand why Leslie
was so interested in you.

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
It's a shame killing somebody
so entertaining,

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:31.087 position:50% align:center
but I was told to eliminate
anyone in our way.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.048 position:50% align:center

Enough of this.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center

It's been too long.

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center

thought I would see you

00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
trying to save one
of your men's lives.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't afford to lose
any more of my own pawns.

00:19:53.485 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50% align:center
[laughs] To think that you're
so obsessed with EL-Cee!

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
Would you care to bet?

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
Which one of us do you
think will get to her first?

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
My side or yours?
Guess we'll find out.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.751 position:50% align:center

repay the four of you?

we were able to keep our

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] It's an ancient heirloom
belonging to our clan.

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
My intention was
to give it to EL-Cee

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
during the celebration.
But we were interrupted,

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
and now she's already left
to go see Master Karateka.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
Looks like I missed
my opportunity.

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:56.339 position:50% align:center
If you would like, you could
entrust the treasure to me.

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
And just who are you?

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:00.760 position:50% align:center
Someone who'll make sure
the Child of God receives it.

[CHIEF]
Then I graciously accept.

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
Welcome back to the surface!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
[VERA grunts]

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
Time for a ten-hour nap.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.407 position:50% align:center
The mission was a total success.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Talk about a stroke of genius!

00:21:24.451 --> 00:21:26.995 position:50% align:center
Using an all-out attack
to fool the enemy!

00:21:27.078 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
That's what I call thinking
quick on your feet, Kobato!

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
Actually, I didn't come
up with the plan.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
[LARRY laughs]

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.465 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're kidding!
Shigure came up with it?

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:40.383 position:50% align:center
You almost sound
annoyed by the fact.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Without the XO around,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.928 position:50% align:center
I was kinda worried
about him at first.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.933 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
I think things will work out.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
I hope you're right.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Commander.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center
I want to do the mission.

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
The XO's gone, but I refuse
to let their death be in vain.

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center
That's my decision.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:11.706 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Then I'll give you
the details later.
