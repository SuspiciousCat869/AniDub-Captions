Everyone, hang
back for a second.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
I've got a sneaking suspicion
we're being watched.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
Really? I didn't hear anything.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center

Goodness, Larry, you must
have really enjoyed that slap

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.924 position:50% align:center
I gave you the other day.
Want another one?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Was I really talking that loud?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
And stop getting
lost in the past

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
when you're on a
mission, Shigure.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
Well, were you right?

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Mm-hm.
That's my intuition for you.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.728 position:50% align:center
It's never been wrong!

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
Is it a Scarred?

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
Rookie, meet your first Cultist.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
To make a long story short,
they're a type of Exile.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.196 position:50% align:center
Here's all you
really need to know:

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
They're hostile,
and they're shootable.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.533 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Well, that's cut and dry.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:19.329 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Right. Enough
chit-chat. Time to get to work!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
Stop, it's pointless.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
You'll just wind up hurt
if you chase after them.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Same goes for love.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
Great advice.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] You guys in the back
row barely did anything.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Hope you enjoyed the show.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
Makes me sick to think we're
all getting the same pay.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to pick a fight?

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
The opposite.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.287 position:50% align:center
I'm proud of how much
stronger you've both gotten,

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.041 position:50% align:center
but next time, make my job
easier and participate, 'kay?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
It's difficult having
a superior officer

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
with communication issues.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
So, Sumire. What's next?

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
We're up for more,
if you've got it.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] That encounter you
just had wasn't supposed

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
to be part of the mission.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
So I think it would be more
prudent to play it safe for now

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.557 position:50% align:center
and return to this
search another day.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.725 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Sounds good.

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center

a relaxing evening.

What's wrong?

Oh, Um, just...
This little girl is our target?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
[VERA] A good soldier
doesn't ask questions.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50% align:center
Nor do they hesitate
when given an order.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
Understood. I'll go.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
Huh? I didn't mean you.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, my bad.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
Hey, Earth to XO,
are you even listening?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I heard you.
You were just saying how

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
that woman can't stand
to be away from me.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
By the way, are those new shoes?

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.522 position:50% align:center
You've got way too much fashion
sense to be a Sanity Anchor.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.065 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Hmm...

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
Next time, make me compliment
you on your operator skills.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center

Hm? Oh, just you wait.

[ANNOUNCER A] To all employees.
R and R begins now...

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Are you so tired
your brain froze?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
I'm good. I was just thinking.

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
I don't know who
XO Leslie really is.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
Why are you so curious
about them?

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
Well, they're sarcastic
and always joking around

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
with us, but also incredibly
skilled with a sword.

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
They're kind of a mystery.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.615 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it...

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.827 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Guess who, beautiful.

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.162 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Enter.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Listen here,
you know how exhausted I am

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
after a mission wraps,

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
and you're not even going
to let me take a shower?

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:44.803 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well, lucky for you,
I do enjoy looking

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
at that handsome face
of yours. What's up?

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:48.848 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
It's in one month.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:51.351 position:50% align:center
Get the bullet in
the chamber by then.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] You're making this
my responsibility now, are you?

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
[VERA] You're free to back out,
if you would prefer.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
But now that you're
aware of the secret,

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.569 position:50% align:center
there's no way I can
guarantee your safety.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
You can be a real bitch
sometimes, you know that?

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
I swear you're going
to die old and alone.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
I would like nothing more.

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
Well, since you asked so
nicely, fine, I'll do it.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.251 position:50% align:center
I won't leave you alone,
even if that means following you

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
straight into the
depths of hell.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
If anyone's gonna
give me a heart attack.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.093 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Hmph.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.975 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] You want to know about
XO Leslie's past? Let's see.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Actually,
I've heard a rumor or two.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
I think they were in the
fashion industry at same point.

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
Apparently, they were so smooth,

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
they even managed to con their
way into some really big deals.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
I heard before joining the
Antarctic Front,

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.991 position:50% align:center
they ran an ultra-exclusive
VIP club. But unfortunately,

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
after the global depression
following the appearance

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
and spread of Randolph Syndrome,
the business went belly-up.

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.457 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
Well, regardless, there's no
denying that they're an enigma.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
Somehow, they can even get
girls like Kobato and Sumire

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
who never open
up to spill their guts.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] I've never
"spilled my guts" to them.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Our cold-blooded
Commander seems to know them

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.430 position:50% align:center
best, if her trust and respect
for them is anything to go by.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:11.848 position:50% align:center
Now that part is true.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Ooo, now I want to know more!

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
And since you're the lowest
in the pecking order,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
we're leaving this
special mission up to you!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Wait, what, now?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
Doing a deep dive into
the XO's past, naturally!

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.109 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Is this it?

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
Huh?! That's the XO!

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
And that's... Commander Vera?

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
Just look at her!
She's cool personified!

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right?

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm seeing
something I shouldn't be!

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
Look at all these pics...

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Like getting a glimpse
into their memories.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
This is great.

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.978 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
We struck a treasure trove!

00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:01.439 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Definitely a ten
on the suave scale.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
When will it be ready?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Soon enough.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
But the brass is worried
about internal leaks,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
you sure about leaving
this to your new kid?

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50% align:center
No matter how the
mission plays out,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
it'll make clean-up
a lot easier.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Tell them that's the advantage
of using a fresh recruit.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
So, if things go south?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:28.174 position:50% align:center
Yes, even then.
I prepped for all scenarios.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
Well? When will it be?

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
A month from now.

00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
[NADIA] You're taking nutrition
pills instead of eating again.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
You should try consuming
some actual food, I think.

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Frozen, instant, as long as it
isn't in the form of a capsule.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.830 position:50% align:center
Nadia I'll have you know
these are a food substitute.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
It's got all the basic
nutrients my body requires.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
Plus, it's the logical choice
since my time is so limited.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:08.048 position:50% align:center
Kamezou, I know you want some.

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
That sounds less like
a logical argument,

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
and more like you don't want
to concede that I'm right.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I certainly hope you
didn't come all the way here

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
just to complain.
What have you learned?

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
The Antarctica Front's
getting ready.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
They're about to
make a move, I think.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
Huh. So they've finally
admitted the existence of

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.033 position:50% align:center
the Star Child, have they?

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[NADIA] Mm-mm.
Their most important leaders

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
are still putting
off the decision.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:41.039 position:50% align:center
But some at the top
and a squad commander

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
have decided to act
on their own.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.003 position:50% align:center
Oh? And who specifically
is involved?

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50% align:center
That would be Platoon Eleven.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
Think that'll pose a problem?

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
Hmph. Just the opposite.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] That form, are you
trying for a forward position?

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:46.938 position:50% align:center
[gasps] XO?

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
Since you're training
after a mission,

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
I take it that means
you've gotten settled in.

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.318 position:50% align:center
Or you're a night owl.

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
No, I...

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.863 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
If you're not going to sleep,

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:57.449 position:50% align:center
then why don't you
join me for a night cap?

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Look who's here!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
It's been forever, XO.
What've you been up to?

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
With how long you've
been working here,

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
you ought to know by now:

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
Whenever a young lady
disappears for a while,

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
she was on a journey to
mend her wounded heart.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:15.467 position:50% align:center
Oh? A journey where?

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.093 position:50% align:center
The bottom of the Earth.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
Now, then, can you find us a
table somewhere secluded?

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A] Heh. Anything for
you, XO. I don't need a tip.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
So, how 'bout at the
back of the counter?

00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Much obliged.

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.027 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Enjoy yourselves!

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
So, um, if you don't
mind me asking,

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.158 position:50% align:center
have you always
studied swordplay?

00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:42.577 position:50% align:center
Since the day I
became a Sleeper.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How long ago was that?

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
I'm one of the most senior,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
so it's been about
three years, I'd say.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] You've gotten
that good so quick?

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
Well, my experience from
before I trained as a Sleeper

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:57.175 position:50% align:center
probably gave me a leg
up in that department.

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
Enough about how
interesting I am.

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
Are you going to do it?
The you-know-what.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.848 position:50% align:center
Sorry, do what?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.434 position:50% align:center
You know, "The Job."

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.650 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] What will you do
if I tell you?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
Absolutely nothing,
so don't worry.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] To be honest,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.409 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had a feeling.

00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.125 position:50% align:center
That woman's fine
letting me do all the work!

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:32.711 position:50% align:center
What? I didn't say
anything at all.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Naturally, the whole thing's
got you confused.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50% align:center
But here is where that
rule I mentioned earlier

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.217 position:50% align:center
really comes in handy.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
No matter what the
circumstances are,

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
never hesitate to
execute an order.

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
You'll just end up dead.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,
I'm not entirely sure

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
whether what we're told
is right or wrong.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
However, I do know this:

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:58.069 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
it'll probably save them.

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
Who's "them"?

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
I'm going run to the restroom.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
I'll take another, please.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.660 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Coming up!

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.622 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A] In case
you're wondering, they used

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
to be a dancer. A pretty
famous one, supposedly.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? What happened?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A] They quit.
Got injured and that was that.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
No more performing for a crowd.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
They tried directing,
but they weren't cut out for it,

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
so they came here instead.

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.307 position:50% align:center
Kinda like being a voice actor

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
and quitting to become
an audio director?

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[BARTENDER A]
Huh?

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
Nothing! I was just
thinking out loud!

when you go out drinking?

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
[NADIA] Oh, not bad.
This ought to be fun, I think.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
I don't understand. Why were
those guys chasing me?

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
Back up and tell me
what happened.

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I don't know.
I got a phone call,

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:44.944 position:50% align:center
and when I stepped out,
I saw this girl.

00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
What girl?

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.156 position:50% align:center
She was, uh, never mind.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.159 position:50% align:center
Anyway, those were definitely
Cultists, there's no question.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but, I still don't
really know what that means.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
You know what Exiles are,
don't you?

00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
I think so.

00:15:57.415 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] They're humans
who live in the Asylum.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
They might have
always been here,

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
or they could be refugees
from some far-off land.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
I can't say for sure.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:08.593 position:50% align:center
I've got some idea at least.

00:16:08.677 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
Cultists are a type of Exile,
with one fundamental difference.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.225 position:50% align:center
They've lost their minds.

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Randolph Syndrome is mysterious,

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
but one thing we do know
is that prolonged exposure

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.565 position:50% align:center
to it down in the Asylum
can drive you mad.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:25.110 position:50% align:center
Those who are deep in
the grips of that madness,

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
and hostile,
we refer to as Cultists.

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
Now, defining that condition
and diagnosing someone

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.368 position:50% align:center
is still pretty subjective,
but basically,

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
if someone tries to attack
you while shouting

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
weird nonsense, they probably
meet the requirements.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Are they usually
outside the Asylum like this?

about them at all.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
One thing's certain.

could've sent them.

much to drink tonight

[LESLIE] Reality's different
for everyone,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center
and I'm not interested in yours.
I'm well aware what it entails.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:49.819 position:50% align:center
A willingness to die at
any minute, isn't that right?

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.280 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] A willingness
to die at any minute?

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Of course, if your
current version of "reality"

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
also includes explaining
the past and apologizing,

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
I might be a little
more interested,

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.623 position:50% align:center
but something
tells me it doesn't.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I hate to disappoint,
but I'm not here for you.

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:08.004 position:50% align:center
I see. Your skills have improved
since the last time we met.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
At pissing me off, that is.

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
It's impossible!
You know about the plan?

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:19.015 position:50% align:center
Shigure! Run for it! Just go!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] What's going on here?
Who was that?

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
No point resisting, I think.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
Hayden's after you.
Which means you're finished.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
Hayden? That guy back there.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50% align:center
That's why the XO had me run,
because I'm the target!

00:18:48.545 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Whatever the reason,

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
it's not right to
let you get away.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.008 position:50% align:center
Kamezou!

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Heh. You never did have much
luck hitting your target.

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
Same goes for your
personal life, too.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
That blast! The XO!

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't worry.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
Hayden is still alive
back there, I think.

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
I mean, he is always
going on about how

00:19:21.953 --> 00:19:23.788 position:50% align:center
he's willing to die
and all, but...

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.373 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:28.168 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Those who were willing
to die have all left this place.

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
Long gone.

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
Get him, Kamezou!

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:42.640 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE growls]

00:19:42.724 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
[NADIA gasps]

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.566 position:50% align:center
He's running back there?
Strange, I think.

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I will remove anyone
who interferes with the mission.

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:03.870 position:50% align:center
Even you, Leslie. Got it?

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Is that right? Because
what I'm actually hearing

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
is that you'd rather shoot me

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.251 position:50% align:center
than let anyone
else have my heart.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
Heh. You really haven't changed.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.506 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE yells]

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
XO! Hide somewhere quick!

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Very well. Consider
today merely an introduction.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:35.610 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] We'll see
each other again, Leslie.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:39.114 position:50% align:center
You, too, my young
Sleeper friend.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
[sighs] You really don't know
how to follow orders.

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:50.458 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you to run?

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
I did at first, but then
I remembered what you said.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
About how anyone who came here
willing to die has already left.

00:20:58.675 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I want to live.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:07.058 position:50% align:center
I don't want to die, and I
don't want you too, either.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center
So I stayed. I couldn't
run away and leave you.

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:16.568 position:50% align:center
That guy shooting
at us back there...

00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. Not my place, sorry.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
You're right, it's not, but it's
true--he and I have a past.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.411 position:50% align:center
A very distant one.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.208 position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.210 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
There's no shame in admitting

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.588 position:50% align:center
when you don't understand
something, you know.

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
As complex and
mysterious as I am,

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
you can't hope to
comprehend me so easily.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.721 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I understand that, too.

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
Just putting it out there,

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
tonight was an
astonishing failure.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
Thing is, he seems
intriguing, I think.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.455 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
EL-Cee will be ours soon enough.
