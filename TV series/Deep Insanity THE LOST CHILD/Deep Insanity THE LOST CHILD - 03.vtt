[VERA]
I'll cut right to the chase.

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.061 position:50% align:center
I'd like to send you out
on a special mission.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
I need you to go and
assassinate someone.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] An assassination.
Is that part of a Sleeper's job?

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Hey, whassa matter, mumbly?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
I'm here if you need to talk.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.324 position:50% align:center
Um, well...

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
[VERA] I'm sure you don't
need me to tell you,

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
but this is classified.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
No. I'm good, but thanks.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
Anyway, was there something
you wanted to ask me about?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.628 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Mm-hm. We're not on duty
tomorrow. You heard, right?

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:49.382 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Me, Sumire,
Kobato, and XO Leslie

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
are gonna make the trip out to
Cliff Town for a little R and R.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
So? You wanna come with?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
What is Cliff Town?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] As you can see, with
Randolph Syndrome continuing

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.365 position:50% align:center
to spread and worsen,

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
this will not be a
temporary phenomenon.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.954 position:50% align:center
It goes without saying
that society is on the cusp,

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.664 position:50% align:center
and we are about experience

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:47.500 position:50% align:center
the sixth mass die-off
in Earth's history.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.211 position:50% align:center
All evidence points
to this conclusion.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
Is humanity in danger?

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
Yes, from a certain
point of view.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
However, this also presents us
the opportunity to change

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:01.097 position:50% align:center
what the definition
of "humanity" is.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
Now's the time!
We must look to the future

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.186 position:50% align:center
and advance our plans
for a revolution.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.522 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Hello, sir. If you would.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.832 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Wonderful speech, and
the audience seemed to like it.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
I could hear the
applause from outside.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.837 position:50% align:center
In the end,
it's all just for show.

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.465 position:50% align:center
Those people don't
understand anything.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
I thought what you had to say

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.803 position:50% align:center
was incredibly straightforward
and catchy.

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
It was more than enough to turn

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
a simple grunt like me
into a devoted fan.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50% align:center
That's because
you're intelligent.

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
Smart people steer
clear of politics,

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
unlike my "captive"
audience today.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
Trying to actively
discuss this subject

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
with them would be pointless.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
Per the original plan,
you'll be reaching out

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
more to wealthy capitalists now?

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.701 position:50% align:center
No. It's about time for
the real work to begin.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
You agree, Hayden. Don't you?

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] All right, we'll meet
back here at 1400 hours.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE, KOBATO]
Roger that, sir.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:23.054 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] We finally
get a day off and that's

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
what you decided to wear out?

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
Really? You ladies deserve
to show off a bit more!

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
I could teach you a thing
or two if you wanted.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have to pass.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
Same for me.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Fine then. Suit yourselves.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
Everyone's splitting up to go
do their own thing, huh?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.529 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
Who wants to waste
primo private time

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:43.116 position:50% align:center
hovering around their coworkers?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
But I won't complain if you
wanted to tag along with me.

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
Why, where are you going?

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.207 position:50% align:center
[LARRY laughs]
Shopping, duh!

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] I'll take this. And
this. Oh, and these, too!

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
D'you got that thing
I asked about

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
the last time I was in here?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
No luck, my friend.

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Sadly, there aren't enough
down below these days,

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
so it's been forever since
we've gotten a shipment in.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Ah, for real?

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
The damage caused by Randolph
Syndrome knows no bounds!

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
So uh, that store back there.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] They sell black
market medical devices.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.692 position:50% align:center
Uh. Do you mean, like...?

00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
I also do operations!
But that's just for fun.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.741 position:50% align:center
Should've known he was
telling the truth...

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
[THUG A] Shut up and hand over
whatever you've got on you!

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
[DEALER A] I would, I swear,
but I'm fresh out!

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
Then I guess you'd better go

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
and steal some from
another dealer, huh?

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50% align:center
--[DEALER A groaning]
--Tch.

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Oh! Would ya look at that!

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
An old-fashioned street brawl!

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
So unreal! Nobody's committed
an act of lameness

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
of this magnitude in
like, over 50 years!

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Careful!

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid! Think you're smart

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
shooting your mouth off
in front of us like that?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
Well, that's all relative,
I guess.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
But compared to people who
waste their time in alleys

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.734 position:50% align:center
making threats and
bruising their fists

00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:00.860 position:50% align:center
on each other's faces,

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
my brain is in
perfect working order!

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Sounds like this runt
is looking for a beatin',

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
doesn't it?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
You better watch out!
Unfortunately for you guys,

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
I brought along a hero
who protects the weak

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
from scumbags like you.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
[THUG A]
Really? I don't see 'em.

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.295 position:50% align:center
Could we just talk?

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
[THUGS grunting]

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
[THUGS groaning]

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:30.348 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Surprise!
Thought you might've figured

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
that one out on
your own, though.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
As a Sleeper,
your athletic abilities

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.354 position:50% align:center
are a bit different
from normal folks.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
I know you just joined,
but you've already

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:41.192 position:50% align:center
been through some tough battles.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.070 position:50% align:center
So these wimps never
stood a chance against you.

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just about
time to meet up

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
with the rest of the squad...

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
[DEALER A]
Wait! You're Sleepers?

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.331 position:50% align:center
I need a huge favor!

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.750 position:50% align:center
Well, let's hear what it is.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
We might be able
to help you out.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
For a moderate fee, naturally.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE exhales]
And they're totes late.

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
What's that look?

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
It's just the way
you're talking...

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
Whatever, it's not like
we're on duty.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Sorry! I kept seeing
places I wanted to stop by.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.228 position:50% align:center
But I picked up some
fun stuff for you two!

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:18.897 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
You're such a mom.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] My only concern is
whether all those boxes

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
are going to fit in the car.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
--[ding]
--[GROUP] Huh?

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
Larry's on some kind
of special errand?

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
"No need to wait up," he says.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
That boy, I swear.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
I don't like this.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.537 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Yeah. I've got a bad feeling.

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
So, what is this favor?

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
The kinda job only a Sleeper
can do, you follow me?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
[DEALER A] This tree here
grows in the Asylum,

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
and its seeds
fetch a high price.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
I gotta have 'em.
That stays 'tween us.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
In other words, you want
us collect drugs for you.

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
Huh? You said "drugs"?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
You really need to get out more.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
I mean, all that talk
about "handing it over"

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
and "stealing it
from someone else."

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
Obviously he's a dealer.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:08.738 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] You're after
Vista Pazza seeds, right?

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:12.367 position:50% align:center
[DEALER A] Yeah. There's a high
demand for them on the streets.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
I've lost contact with
the Sleeper that I had

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
an arrangement with,
so I need a replacement.

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.332 position:50% align:center
Who'd have thunk?

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
I thought our jobs
were hard enough,

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
but I guess everyone's got
a side hustle these days.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center
Not us, though. Sorry,
but we can't accept.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
We're in. We'll happily
go fetch your product.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.719 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh...

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Is this, uh, some sort of...

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.101 position:50% align:center
A super-secret backdoor that
leads down into the Asylum!

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
And by "secret," you mean...

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.564 position:50% align:center
Super illegal! But the
only time there are

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
any real restrictions
on us is during missions,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
so technically, we're
both in the clear today!

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:50.113 position:50% align:center
Nothing in our contract forbids
us from doing side jobs.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] But what happens
if we get found out?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
We'll be toast.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Nah, we'll be fine! You
remember, right? I've got some

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
problems with my brain that
stop me from feeling fear,

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
so nothing about
this bothers me.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
Just think of it
as an adventure.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.628 position:50% align:center
That wasn't an answer
to my question at all.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Enough talk. Let's go!

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE screaming]

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Should be just
a little further up.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Compared to what
I've seen so far,

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
this place doesn't even look
like it belongs in the Asylum.

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Give it time,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.401 position:50% align:center
you'll see what it's
really like eventually.

00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What do you mean?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
Think of this section
as an oasis,

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.406 position:50% align:center
while we only work
in the desert.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
Since it has nothing to
do with our missions,

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
we never come here.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.578 position:50% align:center
Supposedly,
the Asylum's so large,

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center
there are places like
this spread all over.

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
Then, since this
is like an oasis,

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
does that mean that creatures
like to gather here?

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Well, I wouldn't
call 'em creatures.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh...

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.469 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A human.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.102 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] No need. She's just
an Exile. We're safe.

00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Never heard of them.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] They're humans
who live in the Asylum.

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
They might have
always been here,

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50% align:center
or they could be refugees
from some far-off land.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
I can't say for sure.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
Hello, there.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
We're on a bit of an expedition,
so have you seen this tree?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing? Think!

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.041 position:50% align:center
You can't involve a little girl
in this! Are you insane?

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
We're here for illegal
drugs, remember?

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
[LARRY sighs]
You're wound up too tight!

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.213 position:50% align:center
Want me to open up your skull

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.798 position:50% align:center
and loosen your
frontal lobes a bit?

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
I'll take a rain check.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
Look, this guy is kinda
dangerous and in my professional

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.346 position:50% align:center
opinion, it's probably best
if you ignore anything

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
that comes out of
his mouth, okay?

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.268 position:50% align:center
Better yet,
you should run for it.

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
Boo.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.276 position:50% align:center
By the way, what you
said back there,

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
about how that girl was
something called an Exile.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
If she's not from around
here or a refugee,

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
what exactly is she?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
Time for a history lesson.

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
You know how the Asylum's
currently being investigated

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.081 position:50% align:center
by multiple companies, right?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
That's what I heard.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.461 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Not too long after
the searches began here,

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
they made a discovery.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
Turns out there were
beings living underground.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
There are a lot of
different types of them

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
and nothing really unifies them.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
So the biggest problem
is how to define them.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
For instance,
say they're indigenous,

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
then all these companies can't
stake out their territories.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
But if they're refugees,

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
then it becomes
an aid situation.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
So they call them "Exiles,"
or the banished ones.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.655 position:50% align:center
No one knows much about them,

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:40.658 position:50% align:center
because they feel it's
better if they don't ask.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh?

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.329 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
It's you again!

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
Like I told you,
you need to stay

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
as far away from us as possible.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
But why, though?
Look, she's interested in us!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.713 position:50% align:center
And I'm interested
in Exiles' brains!

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Laurence!

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
Looks like she wants
us to follow her.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
Hey! Fine.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.559 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
So how'd it go?

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:09.354 position:50% align:center
Apparently they were here,
but left about two hours ago.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:11.606 position:50% align:center
The storeowner doesn't
know where they went.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
We've tried calling them,
but neither of them

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
have bothered to
answer their phones.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
There aren't a lot of
places around here

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.197 position:50% align:center
that don't get any reception.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
Besides underground clubs.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.786 position:50% align:center
I highly doubt those two are
cool enough to make it inside.

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Coolness aside,
it'd be irresponsible

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.832 position:50% align:center
to let them in since
Larry looks like a kid!

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
[THUG A]
That stupid brat!

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.128 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE, KOBATO]
Huh?

00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
[THUG A] Next time we see him,
we'll kick his ass!

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
[THUG C] You make it sound
like it's no big thing.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.343 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they said they were
Sleepers, didn't they?

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.845 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.014 position:50% align:center
They're just a buncha losers
who dig around in the dirt!

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Sorry to
interrupt you, gentlemen.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
Uh... Who are you?

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
Some of the
aforementioned losers.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[LARRY gasping, laughing]
X marks the spot!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] First off, let's take
this one step at a time.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:05.618 position:50% align:center
I mean, how does she
even know about this tree?

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
A flower.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.664 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh...

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.921 position:50% align:center
It's lovely. That's what
you wanted us to see?

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:18.465 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
Mm-hm.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.803 position:50% align:center
That's sweet of you.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
Hey, Larry?

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Uh-huh...
What's up? Everything good?

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Be honest,

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
this errand wasn't really
about collecting the seeds.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
It costs a small fortune to
set foot inside the Asylum

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.452 position:50% align:center
if you're not on a mission.
I figured we might as well

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
take advantage
of this free trip.

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
Then why are we really here?

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.916 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you've heard
something about how

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.793 position:50% align:center
the initial outbreak
of Randolph Syndrome

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
is somehow related
to the Asylum, right?

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've heard.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
I want to be the one
who solves that mystery.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
But whenever we're
on an assignment,

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
there're so many
restrictions on what we

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
can and can't do,
where we can go,

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
what we're allowed
to bring back.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.226 position:50% align:center
I always wanted to be free

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
to casually stroll
around down here.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] And you figured
linking up with a drug dealer

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
was the way to go?
Isn't that a little far?

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
Now that is a creature.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:33.748 position:50% align:center
[LARRY sighs]
Talk about bad timing.

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so what's the plan?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
I mean, we could
try and shoot it,

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.503 position:50% align:center
for all the good
that's gonna do.

00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A growls]

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay.

00:14:43.425 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:47.262 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
Hey, she's takin' it with
her--that's fortuitous.

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
Now's our chance to run.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
Yeah! After her!

00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
Wait, what happened to not
wanting to get involved?

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
I'm noticing a slight
inconsistency

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.242 position:50% align:center
between your words
and your actions.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Hey!

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.597 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A growls]

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.310 position:50% align:center
Should probably head
inside that building!

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.062 position:50% align:center
Then let's go!

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A screeches]

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Got a second to talk?

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:54.913 position:50% align:center
Look, I don't have
any stuff today.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
Come back tomorrow if you want,
I should have some by then.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
No, that's not what

[SCARRED A screeches]

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
I can't believe she can sleep
through its screeching.

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
What a strange girl.

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be a long night.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.146 position:50% align:center
Either the Scarred
gives up first,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.400 position:50% align:center
or we collapse from exhaustion.

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:27.529 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought. How about
we use her as a decoy?

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:29.072 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna sacrifice
her to get outta here!

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Before you blow up,
lemme finish!

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:39.207 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,
but that flying Scarred

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
was definitely
interested in her.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
So, we'll make a
duplicate of the girl

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
and we can use that to
lure that turkey away.

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
Leaving her outta trouble.
Sound like a plan?

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.557 position:50% align:center
Except that doesn't
really eliminate the risk.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
'Cause whoever has the decoy
will probably end up dead.

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
So obviously, it should be me.

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.398 position:50% align:center
Why say that?

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
I told you,
I've completely forgotten

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
what the word "afraid"
even means.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:10.321 position:50% align:center
Because of my brain,
I got injured pretty bad

00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
a while back and
that whole ordeal

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
left some lasting
damage up here.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.749 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] I originally
volunteered to be a Sleeper

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:22.959 position:50% align:center
because I thought studying
Randolph Syndrome

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
and its effects
on the human brain

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
might help me better
understand my own, somehow.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:31.134 position:50% align:center
I know the answer's hidden
somewhere down here.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.136 position:50% align:center
It has to be.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50% align:center
Long story short,
I've never not been reckless!

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
I want to be the one
who solves that mystery.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I understand.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A growls]

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
A decoy who's not scared
of being caught?

00:17:50.278 --> 00:17:52.655 position:50% align:center
I'm perfect for this mission!

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
So once I draw the Scarred away,
take her and run for it.

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:00.580 position:50% align:center
And I promise you,
I'll be just fine.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
But if something
does happen to me,

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
another Sleeper will be
down here in a jiff, okay?

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.586 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You're wrong.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
No offense, but you're not
a good fit for that job.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.759 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
What do you mean by that?

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
It's like you said,
you don't feel fear.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
So you'll take risks
without thinking.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
Like you did today.

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:22.686 position:50% align:center
But I'm afraid of dying.

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
And that's what separates us.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
My choices are about surviving.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
You see? If we want to
get out of this alive,

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
then I'm a better candidate
to distract the Scarred by far.

I didn't think I could do it.
Kill someone, I mean.
