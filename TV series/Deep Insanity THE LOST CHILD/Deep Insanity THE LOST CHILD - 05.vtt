cover fire to slow him.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:30.734 position:50% align:center

Mm.

[SUMIRE] Larry, XO,
once he's locked into place,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
you move in and deliver
the finishing blow.

Oh, wow... All right, then.
Guess that's one way to do it!

get a little action today.

you were doing a countdown.

The mission failed.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
I don't need an explanation.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
I have been informed
of all the details.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
You ran into an old associate,

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
and were very quick
to retreat, correct?

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50% align:center

Yes.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center

Thank you for your time, sir.

[ICEMAN]
Out of all of my believers,

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
I chose you for this mission.
Do you understand why that is?

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.240 position:50% align:center
Yes sir.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] Neither your
loyalty nor your intellect

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
earned you this
enviable position.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.496 position:50% align:center
You're allowed
to stay by my side

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
because you're useful to me.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
I assure you,
I'm well aware, sir.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.756 position:50% align:center
Your job is to capture EL-Cee.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
Get rid of anything and anyone
that gets in your way.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:24.180 position:50% align:center
That includes...
your former lover.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
As you wish, sir.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Well, your skills with
a gun have certainly improved!

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
But that doesn't mean
you get to go wild

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
and do everything yourself.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
I know how it looked,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
but that was more of an
accident than a victory for me.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
Something else was occupying
your thoughts, perhaps?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
That secret mission, I imagine?

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.493 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
Fair. That would weigh
on anyone's mind.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
"Why is a little girl like that
the target?" "Who is she?"

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
"When the time comes,
can I really kill her?"

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
No, well, not exactly.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
I mean, I guess I am worried
about all those things. But I...

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
Of course, I can't tell you
not to think about it,

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
that would be silly.
But remember,

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.647 position:50% align:center
you've still got two
weeks to prepare.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.319 position:50% align:center
So let's not stress out
too much in the meantime.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
Also, if you're going to worry,

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
worry about the people
closest to you first.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
Just a piece of advice.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] So, on that note.
Your next objective

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.250 position:50% align:center
should be to power up your
teamwork with Kobato!

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.168 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasping]

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
You're both in the rear,

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
which means you need
to synchronize!

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.089 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE exhales]

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
I do not get you at all.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
You get so frazzled
around Kobato,

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
but you're fine
with everyone else.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:50.016 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd be closer since
you're partners and all.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.018 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean we're friends.

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. I figured that you
were just shy around girls,

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.481 position:50% align:center
but now that I think about it,

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
you don't have any
trouble talking to me!

00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.776 position:50% align:center
So what's the deal with that?

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's just
a personality thing.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Huh?!

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50% align:center
Y'know, it's funny.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
You've spent time with us
for one reason or another,

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.243 position:50% align:center
but you never had the chance
to get to know her,

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
even though you have
literally the same job.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:10.954 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
Also, while we're
on the subject,

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
what does she have that I don't?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh...

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
I dunno, I guess it's just...

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
[LARRY, SUMIRE grunt]

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Shigure and Kobato. Hm...

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.766 position:50% align:center
It's tricky. Ideally, they'd
get to know each other

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
all on their own, but
as I'm sure you've noticed,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
the two of them are a bit
shy about opening up.

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens,
I shall rise to the challenge!

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
I need to rise to the challenge.
Just don't overthink it.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
Hm? Oh, sorry.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
That's it. I figured it out.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
Oh, goody.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know why Shigure
is nervous around Kobato.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
She looks just like
his ex-girlfriend

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
and he's still bitter
about the breakup!

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Ex-Girlfriend? Shigure?

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
Remember who you're
talking about here.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.557 position:50% align:center
It's probably more like he
had a crush on some girl,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.642 position:50% align:center
but was too shy to
confess his feelings.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
Then, right when he
worked up the courage,

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
he found out she
had a boyfriend.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Oh, he's totally a virgin.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.734 position:50% align:center
And beyond that, he's awkward.

00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
It's going to take more
than a gentle shove

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.279 position:50% align:center
to get them working together.

00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
I'm open to suggestions,
by the way.

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
That dork can't even talk
to her without losing it,

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
so it's kind of hard for them
to form any sort of connection.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.829 position:50% align:center
They won't chat on the job
and they won't chat at

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
the base either. Huh.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:41.836 position:50% align:center
How do you force a dork
to talk to girls?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
I got it!

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.889 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
A barbecue?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.933 position:50% align:center
Yep! You've been
with us a while,

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
but we never threw you
a proper welcoming party!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
And seeing as you've managed
to survive this long,

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
that's all the more
reason to celebrate!

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
It's all right here!
We'll call it

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
the "Vera Platoon Welcome
Party (Sans Vera)"!

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
We worked out
the details already,

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
so don't you worry!

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.075 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] He's making it sound
way too complicated,

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.452 position:50% align:center
it's just a barbecue where
we hang out and have fun!

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal!

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
You came all the way to Southern
Cross to prep for a party?

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.752 position:50% align:center
And you're so excited that you
made a presentation about it?

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] What, you got
a problem with that?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
There's no objection on my end.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
In that case, let's start
buying some ingredients!

Hey, you're smiling! You must
be really into that stuff, huh?

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
Uh!

He's my favorite.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.250 position:50% align:center
Oh, that reminds me!
You signed up

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
because of some anime
voice actor, didn't you?

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
And there was something
you said to me, too.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
I prefer a different genre.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.301 position:50% align:center
You were totally talking
about anime, weren't you?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.178 position:50% align:center
Just stop it. You are way off.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.347 position:50% align:center
Can we change
the subject, please?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.772 position:50% align:center
Isn't Kobato like, uh...

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
Like a massive otaku? Yeah!

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
She draws her own
manga and everything,

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:29.402 position:50% align:center
so she's pretty hardcore!

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
You little nerd! I get it!

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.200 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] So Shigure's
in love with Kobato

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
'cause she has the same hobby?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
Oh c'mon you two, that's kind of
a stretch and you both know it.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
Can we work with this?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
I have just the idea!

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Shigure, I have
a job for you and Kobato.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
Pick up the ingredients
for the barbecue.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.723 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] You guys aren't
going to come with us?

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
I'd love to, but someone has
to go buy the gas burner!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
And charcoal! Sorry, bud!

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.064 position:50% align:center
But I've never done a
barbecue like this before.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
What if I end up
buying too much food?

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.984 position:50% align:center
Or not enough food
for everyone?

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:12.112 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] I'm confident that the
two of you can work that out

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
together. This is
an order. Got it?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
Then I won't let you down.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
Well. Okay.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
Nice one! This is such
a perfect setup!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.291 position:50% align:center
Can you imagine?

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
What if they hook up before
the party even starts?

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.588 position:50% align:center
For the record, buying some
meat isn't exactly romantic.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
And if, by some strange twist
of fate, they do hook up,

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.343 position:50% align:center
that'll be awkward
for all of us.

00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:38.638 position:50% align:center
Perhaps. What's more,
even if we're having fun now,

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
we could still die on
a mission tomorrow.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
Who knows what love
would look like

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
under cruel circumstances
like that.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.480 position:50% align:center
Even if you meet
that special someone,

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
even if everything
works out well at first,

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
it might just bring you
more suffering in the end.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
But I think, if every day
could be your last,

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
then you shouldn't miss out
on even a moment of joy.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
That was so deep.

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.463 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] It looks like the higher
ups are on board for your plan,

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
but they need a few more details
before it's officially approved.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
Namely, they want me
to find out exactly how

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
you're going to
approach the target.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.848 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Tell them I have
everything under control.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] It's gonna take
a little more than that

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
to reassure them. They're not
going to trust you unless

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
you have skin in
the game as well.

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
On the day of the plan,

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
a certain event will take
place inside the Asylum.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
You can tell the higher ups

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
that I'll be sending
my men to it.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. I didn't realize
that imitation meat

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
had gotten so cheap these days!

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.798 position:50% align:center
But if we're having a barbecue,

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
I feel like we should probably
go with the real stuff.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:12:00.220 position:50% align:center
Plant proteins only might
not cut it, you know?

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
That didn't dawn on me,

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
but I've hardly ever eaten
any animal protein, myself.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
So I'm not really
the expert here.

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh, well, okay.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Actually, I think
you have a point, though.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to end up
disappointing everyone else.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh?

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.406 position:50% align:center
Let's shoot for the best!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.492 position:50% align:center
You can't go wrong with fish!

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.661 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Are you sponsored by
a sushi company or something?

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.329 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] We'll take all the
vegetables on this shelf

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
and this shelf, too.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] You really think
we can eat all that?

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.251 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] As for the meat,
one cow should do.

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What're you basing this on?

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
There's only five of us, y'know!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.757 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:43.221 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Shigure! We should
get these fireworks, too!

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
We'll light them up together!

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
I admit, fireworks and barbecue
do sound like a winning team.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I'm just kinda worn out.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Sorry 'bout this.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.817 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm making
everything way too complicated.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
I just remembered the barbecue
parties we used to have

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
at home and my sense of
scale got all thrown off.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.074 position:50% align:center
[fireworks popping]

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Thank you so much for coming!

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.038 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I see. Your family
must be really rich, huh?

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
Wow, I'm jealous. I've never
been to a fancy party!

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
There's nothing good
about it, I promise.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.629 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
But on the other hand, I am
looking forward to this party.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
I want to see the XO eat
a big piece of manga meat.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'm not sure what kind
of image you're conjuring up,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
but it sounds funny.

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
Something like this, I'd say.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Oh my! It's so juicy!

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.863 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Does it look bad?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.866 position:50% align:center
No, no. I was just thinking
we've still got some time

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:48.370 position:50% align:center
to kill. I'll get us
something to drink.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.333 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Sit back and relax.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:57.712 position:50% align:center
I bet the magic's happening
between them as we speak.

00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
What's your deal today?

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.298 position:50% align:center
What d'you mean?

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
You're being a real weirdo, XO.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
I mean, I know you like to butt
into other people's business,

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
but it's usually more
like a pushy aunt

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
or a gossipy neighbor

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
or your mom's retired
friend or whatever.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.520 position:50% align:center
I object to the fact that
I'm clearly over 50

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
in all those examples.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] What I'm saying is,
you're really insistent

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:20.026 position:50% align:center
when it comes to Shigure,
for some reason.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
That's true!

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
You're right. I am
trying to help Shigure,

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
but there's a good
reason for it.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
At least I think so.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
[VENDING MACHINE]
Please choose an item.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
Please choose an item.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[VENDING MACHINE]
State your order, please.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
One can of orange juice

00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
and one can of
carrot juice, please.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm? It's you!

00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.607 position:50% align:center
Wait one sec.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm here. Yeah.
That's right. Yeah.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.780 position:50% align:center
And I ran into that boy
from the other day.

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Roger.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
I understand, I think.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
Kamezou, Usazou. Get him.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.547 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE screaming]

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?
That's a lot of screaming.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I'll explain later!
They're assassins!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
Those cute bunnies?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.225 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Just come with me!

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.608 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE screaming]

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
Stay still!
I can handle these two!

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE yelps]

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
I think I have a plan.
Distract them for me.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:53.578 position:50% align:center
I can try, but how?

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:04.089 position:50% align:center
It's payback time!

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.436 position:50% align:center
No, Kamezou. Usazou!

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
You two are going to pay dearly

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
for kicking them
like that, I think.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:26.778 position:50% align:center
It's a Scarred.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
How handy! It looks like Hayden

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
was prepared for anything
this time around!

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
So how should we handle this?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] If we don't run now,
we're dead.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:49.092 position:50% align:center
It's no good. It won't budge.

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:51.803 position:50% align:center
Then we'd better come up
with a Plan B, and fast.

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
We need guns. Or any
kind of weapon, really.

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
If we go back out there,

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I'll be
able to protect you.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.856 position:50% align:center
I'll go on my own
and protect myself.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
It's a shame, we were finally
working together back there,

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
but I suppose everyone
has their limits.

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Hm?

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
No matter what happens,

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
I shall rise to the challenge.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Wait. Did you just
recite a line from <i>Hungry Arts</i> ?

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Huh? Oh, uh-huh. Aw, jeez.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
We haven't talked about it, but
you're an anime fan, too, huh?

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
Yeah, actually.

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.602 position:50% align:center
But I don't have the
same passion as you.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center
I'm not a creator or anything.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:50.487 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Anyway. Let's give our
teamwork one more shot, partner.

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.073 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:18:07.504 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]
Your turn!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A groaning]

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelling]

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A shrieks]

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.086 position:50% align:center
[LARRY, SUMIRE, LESLIE]
Cheers!

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. I guess
everybody just wanted

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
to have fun by themselves, huh?

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
Looking good! Is it ready yet?

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it should be.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.565 position:50% align:center
This is what I was
talking about before!

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
It's like the meat
you see in manga!

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:15.405 position:50% align:center
It's really wild how much you're
into manga and all that stuff.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Wait, you're not into it?

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
Well, I enjoy it, but I can't
create it like you do.

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
I've never tried writing or
drawing anything in my life.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
So it's not exactly
the same, y'know?

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
It's just a hobby.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
I watched it a lot and acted
like I was an expert,

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:37.427 position:50% align:center
but didn't know
anything, really.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.305 position:50% align:center
Even if I like it, so what?

00:19:40.388 --> 00:19:44.392 position:50% align:center
It's not something for me
to be proud of, exactly.

00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
When I saw that you
were an artist,

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
that you liked the same stuff,
but on a whole different level,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
it made it hard to talk to you.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
I see. I didn't realize that
that's what was going on.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
I thought you were
just being weird,

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
'cause of my leg.

00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:04.245 position:50% align:center
Your leg? You mean
your prosthetic one?

00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center
What about it?

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.669 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Nothing.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:16.049 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad I was mistaken.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Aw man, I'm the worst.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find something in
life to really devote myself to.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
That's why I became a Sleeper.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:28.144 position:50% align:center
But nothing has changed at all.

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Do you really believe
that's true?

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh?

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:35.110 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Real life was too much for me.

00:20:35.193 --> 00:20:36.861 position:50% align:center
I couldn't face it anymore,

00:20:36.945 --> 00:20:40.740 position:50% align:center
so I had no choice but to
immerse myself in manga.

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
That's what I told
myself, at least.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
But you, you're working hard to
find your place in this world,

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
and your love for anime
inspired you to do it.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] You wanted to be
a hero, you said, right?

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
That's why you're here?

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:06.766 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE laughing]

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Did I get it wrong?

00:21:18.653 --> 00:21:22.073 position:50% align:center
You weren't saying all of that
just to sound cool, were you?

00:21:24.951 --> 00:21:28.788 position:50% align:center
'Course not. I'll keep trying!

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Me, too.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
I had convinced myself
that I was weak,

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
but I know there's a
better, stronger me

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
out there somewhere.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Good luck... to both of us.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.613 position:50% align:center
[MAN A]
She was very forthcoming.

00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.782 position:50% align:center
The plan will happen
as scheduled.

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:07.452 position:50% align:center
In two weeks, there will be some
kind of event in the Asylum.

00:22:07.535 --> 00:22:10.372 position:50% align:center
It seems they'll
all be in attendance.

00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
It's about to be party time.
For all of us, I think.
