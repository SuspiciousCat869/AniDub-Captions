[SOLDIER A]
Do you read us, HQ?

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.916 position:50% align:center
We located the Sleeper
that went missing yesterday.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.753 position:50% align:center
[HQ A]
Confirm it.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:45.962 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] Results are
unclear at the moment.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
It's quite possible
infection's occurred

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.635 position:50% align:center
and the signs
aren't showing yet.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.887 position:50% align:center
[HQ A]
Recover the target.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
Roger.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.598 position:50% align:center
Uh...?

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B]
Hm? What's wrong?

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] Nothing,
thought I saw some movement.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
Probably imagined it.

Randolph Syndrome confirmed!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER C] Impossible! Becoming
a Scarred while still in a coma?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
That's never happened before.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER D]
We can figure out why later.

[SOLDIERS screaming]

[NARRATOR]
Madness and never-ending sleep,

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.387 position:50% align:center
known as Randolph Syndrome.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.181 position:50% align:center
Although little has been
discovered of this new disease,

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:43.228 position:50% align:center
one thing is certain: it's
slowly eating away at humanity.

00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:46.523 position:50% align:center
As to where it came from,
a deep pit in the South Pole

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.191 position:50% align:center
is believed to be the source.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.735 position:50% align:center
Within this underground realm
are bizarre creatures

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.490 position:50% align:center
unlike any seen on Earth,
as well as mysterious resources.

00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:58.576 position:50% align:center
Despite the incredible
nature of this discovery,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
most people aren't aware yet
of this mysterious new world,

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.290 position:50% align:center
the threat it will
soon pose to Earth,

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:07.585 position:50% align:center
or even its name: The Asylum.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.944 position:50% align:center
Come on. No saving a city
when it gets to this point.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.988 position:50% align:center
People are gonna get
Randolph Syndrome.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
Not like you can do anything
to stop that from happening.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:40.201 position:50% align:center
Kinda wish they'd
just accept reality.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.038 position:50% align:center
Lower you voice, Leslie.
You're being too loud.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
Give me a break,
it's hereditary. Can't help it.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center
Plus, this is my first
time out in forever,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.961 position:50% align:center
and I really wanna
cut loose, y'know?

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:52.505 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, I've got this crap
reminding me of work.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50% align:center
[COMMERCIAL A]
Join the Antarctica Front!

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.676 position:50% align:center
A company looking to the future!

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.221 position:50% align:center
Research and develop new
materials for a brand new era!

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.433 position:50% align:center
See? Doesn't matter where we go,
we'll always run into something

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
that reminds us
about the mission.

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:07.395 position:50% align:center
[COMMERCIAL A] Young comrades
thinking of joining,

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.897 position:50% align:center
sign up today!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.442 position:50% align:center
The Antarctica Front needs
Sleepers. Heroes, just like you!

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:15.695 position:50% align:center
The time to open the
pathway is upon us!

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
We'll be waiting for you!

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
What's that commercial
even about?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
It makes us sound like
we're a bunch of weird

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.535 position:50% align:center
dreamers or something.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center
Fabrications, half-truths,
and exaggerations.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
All in one short commercial.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna phone up the
government to complain!

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, Vera.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.674 position:50% align:center
I heard a rumor you
issued another request

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:37.300 position:50% align:center
for more personnel.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Yeah.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
Really, though. Aren't you
ever going to learn?

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] My name is Shigure
Daniel Kai. Nice to meet you.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
So tell me, what made you decide
to volunteer for this position?

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
Honestly, a hero.

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.161 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.415 position:50% align:center
I mean I want to be a hero,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.835 position:50% align:center
and figured becoming a
Sleeper was the way to go.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
I'm pulling up the
next volunteer now.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
So this is the famous one.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.221 position:50% align:center
Famous, you say?

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.681 position:50% align:center
You mean you haven't heard?

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.641 position:50% align:center
He said in the interview
his motivation

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
for joining was
to become a hero.

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
Even by our standard,
that's one weird kid.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
What we need more than ever
are cost-efficient soldiers

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.654 position:50% align:center
who're experienced in
combat and can stay alive

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
longer than their first day.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50% align:center
[INTERVIEWER A] I understand
that, sir, but these days,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.037 position:50% align:center
we only get applicants like him.
It's because of that commercial

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.039 position:50% align:center
and the misunderstanding
it creates.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
So, how was his
aptitude evaluation?

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
[INTERVIEWER A] About that.
He has a B ranking.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
Overall, nothing extraordinary.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.467 position:50% align:center
But he scored quite well
on the practical portions.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.427 position:50% align:center
Specifically, his concentration.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.513 position:50% align:center
In terms of time to focus
and time spent focused,

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
he set new records.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
[NICOLAS] Yes, yes,
that's impressive and all,

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
but what unit would
want a guy like him?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
[JAMES grunts]

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
Beg your pardon.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
I'm Commander Vera Rustamova
of Platoon Eleven.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
You wanted to see me?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] Commander Rustamova.
If memory serves,

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50% align:center
your unit wanted reinforcements,
is that correct?

00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.292 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:35.710 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] Then you'll be happy to
hear we have someone for you.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
The kid is green,
but there is no denying

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
he has lofty ambitions.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
[exhales] A new kid, you said?

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.804 position:50% align:center
You do know I can't
guarantee his survival.

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:47.138 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
That's fine.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
Whether he survives or not
is his responsibility.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
Not yours, Commander. Want him?

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
If that is your order.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:58.525 position:50% align:center
So, did you hear the latest?

00:05:58.608 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center
Concerning what?

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
About the new kid who's
joining our platoon.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
He's supposed to be
showing up today.

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Did not.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
I didn't hear either, and
frankly couldn't care less.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:13.456 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Looks like you're
just as cold as ever, huh?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
And you expected any different?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
Our platoon's had eight kids
sent to us in the past

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
ten months, and out all
of those new recruits,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
tell me, how many are left?

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.467 position:50% align:center
Zero! It's gotten to a point

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
you stop thinking about them
as people altogether.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.431 position:50% align:center
Both of you guys are mean. Fine.

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.516 position:50% align:center
I'll give him the
welcome he deserves.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
You just stand there.
He should be here any moment.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.521 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Again with this?

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
You and your little pranks.
What's it gonna be this time?

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Squad three.
Assemble at gate three.

00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
Squad commander. Report
to the commissary

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
immediately for departure
preparations.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
Anyone there?

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.415 position:50% align:center
It's Shigure Daniel Kai,
the new recruit, sir!

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
I've been assigned to this
platoon, starting today.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.712 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Yeah, we heard! Come on in!

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
Hello, and welcome
to Vera Platoon!

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kinda childish, huh?
I wasn't trying to be mean.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
Just give you a
spirited reception is all!

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you heard about us,

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.862 position:50% align:center
but I wanted to show you
that here in Platoon Eleven,

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
we're not afraid of having fun!

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, the name's
Laurence Jackson,

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.742 position:50% align:center
my friends call me Larry.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Larry. Larry.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
Can't you see we're having
a bonding moment, Kobato?

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
And I don't mean to interrupt,
but in case you haven't noticed,

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
he's not breathing.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:48.635 position:50% align:center
[LARRY screams]
We have to do something!

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
What if his heart stops before
the mission even begins.

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] All right, Larry,
what did you do this time?

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.
Isn't that the new kid?

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
Do you have to pick on him?

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, I was just
trying to prepare him

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center
for what to expect
down in the Asylum?

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, that's it.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] And the result
was he has no heartbeat.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Good morning.

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:16.663 position:50% align:center
I must say, I've seen plenty
of Sleepers in my time,

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
but none of them had an
introduction that terrible.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.252 position:50% align:center
It certainly made a strong
impression, though.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.337 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh, who are...?

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:25.922 position:50% align:center
You can call me Leslie.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
The Executive Officer
of Platoon Eleven,

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.760 position:50% align:center
your new assignment.
Some call us the Vera Platoon,

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
but regardless of name,
glad to have you.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
Mm-- Uh, thank you. Happy
to be a part of the team.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.728 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Believe it or not,
you've already set a new record.

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
A record for what?

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
For fainting, of course, silly.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
You're the weird new kid
who became a Sleeper

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
because you wanted to be some
kinda hero, isn't that right?

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I, uh... Uh, yeah.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Seriously?

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Is it really that strange
of a reason?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:06.004 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Hmph. Follow me, recruit.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Oh. Coming.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] 1-9. I repeat.
1-9, you're clear for entry.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
I'm Luca Adriano!
I just joined this unit!

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Glad to be here, sir!

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.060 position:50% align:center
This may be a stupid question

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
but you do know what
a Sleeper is, don't you?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:26.358 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. Their main job
is to research, investigate,

00:09:26.441 --> 00:09:28.443 position:50% align:center
as well as recover
any new resources found

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:31.404 position:50% align:center
in the recently discovered
world under the ice.

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
That's the official story.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.283 position:50% align:center
Huh? You mean it's just a cover?

00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50% align:center
I'll skip the details since
you'll find out for yourself

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
soon enough.
Before you go down there,

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
all you need to
remember is this:

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.586 position:50% align:center
Anyone who's got free time
to wonder who they want to be

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
is going to wind up
dead in a hurry.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
I've seen plenty of recruits go.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:59.391 position:50% align:center
[MEDIC A] Make way! Coming
through! Move please!

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.980 position:50% align:center
That guy they brought
in was hurt, right?

00:10:06.064 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
So how come they
weren't going any faster?

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
The longer you're around,

00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
the quicker you'll be
able to figure out

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
the difference between
those who'll survive

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
and those who won't.
Everyone learns.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Remember the rules,
you won't end up like him.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Rules?

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] First off, this place
is devoid of all hope.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
So don't try finding any.

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
Second, you're
responsible for yourself.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
If you don't want to die,

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
you better figure out
a way to survive.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
Third...

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
People who do want to die
are a burden on others.

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.059 position:50% align:center
So do it somewhere else.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
Four, never hesitate
to execute an order.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
All that'll do
is get you killed.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50% align:center
And finally...

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.317 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
New orders.

00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
The team needs to gather
in front of Cage One.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:57.615 position:50% align:center
We're on our way.
Better hurry. Our time's up.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] XO. Wait, you never
told me what the last rule was!

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.704 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
We'll talk about it later.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
If you make it
back alive, that is.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How am I supposed to survive

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
if I don't know all the rules?

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
You took your sweet time, XO!

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Never rush a lady
when she's getting ready.

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
[LARRY sighs]

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
So, uh what's next?

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
Hello, Shigure! How are you?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.149 position:50% align:center
I'm your Sanity Anchor,
Mochiki Sumire!

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
When you're down there,

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:35.028 position:50% align:center
try and follow my orders
to the letter, okay?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.034 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
One more thing!

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
I need you to be able to hear
what I say at all times,

00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:44.871 position:50% align:center
so would you please
tell me in advance

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
when you're going to pass out!

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
Hey, new recruit!
Get the lead out!

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.423 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Caution. Please step back

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
within the designated safe zone.
When riding the elevator,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
do not approach or lean
against the guard rails.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
Caution. Please step back
within the designated safe zone.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
When riding the elevator,

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:13.358 position:50% align:center
do not approach or lean
against the guard rails.

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
Let's move out!

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
You're heading
to Area 2-6-0-3.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
Upon arrival, immediately
begin your investigations,

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
and return when you're done.
In one piece.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Roger that.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
We'll enter via route Sigma,
just like always.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
Watch our back, wouldya?

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Roger.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E] Hey, newbie!
You're falling behind!

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
[LUCA gasps]
Sorry, sir!

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Come on! What's the hold up?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Um, it's nothing!

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.072 position:50% align:center
Do us a favor, newbie.
No talking during the mission.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Don't be so hard on him, Kobato.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.952 position:50% align:center
You know I don't like
these missions to be formal.

00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
So where are we?
What is this place?

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
The Asylum, of course.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
You went through the
simulator, didn't ya?

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.752 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] He's coming
into his first mission

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
without any training.
Seeing as how he passed out.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
Right. I keep
forgetting 'bout that.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:20.342 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] There's a lot I could
have briefed you on

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:21.926 position:50% align:center
before we got here,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:25.430 position:50% align:center
but I think it's faster if you
just experience it for yourself.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Everybody! Get into positions!

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
Magnetic field
distortion detected!

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
Wait. What's happening?

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
Looks like we've got our
first customer of the day!

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hey, guys. What is this thing?

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
We call them the Scarred.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
We believe them to be animals,
identical to those found

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
on the surface, except mutated
due to an unknown factor

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.168 position:50% align:center
involving the Asylum.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.629 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Or to put it simply,
these are the baddies

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.673 position:50% align:center
we Sleepers are
supposed to bring down!

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
We fight them?

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:03.301 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
All right, everyone.

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
Time to get this
show on the road.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the Asylum,
new recruit.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
Now, Sumire!

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
Right! Commander.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:17.816 position:50% align:center
Requesting authorization
to use FIBE.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
Granted!

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
Close-range severing
is effective

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.952 position:50% align:center
against this particular enemy.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
Okay, then, what do we
need all of this for?

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Because, if you try
moving any closer to the target,

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:39.087 position:50% align:center
you'll expose yourselves to
its extended reach attack!

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.296 position:50% align:center
You're up, Kobato.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
Open fire on the Scarred
from a distance.

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.175 position:50% align:center
Read you loud and clear.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.219 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Larry, you get
in close between the gaps

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.513 position:50% align:center
in her fire and pin its arms.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:50.348 position:50% align:center
I'm all over it, sir!

00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:53.560 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] You, new kid, provide
covering fire from the rear.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
Just do me a favor and try not
to shoot Larry in the process.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
Wha--?!

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.568 position:50% align:center
Last but not least,
XO Leslie--you finish it.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.028 position:50% align:center
I'm down for that.

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Best of luck, all of you!

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED B growling]

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED B screeching]

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:24.466 position:50% align:center
Wow, It's more powerful
than I thought!

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
Go ahead and pin him
down for me, new kid!

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.136 position:50% align:center
Where's your FIBE?

00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Uh. Um, well... I don't know.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:32.974 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to die?

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
Suicides are a
nuisance down here,

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.103 position:50% align:center
so do us a favor and get
killed somewhere else!

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Well, not like
I'm trying to get killed!

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
He almost sounds sure.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE grunts]

00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED B groans]

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.307 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Congrats on
completing your first job.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
No, I just stood there
frozen in place.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
I meant surviving.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
When you're in the Asylum,

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
everybody's first job
is coming back alive.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.
Their first job?

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.824 position:50% align:center
Everyone here has
something special about them.

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
Like Kobato, who was once so
badly injured she lost her leg.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.790 position:50% align:center
She signed up once she
learned that enlisting

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.043 position:50% align:center
came with cutting-edge
combat prosthetics.

00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Or take Larry.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.757 position:50% align:center
He suffered an injury that
permanently damaged his brain.

00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.553 position:50% align:center
He doesn't feel pain anymore.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
Everyone around you joined
for their own reason.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.182 position:50% align:center
Though their motives
may be different,

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
the boundary between
life and death

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
is blurred for all of them.

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Each has their own take on
living, dying, even killing.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.858 position:50% align:center
Of course, because of that,

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.737 position:50% align:center
they all bring something
unique to the table.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
So, the question remains.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.452 position:50% align:center
What was it that made you
want to sign up, kid?

00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
Because I want to be a hero.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:24.210 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?
You were serious?

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.714 position:50% align:center
I figured that was an act you
put on for the interview.

00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
My whole life, I was just
waiting for a chance.

00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
I knew that at some point
I'd have to make a change,

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
but I didn't know exactly when
I would get the opportunity.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
And then one day,
I saw a commercial.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:44.397 position:50% align:center
So that propaganda piece
actually did some good?

00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I had to take a shot.

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.318 position:50% align:center
No matter what my odds were.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center
The truth is,
I was just being naive.

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
Don't know if I agree with that.
I'm sure you understand now,

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
but we're not down here
because our job

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
is to go around
digging up dreams.

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
Fighting deadly beasts
in this strange world

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
is dirty work,
but someone has to.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
Thing is, only the chosen
are fit to be in this madhouse.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
Individuals who
have a resistance,

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
and so are able
to stay down here

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.889 position:50% align:center
for extended periods of time.

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
After all this,
I know you have it.

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
I do?

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] We've got real trouble!
Issuing Code 0-1-6!

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:29.776 position:50% align:center
Report to Area 2-3-7-4!

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Rescue your comrades
immediately!

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER F]
Forget it! They're done for!

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER G gasps]
Commander! What do we do?

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER E]
We'll have to eliminate them!

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.163 position:50% align:center
Permission to engage!

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
We've got the target
in our sites.

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
As for our allies,
we're a little late.

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
No. Wait a minute.

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
Is that another
new recruit, like me?

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Kobato, if you would
kindly pin down the hostile.

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
Way ahead of you.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.602 position:50% align:center
Hey, XO.
That Scarred over there.

00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.104 position:50% align:center
I know what you're thinking,

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
but remember what I said before:
if you don't want to die,

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
you better obey whatever order
you're given down here.

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
You guys are being
generous today.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
For the record,
I never asked you

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
to duck out of the fight
and let me have all the glory.

00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] The time to open up
the pathway is... upon us!

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE gasps]

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:57.572 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
XO!

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:01.993 position:50% align:center
I can handle this.

00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:04.621 position:50% align:center
You want to take point,
then be my guest.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:08.875 position:50% align:center
But don't stress. If you fail,
I'll put a bow on things.

00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
No. That won't be necessary.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:15.173 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh, my. Aren't we cool?

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
[yelling]

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE grunts]

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center
And with that,
the mission's completed.

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
We're heading home now.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] I never did tell you
the final rule, did I?

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh, no, you didn't.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Funnily enough,
you just demonstrated it.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
I don't think I understand.

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.616 position:50% align:center
Have a healthy fear of death,
and accept that fear.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
Both when it comes to
dying and killing others--

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.164 position:50% align:center
you're free to be scared.

00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
That's your greatest ally and
the only chance you have

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.834 position:50% align:center
of staying alive for long.

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
If that's what it takes
to live, then I'll try.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Everyone here is
afraid of something.

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.344 position:50% align:center
Everyone.

00:21:42.427 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
We're all barely hanging on,
fighting to stay alive.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:49.726 position:50% align:center
Those who were willing to die
have all left this place.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
Long gone.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.027 position:50% align:center
I'm still amazed.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
How did that stupid commercial
convince you to join the cause?

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:07.160 position:50% align:center
It was the voice actor.
He's my favorite.

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
You're kidding me. That was it?

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
I never got a chance
to tell you all,

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
but I'm glad to be here.

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.043 position:50% align:center
Thanks.
