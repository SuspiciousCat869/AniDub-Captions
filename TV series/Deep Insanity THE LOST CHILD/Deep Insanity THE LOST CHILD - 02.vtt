Ah, here we go.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.913 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Careful.
Don't let your guard down.

Says here the target's
approaching from the front.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
Maybe the reading
is off or something.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
'Cause I don't see a thing.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.970 position:50% align:center
It's here! Below us!

[LARRY gasps]

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.608 position:50% align:center
It burrowed underground again.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.651 position:50% align:center
Sumire, is there
any way you can

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
pinpoint where the target's
going to appear next?

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.449 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] I'll use its heat
signature to track it.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.208 position:50% align:center
Kobato, new kid, listen up.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.293 position:50% align:center
When it breaches, I want
you to aim for the sphere

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
on its tongue. That should
be its weak point.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Roger, we're on it.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.508 position:50% align:center
Leave it to us.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.734 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] Get ready. Take aim--
55 degrees, incoming.

[SHIGURE grunting]

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:10.588 position:50% align:center
Well, looks like the pacifist
approach scared it off.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.885 position:50% align:center
That was my bad.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
What did I tell you? Most people
almost immediately lose their

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
inner ear balance
and sense of direction

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50% align:center
the moment they step
foot inside the Asylum!

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Even those who can
handle the environment

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
have trouble orienting
themselves correctly!

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
That's why I explicitly
ask you guys

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
to double-check your direction
every time I give you an order!

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
Or did you forget that, too?

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
I didn't forget, but...

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
Then maybe you can explain to me

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:23.596 position:50% align:center
why your aim was
so terrible out there.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50% align:center
You didn't come anywhere
close to hitting the target

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.560 position:50% align:center
and it literally breeched
right in front of you.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
We missed our chance
because of you!

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
And who do you think the
blame ultimately falls on?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
The Sanity Anchor
who gave the orders!

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but when it's underground,

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
double-checking anything
is practically impossible.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
And not to mention,
I have no practice

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.454 position:50% align:center
defeating these things.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but life isn't fair.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--Huh?!

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.127 position:50% align:center
Uh, anyway. I don't know
if you were serious

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
about being a hero, but before
you get too wrapped up

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
in your dreams,
it might be helpful for

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
the rest of us if you
learned to follow orders.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Got it.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Since the day you joined,

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
you've only demonstrated
two things:

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
you've got zero
sense of direction,

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
and you're completely incapable
of doing as you're told.

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
What are you actually good at?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.649 position:50% align:center
Surely you have some
skill that sets you apart.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:19.027 position:50% align:center
At least I hope you do.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.698 position:50% align:center
Some kinda skill? I dunno.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] What am I good at?
Mm... Couldn't tell you.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.623 position:50% align:center
Come on. She asked me what I
specialize in that could help

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
with the next mission.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
So I wanted to see what
your special skill was.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.253 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
Do you need some kind of a
unique talent to be a Sleeper?

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50% align:center
Uh. Like what?

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
I don't know, that's why I'm
asking. What's yours, Laurence?

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
Like I told you, call me
"Larry." We are teammates.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Kay, if you had to pick,
what would say your skill is?

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
Guess I would say it's...
brain chemistry?

00:05:56.398 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
That sounds impressive.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
I know! I've basically
read every paper

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
that's out on the subject and
do research whenever I can.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.952 position:50% align:center
I also do operations!
But that's just for fun.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
Like recreationally?
Are you joking?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
You can look at what parts
of the brain a person

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
uses most and instantly
determine what kinds of things

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
they excel in. I can take
a look at you, if you want!

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
Pop open your dome!

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
I think I'll pass, thanks.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.843 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Aww...

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] A reminder,
for optimal efficiency...

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] Man, those idols
sure have it easy.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
The World's falling apart,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
and they still get to make a
living singing and dancing.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they've got
their tough times, too,

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
just like the rest of us.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
What I'm good at?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.577 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I'm trying to figure out

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.455 position:50% align:center
what exactly makes an
effective Sleeper. So...

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
Larry supposedly excels
at brain surgery.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
Yes, so I've been told.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.088 position:50% align:center
He almost opened up my head
for a look back there.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm glad he
decided against it.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
So, um, do you have some kind
of special skill, Kobato?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] What benefit
would I get from sharing

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
personal information with you?
Seems pretty one-sided.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to
pry into your life or anything.

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Commander. Hope you're well.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
[VERA grunts]

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's good to see you again.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:59.938 position:50% align:center
I wonder, am I gonna be able
to make it work out here?

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Oh, you're giving up already?

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
You think you can be a hero
with that sort of mentality?

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.569 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize modern
day champions

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.155 position:50% align:center
were so very delicate.

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:13.993 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not gonna give up.
But take Commander Vera.

00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
Every time we meet, she glares
at me like I ran over her dog.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:21.251 position:50% align:center
Or Larry, who always has
this crazy look in his eye.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
And then there's Kobato,
who barely even speaks to me.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.050 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] So they're weird,
what's wrong with that?

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:32.345 position:50% align:center
Give it time. They'll warm
up to you eventually.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
Maybe them, but Mochiki--
he's a different story.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
I get the impression
she totally hates my guts.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
Sumire? More like she's
a little nervous, is all.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
When she first arrived here,
she only wanted one thing.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.571 position:50% align:center
To fight on the front lines.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
But it turned out
she wasn't able

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
to handle the Asylum's
environment,

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
so she couldn't
become a Sleeper.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
Becoming a Sanity Anchor
was the next best thing,

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.750 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't compare
to actual combat.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center
To some people, Sleepers are
the real stars of the show,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
whereas the Sanity Anchors
have more of a supporting role,

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
behind the scenes.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I don't see it that way.

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:13.011 position:50% align:center
A huge part of
the mission's success

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
rests on the shoulders
of the Sanity Anchors.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
That being said, I suspect
she's probably acting

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
harsh towards you because
she thinks you're special.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
The thing is... I'm not.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Don't sell yourself short.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
There aren't many
new kids who can keep

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
their concentration up
in the Asylum like you.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
You just had a bit
of a rough start.

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
You want my opinion, after
seeing how easily you adapted,

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
I figure she's jealous of you.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
But dreams don't always come
true and she should get

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
used to that. It doesn't
do her any good to pine

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
for something
that'll never happen.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
This room here's your cleaning
assignment for the day.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.908 position:50% align:center
I got it.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:18.827 position:50% align:center
Good luck, hero!

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:22.997 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

[crash]

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
That's her. She's an idol?

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Mind if I sit here?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
Fine by me.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:56.197 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] To all employees.
R and R begins now.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:11:00.035 position:50% align:center
Remember, exhaustion results
in a decline in focus,

00:11:00.118 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
and may lead to
workplace accidents.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
Um, so...

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.914 position:50% align:center
What's the problem?

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.335 position:50% align:center
Nothing, just... I had no idea

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
that you were an
underground idol.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Not as if I care,
but how did you find out?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
An idol magazine.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
It was buried in the storage
room with some other papers.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
So while I'm doing my absolute
best as your Sanity Anchor,

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
you keep cheering me on, okay?

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
What a pro.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center
Everything all right?

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.095 position:50% align:center
I think so. Something tells me

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
I'm going to enjoy
working with this platoon.

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
I see. Well,
that's good to hear.

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
Vera wants to see you.

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:15.108 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] It's Shigure
Daniel Kai. Reporting.

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.492 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
Come in.

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:30.290 position:50% align:center
You called for me?

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
I'll cut right to the chase.

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:35.128 position:50% align:center
I'd like to send you out
on a special mission.

00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Me? Really?

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Just so you know,
you have the option to refuse.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
No one's going to
force you. Still, though,

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
it felt like a chance to
make your wish come true.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
My wish, Commander?

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.352 position:50% align:center
You want to be a hero,
don't you?

00:21:50.435 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
Uh, well that is what I said.

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:56.316 position:50% align:center
[VERA] This mission's an
extremely simple one.

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
I need you to go and
assassinate someone.

00:22:03.782 --> 00:22:07.952 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Do this and become the
hero that saves the world.
