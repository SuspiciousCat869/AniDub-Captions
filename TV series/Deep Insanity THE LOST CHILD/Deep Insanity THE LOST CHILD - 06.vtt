00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
Vera Rustamova, reporting in.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] 
Enter.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
I'll get right to the point.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.605 position:50% align:center
You have permission to
execute the operation.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.275 position:50% align:center
But the continued existence
of your platoon depends on

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.987 position:50% align:center
your complete success.
So keep that in mind.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
Before you go, there's
something I'd like to ask you.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
When it comes to this
so-called "Child of God,"

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
 do you truly
believe they exist, 

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
or do you think it's
some kind of legend?

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:41.666 position:50% align:center
The idea of a single human,
and a young girl at that, 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
with the power to alter the
whole world seems preposterous.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
You have the freedom to
think whatever you wish.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
[JAMES] Hmph. So what is
the philosophy driving

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.010 position:50% align:center
this plan of yours?

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
I don't have any
grand ideologies,

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:56.306 position:50% align:center
if that's what you mean.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
Then tell us why you
are so obsessed 

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
with the assassination plot.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
Are you like the other
leaders who view 

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
the Star Child as an immediate
threat that must be taken out?

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:09.903 position:50% align:center
No. I sincerely hope
I'm different from them.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.696 position:50% align:center
[JAMES]
If it's none of the above, 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
then it must be a conspiracy.
Or some sort of personal grudge

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:20.789 position:50% align:center
you haven't made us aware of.
So, which of these apply to you?

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
If you're really curious,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
then allow me to
make a suggestion.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
Go with my team
down to the Asylum, 

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:30.006 position:50% align:center
and my squad will happily
show you to the pits of hell.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.721 position:50% align:center
She's a hard one to read. Hmph.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.113 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER]
Father Hotep, you've arrived!

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.657 position:50% align:center
Truly, it's a pleasure
to see you here.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.618 position:50% align:center
Someone in your position must
have a very busy schedule, 

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:02.247 position:50% align:center
so we're grateful you could make
time to attend our little party.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.374 position:50% align:center
Of course I came for
political reasons, 

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.042 position:50% align:center
but one can never forget
the importance 

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.961 position:50% align:center
of duty and honor, either.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.171 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER] I promise, we'll
give you the best welcome

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.506 position:50% align:center
we can offer.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.802 position:50% align:center
By the way, just where
is our celebrated guest?

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER]
That's her over there, playing.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.475 position:50% align:center
The famous Lady EL-Cee.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.895 position:50% align:center
Of all people, she's the one?

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50% align:center
The Child of God who
will end the world.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Gate Four
is currently sealed...

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
[VERA] What a surprise.
Imagine, you waiting for me.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Can't let you summon
me all the time, can I?

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.466 position:50% align:center
Otherwise people will start to
think I always come running

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
at your beck and call.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
The mission was
given the go-ahead.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] 
Well, well.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
Do you think I should
tell him the details?

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
Entirely your call, but
if you want to keep it 

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.186 position:50% align:center
bottled up in that
pretty chest of yours, 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
then by all means,
go right ahead.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
I just don't want to
hear any complaints

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
after it starts to blow up.

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
The whole point of our group is
to keep that from happening.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
Or is something wrong?
Getting cold feet?

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
[VERA grunts]

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
Hopefully you remember
what I told you before.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
A girl like you needs
one thing: somebody 

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
who'll loyally follow her
down into the pits of hell.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
And don't go looking around
for any other reason 

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
I'm with you, because
you won't find one.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.798 position:50% align:center
You have peculiar tastes.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.675 position:50% align:center
Nah. At the moment,
my current preference 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
is oil sheikhs who are kind,

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.471 position:50% align:center
 considerate,
and like long hair.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.514 position:50% align:center
[VERA] 
Leslie.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Hm?

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
What is this, a proposal?

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.402 position:50% align:center
All of your orders
are written down.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] 
And these?

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.740 position:50% align:center
Good luck charms
for the mission.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:28.536 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] 
Right, listen up.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
'Cause this mission's
a little special.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
We're going to disguise
ourselves as Exiles.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.084 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.002 position:50% align:center
In other words,
we're gonna cosplay.

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you serious?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
When is the XO ever serious?

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
This is an infiltration
mission, right?

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Yeah, what's
our primary objective?

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] The four of us are
crashing a birthday party.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
[GROUP] 
A birthday party?

00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Father Hotep! I knew my
eyes weren't deceiving me!

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
I'm Jiryo, the chief
of Ruroi Village.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
It's been ages since we
saw each other last, 

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
but luckily you decided to
put in an appearance, too.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:05.281 position:50% align:center
Yes. Hm?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:07.283 position:50% align:center
I've been told that
the Child of God

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
can change the fate of
not just the Asylum,

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.164 position:50% align:center
but also of the outside world.

00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
I've brought this gift, as well.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.461 position:50% align:center
Seems everything is proceeding
in accordance with their wishes.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] 
Sorry, who?

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Why Master Karateka, obviously!

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.717 position:50% align:center
They planned this?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.427 position:50% align:center
While I understand
all of us here 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
are operating under
their command, 

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
I must admit to having
some reservations.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.850 position:50% align:center
I mean, what are
they truly after?

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50% align:center
Don't worry yourself over it!
I'm sure they care as deeply

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
about duty and honor
as the rest of us do!

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF]
Indeed. I certainly hope so.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.819 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, did you run
into the child's bodyguard, 

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Blake Ron, on your way in?

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
 First we'll secure the
Child of God's surroundings.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.459 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Huh. Looks like
the path ends here.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Strange. We should be
going in the right direction.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
Step lively now.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Uh...

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.144 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you could
find villages like this

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
down in the Asylum.

00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:23.318 position:50% align:center
Course, you can. I can't say
they're very friendly, though.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:31.743 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] West side, fifth house
from the entrance. Bingo.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Mm... Hm?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] We're messengers
from the outside.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
I have something to ask you.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:49.844 position:50% align:center
There's no need to be afraid.

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A gasps]

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:55.725 position:50% align:center
I understand your village chief
has departed for a mansion

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
somewhere nearby. Would
you mind taking me there?

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Ah, so that's the
place? Thank you for showing us.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
What was up with that, XO?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone's got
an in with the villagers,

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
is what's up!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:20.125 position:50% align:center
Maybe. I did visit here during
my college graduation trip.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
--I find that hard to believe.
--Yeah, not a chance.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
What are these fireworks for?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.466 position:50% align:center
We were going to use
them at the barbecue, 

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.802 position:50% align:center
but seems like some
ended up in our luggage.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] All right. While me,
Larry, and Kobato head inside,

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
Shigure will provide us support
in case something happens.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] 
Got it.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.229 position:50% align:center
You'll remain on standby until
the mission gets underway.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to powder my nose.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] 
Hey, XO?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
What did you mean back there
about me providing support?

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.620 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] That was so they
wouldn't get suspicious.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
Once we've made it inside, the
three of us will ID the target.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you tell
the rest of the team 

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.377 position:50% align:center
what will happen afterwards?

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.005 position:50% align:center
If they knew the actual goal
of this mission, I guarantee

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
it would end up being a
complete and total failure.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
As far as they know,
leaders from Exile villages

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
are gathering, and we're here
investigating the reason.

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:19.684 position:50% align:center
Once we find this EL-Cee, we'll
lead her in front of a window.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
When she's in view...

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
...I take the shot.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
We're counting on you.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
It'll tell you what to do if you
get separated from the rest

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.113 position:50% align:center
of the squad. Hey,
no dying, okay?

00:09:32.197 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Why are
you so committed

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
to making sure this
mission succeeds?

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
 Because it's an order
and I'm a loyal soldier.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
But you could also say
it's all for Vera.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.378 position:50% align:center
Is she that important to
you?

00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
She's bet everything on this
plan ending in victory.

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How come?

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
 Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
But I can tell she's
pretty desperate.

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
And I want to help her by
making sure it gets done.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
The Commander, acting desperate.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
It's hard to imagine that.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.436 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] She can be
kind of sweet when she

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.231 position:50% align:center
puts in the effort.
Even gave me a good-luck charm 

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.983 position:50% align:center
to take along specifically
for this mission.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
Nope. A silver necklace,
as a matter of fact.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
I left it behind because
I didn't want to lose it.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.241 position:50% align:center
That was nice of her.

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm counting on you.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
With your concentration,
it oughta be a cinch.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
Should be.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
[VERA] 
How's it going?

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
Just perfect,
like you had to ask.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, we're
all ready whenever you are.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:32.340 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Understood. I'll
let you give the go ahead.

00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center
And who'll make the
call to cancel it?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:38.972 position:50% align:center
[VERA] No one, that's who.
Pull it off, no matter what.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah. I live to serve.

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
Wonder why she's
in such a hurry.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.659 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A] 
Who's there?

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] We were told you might
need additional servants

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
for the event.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A]
I didn't hear anything.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.999 position:50% align:center
Wait here. I'll go check.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER A groans]

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
[LARRY laughs]

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Well, it's certainly
not a military facility,

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center
now is it?

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:17.552 position:50% align:center
That was even easier than
seducing a pubescent boy 

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
who's never known love before.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.098 position:50% align:center
Which would be a crime.
You realize that, don't you?

00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] 
Let's go.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
 Listen up. As far as
finding the target,

00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
leave that entirely up to me.
But if something goes wrong,

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
give me a call and
we'll work from there.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50% align:center
If you mean a wake-up call,
I think it's too late for that.

00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:02.263 position:50% align:center
Hm? The XO's alone. How come--?

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Once we find this EL-Cee,

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.226 position:50% align:center
we'll lead her in
front of a window.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.270 position:50% align:center
Why're they going
in without backup?

00:12:09.354 --> 00:12:10.522 position:50% align:center
Couldn't help myself!

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
I'm having such a blast
at this lovely party!

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
Oh, excuse me, waiter. I'm in
desperate need of a refill,

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.405 position:50% align:center
if you would be so kind.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
Certainly, sir. Here.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
 Huh? Who, me?

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
The Child of God must
love making an entrance.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
I wonder what could
be taking so long.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
 Child of God?

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
Who knows? Beats me.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
Don't be in such a rush,
Father Hotep.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
Allowances must be made 

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
so we can provide
proper protection.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
To be fair, I suppose we're
also waiting for the other

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
guest of honor to arrive, yes?

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Pardon,
who's the guest of honor?

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
 Come now, who else? The one
and only Master Karateka!

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.734 position:50% align:center
So what do we do? Child
of God, Master Karateka, 

00:12:55.817 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
sounds like the XO left out
a few crucial details!

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] I don't know who
they are any more than you.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
But did you see how
much security there is?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
Yeah. If our cover gets blown
at this rich-weirdo party,

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
we're dead,
no question about it.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO] Hold up. I thought you
weren't scared of death, Larry.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
We can discuss that later, okay?

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:19.382 position:50% align:center
The XO isn't answering!
Wait here while I go find them!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.887 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Excuse me!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.348 position:50% align:center
In too big of a rush to
watch where you're going?

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.517 position:50% align:center
They sure do keep Sleepers
busy these days, don't they?

00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] 
Have any luck?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid what you're looking
for isn't inside there.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Oh, good. We get
to play this game again.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.376 position:50% align:center
Who're you, part two.

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
Hmph.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
We meet again... Leslie.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.924 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
That's right. Now I remember.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
You're the drunk
I ran into earlier.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I don't have time
to deal with you today.

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.640 position:50% align:center
You always had a gift
for being cold.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
I promise I have something
you're going to want to hear.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Ooh, From the sound of it,

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
you know what my
interests are. About time.

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.694 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] EL-Cee isn't
going to be killed today.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
And what is that
supposed to mean?

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.449 position:50% align:center
Obviously, your mission is
destined to fail, what else?

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE gasps]

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.477 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Hmph.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
[BUTLER] Attention. You'll
be excited to hear EL-Cee

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
has arrived. Let's give her
a round of applause.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:45.779 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Vera! Our plan's
been leaked somehow!

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
We need to call it off, now!

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE] 
Commander?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
The mission proceeds, XO.
Draw the enemy's attention.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
That woman has ice in her veins,
no tears and zero armpit sweat.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] I never thought I'd be
able to have a real fight

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
with you like this.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
Huh. I know the voice, 

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
but there's no way
he's this confident.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
I already said that
I don't have time 

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
to deal with you right now.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.816 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
want to run away?

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:24.526 position:50% align:center
Why'd you say that?

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You don't
mean the Aruka...

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
Hmph. You're still as quick
as ever, aren't you, Leslie?

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Give me a break.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Shigure! We got interrupted!

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Are you okay?

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] I'm leaving it up to
Larry and Kobato to handle

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
the target. Take the shot
the second she's in range.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm in position now.

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:49.718 position:50% align:center
That wasn't very nice.

00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
What the heck
happened to you, Larry?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Come in, you two.
Can you hear me?

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
Yeah, XO. But Larry got hurt.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.602 position:50% align:center
Look, I'm kinda tied up
at the moment.

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to complete
the mission instead.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.857 position:50% align:center
Right. We'll take care of it.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] The target is
a girl named EL-Cee.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
Find her and bring her to the
window and we can wrap this up.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
I don't see how, if all we
have to go off of is a name.

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:13.992 position:50% align:center
EL-Cee?

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.708 position:50% align:center
I know her. C'mon.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
Only problem is getting
her out in the open.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
I may have a solution.

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE grunts]

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
It's useless.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[CHIEF] Please, El-Cee,
accept this gift

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
as a token on behalf
of my village.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] 
Hey! Look, EL-Cee!

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
They're shooting off
fireworks, just for you!

00:18:15.845 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE whimpers, exhales]

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps] 
Hey!

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
I doubt you'll believe me,
but you were one of the most

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
memorable people in my life.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.416 position:50% align:center
Would you mind not
talking about me 

00:18:44.499 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
in the past tense?

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:48.253 position:50% align:center
Even if I die,
I'll come back as a ghost.

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:51.131 position:50% align:center
Hmph. That's the
problem with exes.

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
They never do stop haunting you.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE whimpers]

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN screams]

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shigure?

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.112 position:50% align:center
[SOLDIER B] 
We're under attack!

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:16.281 position:50% align:center
Someone was just shot
on the floor above us!

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
I knew it.
Guard the Child of God!

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
This isn't over between us.
Not even close.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Nice going, Shigure.
You screwed up royally.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
 I'm sorry.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.843 position:50% align:center
Well, I certainly didn't want
him to be the last person I saw 

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.471 position:50% align:center
before dying, so you
kinda did me a favor.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
I need you to get out of
here and go meet up 

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.725 position:50% align:center
with Larry and Kobato,
is that understood?

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] 
What about you?

00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:46.853 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
Don't worry. I'll catch up.

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] 
Understood!

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
Wow. Ha, ha... Look at that.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
Bet this would be a fun one!
But I can barely stand.

00:20:12.587 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
We have to hurry.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
Who knew? Shigure gets
to be the hero after all!

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up
for a minute, please?

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN] Thanks to you,
we can't miss our next chance,

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
and this has to end now.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
I swear, you're
going to die here.

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] You're almost there!
Just a little farther!

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
The XO!

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.722 position:50% align:center
Did I make you more upset?

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
Listen, you get too
bent out of shape, 

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
you're gonna fail in
both love and war!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] 
I've got only one shot.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.029 position:50% align:center
Still, the advantage
is mine with 

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.364 position:50% align:center
that fiery-hot temper of yours.

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Surprising, for a
cold-hearted machine!

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right. Come
and get me, my darling!

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Not a bad shot.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.612 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:07.702 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE] Do me a favor...
take care of Vera.

00:22:07.786 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] 
XO!
