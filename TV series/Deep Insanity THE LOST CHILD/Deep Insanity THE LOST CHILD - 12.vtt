00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.888 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] You guys are the best.
Thanks for everything.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.683 position:50% align:center
It's so sudden. I just
don't know what to say.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
You can tell us how you feel.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.229 position:50% align:center
We're all on your side.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50% align:center
I don't think they're
treating you fairly one bit.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No, that's not it.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.862 position:50% align:center
Well, what is it, then?
Just say it already!

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
Okay, how should I put this?

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
What if you knew everything
that was about to happen to you,

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
but you also knew
it wouldn't end well?

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh...?

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] What would you do
to change the future?

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
I mean, where would
you even start?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.377 position:50% align:center
Uh, this is all
kinda out of the blue.

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
I get that you're upset about
leaving, but you'll be fine.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I'm just
talking hypothetically here.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.636 position:50% align:center
Try to think of it
like an anime.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.014 position:50% align:center
No offense, but maybe
it would be easier

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
if you just said it
to us straight.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
Like I said,
we're all on your side.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
They may have kicked you out,

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
but we'll always
be your friends.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you guys have no idea

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
how much that means
to me right now.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:10.695 position:50% align:center
But part of me is
still frozen in fear.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
The truth is so crazy,

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that none
of you will believe me.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
'Cause honestly, I'm having a
tough time believing it, myself.

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.997 position:50% align:center
I don't think I can do
this without your help.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
Or it's more like, I don't
know what I'd do if I lost you.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
Be afraid, then!
What's wrong with that?

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.383 position:50% align:center
Yeah, exactly!
If you're that scared,

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.842 position:50% align:center
then the threat must be real!

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
Even if it sounds totally
crazy, we'll believe you!

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
We trust you.
We know it's not like you

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
to joke about
something so serious.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.560 position:50% align:center
[LESLIE]
You're free to be scared.

00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
That's your greatest ally,
and the only chance

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:48.525 position:50% align:center
you have of staying
alive for long.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:52.404 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Then will you promise
to listen to the end?

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50% align:center
You're the only people
I can count on.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
--Of course!
--Lay it on us!

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.998 position:50% align:center
I'm about to shut down
the security network.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
That will lure people
out of the Gate

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.293 position:50% align:center
and give you an
opening, I think.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.837 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
You are the best.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.174 position:50% align:center
Now, let's make this a
homecoming to remember.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
[NADIA]
Not you jerks!

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.469 position:50% align:center
I won't let you
ruin this when we're

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:21.016 position:50% align:center
finally gonna win! Kamezou,
Usazou! Get 'em!

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.310 position:50% align:center
[LARRY yells]

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:30.734 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Heh. That was easy!
Should've done this sooner.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.194 position:50% align:center
I think I'm in big trouble.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.696 position:50% align:center
Here you go!

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.114 position:50% align:center
[NADIA gasps]

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
Ready to fly?

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.624 position:50% align:center
The two of us have to squeeze
into this tiny thing?

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.293 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun!

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:55.091 position:50% align:center
No stealing! Thieves!

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
Even as an outsider,
I could see how much they

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:05.518 position:50% align:center
cared for you. And just between
us... it made me jealous.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts, yells]

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.236 position:50% align:center
I'll handle this one, Commander!

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
Mission failed. We're
retreating. I'll need a lift.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.744 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Nadia. You there?

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
You get it, right?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.289 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Intruders inside the Gate!

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.917 position:50% align:center
Warning! Consider them
armed and dangerous.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.087 position:50% align:center
All units, proceed with caution
and capture the enemy!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.589 position:50% align:center
Not bad, but it's not enough.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN]
Nadia! Over here!

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
Sucks to be you, dude!

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Larry.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
You could've at least
tried landing it!

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.202 position:50% align:center
What the hell is happening?

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center
Nothing too complicated.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:08.915 position:50% align:center
Let's just say we got
ahead of your plan.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
And don't worry about Nadia.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
We'll release her
when this is over.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50% align:center
But you're gonna give
us EL-Cee in return.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN laughs] You idiot!
She's the Child of God!

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.555 position:50% align:center
You really think Nadia and I
are worth that much as a trade?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.600 position:50% align:center
we'll just put a stop to
Iceman's transformation.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
Look at you!

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're not an idiot,
if you know that much.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.775 position:50% align:center
But it's my job to
kill anyone in our way.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
And I'm a professional.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE grunts]

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Remember what gun he's using!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
He'll have to reload
in three... two...

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE yelling]

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
That's pretty clever.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.347 position:50% align:center
You must have been
counting my bullets,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
though I'm surprised you
prepared so thoroughly.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
Unless, of course, you're stuck

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
in a time loop,
like your Commander.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever. You kicked my
ass, and I'm all out of options.

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
But I'll warn you...
Even without me,

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
no one can stop the
Professor's ascension.

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
What's he doing?

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.995 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Oh, no. He's gonna--!

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[HAYDEN laughing]

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Your power is safe.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.996 position:50% align:center
I have it with me.
It's right here.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.293 position:50% align:center
Then you know what this is,
and what it can do?

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] That's right.
I got this from you.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
It was, well, sort of in the
past, but also in the future.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.138 position:50% align:center
So you know everything.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
The Commander found that thing
back in the Asylum, you said?

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50% align:center
Right, so the two of us
are on the same page now.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:40.525 position:50% align:center
It never made much sense to me.

00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
I was ordered to kill
a girl named EL-Cee.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
And no matter how
many times I failed,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.159 position:50% align:center
you forced me to
continue with the plan.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:52.120 position:50% align:center
But now, I finally get it.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.747 position:50% align:center
You never thought
that I would succeed

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
in the first place, did you?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
She knew the plan would
fail, but she kept going?

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.133 position:50% align:center
To be specific, she was just
used to the plan failing.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:08.511 position:50% align:center
That's kinda harsh! We only
screwed up a few times!

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.388 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Well, it may seem that way.

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
But you've been repeating this
for a long time, haven't you?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
Just like I am now.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.106 position:50% align:center
I've been killed three times
since I had this power.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Down in the Asylum, by Iceman.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:26.738 position:50% align:center
But then I wake up again--
the day before it happens.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
All thanks to this strange thing
you gave me, and its power.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.080 position:50% align:center
It's awful, but I'm
sure you've done this

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.707 position:50% align:center
many more times than I have.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
And not just dying, but watching
your comrades die.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
I'll protect them.
I will put an end to this.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
I can't stand to see it again.

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Stopping Iceman
won't change a thing!

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
That girl's power
is too dangerous.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:05.735 position:50% align:center
As long as she's alive, people
will keep trying to claim it.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
This struggle won't
end until she's dead!

00:08:13.827 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
The reason you believe that

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
is because you
are EL-Cee, right?

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
You have been putting
the pieces together.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised the future me
likes to run her mouth so much.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] No. That's something
I figured out on my own.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:43.440 position:50% align:center
I get it now. Finally...
I can't be a real hero.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
But there's some
things I can't help.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center
Like if I see a girl who's
in trouble--who's crying...

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:53.783 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I have
to try and save her.

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
[ALL laugh]

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:17.307 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] So, that's the end
of Hayden. It's no concern.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
I simply need to move
the plan up a step.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.354 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Caution. Please step back

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
within the designated safe zone.
When riding the elevator,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.777 position:50% align:center
do not approach or lean
against the guard rails.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal, listen up!
We cannot let Iceman transform.

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
In other words,
we have to get EL-Cee

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
back by tonight! No exceptions!

[KOBATO]
Understood.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] Unfortunately, it looks
like the enemy also knows that.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] We can't afford
to waste time this early on!

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
You're getting
pretty good at that!

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
[SCARRED A growls]

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50% align:center
Guess I'm late. Sorry.

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
--[LARRY] No complaints here!
--[KOBATO] Wow. Thanks!

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Just one quick thing.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
Our squad has some rules
that you might not know about.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:21.621 position:50% align:center
First off, this place
is devoid of all hope.

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
So don't try finding any.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.126 position:50% align:center
Second, you're
responsible for you.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
If you don't want to die,
then you'd better

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
figure out a way to
survive, and quick.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
Third... Those who want
to die are a burden.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
If you have to die,
do it somewhere else.

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
And fourth, never hesitate

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
executing an order.

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
'Cause you'll only end up dead.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
And last, have a healthy fear
of death and accept that fear.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
For you and EL-Cee,
it's your greatest ally

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
and the only way you're
going to stay alive.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
That an order?

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:58.116 position:50% align:center
No. It's a request
from your friends.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
They're coming.
Tear through them!

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Roger that!

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:11.129 position:50% align:center
You and the Commander
need to go and stop Iceman!

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
We can handle these guys,
no problem!

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
Here already?

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] We're not gonna
let you get away with this!

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
We're taking EL-Cee with us!

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
Oh? You're taking her away, now?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.023 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be easier
just to kill her?

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN laughs]
I know the truth, Vera.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50% align:center
You can't stop me
from becoming a god.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN] But you've tried
many times, haven't you?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
You've killed your younger
self, over and over.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
But each time,
it ended in failure.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
If a person erases themselves,
it causes a space-time paradox.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
So each time you
accomplished your mission,

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
you were forced to start over.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.470 position:50% align:center
Don't bother denying it.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
As I said, there's
nothing you can do!

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
Commander! Tell me you're okay!

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.161 position:50% align:center
[LARRY]
Shigure! Where is she?

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Huh...?

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Commander!

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN]
Damn it. The power is unstable!

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN groaning]

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
This is bad! There's no way
we can fight that behemoth!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.697 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] No, we still have
a chance of winning!

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.242 position:50% align:center
Up there! We just have
to get EL-Cee back!

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.578 position:50% align:center
He's behaving kind of
strange, don't you think?

00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.997 position:50% align:center
Why isn't he killing
Commander Vera?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.332 position:50% align:center
'Cause he's using her
as a hostage, right?

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.918 position:50% align:center
Wait a second! He doesn't
care about any of us--

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
he thinks that she can still
cause another time loop!

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
[LARRY] I see! He's afraid
that if he kills her,

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:21.301 position:50% align:center
then all his hard work
will be undone!

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
[SUMIRE]
Then I've got a plan!

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
If we act like we're trying
to rescue the commander,

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.222 position:50% align:center
then he'll fall for it!

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
Move in like that's
the objective.

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.518 position:50% align:center
Get him to focus his attacks
on Shigure and Kobato.

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Larry will
get to higher ground

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50% align:center
and launch an
offensive from above.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
It's worth a shot.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
I agree. Is everybody ready?

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.485 position:50% align:center
You bet!

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.070 position:50% align:center
On the count of three, Kobato!

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.071 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Roger! Three...

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO, SHIGURE]
Two, one!

still incomplete. Look here.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center
Yes, but it's only
in the early stages.

00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
He's trying to fuse
with the god,

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
but he doesn't have full
command of its power.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center
There's still hope.

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:49.472 position:50% align:center
Commander, do you have
the Aruka with you?

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:50.724 position:50% align:center
[VERA grunts]

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Let's use it.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
We'll take EL-Cee's power, and
we'll put it back inside there.

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
But this has never gone
well any other time,

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50% align:center
and that Aruka is what brings
you back to life, right?

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.320 position:50% align:center
Or it turns back time,
for you at least.

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
Then isn't it really bad if you
get rid of it? You could die!

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but we have no choice.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
Despite my best efforts,

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.626 position:50% align:center

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center

Is that an order, Commander?

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
No. It's a request
from a friend.

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center

as I can to him.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.559 position:50% align:center

Here's the plan.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
Once I give the order,
Kobato and Larry,

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
I need you both to
put up cover fire.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
At that time,
Shigure and the Commander

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
will dash towards the target.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
Then Larry and Kobato

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.490 position:50% align:center
will shift their fire
to that big statue,

00:15:48.573 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
which we'll use to
pin down Iceman!

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
After that, it's all up
to you, Commander. Ready?

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:59.209 position:50% align:center
One more thing, Shigure.
No dying out there.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best!

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.545 position:50% align:center

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
If you want her
power that badly...

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Then you can have it!

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.421 position:50% align:center
[ICEMAN groaning]

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE yelling]

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
I'm here.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
Is EL-Cee okay?

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:15.256 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm still here.
So she made it.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
What did you do?

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's fine. Don't worry.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:25.100 position:50% align:center
I've lost this life
several times.

00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
Just like the XO, I'm proud.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
Stop it! You're not the same
as them! You're still you!

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Thanks for that.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:57.716 position:50% align:center
Commander, I can't say
I have no regrets.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
'Cause that would be a lie.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
But I lived.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:09.144 position:50% align:center
And now, I want you
to live. For yourself.

00:21:12.147 --> 00:21:14.774 position:50% align:center
And is that an order?

00:21:14.858 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center
No, ma'am. It's a request
from a friend.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
[VERA]
All right. I'll do my best.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
Now, there's a surprise.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
I never really knew you
could smile like that.

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:21:44.554 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
Are you guys okay?

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
Where is he?

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
[KOBATO]
Is that Shigure's...?

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Somehow, I know he'll
find a way back to us.

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:47.469 position:50% align:center
[VERA] Welcome to hell,
Sleeper. Hope you're ready.
