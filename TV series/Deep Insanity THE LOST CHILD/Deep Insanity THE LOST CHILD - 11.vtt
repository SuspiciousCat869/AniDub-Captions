00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.792
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.166
A dream?

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:46.709
[VERA grunts]

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:31.166
[SOLVEIG] You entered the
Asylum without permission.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.792
And what's more, you did so
using an unauthorized route.

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.709
We were given a full report
of your transgression.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:42.375
[JAMES]
Well, do you deny it?

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:43.583
What's wrong?

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.542
Oh. I, uh-- No sir.
All of that is correct.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.959
Huh?

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:55.041
[SHIGURE] It feels like I've
had this conversation before.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:58.542
[KOBATO] You're leaving.
I can't believe it.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.208
[SHIGURE] I'll miss you guys.
Thanks for everything.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.667
So what route are you
taking to get home?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.583
I'm going through
Southern Cross.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.333
But given the situation,
I'm not exactly in a hurry.

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.041
So I'll probably be
hanging around there

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.542
for a little while longer,
at least, I think.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.792
You didn't want to
go straight back?

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.041
Oh. I tried. But everything
happened so suddenly,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.959
that I couldn't
get a plane ticket.

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:23.166
If you don't have a ticket,
why leave now?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.417
You could hang out
here a bit longer

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.000
if you wanted, right?

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:27.792
[SHIGURE]
I guess, but, why?

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.667
Duh. So we can throw you
a farewell party, of course.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.917
Yeah, absolutely!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.125
We need to say goodbye
to you properly.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:38.667
[gasps] Thanks. I'd like that.

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:41.417
[gasps]

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.375
[SHIGURE]
What the heck is going on?

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.291
This can't just be
déjà vu. Can it?

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:49.625
Huh?

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:53.917
[gasps]

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:59.792
[SHIGURE] If I have this, then
it wasn't just a dream.

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.583
Those memories are real.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.083
[SHIGURE] All of this
has happened before.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.709
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:15.291
You know, ever
since we first met,

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:16.792
I was curious what
sort of person

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.417
you would blossom into!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.125
You wanted to be a hero, right?

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.333
A lot of people join
for a lot of reasons,

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:24.583
but that's got to be a first.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.834
Maybe in another life
I'll get the chance.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.583
Um, are you okay?

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.208
Something I said?

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.208
I want you to tell me the truth.

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:36.000
The truth about what?
Just say it already.

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.333
You're acting like I'm trying
to hide something from you.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:40.583
Don't get so defensive,
I don't know!

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:43.125
Hey, what's gotten into
you two all of a sudden?

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:45.625
Did you have a fight
we never knew about?

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.750
Sorry. Uh, no, it's nothing.

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:52.333
I think I need to
get some fresh air.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.542
Huh...?

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:58.417
[SHIGURE]
No, wait!

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.875
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.542
[SHIGURE]
On second thought.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:05.166
Maybe I could use your
help with something.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.458
[NADIA]
Sorry. I'm just doing my job.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.291

[SUMIRE yells]

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.166
[NADIA]
What a mess.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.333
How did they even
know where I was?

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:25.583
Hayden must be in
trouble, I think!

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.667
Come on, let's get out of here!

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.500
[SHIGURE]
Are you alive?

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.834
[MAN A]
Yeah, but I'm confused.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.709
[SHIGURE]
I work for Commander Rustamova.

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.625
My name's Shigure Daniel Kai.

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.417
[MAN A grunts]
So you've heard?

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.583
Some things, but I still
don't know who you are.

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:48.792
[MAN A]
I'm a spy. Or rather, I was.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.750
For Commander Rustamova.

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:53.709
As well as the Grosse
Bär Director's aide.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.959
Who? That title isn't
ringing any bells for me.

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.667
She's one of the people who
runs the show around here.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.750
The one with the white hat.

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:06.125
[SHIGURE] Huh? You're her spy?
What does she want exactly?

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.667
[MAN A] She formed a partnership
with Commander Rustamova,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.333
and fed her intel on
the top brass' goals.

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:12.917
The Commander used
that information

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to get her plans approved.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.291
As for the Director's aide,

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.792
she was just trying to
advance her own career.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:22.125
Successful operations
helped make her look good.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.542
But they couldn't do this
in the open, of course.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.417
So, I acted as their go-between.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.834
Fair enough.

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.875
But that still doesn't explain
why you were attacked.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.500
[SUMIRE]
No, it makes perfect sense.

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:35.709
‘Cause you were
giving that intel

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:37.000
to someone else, weren't you?

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.542
Huh?

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:41.625
This sort of thing happens in
the idol world all the time.

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:43.959
You buy and sell some
secret information,

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.375
then blackmail your rivals
to make them retire.

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:49.208
Maybe you do it for money,
or maybe for power.

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:51.250
[MAN A]
How insightful of you.

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.542
Yes, I was selling that
information to Iceman's cronies.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.500
And should I know who that is?

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.000
[MAN A]
He's a scientist.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:01.166
Specifically, one known
for his views on the Asylum.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.208
He says it's a sign of
the sixth great extinction.

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.166
Claims the whole thing's
gonna kick off once

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.917
the "Child of God"
is good and ready.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.417
Sound familiar?

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.125
Child of God.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.250
[SHIGURE]
He must mean EL-Cee.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.375
Sorry, but you kinda
lost me there.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:18.917
This guy's into
the Child of God,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.291
and you're selling him intel,

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.667
but what does that have
to do with our commander?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.125
‘Cause it's the operation
the Commander's working on.

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:27.291
She wants to kill
the Child of God.

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:30.041
It makes sense.
She did her research.

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:31.917
I don't know where she got
the information from,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.667
But... that's the idea, right?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.083
[MAN A]
Correct.

00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.667
You're just gonna leave?

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.291
[MAN A] You should do the same.
The Commander's in danger.

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:46.166
She'll be all right.
Our friends are on the way.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.333
[ANNOUNCER B] Access to Gates
has been restricted.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:49.583
All employees report to
your commanding officer...

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:51.792
[HAYDEN]
You're not a trusting person.

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.417
But you trusted them.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.291
Even as an outsider,
I could see how

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.500
much they cared for you.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:01.750
And just between us,
it made me jealous.

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:04.709
[groaning]

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.750
[gasps]

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:09.000
[growls]

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.166
[VERA]
What's the meaning of this?

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.417
Shigure filled us
in on the details.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.542
We know about your plan now.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:30.125
You've been trying to take
out EL-Cee this entire time.

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.125
That said, we still
don't know why.

00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:37.208
[KOBATO]
But you must have your reasons.

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:39.125
An order is an order, right?

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:41.083
If knowing all the
details were necessary,

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.208
you would've told
us a long time ago.

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:45.041
At least, I would hope so.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.500
[sighs] We've got an early start
tomorrow. Get some sleep.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:01.125
[VERA] For better or worse,
it's no longer mine.

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.792
The power to
repeat time has been

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.375
passed on to someone else.

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:06.959
And I'll just have
to deal with it.

00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:11.875
It's not like I can turn back.
Not after coming this far.

00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:17.583
Let's move.

00:09:24.583 --> 00:09:29.125
[SHIGURE]
This way. I'll go with you.

00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.333
You were removed
from the platoon.

00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:34.125
[SHIGURE] That's true, but
I'm not here as a soldier.

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:35.500
I'm here as someone
who has chosen

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.709
to help you of his own volition.

00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:40.083
[VERA grunts]

00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:41.792
Do as you please.

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:45.792
[SHIGURE]
This should be the place, right?

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.041
What's the plan, Commander?
What's inside?

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:50.792
We don't really know what
we're getting into here.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.542
You two just follow me
and be ready for a fight.

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.917
You, stand by from
that vantage point.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.375
I'll make sure you
get an opening.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:10.875
[ICEMAN] Impressive. I didn't
expect you to make it this far.

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.333
[SHIGURE]
I don't get it.

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:15.291
The commander doesn't
seem worried at all.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:19.417
Is she just confident?
Or does she know something?

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.542
[VERA] Don't just stand there,
find the girl!

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:24.333
As soon as you do, kill her!

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:27.750
[ICEMAN] You think I'd let you
interfere with our goal?

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.166
Nothing will stop me
from fusing with EL-Cee.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.458
Over my dead body.

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:38.333
That's the idea, since you don't
have the power to save yourself.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.291
[ICEMAN grunts]
What's going on here?

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:54.959
I'm not sure, sir.
Unless... Did you set us up?

00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:56.500
Finally catching on?

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.542
I figured out your
plan way ahead of time.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.500
It was obvious to me that
you'd try to seal my powers

00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:04.125
before you made your move.

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:06.834
You think I'd just
sit back and let you?

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:08.208
[ICEMAN]
Very clever.

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.875
Then you must have entrusted
it to someone else.

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:13.208
Your hypothesis is if
you abandon your power

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.125
before you kill her,
then EL-Cee's death

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.083
won't cause another time loop.

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:19.667
But that comes
with a clear risk.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.417
I've seen this scenario
play out enough times by now.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.667
A little danger might be fun.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.041
How confident.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.500
But I doubt this will
play out the way you think.

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:31.959
[VERA] This is my story,
and I'll end it myself!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.458
[ICEMAN groaning]

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.625
Hayden! Stop her!
I'll handle the rest!

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:41.375
[HAYDEN]
Right!

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:46.458
[KOBATO]
This feels kind of wrong.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:49.625
There's no turning back now.
We have to have faith.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.917
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:52.125 --> 00:11:53.041
[LARRY grunts]

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.834
You get away from her!

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:56.500
[ICEMAN]
Come on!

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:09.959
[gasps]

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.291
[ICEMAN]
This is it!

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:36.834
[ICEMAN laughing] The moment
I've been waiting for!

00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:39.959
Everything's in place!

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.792
How did this happen?

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:44.959
The god wasn't supposed to
be unleashed until tomorrow!

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.750
[ICEMAN]
Seems you've done your research.

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:49.041
But not quite enough,
I'm afraid.

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:54.041
You failed. It's over.
There's nothing left to do.

00:12:58.208 --> 00:12:59.667
[gasps]

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:03.375
[VERA grunts]

00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:07.291
[VERA gasping]

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.083
[gasps] Commander!

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:38.542
[yelling]

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:42.750
[SHIGURE]
You bastard! I'll kill you! Die!

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.542
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:09.625
I'm back again.

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:12.041
[SOLVEIG] You entered the
Asylum without permission.

00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:13.208
And what's more,

00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:15.792
you did so using an
unauthorized route.

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:19.041
We were given a report
of your transgression.

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.250
Well, do you deny it?

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:24.458
[JAMES, SOLVEIG gasp]

00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:26.834
If you don't have a
ticket, why leave now?

00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:29.834
You could hang out here a
bit longer if you wanted.

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:31.333
[SHIGURE]
Uh, yeah.

00:14:31.417 --> 00:14:36.166
I mean, at least let us
throw you a farewell party.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.834
That sounds nice.

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:39.208
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:47.375
[SHIGURE]
There's no question.

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:50.250
This is what's causing
the time loops.

00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:57.583
[SHIGURE]
Let's see what else I can learn.

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.792
[NADIA panting]

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.041
[SHIGURE]
Are you alive?

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:05.333
[MAN A]
Yeah. But I'm confused.

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:06.875
[SHIGURE]
I'm Shigure Daniel Kai.

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.208
And I work with
Commander Rustamova.

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.083
[MAN A]
And? You know who I am?

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:14.000
[SHIGURE] Sort of. I know
you're a spy, at least.

00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.625
[MAN A gasps]

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:18.750
[SHIGURE]
Can you tell me what this is?

00:15:18.834 --> 00:15:20.667
[MAN A]
Not a clue.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.542
[SHIGURE]
What am I missing?

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:26.083
This thing has to
be the key, right?

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.834
Does that mean sending
Kobato and Larry

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:30.542
to help the Commander
was also a mistake?

00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:31.792
[gasps]

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.458
It's me. I got interrupted.

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.625
[NADIA]
That didn't take long, did it?

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:40.625
I'm still in Cliff Town.
I need you to buy me some time.

00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:43.375
I'll see what I can do.

00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:45.375
Wait a sec...

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:48.625
I'm about to shut down
the security network.

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:50.125
That will lure people
out of the Gate

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:52.208
and give you an
opening, I think.

00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:53.750
[HAYDEN]
You are the best.

00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:57.291
Now, let's make this a
homecoming to remember.

00:15:57.375 --> 00:15:59.333
[NADIA sighs, gasps]

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.375
[NADIA] You, huh? How did
you know I was here?

00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:06.875
It's none of your business.

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.542
[NADIA gasping]

00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:11.250
That's no good.
Hayden's in big trouble!

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:16.333
[HAYDEN] But there's no
sense dwelling on those

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:18.792
who are no longer
with us, is there?

00:16:18.875 --> 00:16:22.000
I did always wonder
about one thing, though.

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.542
What bound you two together?

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:27.709
It never made any sense.
I mean, sure, on the one hand,

00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.000
Leslie would feel obligated

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:31.166
to take care of
someone like you.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.709
That's just how they were.

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.583
I never understood
your motivations.

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:39.333
You aren't the type to
care about anyone else.

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:43.709
Then, the other day,
it finally dawned on me.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.208
[HAYDEN] Commander. You've
repeated this same timeline

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:50.667
over and over, right?
I have a theory.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.333
[SHIGURE] The Commander was
stuck in a loop, just like I am!

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:56.792
[HAYDEN] Each iteration
played out the same way.

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.875
Every time you came to
them with the mission,

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.458
they agreed to the job
without hesitating...

00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:04.208
And every time,
you got them killed.

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:06.834
They died and died
and died again,

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:09.667
while EL-Cee's assassinations
always failed.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.000
No matter how many
times you tried,

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:13.834
they did what you asked.

00:17:13.917 --> 00:17:16.291
And the outcome was
always the same.

00:17:16.375 --> 00:17:19.250
You don't witness that sort
of unquestioning loyalty

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:23.375
without developing some kind
of attachment, do you?

00:17:27.875 --> 00:17:33.709
[SHIGURE] I think I get it now.
I know what my job is here.

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:39.667
[ANNOUNCER B] Alert. Illegal
override has been detected.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.875
Access to Gates
has been restricted.

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:44.291
All employees report to
your commanding officer

00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:46.208
and await further instruction.

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:53.166
[ANNOUNCER A] Alert.
Alert. This is not a drill.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.250
I thought so.

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:04.875
Huh?

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.917
[EL-CEE]
It's you.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.750
Why did you come all
the way out here?

00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:16.875
[SHIGURE]
I wanted to give this back.

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:21.917
Hey, that's-- This is mine!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.083
Looks like my theory
was right, then.

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:28.000
Come with me. We've gotta
get you out of this place.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:31.250
[LARRY]
An order is an order, right?

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.083
If knowing all the details
were necessary,

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:35.208
you would've told us
a long time ago.

00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:37.917
But we're a team. We need
you to have faith in us,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.917
so we can pull
this off together.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.166
He told you everything,
I presume?

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.625
Where is he now?

00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:45.959
[LARRY, KOBATO]
Uh...

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.834

EL-Cee? EL-Cee?

Not half bad!

00:19:08.709 --> 00:19:11.792
Or at the very least,
better than I expected.

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:14.750
But we're still
taking back EL-Cee!

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.959
[NADIA] You're full of
surprises, I'll say that much.

00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:18.125
But you won't win.

00:19:18.208 --> 00:19:19.417
[SHIGURE]
EL-Cee!

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:25.834
[KOBATO] Don't worry about him.
We'll take care of things here!

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:28.125
You do whatever you've gotta do!

Thanks, guys!

[VERA]
I'll lure out the girl.

00:19:42.083 --> 00:19:45.375
You wait here for
further instructions.

00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:50.166
[SHIGURE]
No. I'm going with you.

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:53.583
For what purpose?

00:19:53.667 --> 00:19:57.417
[SHIGURE] Because I think that
we should try to save EL-Cee.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.542
[VERA]
There wouldn't be any point.

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:02.083
[SHIGURE]
Why is that?

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:05.625
[VERA] You have your orders!
Her death is the only answer.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:09.875
I can't do it.

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.709
You came this far
just to give up on me?

00:20:12.792 --> 00:20:14.709
[SHIGURE]
No, you've got it backwards.

00:20:14.792 --> 00:20:16.166
Because you know
there's a good reason

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.417
why I can't take her life.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.750
If somebody kills EL-Cee,
then you'll disappear as well.

00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:30.667
Isn't that right?

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:38.667

Commander...

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:02.583
This is a nightmare.

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.834
How many times have you
suffered through this pain?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.625
I'll stop this, no matter what!
