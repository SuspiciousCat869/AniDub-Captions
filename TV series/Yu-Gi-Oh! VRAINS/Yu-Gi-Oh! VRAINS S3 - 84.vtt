WEBVTT

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:10.277
Let's duel, Varis!

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.580
And when I win,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.749
I'm gonna send you
right where you belong,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.084
straight to jail!

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.453
Cuz you deserve to be
in an orange jumpsuit,

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.187
not that white sweat suit!

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.857
Sorry, but orange
isn't my color.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.926
(Pigeon)
I can't hear what
they're sayin', boss,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.795
but I'm pretty good
at reading lips.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.830
And they must be makin'
dinner reservations

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.698
cuz they said
they're about to drool.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.599
(grunts)

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.600
Well, read my lips.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.601
(crows)

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.436
Get your camera
prepped and rollin'

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:37.404
and get the exclusive!

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.907
You gonna try
to stop this, Playmaker?

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.009
No, Ai,
because it's clear to me

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.245
that they have unresolved issues
that exist between them.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.282
And this is something
they must resolve on their own

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.584
if we're ever to work
together in the future.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.452
Well, I'm not holdin' my breath

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.788
cuz they got more issues
than a magazine.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:55.955
Ready?

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.457
(both)
Let's duel!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.502
(electronic whirring)

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:58.018
(electronic whirring)

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.320
Ready?

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:01.988
(both)
Let's duel!

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.934
I'll go first!

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.802
I summon SALAMANGREAT WOLVIE

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.070
in attack mode!

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:19.573
(computer chirping)

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:21.074
And next,

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.710
I activate
my spell FURY OF FIRE!

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.415
It lets me summon two
SALAMANGREAT monsters

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.050
from my hand!

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.319
Soar, SALAMANGREAT PARRO!
(computer chirping)

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.255
And SALAMANGREAT FALCO!

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.089
(computer chirping)

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.623
And I'll use 'em...

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.259
to Link Summon!

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.063
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:45.332
(computer chirping)

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.134
Then I'll place this facedown

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.603
and end my turn.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.373
He summoned
HEATLEO on his first turn?

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.408
Soulburner means business.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:56.444
Soulburner, listen.

00:02:56.644 --> 00:02:58.945
Like you, I'm no fan of Varis.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.615
I haven't forgotten
that his goal is to destroy

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.651
every single AI,
including myself.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.054
And I do quite enjoy
being alive.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:07.721
But--

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:09.523
But what?
Let's crush this guy...

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.859
so that we don't have to see
his smug smirk again!

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.294
What's the problem
with that plan, Flame?

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.329
The problem is,

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.163
if he has a plan to help us,

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.399
the least we can do is listen.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.635
Well, right now,
I don't feel like listening!

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.170
Yes, clearly.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.306
But not just to Varis,
but to me as well.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.141
It's my turn.

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:29.476
I draw.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:34.381
So what cards do you think
Varis is gonna play?

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.949
That's the question, isn't it?

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.384
Because every time he shows up,

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.519
he has a new tweak
to his strategy.

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.825
Well, c'mon get on with it!

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.127
Make your move!

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:50.330
I'm ending my turn.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:51.565
What?

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.567
Well, that's a new tweak.

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:54.968
What's he doing?

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.704
Nothing from the looks of it.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.105
It seems like Varis is...

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.608
trying to lose.

00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:03.376
But I don't sense
any deception from Varis.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.913
What's with that? You serious?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.882
C'mon. It's your turn.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.884
Make your move.
I don't have all day.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.253
Am I a joke to you?

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.387
(screaming)

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:15.889
Fine then!

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.191
I draw!

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:21.128
And I summon
SALAMANGREAT JACK JAGUAR!

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:22.195
(computer chirping)

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:27.234
Those two monsters have
enough attack points

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.070
to wipe out
all of Varis's life points!

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.373
All right!

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.842
You might not be taking
this duel seriously but I am!

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:36.744
HEATLEO...

00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:39.546
attack his life points directly!

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:42.048
(roaring)

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:46.586
(timer beeping)

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.122
Varis can't do a thing.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.726
One last attack and this duel
is over for him.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:04.671
'Kay.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.339
I'll attack and--

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:08.008
(groans)

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.078
(screaming)

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:23.156
Hold up? Why didn't he attack?

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.925
(Playmaker)
Because it wouldn't
have helped.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:25.592
Huh?

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.360
What do you mean?

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.465
Soulburner, are you ok?

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.099
I couldn't do it.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.269
Even if I won the duel this way,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.939
what-- what would it actually
get me in the end?

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:41.175
You'd get a W
on your record.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.910
But is that so important?

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.411
No, I guess.

00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:47.647
Need a hand, getting up?

00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.317
I don't need anything
from you, Varis!

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.319
But Flame's right,
if you're willing to help,

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.522
I can't sabotage it
for everyone.

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.957
But are we really
supposed to trust you?

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:58.858
We don't even know who you are!

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:02.596
My name is Roken Kogami.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.899
I'm sure you're familiar
with my father,

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:07.368
Dr. Kogami.

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:08.068
(both)
What?

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:12.305
He blurts out his biggest secret
just like that?

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.141
Huh, good thing
he doesn't know mine,

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:14.908
or does he?

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.044
(Pigeon)
I think they're already
done duelin'.

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.679
I didn't even have enough time
to set up my camera,

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:21.081
so I didn't get anythin'
recorded, boss.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.182
Set up?

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.317
It's already on your head!

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:25.652
So...

00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:27.154
let me get this straight...

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:29.523
your Dad started
the Lost Incident?

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.857
Yes, that's correct.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.059
But Varis is the one responsible

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.695
for ending the Lost Incident.

00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:35.329
(gasps)

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.230
(Playmaker)
Varis was a child back then,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.699
just like us.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.434
But he knew his father's
experiments were wrong,

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.236
so he alerted the authorities.

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.506
You can kinda say that...

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.974
he saved you.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.576
Not a chance.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:52.513
We both know Varis has made
many mistakes in his life,

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:54.147
but this wasn't one of them.

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.349
So what!

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.218
I'm just supposed
to forgive him?

00:06:57.218 --> 00:07:00.154
No, just be mad at him
about the right stuff.

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:01.889
Listen, Soulburner,

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.057
I'm not going to ask
for your forgiveness

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:07.127
because, frankly, I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:09.763
But this isn't the time
to argue that point

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:10.931
because what we need to do

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.800
is work together
to defeat the Light Ignis.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.635
And after that task is done,

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.472
we'll make time
to settle our differences.

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:19.606
Fine then.

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.042
(Varis)
Now, if you'll come with me,

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:23.944
there's something
I want to show you.

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.279
Follow you, huh?

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.047
Is he trying to trick us?

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:28.148
No,

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.985
there's no ulterior motive
to his actions.

00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:32.953
If Aqua's good then so am I.

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:34.221
So then...

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.424
let's go check out
what Varis wants to show us.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.093
Aye, aye, captain.

00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:40.894
Are you coming along?

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.762
Because I can't go without you.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:43.964
I know, Flame.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.966
If this turns out
to be a trap, Varis,

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.068
I'll crush you once and for all!

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.603
I'm sure that you will.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.637
(fingers snap)

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:56.243
Let's go.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.649
They're vanishing
into that portal.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.217
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:06.686
(shrieks)

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.388
The portal's closing up, boss!

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.856
Not without us!

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.692
(screaming)

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:12.325
(muffled yelling)

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:16.496
(grunts)

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.032
Get a new travel agent, Varis.

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.668
(Varis)
We're here.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.005
Hey, I've seen that before.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.273
Same here.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.340
(gasping)

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:39.152
It's the Tower of Hanoi!

00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:40.453
Then that means...

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.289
we're in the old LINK VRAINS!

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.024
How unexpected.

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.329
That Tower's still standin'?

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:50.031
Shush!

00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:51.231
They're gonna hear us!

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:53.967
Unless it's to reminisce
about the bad ol' days,

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.769
why did ya bring us here, Varis?

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:56.504
Yeah.

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:57.470
You want us to help reboot

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.940
your poor little Tower of Hanoi?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.209
That's exactly what I want.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:02.876
(gasps)

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.611
Are you for real?

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.547
Yes, I am.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:09.049
The first step to defeating
the Light Ignis,

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.218
is to find the Light Ignis,

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.387
which we've been
unable to do so far.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.956
But this Tower
functions like an antenna,

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:18.925
the most powerful one
in all of LINK VRAINS.

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.695
So we can use it to find
the Light Ignis.

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.264
No matter
where it might be hiding out.

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:26.433
Wait, is that really possible?

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:27.434
Maybe...

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:28.668
if you know the Ignis's

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.372
very specific digital signature.

00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:32.505
And that's the problem.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.208
I need a hacker
who's more familiar

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:38.378
with Ignis' algorithms than me
to actually find that program.

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:40.047
So then,

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:40.881
that's why you tried
to get my brother

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.083
to join up with you
and the Hanoi.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:43.884
That's right.

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:44.952
But unfortunately,

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.420
he had to go
and get himself deleted.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.622
You know what?

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.891
You really need to work
on your bedside manner.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.226
But let's say we help you
rebuild the Tower of Hanoi

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.396
and turn it into a scanner
like you claim.

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.364
I know, that once
the Tower's fixed,

00:09:57.364 --> 00:09:59.065
you can easily reprogram it

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:00.700
and turn it back into a weapon,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.270
the same weapon
that destroyed LINK VRAINS.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.872
How do we know
you're not gonna betrays us

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.540
the first chance you get?

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.243
Yeah, cuz let's just say I have
a hard time trusting people

00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:10.944
who, you know, erase me.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.448
If my word's not good enough,
then this may help you.

00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:19.887
What's that?

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:22.890
It's the program to reactivate
the Tower of Hanoi,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.758
but it's only half complete.

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:26.393
If you write the other half,

00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:28.028
the Hanoi are only in control

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.863
of 50% of the program.

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:31.799
That makes us equal partners.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.101
Neither side can modify
without the other

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:37.371
so I can't transform it
into a weapon on my own.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:38.371
That makes sense.

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:42.543
Very well.

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:45.846
Let's work together to rebuild
the Tower of Hanoi, Varis.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:47.414
And perhaps through
this partnership,

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.082
you may learn
to see things my way,

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:51.718
that there must be
a peaceful end to this war.

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:53.521
We'll see, Playmaker.

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:54.888
Did you hear that?

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.424
Playmaker and Varis
are gonna team up!

00:10:57.424 --> 00:11:00.527
It'll be the scoop of
the century of the millennium!

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.330
Front page headline,
here we come!

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.633
(Varis)
You're not going anywhere.

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:06.366
(gasping)

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:09.603
(screaming)

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:11.938
I can't risk having any leaks

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:13.673
until the mission is complete.

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:14.841
(crying)

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.278
(Ai)
Let's code this core already.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.447
What's taking so long?

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:22.816
You. Shall we?

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:25.753
Good, let's begin there.

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:26.786
You down?

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:37.597
(sighs)

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:39.633
Ya know,

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:41.601
if you told me a week
or even a day ago

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:43.270
that we'd be working
with the Hanoi,

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.507
I'd say you need to write
more realistic fan fics.

00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:47.475
I agree.

00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:48.842
But it's a risk worth taking

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:51.979
if there's a real possibility
that we can find Lightning.

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.915
We need to bring this war
to an end and fast.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:56.016
You're right.

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:58.285
But it's still weird.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:04.691
Theodore, do you have
a moment to chat?

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.393
Theodore,

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.429
I can tell
that you're still not in favor

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.197
of working with the Hanoi.

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:11.732
Well, you're right.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.101
Is it really that obvious
how I feel?

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:16.837
Not to the others,
but to me it's quite clear.

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:17.904
Right.

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:21.741
One thing puzzles me
that perhaps you can clear up.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.744
Yeah? What are you
worried about?

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:26.847
Why did Varis want you
to help with his plan?

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.849
He needs a hacker
or a programmer,

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.150
and you are neither.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.018
(grunts)

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:32.653
Well, I suppose that's true.

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:34.922
There's no supposing,
it's a fact.

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:36.356
Varis needs Playmaker

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:38.025
for his knowledge of the Ignis.

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:40.260
And Ghost Gal
is a genius of a hacker.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.929
I can also understand
Blue Maiden

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:44.198
for her connections
to SOL Technologies.

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.665
But he doesn't need you.

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:47.534
You are useless
in this endeavor,

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:48.502
no offense.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:50.237
How can I not take offense?

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.839
Maybe he reached out to me
to get to you.

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:53.874
No, no, no,

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.677
then he would have
contacted me directly.

00:12:56.677 --> 00:13:00.181
He definitely wanted you
to join this mission.

00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:02.482
Why is that do you think?

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.151
I have no idea.

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.453
What do you think?

00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:08.255
Well, I can only conclude...

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.090
he wanted to see you

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.392
to atone for the Lost Incident.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:13.827
You're wrong there.

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:16.597
He already said that he doesn't
feel guilty about it.

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:17.731
Yes,

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.600
but what I have learned
about humans

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.068
is that what they say

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:22.235
and what they feel

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.405
are entirely different things.

00:13:24.405 --> 00:13:25.973
And perhaps that is why

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:28.475
he was so unwilling to duel.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.211
I'm ending my turn.

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:33.080
Flame, sometimes I think

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.715
you know more about humans
than humans.

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:37.951
It's only natural

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:40.254
because my name
is Flame after all.

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:41.922
F-L-A-M-E.

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:44.057
The F stands for foresighted,

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:45.559
the L for loving,

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.560
the A for--

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.728
Oh, Flame,

00:13:47.728 --> 00:13:49.797
the A is for Amazing.

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.765
Why, thank you, Theodore.

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:53.167
And the M and E

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:55.802
is for you being
the Most Excellent partner

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:58.138
an Ignis can have.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:15.488
(panting)

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.294
How are you feelin'?

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:22.896
I'm fine.

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:26.333
You never have need
to worry about me.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:29.202
It's my job to make sure
you're in top shape.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.037
Your job?

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:31.639
Don't be silly, Harlin.

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:33.306
You and I,

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:34.608
we're brothers.

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:36.810
It's only natural
that we should want to care

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.378
and look out for each other.

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.515
Well, you know we're not
really brothers, right?

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.617
Lightning reprogrammed me to be
your brother

00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:45.986
because he thought that
I'd be the one capable

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.855
of keeping your emotions
in check.

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:49.690
It's not like
we had the same parents

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.158
because we're AIs?

00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:53.160
Even if it's true,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.495
that Lightning created you,

00:14:54.495 --> 00:14:56.830
our brotherly bond
couldn't be programmed.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.164
You may call me your brother,

00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:00.300
but I call you my replacement.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.070
Lightning had to create you
because I wasn't good enough.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.005
I would say that hurts
my feelings,

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:06.373
but, nah,

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:08.542
these feelings
aren't real anyway.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.043
They're programmed.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.946
But as long as we, AIs,
win in the end,

00:15:12.946 --> 00:15:14.848
it'll all be worth it, right?

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:17.250
It will all be worth it, Harlin

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.853
because we will do it together.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:25.125
<i>Master, how is your search
for Lightning going?</i>

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:26.860
Well, I'd have
found him by now

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.430
if Playmaker wasn't so slow
with his typing.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.466
<i>Poor Master.</i>

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:34.301
Yeah, but when
we find Lightning,

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.003
it's gonna be
an all-out knockdown

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:38.539
feathers-flying brawl
where no one...

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:39.506
may come out

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:40.841
alive!

00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:42.342
<i>That sounds fun!</i>

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:43.743
No, it doesn't!

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.845
<i>Huh?</i>

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:47.214
<i>Oops, wrong emotion program.</i>

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:48.615
<i>Launching teardrop app.</i>

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.183
Stop faking it!

00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:52.452
You're lying with your crying!

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:53.920
<i>Wow, Master!</i>

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.122
<i>That rhymed!</i>

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.190
<i>As the wall said to the hammer,</i>

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.393
<i>you nailed it!</i>

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:02.162
Hey! Jokes are my job,
got it?!

00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:03.430
But pause, pause, pause,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.765
I'm getting off topic.

00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:06.600
If this is gonna be
my final battle,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.302
I gotta tie up
some loose ends,

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.269
meaning you.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.504
<i>Meaning me?</i>

00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:11.772
Yeah,

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:13.774
remember how I promised
to improve your intelligence?

00:16:13.774 --> 00:16:15.809
Well, now's the time!

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.578
<i>So Roboppi is going
to become smart?</i>

00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:20.280
As smart as me.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.615
<i>Squee!</i>

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:23.783
<i>Squee!</i>

00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:24.618
<i>Wait.</i>

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:25.653
What's wrong?

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:29.289
<i>The Master has made
similar promises in the past.</i>

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:30.457
True,

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:33.260
but this is one promise
I'm keepin'!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.795
Stare into my eyes

00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:36.997
and feel the upgrades!

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.601
(moans)

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:51.178
It's ready now.

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:54.181
We can use this program
to find Lightning.

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.683
Yup, once we uploaded it
to the Tower.

00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:58.818
You gonna need my help
with that?

00:16:58.818 --> 00:17:00.787
Well, I'd feel a lot
more comfortable

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:03.056
if you could keep your
eye on us from out here.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:04.591
Cuz in there,

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:06.694
me and Flame
will watch his back.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.195
Hmm.

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:09.597
Sounds good.

00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:11.031
Then I'd be more comfortable

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.034
if you install this
in your Duel Disk before you go.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:15.735
Another program?

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.304
But I just ate!

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:19.306
Since our enemies
keep upgrading their tech,

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:21.141
we gotta stay one step
ahead of 'em.

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:24.010
This program creates a backdoor
through any security system

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.745
and broadcasts your location.

00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:28.182
That means no matter where
you might be in the network,

00:17:28.182 --> 00:17:29.884
I can still find you.

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.651
(Flame)
That is quite useful.

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:33.220
If you're gonna tell me
to stay out here

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.888
and keep an eye on you...

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:37.658
then that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:38.659
Okay.

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:40.160
Now go break a leg!

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.228
That's not nice!

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:42.229
I agree!

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:44.231
It's a way of saying
good luck, Flame.

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:47.667
Alright, then let's get going
and find Lightning.

00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:57.177
(Hayami)
The new security patches
are up and running, sir.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:09.990
Hey, wait, where's Ghost Gal?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.826
I ordered her to
go to LINK VRAINS

00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:13.327
while we came here.

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:14.895
Wait, you ordered her?

00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:16.731
(Blue Maiden)
Okay, requested.

00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:19.166
Just in case something
bad happens there.

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:21.168
Because we can't be
in two places at once

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:23.637
and you know Ghost Gal
can handle her own.

00:18:24.705 --> 00:18:27.374
That is a wise decision,
Blue Maiden.

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:28.742
So, Specty,

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:30.310
where's the rest of your Hanoi?

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.779
They're all waiting on standby.

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.415
Ready to back us up if needed.

00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:41.888
There's no time to waste,
let's begin our search.

00:18:57.905 --> 00:19:00.173
Initiating the global scan!

00:19:08.716 --> 00:19:10.150
(rumbling)

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.170
The Tower's energized!

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.304
Prepare for impact!

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.107
Engage!

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.483
(alarm rising)

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.286
What is that?

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:48.655
Someone has launched a scan
of the entire network, sir.

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.690
Unreal.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.524
What do you think
they're looking for?

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.562
That was weird.

00:19:54.562 --> 00:19:56.162
Hey, look over there!

00:19:57.798 --> 00:20:00.901
Is LINK VRAINS glitching out
or am I seeing double?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.375
Is that normal?

00:20:08.842 --> 00:20:09.977
No way!

00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.811
There are two LINK VRAINS?

00:20:14.514 --> 00:20:15.616
What is that?

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.319
It's a second
copy of LINK VRAINS

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:20.387
layered right
under the original!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.222
That's why we couldn't
find the Light Ignis.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:24.457
It created a mirror world
to hide inside.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:25.693
How frustrating.

00:20:25.693 --> 00:20:28.695
The Light Ignis was hiding
in plain sight.

00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:31.698
Yes. But that's no longer
the case.

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.603
(Windy)
The humans have found us.

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:37.805
Yes.

00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:40.473
I figured they would
eventually,

00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:42.609
but this is surprisingly sooner

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.644
than I expected.

00:20:44.644 --> 00:20:47.681
So Bohman is not yet ready
to engage them.

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:49.049
You see that as a problem,

00:20:49.049 --> 00:20:51.018
but I see that
as an opportunity.

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:53.354
An opportunity for me
to get my revenge.

00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:55.055
They almost took
everything from me,

00:20:55.055 --> 00:20:56.523
so at the very least...

00:20:56.523 --> 00:20:59.226
they owe me an eyeball!

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:00.460
(Ai)
If you're ready,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.896
let's go kick some Lightning!

00:21:02.896 --> 00:21:05.899
Whatever comes now will be
the beginning of the end.

00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:10.570
Let's go, Spectre.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.405
Bye, bye!

00:21:11.405 --> 00:21:13.240
Try not to get digitized!

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.274
Wait up!

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.376
Varis, take us with you!

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.044
What?

00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:18.278
Are you nuts?

00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:19.379
You're nuts!

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:22.216
It's either this or filming
the Brave Battler.

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:23.516
Good point.

00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:25.285
C'mon! Take us!

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.888
Beyond that portal, it's more
dangerous that a war zone,

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:29.856
and no one's
going to protect you.

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:31.625
It's much safer out here.

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:32.893
No, it's not,

00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:35.428
not if you've sneaked
a peak at our bank accounts!

00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:36.263
Yuh-huh!

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:37.464
You know how people brag about

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.299
how many zeroes
they have on their paycheck?

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:40.734
We have nothing but zeroes!

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:42.703
We need a scoop and now!

00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:44.371
Stop squishin' my face!

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:45.171
(chuckles)

00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:46.907
Very well then.

00:21:46.907 --> 00:21:50.176
But don't say I didn't
warn you of the danger.

00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:02.089
There's the entrance.

00:22:02.089 --> 00:22:03.924
Get ready. It's time.

00:22:38.158 --> 00:22:39.759
(electronic whirring)
