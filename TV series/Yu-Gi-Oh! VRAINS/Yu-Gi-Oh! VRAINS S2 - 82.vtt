WEBVTT

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.275
(Soulburner)
Gore summoned KING T WREXTLE!

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:09.309
(Blue Maiden)
That means he now has

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.112
the strongest
monster on the field!

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.246
(Soulburner)
Yeah.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.182
(Gore)
My KING T's already
mighty mighty,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.184
but CRYSTAL HEART gives it
600 more attack points.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:20.920
Next, I summon

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.757
DINOWRESTLER VALEONYX
from my hand!

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.528
Then I'll activate and use

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.664
VALEONYX's special ability
on my KING T WREXTLE!

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.866
But as for what
that ability does,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.267
I don't feel like tellin' ya.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.103
(roars)

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.472
But you got other
problems to worry about.

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:40.674
KING T!

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.943
Attack STORM CIPHER!

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.946
And my Field Spell

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.848
WORLD DINO WRESTLING's
gonna help you out

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.786
by giving you
200 extra attack points!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.520
(roars)

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.096
And that loss of yours...
is my gain.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.098
Because since I destroyed
your STORM CIPHER,

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.267
I'm allowed to banish
CRAZY EVOLUTION

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.502
from my graveyard
to draw one card.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.173
It's your turn, Playmaker.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.143
Now whaddya say we win
and break his heart!

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.745
Gore's heart,
not CRYSTAL HEART.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:19.813
It'll break my heart
if you break CRYSTAL HEART.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.248
So have heart
and break his heart,

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.516
but not his other heart!

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.886
Whatever you try, you're the one
who'll break in the end.

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:35.562
♪♪♪

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.648
Gore's brain
is further synchronizing

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.651
with his AI chip,
Mr. Zaizen.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.320
But the stress on his body
is off the charts.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.990
(evil laugh)

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:39.326
(Gore)
Yes... I can feel it,
Playmaker.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.295
I'm becoming
the perfect duelist.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:45.832
And I will crush you
with my bare hands.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.135
Make your move.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.070
'Cause only by defeating you...

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.073
Will I restore my glory.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.875
I know Gore was
once our bud,

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.644
but he didn't bloom
into a flower,

00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:57.911
he grew into a weed.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:59.479
And you know what
to do with weeds,

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:00.748
mow 'em down!

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:02.882
So if you wanna save him
from himself,

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:04.885
you gotta hack up
this AI-chippin',

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.488
brain-implantin',
Earth-stealin', short-cuttin',

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.690
pork-choppin', meat-baggin',
and win this duel!

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.525
If you insist.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.127
I draw!

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.529
I summon DOTSCAPER!

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:23.537
And I'll use it...
to create my circuit!

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:30.377
I Link Summon...
Link 1 LINKURIBOH!

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.213
When DOTSCAPER
is sent to the graveyard,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.382
its special ability activates,

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.684
resummoning itself
back to my field.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.057
That means I can use it
to Link Summon... once again!

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.060
The summoning conditions
require two monsters!

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.563
I Link Summon!

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:52.232
Link 2 SECURITY DRAGON!

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.772
And SECURITY DRAGON's
ability activates!

00:03:57.872 --> 00:03:59.840
When it's co-linked
with another monster,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.776
it returns one monster
on your field to your hand.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:06.780
So scoot home to your
paleo palace, KING T!

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:12.118
KING T isn't gonna go anywhere.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.588
'Cause due
to VALEONYX's ability,

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.924
KING T isn't
affected by monsters

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:19.126
with equal or fewer Link Arrows.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.462
Whaaaat? Since when?

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:23.931
(Gore)
Since forever!

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:26.033
So that's the special ability

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.835
you kept secret from us
earlier in this duel.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:29.937
That's right.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.939
If your monsters
are Link 3 or lower,

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.274
their special abilities
are useless.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.876
If that's the case,
then all I'll need to do

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.113
is go and summon
a Link 4 monster.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.716
When I have at least two
Link Monsters on my field,

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.552
I can summon
CROSS DEBUG from my hand.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.126
And with it I will create
my ultimate circuit!

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:56.263
I set LINKSLAYER, CROSS DEBUG
and SECURITY DRAGON...

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:57.898
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.837
I Link Summon!
Link 4 FIREWALL DRAGON!

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:13.747
I Link Summon!
Link 4 FIREWALL DRAGON!

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.185
FIREWALL DRAGON's
special ability activates!

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:21.589
For every monster
that's co-linked to this card,

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.690
one of your monsters
returns to your hand!

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:31.331
Bye bye KING T WREXTLE!
And for real this time!

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:34.701
Then I'll turn your reality
into a fantasy.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.170
I'll use my trap card,
DINO DECEIT!

00:05:38.973 --> 00:05:42.342
I can activate this trap card
when your Link Monster has equal

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:45.579
or more Link Arrows
than my DINOWRESTLER does.

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:49.783
All monsters on your field
lose their special abilities.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:51.585
Aah!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.453
Not again!

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:56.490
In addition,
I can place a spell or trap card

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.191
facedown on my field.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.761
And last but certainly not least

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.930
you're required
to battle this turn.

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.068
I remember from our duel

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.369
that KING T WREXTLE
has a special ability

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.138
that lets Gore choose
which monster

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:12.906
his opponent attacks with.

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:16.043
But all of Playmaker's monsters
have less attack points

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:17.678
than KING T WREXTLE.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:19.412
(Gore)
One more thing:

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:22.149
If you don't attack
with the monster I select,

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.753
that monster will be
automatically destroyed.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:27.754
And of course
I'm going to choose

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.389
your FIREWALL DRAGON.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.258
So if we don't attack,

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:32.993
FIREWALL will be destroyed.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.495
But if we do attack,
FIREWALL will be destroyed,

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.364
and we'll take damage.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:38.532
Well?

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.600
Go ahead and make your choice.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.068
Not that you have one.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.407
That's exactly what I thought.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:49.543
Since you're not gonna attack,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.511
FIREWALL DRAGON is destroyed.

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:53.414
Welp, that happened.

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:55.349
We're ending our turn, Gore.

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.985
Without doin' a single move
that worked.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:01.222
(Spectre)
Gore's upgrades
are clearly paying off.

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:04.125
The Earth Ignis's data
has put him on par with,

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:06.793
if not superior to,
Playmaker's abilities.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.995
Not that I find it
that hard to believe.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.266
After all, the Earth Ignis
always did seem wiser

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.735
than Playmaker's
Dark Ignis.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.803
But look at him,
he's a mess.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:19.140
That's what happens when
you cede control of your life

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.440
to an AI.

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.643
For a brief moment to shine,
they take everything from you.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:26.914
And this isn't a metaphor,
this is a fact.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.282
That's why AIs
are not be trusted.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.918
It's my turn.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.954
I draw!

00:07:34.054 --> 00:07:36.323
I'm bringing this duel
to an end.

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:39.159
First,
I place this card facedown.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.462
Then I activate my trap card
DINO DOMAIN!

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:48.402
It returns one DINOWRESTLER
on my field back to my hand.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:51.771
So I'm pulling back
my KING T WREXTLE!

00:07:53.074 --> 00:07:53.707
Huh?

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:54.942
He did everything and a half

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.044
to stop us from getting
rid of that monster,

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.912
but he did it
on his own anyway?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.549
Yup, and in exchange
your monster's special abilities

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.219
can no longer affect my monsters
until the end of this turn.

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.722
That would usually
be powerful and everything,

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:11.525
but Playmaker only has
LINKURIBOH on his field.

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:14.060
Let's be honest,
it's not exactly a monster

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:15.996
that leaves ya quakin'
in your boots.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.966
But if he's willing to sacrifice
KING T WREXTLE

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.535
to negate LINKURIBOH,
it must be worth it.

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:22.703
It is.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.204
Because he actually
hasn't really

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:26.140
sacrificed anything at all.

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:26.874
(sighs)

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:29.876
(Gore)
I use CRYSTAL HEART's
ability to resummon

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:33.380
DINOWRESTLER TERRA PARKOURIO
from my graveyard.

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.215
And by doing so

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.352
my CRYSTAL HEART gains
another G Golem Counter.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:41.188
Also, monsters linked
to CRYSTAL HEART gain

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:43.890
600 attack points
per counter.

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:46.393
For my next move...

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.228
I concentrate my circuit!

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.333
I Link Summon!
Return Link 3

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.036
DINOWRESTLER
KING T WREXTLE!

00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:00.941
Since I used TERRA PARKOURIO
to Link Summon,

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:03.444
its special ability activates
and resurrects

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:06.213
VALEONYX from my graveyard
in defense mode.

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.783
He not only resurrected
KING T WREXTLE,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.552
but another monster with it.

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:15.589
Since I summoned KING T WREXTLE
next to CRYSTAL HEART's link,

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:18.258
it gains 1200 attack points.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:24.898
Which is more than enough
to eliminate

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:26.933
the rest of your life points.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.505
(Zaizen)
Gore's vitals are spiking
to dangerous levels!

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.108
Log him out
immediately!

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:36.376
But the Queen said--

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.111
I don't care
what she said!

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.948
(Queen)
And I don't care
for your opinion, Zaizen.

00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:44.251
No one's logging
anyone out, got it?

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:45.452
KING T!

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:48.122
Attack LINKURIBOH!

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:51.191
And not that I need it,
but WORLD DINO WRESTLING

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.293
gives it 200
more attack points.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.898
I activate CROSS DEBUG's
special ability!

00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:00.133
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:03.436
I can give FIREWALL DRAGON's
attack points to LINKURIBOH!

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.874
In addition, LINKURIBOH
can't be destroyed in battle.

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:09.210
So watch as LINKURIBOH's
attack points

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.878
rise from 300 to 2800

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.413
and survives your attack!

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.621
But you still take damage
to your life points.

00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:26.626
I end my turn.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.196
And while you managed
to survive,

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.631
even you have to admit

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:33.267
that I'm outdueling you
in every possible way.

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:35.769
It's only a matter of time
until I break you

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.738
and prove there's no one greater
than the Gore.

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:45.279
Now it's your turn, Playmaker.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:47.714
Oh man, this isn't
looking good at all.

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.049
You're telling me.

00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:52.052
Gore's had a counter for every
one of Playmaker's strategies.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:53.854
And since he's tapped
into Earth's data,

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:56.022
you know he can think
up of a million more.

00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:59.359
Since we're down
to a 1000 life points,

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.495
we usually get
to use our Skill.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:02.763
Usually.

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:06.200
But Gore has an Anti Skill
to cancel it out, so we can't.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.834
Don't be so sure, Ai.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.237
We won't truly
know until we try.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.671
It's my turn.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.174
I draw!

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.177
(sighs)

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.516
The winds are picking up, Ai.

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:25.518
Wait, you're really gonna
try to use your Skill?

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:26.587
Yeah.

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.156
(Ai)
B-B-But that's not gonna work!

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.191
My calculations say
that you have less

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.761
than a zero percent chance
of success!

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.463
That's not
mathematically possible, Ai.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.698
It's the new math!

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.366
Aah!

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:41.668
Calm down.

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.470
Fine then.
Give it a whirl!

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:48.675
Good luck.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.181
I activate my Skill!

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:57.284
Neo Storm Access!

00:11:57.351 --> 00:11:58.852
I don't think so.

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:01.889
I activate my Anti Skill!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.157
So I'm cancelling out...

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:06.426
your Neo Storm Access!

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:14.067
(Ai)
I knew it!

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:18.639
Anti Skill also lets me draw
two additional cards.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:21.508
It seems as if your plan
went all up in smoke.

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:22.977
Actually, so far

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:24.978
everything's going
exactly to plan.

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:25.979
Say what?

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:28.315
I'm now activating
my trap card

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.417
DRAW DISCHARGE!

00:12:30.084 --> 00:12:33.487
If you draw a monster card
outside of your Draw Phase,

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:35.756
your life points
not only take damage

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.658
that is equal
to its attack points

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:40.427
but every card that you draw
gets immediately banished!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.762
(grunts)

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:45.098
You used my
Anti Skill's effect against me?

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:46.399
That we did!

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.235
You mad? You mad.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.703
(Playmaker)
Since your DINOWRESTLERS

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.072
are some of the strongest
monsters in the game,

00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.874
if you drew any of them,
you're going to take

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.409
a significant amount of damage
to your life points.

00:12:56.543 --> 00:12:57.244
(Gore)
Huh.

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:58.646
Then I guess you're gonna love

00:12:58.746 --> 00:13:01.815
that I drew not one
but two DINOWRESTLERS.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:05.785
And they have 1800
and 2600 attack points.

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.655
That totals 4400
points of damage!

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.624
That's enough to clean out
all his life points

00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:12.727
and pin the tail
on this donkey!

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:16.163
There's only one donkey
around here and it's not me.

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:16.897
Huh?

00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:18.665
Cause I'm activating this!

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:21.135
My trap card DINO SENSE!

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:24.405
When there's a DINOWRESTLER
Link Monster on my field,

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.974
if you activate
a trap card like you did,

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:30.243
that trap card is negated
and banished!

00:13:31.945 --> 00:13:34.148
You also take
300 points of damage

00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:35.983
for every monster on my field.

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.418
And since I have three...

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:40.220
You take 900 points
of damage.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.756
(grunts)

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:44.891
(Soulburner)
Oh no, Playmaker!

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:56.236
(evil laugh)

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:59.539
Maybe your silly moves woulda
worked against the old Gore,

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.142
but I'm now smart enough to know

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:05.679
that you'd try something
to counteract my Anti Skill.

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:10.884
Gore completely shut down
their final desperate attempt.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.385
Poor Playmaker...

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.221
(Soulburner)
I hate to say it but...

00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:16.656
Playmaker's gonna lose.

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.826
Well, Playmaker...
Good knowin' ya.

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.062
(wheeping)

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:23.697
I wish the wind
would stop blowin'

00:14:23.797 --> 00:14:26.900
'cause the sand's blowin'
straight into my tear ducts!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.602
Wait, do I have tear ducts?

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:29.936
The wind...

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.706
Yeah, the wind!

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.774
(laughs)

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.142
What's up, Ai?

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:37.211
What's up?
We're up!

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:38.812
'Cause if the wind's
still blowin',

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.714
we can keep goin'!

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:42.216
I forgot to tell ya

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.952
that Neo Storm Access
had another effect!

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:46.486
Ooopsies.

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.023
(grunts)

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:51.959
It's an effect
that can only be used

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.694
when you're down
to 100 life points or less.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.563
If you activate a Skill,

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:59.032
but fail to get a monster
from the Data Storm,

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:01.601
you not only get a second chance
to snag that monster

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.270
and add it to your Extra Deck,

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:06.106
but you also get
to draw one card!

00:15:08.108 --> 00:15:09.510
(grunts)

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.744
(gasping)

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.281
Huh!

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:23.857
A plot twist, how nice.

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:27.193
(Ai)
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:29.763
Neo Storm Access!

00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:40.106
Aah!

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.880
This duel's... not over!

00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:55.589
Whatever you drew,
it doesn't matter to me.

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:57.791
It's too late
for a single card

00:15:57.925 --> 00:15:59.793
to change the outcome
of this duel.

00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:03.430
Unless the card is this:
FIREWALL GUARDIAN!

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:08.568
Because with it
I can create my circuit!

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.337
I set FIREWALL GUARDIAN

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.906
and LINKURIBOH
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:18.345
I Link Summon
Link 2 CLOCK LIZARD!

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:24.251
Then FIREWALL GUARDIAN's
ability activates!

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.919
If I used it to Link Summon,

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:28.321
it resummons itself
from my graveyard.

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:31.925
And since you have
a Field Spell in play,

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:34.528
I'm allowed to summon
GRID SWEEPER!

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.963
And now,
I'm going to overlay

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.700
my Level 4 FIREWALL GUARDIAN
and GRID SWEEPER!

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.509
Overlay?

00:16:48.642 --> 00:16:50.244
He's not Link Summoning?

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:54.481
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:05.359
The boundary between order
and chaos break down to manifest

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.260
as the fangs of devastation!

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:10.498
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:10.598 --> 00:17:14.167
Rank 4 FIREWALL eXceed DRAGON!

00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:32.753
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:36.323
Rank 4 FIREWALL eXceed DRAGON!

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:40.027
What? An Xyz Monster?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.396
I activate eXceed DRAGON's
special ability!

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.899
By using two Overlay Units,

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:48.069
I can summon
a Link 4 Cyberse monster

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:51.205
from my graveyard
and link it to this card!

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:54.140
Now return, FIREWALL DRAGON!

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.744
Furthermore,
when Link Monsters are linked

00:17:57.844 --> 00:18:00.013
to my FIREWALL eXceed DRAGON

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.950
it gains 500 attack points
from each of their Link Arrows.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.153
(Ai)
FIREWALL DRAGON is Link 4.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.589
And CLOCK LIZARD is Link 2!

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:11.759
(Playmaker)
Together, they provide
3000 attack points!

00:18:11.992 --> 00:18:14.895
Then FIREWALL DRAGON
uses its special ability.

00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:17.263
Go Emergency Escape!

00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:20.567
It returns KING T WREXTLE
back to your hand!

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.969
I activate DINO DOMAIN!

00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:25.705
By returning one DINOWRESTLER
to my hand,

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.709
your special abilities
can't affect my monsters!

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:30.711
So instead of KING T WREXTLE,

00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:33.880
DINOWRESTER VALEONYX
will return to my hand.

00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:37.885
Then I'll activate
GRID SWEEPER's ability!

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:40.554
By banishing GRID SWEEPER
from my graveyard

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:42.756
and CLOCK LIZARD from my field,

00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:45.292
I get to destroy
one of your cards!

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:47.628
Didn't I just say
that my monsters

00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:49.563
aren't affected
by your abilities?

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:50.897
Your monsters aren't,

00:18:50.997 --> 00:18:53.733
but your spells are,
like WORLD DINO WRESTLING!

00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:58.138
Now that that spell is gone,
both my monsters can attack.

00:18:58.639 --> 00:18:59.640
Get ready!

00:18:59.773 --> 00:19:02.610
But I can use KING T WREXTLE's
special ability

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.212
to force your FIREWALL DRAGON
to attack first.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:10.117
Since your FIREWALL DRAGON's
not as strong as my monster,

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:12.852
if you attack,
you lose the duel.

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:15.722
Aah! He slammed
on our brakes again!

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:16.289
No.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.357
Huh?

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:19.827
We're still going to attack
Gore's monster

00:19:19.894 --> 00:19:21.528
with our FIREWALL DRAGON anyway!

00:19:22.663 --> 00:19:24.164
Whatta ya mean, "we?"

00:19:24.732 --> 00:19:25.732
(Playmaker)
When I attack,

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.534
I can activate
FIREWALL GUARDIAN's

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:29.669
special ability
from my graveyard!

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.371
By banishing it...

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.874
FIREWALL DRAGON's
attack is negated.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.209
But in exchange,

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.178
your KING T WREXTLE's
attack points

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.280
will drop
all the way down to 0!

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:47.120
But... I'm supposed
to be the perfect duelist!

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.222
Perfection is overrated.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.124
Believe me, I know.

00:19:51.658 --> 00:19:56.463
FIREWALL eXceed DRAGON attack
and destroy his KING T WREXTLE!

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:59.232
Tempest Reckoning.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:09.009
(Gore)
Aah!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.545
What have I done?

00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:15.048
What did I give up?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.685
Since I wanted more...

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:24.724
I've lost... everything.

00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.231
(Zaizen)
The duel's done!

00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:32.732
Now log him out!

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:33.834
Delay that!

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.203
Extract the Ignis's data
from him first!

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.006
I'll gobble up Earth outta Gore!

00:20:39.106 --> 00:20:42.209
(grunts)

00:20:43.377 --> 00:20:44.878
Oh! Or not!

00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:49.015
Uh... You okay?

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:51.051
Fine.

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:52.686
Leave without
saying goodbye.

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:56.823
(Queen)
Did you log him out, Zaizen?

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.059
What's done is done.

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.627
Now let's get him
to the hospital immediately!

00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:02.897
(grunts)

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.364
(Playmaker)
Here.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.601
CRYSTAL HEART?

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:09.603
We figured it's
better in your hands

00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:11.105
than anyone else's.

00:21:11.205 --> 00:21:14.941
And I'm 102% sure that's what
Earth woulda wanted too.

00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:16.276
Thank you, Ai.

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:18.946
This should bring
some comfort to Earth,

00:21:19.046 --> 00:21:20.280
wherever he may be.

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.684
Speaking of someone
without any comfort,

00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:25.453
I wonder if Gore is okay.

00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:27.288
Yeah, I feel
bad for him.

00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:30.257
I mean he did slip to the wrong
side of the tracks and all,

00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:32.459
but he was still
once a hero, ya know?

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:36.863
That's why we must end
this war as soon as possible.

00:21:36.964 --> 00:21:39.966
So no others will suffer
the same fate.

00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:50.110
