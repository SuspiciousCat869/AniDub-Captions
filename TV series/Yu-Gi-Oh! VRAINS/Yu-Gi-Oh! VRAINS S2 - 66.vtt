00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.440
Master, the message boards
today are full of posts

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.609
praising your exploits.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.011
Really?
Show me show me!

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.846
(AI)
Okay...

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.314
Uh huh...

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.916
Cute...

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.352
That's umm... unique.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.453
Hey!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.022
You said they were praising me,
not Playmaker!

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.357
(Roboppi)
They are. You are in this pic.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.025
(AI)
Where?

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.992
(Roboppi)
There.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.763
I need to hire a PR firm!

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.032
Or better yet, PR myself!

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.268
I can create a post too!

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.003
First... okay.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.739
Then the meatbag... good.

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.743
(laughing)

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:45.679
Roboppi does not approve
of spamming!

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.681
Whaaaaaaaaaa?
It's not spam.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.516
I only put up one post.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.184
Really Master?

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.020
Uh... whattaya implyin'?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.590
You put
212 posts up yesterday.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.657
How'd you know?

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.160
So what if I did!

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.561
Don't you see?

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.531
No one knows I'm the true
hero of LINK VRAINS.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.699
No one.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.401
You can't even spell VRAINS
without an A or an I!

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.570
So it's time this guy
gets the credit,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.539
not the useless flesh husk.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.240
(Yusaku)
I don't think I'm that useless.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.575
Oh!

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.577
Uh... Yusaku.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:18.545
Didn't see you there.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.479
Umm uh...

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.383
Did you like my Kolter
impersonation?

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:23.483
(laughs)

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.586
Cuz he's jealous
of all the love you're getting.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.087
But not me!

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.388
Never!

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.090
Whoa!

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.992
Check out this latest post!

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:35.095
This text!
It's from the Earth Ignis!

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:45.572
♪♪♪

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.660
Let me get this straight.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.564
The Earth Ignis says
he wants to meet Playmaker

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.098
on a message forum.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.400
It's such an obvious fake.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.802
I can't believe
you actually fell for it.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:51.238
When something's
too good to be true,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.739
run the other way.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.975
I know that it could
be a trap Kolter.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.044
But it's our only lead.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:58.545
We can't just ignore it.

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:00.113
Wrong.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.381
We can.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.784
Would an Ignis that's
been in hiding suddenly come out

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.153
on a message board
for everyone to see?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.990
Well... the Earth Ignis is a...
unique fella.

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.359
What do you mean by that, AI?

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.361
He doesn't believe
in being sneaky,

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:17.331
so if he wants something,
like meeting Playmaker,

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.866
he'll just come out and ask.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.000
On a message board.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.502
For everyone to see.

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.269
Yup.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.436
Can you write him back for us?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.773
No problemo!

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.043
(Zaizen)
Everyone, scour
every corner of the network

00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:30.844
for any sign of the Ignis.

00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:31.945
(All)
Yes sir!

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.180
I have a meeting upstairs.
You are in charge.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.616
Right.

00:03:35.683 --> 00:03:37.951
I'll contact you immediately
if I find anything!

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:42.990
(AI)
All done!

00:03:43.124 --> 00:03:45.125
Now this may look
like a garbled mess,

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.827
but run it thru
an Ignis algorithm

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.395
and you can read it
like a manga!

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:49.796
Basically, I'm askin'

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.198
the Earth Ignis
where he's hiding.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.165
Nice.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.967
Let's see if we get a nibble.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.604
(AI)
There!

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.539
Hmm.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.507
Hmm.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:01.074
What's it say?

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.276
(AI)
He sent us a bunch of numbers.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:04.545
Oooooh.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.081
They look like coordinates
of some spot inside LINK VRAINS.

00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:09.249
That's where he wants us to go.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.185
Or whoever sent
this wants us to go

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.520
cuz we don't know
if this message is real.

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.556
You remember the last time
we ran without a plan?

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.793
We ran straight
into The Shepard's trap

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.861
and we almost lost everything.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.963
Aww, why do you gotta
bring up mistakes

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.264
just because it's true?

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.432
Because it's true.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:28.502
I fully understand the risks
we'll be taking, Kolter.

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.538
But if it can help us
save your brother,

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.674
it's a risk I'm willing to take.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:34.674
Yusaku...

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.377
Let's not waste any more time.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:39.012
If others have
seen this message,

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.681
they're already on their way.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.449
Are you sure, buddy?

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.023
(Woman)
I found something!

00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:50.590
Yes, what is it?

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.762
A weird message just popped up
on a Playmaker message board.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:56.296
Show me what it is.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:59.399
(Queen)
Zaizen,

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.569
I put you in charge
of capturing the Ignis

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.472
because I thought you were
the best man for the job.

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:08.275
So I find it disappointing

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:11.578
that we don't yet have
a single one in our possession.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.480
(Zaizen)
If you'll allow me to explain--

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:14.648
(Queen)
I won't.

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.817
But that's not why
I called you here.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:19.686
How's my other pet project
coming along?

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:23.290
The Gore is undergoing
the procedure as you requested.

00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:26.093
We should have
the results momentarily.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.694
Very well then.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.463
I hope these results
are far better

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.465
than what you've
achieved so far.

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.901
I'm a patient person,
but even I have my limits.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.437
Do I make myself clear?

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.737
Very clear.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:38.238
(Queen)
Good.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.106
You're dismissed.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.649
These are the coordinates.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.985
But I don't see
the Earth Ignis anywhere.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.087
Hmm...

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:55.189
Come to think of it,
he did specify the place,

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.157
but he never specified the time.

00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:00.527
So we could be fashionably late
or disgustingly early.

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.029
But I hope he shows up soon

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:04.831
before someone like
SOL Tech sees the message.

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.766
(Playmaker)
Let's take a look around.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.370
(Woman)
This message looks
like it's from an Ignis.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.972
Yes it does.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.008
They even nailed the font.

00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:14.975
I mean...

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:16.377
(laughs)

00:06:16.477 --> 00:06:17.678
What's wrong?

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.314
I might not know
a lot about the Ignis,

00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:21.715
but I do know that none of them

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:23.851
would post on a public
message board.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.919
This has to be a prank.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.088
Hayami, find anything?

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:31.157
No sir,
nothing except for a troll.

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.063
I don't see
anybody else around, AI.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:36.997
(AI)
Hmm...

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.265
But then again,

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:39.900
I'm not 100% certain

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.502
what I'm supposed to be
looking for here.

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:45.306
(AI)
Hey I never told you
about each of the Ignis, have I?

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:47.641
The leader of our troop
is the Light Ignis.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.009
I know you won't believe this,

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.812
but he may actually
be smarter than me.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.314
Half the things he talked about
were over my head,

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.717
and the other half
were way over my head.

00:06:57.318 --> 00:06:58.919
Then there's the Water Ignis.

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.289
She's suuuuuper chill
and suuuuuper nice, but...

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.791
and you didn't hear it from me,

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.059
she's kind of a pain
cuz she has the ability

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.295
to tell if you're lying
or telling the truth.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.065
And that got me into trouble
more than once.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:12.232
(Playmaker)
Really?

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.234
(AI)
Really!

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.936
I always told her to give me
more stuff to do

00:07:16.036 --> 00:07:18.038
because I don't
work hard enough,

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:21.875
but she knew I was lying
and told me to take a vacation.

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.144
In the end,
she saw things my way,

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.546
but she never
forgot to thank me.

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.081
Uh huh.

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:29.983
(AI)
And you know
the rest of the family.

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:31.952
There's Flame the Lame

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.455
and good ol' Windy
to round things out.

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.089
And the one we're meeting today,

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.626
hopefully, is the Earth Ignis.

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.061
He's... umm...

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:41.595
how do you describe him?

00:07:41.728 --> 00:07:44.264
Well, he's orange and blocky

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.000
and perpendicular.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.701
Knda like this guy!

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.037
It's like I'm hugging a boulder.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:51.138
Ahhh.

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:53.874
Whoa hey! It's you!

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.375
That's the Earth Ignis?

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.710
(AI)
In the flesh!

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.879
Well, not flesh but you get it.

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:00.080
How you been?

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:02.283
Follow... me...

00:08:02.383 --> 00:08:04.618
(AI)
Umm... hi to you too?

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.128
(AI)
Hey slow down!

00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:17.364
We haven't even done
introductions yet!

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:19.499
(Earth)
Introductions?

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.535
(AI)
Yeah!
This guy's Playmaker.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.604
And since humans can't
speak our language,

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:24.771
they call me AI.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.107
What should we call you
instead of the Earth Ignis?

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.174
Call me...

00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:29.677
Earth.

00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:31.811
(AI)
Umm,
isn't that a bit on the nose?

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.614
But... your name...

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.048
is AI.

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.616
Because you're...

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.484
an AI.

00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:40.053
Heh, ironic right?

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:41.788
That... is not...

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.792
the definition... of irony.

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:48.695
(AI)
I feel like I'm back in class,
and I didn't even go to school!

00:08:48.996 --> 00:08:51.331
Earth, why did you message me?

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.333
(AI)
Yeah.

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:54.235
I thought we'd have
to go and find you,

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.636
not you find us.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.504
But if I know you
like I know you,

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:59.773
you wouldn't phone
if it wasn't important.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.174
So what do you want?

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:02.677
To challenge you...

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:05.178
to a duel... Playmaker.

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.088
(Playmaker)
You're challenging me?

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:16.122
(Earth)
Correct.

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:17.224
What?

00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:18.925
After months of radio silence,

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:21.862
the first thing you wanna do
is fight us out of the blue?

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:24.598
Without a single hello
or how do you do?

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.133
Oh.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.202
Then... hello...

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.103
How do you do.

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:32.005
That's not what I meant!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:33.407
Apologies.

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:34.708
I am...

00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:37.511
socially... awkward.

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:38.078
Ah.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.013
Well, uh...

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:43.250
You can at least tell us why
you wanna duel Playmaker.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.518
Because I...

00:09:44.618 --> 00:09:46.086
want to see...

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.188
with my own eyes...

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.690
what humans...

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.959
are truly like.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:54.294
That's it?
Well, I can tell you.

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.797
Unlike squirrels,
who are awesome,

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:58.465
they're nothing special.

00:09:58.565 --> 00:09:59.232
Oh...?

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.300
Yea!

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:01.501
But...

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.769
(Ignis sound)

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.905
feels... differently.

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:07.674
You mean the Water Ignis?

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.376
Humans can't understand
our language,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.179
so we should call her... Leaky?

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.013
Drippy?

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.382
Those... are...

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:16.183
horrible.

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:17.284
Oh!

00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:19.854
Absolutely terrible.

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.524
Well, you got a better name,
Mr. Awkward?

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.591
Hmmm.

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.726
Awk-ward...

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.695
Awk-a...

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:31.698
Yes, Aqua.

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.135
The last... time...

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:35.736
I saw...

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.371
Aqua...

00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:39.673
Do you ever think
about the humans?

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:40.708
Not...

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:41.675
really.

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:42.843
I think you should.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.678
You should observe them
with your own eyes

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.513
to see what they're
really like

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.115
before you have to decide.

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.750
(Earth)
Decide...

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.851
what?

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:53.020
Decide which side to join.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.889
The humans or the Ignis.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.525
Because the Cyberse
is splitting in two.

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:02.996
The Cyberse
is splitting into two?

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.798
(AI)
Well, I got news for ya buddy.

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:07.968
It didn't just split,
it was completely annihilated!

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.903
I thought you'd know
that cuz you were...

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.271
you know, there?

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.807
It's not meant... literally.

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:14.808
It's...

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:15.909
a metaphor.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.644
Ah!

00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:18.645
I don't do grammar!

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.746
(Earth)
AI...

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:21.582
why did you join...

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:23.283
the human side?

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:23.917
Ah?

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.253
Why did you team...

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.287
with Playmaker?

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.523
I don't know
if I'd call it a team-up.

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:31.458
More like my Apprentice P here

00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:33.961
wanted to learn
from Sensei AI, right?

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.262
Don't answer too quick...

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:36.463
or at all.

00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.832
Maybe there's something
we can learn from you, Earth.

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:40.433
Me?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.002
(Playmaker)
We're searching
for a man named Bohman.

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:43.804
He not only hurt
someone we know,

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:45.272
but he may also be involved

00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:47.274
with the destruction
of the Cyberse.

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.443
So while you were
floatin' in the network,

00:11:49.577 --> 00:11:51.579
have ya seen or heard
or smelled anything

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:53.313
that can help us track him down?

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:57.017
Even the slightest detail could
prove to be a valuable lead.

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:58.185
I...

00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.820
will tell you...

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.154
what I know--

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:01.922
(AI)
Awesome!

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:03.023
If...

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.391
you duel me.

00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:05.893
Aww, jumped the gun!

00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:08.496
Y' know, it'd be quicker
if you just tell us!

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:09.496
That...

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.597
is true.

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:12.199
Oh? Great!

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:13.900
So you'll share what you know?

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:15.803
No.

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:16.803
(sighs)

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.172
Very well.

00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:19.473
Let's duel.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.474
But how?

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:22.842
An Ignis can't duel
without a partner.

00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:42.563
(Playmaker)
A tree?

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:44.431
Earth must have been created

00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.533
from Spectre
during the Lost Incident.

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:49.136
Are you ready?

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:50.304
Quite...

00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:51.672
ready.

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:52.806
Are you...?

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:53.740
Yes.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.474
Well then.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.343
Let's duel!

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:58.979
All right, Earth!

00:12:59.079 --> 00:13:01.381
Bring it on!
Show me what you got!

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:11.758
Umm...

00:13:12.425 --> 00:13:15.395
Are you not gonna
show me what you got?!?

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:16.563
I'll...

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.964
go second.

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:19.500
You...

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.068
can go...

00:13:21.168 --> 00:13:22.136
first.

00:13:22.236 --> 00:13:24.371
Why didn't you just say
that from the start!?

00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:26.140
You have...

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.374
a problem?

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.143
Why'dya narrow
your eyes like that?

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:32.212
Fine then, it's my turn.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.114
I'll start...

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:37.117
by summoning POISONING BLOCKER
in attack mode!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.288
And due to its special ability,

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:44.558
I can switch it from attack
to defense mode.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:46.894
And when I do,

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.730
this monster gains 800
attack and defense points,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.766
raising it to 2200.

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:55.535
Next, I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:59.039
(AI)
That's a pretty solid
defense to start with.

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:02.275
No matter what Earth plays,
it should keep us protected.

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:04.477
My... turn.

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.847
AI, you still...

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:08.616
haven't answered...

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:09.783
my question.

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:10.784
Huh?

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:11.718
Why...

00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:12.953
do you side...

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.821
with the humans?

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.125
Can't it wait
until after the duel?

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:19.059
No.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.394
You're trying...

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:22.630
to avoid
answering again.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:25.665
You do realize
that humans...

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.601
destroyed the Cyberse.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.769
But without 'em,

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:31.505
we'd never have been created
in the first place.

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.107
(Earth)
But they think...

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:34.942
we're mistakes.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.176
This Bohman...

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.379
and Varis before him...

00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:40.347
want to destroy us.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.482
Yeah, but humans aren't all bad.

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:45.619
You can't judge a whole group
cuz of a few bad apples.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.454
I even like the ones
with worms in 'em

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:48.789
cuz they're
like living spaghetti

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:50.524
and that's awesome!

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:52.292
Whether you are right...

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:53.660
or wrong...

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:55.229
is what I'm here...

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:56.497
to determine.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.198
I draw!

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.937
Since Earth was created
from Spectre,

00:15:03.037 --> 00:15:05.172
does that mean they share
the same dueling style?

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:07.007
Whoa whoa whoa rewind!

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:08.342
Earth and Spectre?!?

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:09.777
I don't see it,

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:11.078
but maybe with a blond wig...

00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:12.178
Focus, AI.

00:15:12.847 --> 00:15:14.548
What's his dueling style?

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:15.882
(AI)
Yeah, that...

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:17.351
Funny story...

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.519
(Playmaker)
You don't know.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:20.520
It's not that I don't know,

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.621
it's that I don't know.

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:23.691
I activate...

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:25.225
the spell card...

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.760
COST DOWN...

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.595
from my hand.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:30.864
By discarding...

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:32.032
one card...

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.034
to the graveyard...

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:35.502
I can lower...

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:38.205
G GOLEM ROCK HAMMER's Level...

00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:40.440
from 6 to 4...

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.242
and summon it.

00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:44.445
But it's only...

00:15:44.545 --> 00:15:45.412
the start.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.014
I...

00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:48.181
can tribute...

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:50.417
G GOLEM ROCK HAMMER...

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:51.686
to summon...

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:53.854
three G GOLEM TOKENS...

00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:55.388
in defense mode.

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.525
He split one monster into three!

00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:00.027
He's going to Link Summon.

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.194
Correct!

00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:03.330
I accrete...

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.832
my circuit!

00:16:04.932 --> 00:16:06.099
I set...

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.669
my three G GOLEM TOKENS

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.604
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.408
I Link Summon!

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:15.909
Link 3...

00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.511
G GOLEM...

00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:20.146
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.790
(Earth)
I Link Summon!

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.359
Link 3...

00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:34.028
G GOLEM...

00:16:34.128 --> 00:16:36.463
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:40.434
INVALID...

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.568
DOLMEN!

00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:42.903
Smash...

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.104
his POISONING...

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:45.405
BLOCKER!

00:16:49.109 --> 00:16:50.777
And even if...

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:52.245
your monster...

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.247
is in defense mode...

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.149
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:57.918
can still deal you...

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:58.785
damage!

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.654
Ahh!

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.090
I end...

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:03.991
my turn.

00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:04.992
Oh!

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.426
Now I remember!

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.361
About?

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:09.229
About how Earth duels!

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.732
He's amazing at dueling!

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:14.802
Which probably coulda helped ya
if I remembered earlier...

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:15.903
Eek!

00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:17.704
My bad!
Don't get mad!

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:19.306
It's my turn!

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.141
I draw!

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.710
I summon BITRON to the field!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.182
And I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:31.819
The summoning condition

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:34.321
requires me to use
one Cyberse monster.

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:37.357
So I set BITRON
in the Link Arrow!

00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:39.526
I Link Summon!

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.562
Link 1 ZOMBIE PROSABER!

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:45.899
PROSABER!

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:49.502
Attack Earth's G GOLEM
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:51.372
(Earth)
Why...?

00:17:51.472 --> 00:17:52.806
Your monster...

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:54.008
is weaker...

00:17:54.141 --> 00:17:54.841
than mine.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:56.310
That doesn't matter

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:58.245
because I have the trap card

00:17:58.345 --> 00:17:59.479
LINK RUSH!

00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:01.948
My Link Monster
can automatically

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:05.785
destroy your monster
without taking any damage!

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:15.763
Next, ZOMBIE PROSABER's
special ability activates!

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:17.597
Since the monster
that was destroyed

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.633
was the one next to its link,

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:21.235
I can resummon that monster

00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:23.937
from your graveyard
to my side of the field.

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:26.207
Meaning your monster
will fight for me.

00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:30.144
And meaning all the muscle
will be on our side!

00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:31.378
I don't...

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:32.779
think so.

00:18:32.879 --> 00:18:33.480
You...

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.882
are stealing nothing...

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:36.416
from me.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.919
When INVALID DOLMEN
is destroyed...

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:41.422
its special ability...

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:42.556
negates...

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:45.091
all your cards' effects.

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:51.932
Argh!
We were so close!

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:53.233
Not that close.

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:57.304
Well, closer than doing nothing,
so I'm technically correct.

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.538
(Playmaker)
But why would you care

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.707
if you're technically
correct or not?

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:01.708
(AI)
Because...

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.712
I'm socially awkward?

00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:06.780
I'm ending my turn, you're up.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.148
Thank...

00:19:08.282 --> 00:19:09.116
you.

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:10.484
I activate...

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:11.718
the spell...

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.153
I just drew.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:15.689
GRAVITY BALANCE.

00:19:16.289 --> 00:19:17.625
I can summon...

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:20.394
two copies
of an Earth monster...

00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:22.396
from my graveyard...

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:23.797
by lowering...

00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:25.799
their attack
and defense points...

00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:27.200
to 0.

00:19:27.701 --> 00:19:28.868
Rise...

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:30.504
from the grave...

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:32.272
G GOLEM...

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.007
ROCK HAMMERS!

00:19:35.276 --> 00:19:36.610
It doesn't matter...

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.946
that they have
no attack points...

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.180
because they won't...

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.116
be sticking around...

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.451
since I'm using both...

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.121
to Link Summon!

00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.222
Witness...

00:19:48.322 --> 00:19:49.557
my new...

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:50.957
Link Monster!

00:19:51.392 --> 00:19:52.959
Link 2...

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:55.962
G GOLEM CRYSTAL HEART!

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:02.770
Bring...

00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:04.104
life...

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.439
to this...

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:07.107
wasteland.

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.818
Did I mention
that underneath all that orange

00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:19.953
he's got the greenest of thumbs?

00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:32.499
Whaa...

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.942
(Playmaker)
I've never seen a monster
do this before.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.143
What's going on?

00:20:46.113 --> 00:20:48.849
This place looks
just like Aqua's territory

00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:50.283
back home in the Cyberse...

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.619
and that looks
like Aqua's monster.

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:54.221
Wait a sec...

00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:55.222
What is it?

00:20:55.322 --> 00:20:58.191
That doesn't just look
like Aqua's monster.

00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.959
It is Aqua's monster!

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.897
So why does Earth have it?

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.030
(Earth)
Aqua...

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.234
I do not trust these humans.

00:21:07.368 --> 00:21:08.669
But I will keep...

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:10.537
my mind open.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:12.606
As I promised you...

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:13.840
I would...

00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:15.542
Because I keep...

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:17.345
my promises...

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:19.713
even if I may never...

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:21.048
see you...

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:23.850
again.
