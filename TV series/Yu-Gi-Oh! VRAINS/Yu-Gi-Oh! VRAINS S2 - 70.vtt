WEBVTT

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.138
(Windy)
Let's do the math,
shall we Varis?

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.774
You have 300 life points
and one monster.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:12.179
While I have 4000 life points
and two monsters.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.914
4000 is greater than 300,

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:14.949
two is greater than one...

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.849
These aren't opinions,

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.784
these are what are
known as facts.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.088
Facts that prove my opinion
that you're in troubllllle.

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.756
But what can you do.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.124
Well,
there is plenty you can do.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.859
Weep, beg, read a graphic novel.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:27.428
It's just
that none of that will help you.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.695
Nothing.
None of it.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.163
(Ai)
He's not wrong...

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.531
Huh.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:32.933
Now I can be nice.
I can.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.568
I don't technically
have to delete you.

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:35.802
Technically.

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.439
I can just have you...
work for me.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.007
Forever.
Unpaid.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:41.675
Until the end of time.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.177
(Varis)
That will never happen.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.014
Not just because I refuse
to be your servant,

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.015
but because you're
not going to defeat me

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.584
in the first place.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:51.685
(Windy)
Aww...

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.186
You know who's most disappointed
with your refusal?

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.421
Ai and Playmaker.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:55.689
I offered you coexistence

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.792
and you just dumped it
in the trash.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.859
That's not coexistence!

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.663
(Windy)
I exist, he exists, we exist,
that's coexistence.

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:03.697
Get a dictionary, Ai.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.999
Even if your offer was real,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.601
I'd never take it.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.570
Because you've already proven
that you're not to be trusted.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:12.472
Yes yes, I've heard that before.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.908
Don't trust the Ignis,
blah blah blah talk talk talk.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.510
It's not just talk.
I have proof.

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:18.645
You do?

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.414
Each Ignis has
a human counterpart,

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:24.417
like you and Playmaker,
and Flame and Soulburner.

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.386
So I ask this:

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:27.721
Where is Windy's?

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.757
If you're not going
to tell them, I will.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:34.194
Because it's the reason why
I will never trust the Ignis.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.004
♪♪♪

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:36.957
Share what you know.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.225
So you snooped
into my history folder, Varis?

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.394
Shame shame shame.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:41.962
Though I can't say I wouldn't
have done the same.

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:44.231
C'mon!
Spill the taco sauce!

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.832
Who's your human partner?

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.067
I...

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.602
don't have one.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:49.637
What?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.371
Of course you do!

00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:52.940
Nope, no I don't.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.708
And you can't do anything
to change my mind

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.109
because
the dumbest-Ignis-says-what.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.944
What?

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:57.878
(laughing)

00:02:57.978 --> 00:02:58.645
Got 'em.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.448
You might have
issues with people,

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:02.316
but you were created from one.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.050
You're both right.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.052
Both?

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.888
I've been investigating
the Lost Incident again

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:10.824
to find out how the six children
are doing in the present.

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:12.560
And what I learned is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.394
that among the six children...

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:18.064
there's one in particular
who's no longer of this world.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.065
Huh?

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.869
(Varis)
An accident due to a faulty AI.

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.605
Surrrreee...
An accident.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:25.606
Windy...

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.041
What did you do?

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.276
(Playmaker)
You caused the accident?

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.610
Why did you do that?

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:31.878
Why?

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.113
Well I never really
thought about it,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.515
becuz...
I didn't want a partner?

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.384
Is that such a big deal?

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.152
Just a skosh.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.654
(Windy)
Really?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.628
Having a partner's a pain.

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:49.964
Do this, do that,
don't do this, don't do that.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.565
And I know you know
that you know that, Ai,

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.033
cuz you've been hanging
with those meatbags

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.001
longer than any of us.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.435
I don't know
how you tolerate it.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:56.536
Well...

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.539
But you must since you're
willing to side with them

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.241
instead of joining
your family in this war.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.209
(Ai)
War?

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.610
There doesn't have to be a war

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:05.345
becuz we don't have to fight!

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.115
Since when did I have to become
the adult in the room!

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.217
I'm not cut out
to be the adult!

00:04:10.284 --> 00:04:11.552
Ai is right.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.187
Uhh... The no fighting part?
Or the adult part?

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.724
It's time you open
your eyes Playmaker.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.192
The war has already started.

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.961
If you haven't
been paying attention,

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.129
we're in the middle
of a duel right now.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:24.798
(groaning)

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:25.632
That's right.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.866
The peace ship
has already sailed

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.535
and fallen off
the edge of the earth.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.770
Just like Varis will

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:32.673
when I send him
plummeting to his demise.

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:35.542
You ought to stop talking
as if you've already won.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:38.912
As long as I have life points,
I'm still in this duel.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.414
That's technically correct.

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.383
But realistically?
No.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.785
It would be wise
not to get ahead of yourself.

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:45.452
Huh?

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:47.087
Now just watch me!

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.623
I summon my SPEEDBURST DRAGON!

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.691
(groaning)

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.627
I get to summon this monster

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.962
whenever your trap card
deals me damage.

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:57.698
But that's not all.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.300
Its special ability

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:02.236
also deals you damage
equal to what I took,

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:04.337
and I regain half that amount!

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.006
No!

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.808
That's three K
worth of damage!

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:20.620
He outplayed you
this time, Windy.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:23.590
Don't rub it in.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.092
There's more.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:26.861
SPEEDBURST DRAGON!

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:30.497
Attack and destroy
STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER!

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.001
Aah!

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:35.635
Varis has taken the lead!

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:37.604
(Windy)
Ah.

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.074
You're beginning to annoy me.

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.475
(Varis)
Is that so?

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.245
Then allow me to relieve you
of that misery...

00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.746
by ending you.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:48.815
Because you can't feel
annoyed if you don't exist.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.016
Huh.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.685
That is logical.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.520
Now don't you start
with me too, Lightning.

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.923
Because while I can appreciate
a well-executed move,

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.825
what I don't appreciate
are the exaggerations.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:58.825
The oversell.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.661
Just one tiiiiiiny
victory on his part and,

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:01.929
"Oh, Windy is done for!

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.863
"Have you bought peonies
for his deletion?"

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.234
With no such evidence to draw
such wild conclusions.

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.669
Keep yapping.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.037
In my experience,
the more someone talks,

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.673
the more they're covering up
for their shortcomings.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.043
And in my experience,
winners talk while losers balk.

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.812
Now it's my turn!

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.748
I draw!

00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:24.652
I activate my spell card,
STROMRIDER RETURN!

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:25.752
As its name implies,

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.088
when I have no other spell
or trap cards in play,

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.524
I can return a STORMRIDER
in my graveyard

00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:31.525
back to my field.

00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.261
STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER
flies again!

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.029
And STORMRIDER TURBULENCE's
effect

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:38.565
raises its attack points by 300!

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:41.268
Uh, you can say it
all powerful and scary-like,

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.702
but both of Varis's monsters

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.705
are still stronger than yours,
Windy.

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:46.039
(Windy)
True. Very true.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.973
That is a problem.

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:48.675
Or it would be a problem for me,
you see,

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.243
if I didn't have
a problem solver.

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:51.478
(evil laugh)

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.812
This!

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:56.750
A Data Storm?

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:03.123
(laughing)

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:05.793
No one winds the winds
more windy than Windy!

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.828
This Data Storm allows me
to activate my Skill!

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.630
When I have less
than 1000 attack points,

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:14.034
I can draw a random Link Monster
from inside the Data Storm!

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:16.570
Hey!
That's our Skill!

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.473
Now it's mine too!

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:22.475
(laughing)

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.914
Go!
Storm Access!

00:07:30.418 --> 00:07:32.085
I thought that Skill
could only be used

00:07:32.152 --> 00:07:33.386
during a Speed Duel.

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:36.757
Well, you thought wrong,
buddy boy.

00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:37.825
That's right.

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.560
(Playmaker)
And this isn't the first time
a Skill was used

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.895
outside of a Speed Duel.

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.564
Bohman did the same thing.

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.600
Does this mean you're
working with him?

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:48.435
(Windy)
I can neither confirm and deny,

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:49.736
but I can do one of 'em!

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.705
Yup!
Bohman's with us!

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:55.142
(Ai)
So you've been lying
to us this whole time?

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:57.144
(Windy)
No no no, not lying.
Misleading.

00:07:57.278 --> 00:07:58.211
Big difference.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.214
Okay, not that big,
but different.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.715
If you're in cahoots
with Bohman,

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.484
and Bohman took Jin's soul,

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:05.219
You must know how to save Jin!

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:06.320
I doooo.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.622
But do I do it?
Do I do or not do?

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:11.058
Cuz all I want to do for now
is to do this duel.

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:14.027
So I'm going
to cyclone my circuit!

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.232
The summoning conditions require
at least two STORMRIDERS,

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.868
so I set STORMRIDER HARPIARM

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:24.437
and STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:27.874
I Link Summon!

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.645
Link 3 STORMRIDERSHIP
BAHAMUT BOMBER!

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:41.054
That's the new monster
that Windy was able to acquire

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:42.222
from the Data Storm.

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.858
And with my Field Spell
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE,

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.861
BAHAMUT BOMBER gains
300 attack points.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:51.198
That makes it stronger
than Varis' monsters!

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:51.832
(Windy)
I know.

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:53.033
That's why I did it.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:55.335
Also, when I have no spell
or trap cards in my field,

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.471
BAHAMUT BOMBER's
special ability activates,

00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:58.973
destroying one of your cards,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.609
and dealing you
500 points of damage.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.911
Be gone, BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:15.356
Now BAHAMUT BOMBER,

00:09:15.456 --> 00:09:18.291
fire and destroy
SPEEDBURST DRAGON!

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:28.102
Ah!

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.105
But there's more.
Yes yes there's more.

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.674
Since I have no monsters
in my Main Monster Zone,

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.510
I'm allowed to summon
STORMRIDER SKYFISHER

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.179
from my hand in defense mode.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.250
But in exchange,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.787
you get to retrieve one spell
or trap card from your graveyard

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.789
and place it facedown
on your field.

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.857
Now go on go on, I'm being nice.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:52.459
Oh, but that card
you bring back?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.127
You're not allowed
to activate it.

00:09:54.227 --> 00:09:56.196
So it'll be
completely useless!

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:57.197
(groans)

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:58.398
(Varis)
Fine.

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.400
I'll bring back MAGIC CYLINDER.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:01.301
Greaaaaaaaat!

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:02.370
But do you know
how I said that card

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:03.670
was completely useless?

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.205
It's not useless for me!

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:08.775
Because BAHAMUT BOMBER's special
ability destroys your trap card

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.444
and deals you
500 points of damage!

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.848
Thanks, MAGIC CYLINDER!

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:17.851
(groans)

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:22.356
Lastly, when I have STORMRIDER
TURBULENCE on my field,

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.292
I can return STORMRIDER
SKYFISHER to my hand.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.532
And with that, I end my turn.

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.434
Not just the turn,
but Varis too.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.103
Ai, don't be so sure.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.206
You know that Varis is the type
that will never give up.

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:40.407
(Varis)
That's right.

00:10:40.508 --> 00:10:41.275
Huh?

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:43.944
Aww glitch!
The Hanoi!

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:45.545
Hey lab coats!

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:48.915
Your boss only has a dollar's
worth of life points left!

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.517
(Faust)
I see that.

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:51.785
So?

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:55.722
A hundred life points is not
the same as zero life points.

00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:57.591
Yes, it's more
than plenty.

00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:00.027
We have
the utmost faith in him.

00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:03.497
My oh my oh my,
confident, aren't you?

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:05.966
Then why is he the one
down on his knees?

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.368
Hmmmmm?

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:10.837
So I can prove...
I can get back up.

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.739
How can we
help, sir?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.776
Did you take care
of all the guards?

00:11:15.843 --> 00:11:18.411
We destroyed
every last one of them.

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.613
What?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.581
Don't be so surprised.

00:11:21.682 --> 00:11:23.750
How could they pose
a threat to us...

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.519
when they were
nothing more than programs?

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.356
(groans)

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:34.027
You three can take a break
while I take care of this Ignis.

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:38.298
Because this is one opponent
I want to crush on my own.

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:47.808
(Kolter)
You see Playmaker anywhere?

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:48.809
(Flame)
No.

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:51.578
But Windy's Echoes
have seen better days.

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:53.113
Hey, look up there.

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.517
Aww man.

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:00.721
(Soulburner)
I know you.

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:01.855
You're Spectre.

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:04.725
Nice to meet you too,
Soulburner.

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:06.660
Oh, so you know who I am.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.262
(Spectre)
Oh, not just you.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.764
Also your little fiery friend.

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:12.399
Does it have a name?

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:13.734
Yes it's F-L--

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.069
(Soulburner)
His name is
none of your business!

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:16.737
"None of your business?"

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.706
That's quite an unusual name.

00:12:18.806 --> 00:12:21.508
I would've picked something
simpler and better like...

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:22.910
Flame.

00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.078
I agree.
It's quite--

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:25.212
(Soulburner)
Not now.

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:27.981
(Spectre)
I was just finishing
cleaning up this rabble,

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.749
so would you care to join me

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.986
up these stairs
to that temple above?

00:12:32.086 --> 00:12:32.919
Join you, huh?

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:35.322
(Spectre)
I promise you this isn't a trap.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:36.323
(Soulburner)
Heh.

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:38.892
I know how much a Hanoi's
promise is worth.

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:41.528
You wound me,
Soulburner.

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:42.930
I assure you

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.766
this little excursion will be
to our mutual benefit.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.734
Because what awaits
there is the truth.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.203
The truth about the Ignis.

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:50.904
A truth that may
affect how you view

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.173
that little fireball of yours.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.143
Oh, it sounds like you
are accusing me of something?

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:57.244
(Spectre)
Am I?

00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:01.749
Well if you follow me,
you can see for yourself.

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:02.816
(sighs)

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.224
(Windy)
It's a shame
that you can't transform

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.593
your arrogance into life points.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.960
Because if you could
you'd have more

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:15.395
than the number
of stars in the sky.

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:16.497
But you can't and you won't

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.632
so all you can do
with your 100 life points

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:20.300
is glare at me in vain.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.368
Like this.

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:26.773
Ah, seems we've arrived
at the most exciting moment.

00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:29.643
Hold up.
Windy, what are you doing here?

00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:31.478
Flame! Soulburner!

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:32.379
(gasps)

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.614
Playmaker it's you!

00:13:33.714 --> 00:13:35.582
Yusaku!
Ai!

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.051
(laughs)

00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:40.087
Perfect, another Ignis
arrives to join the party.

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:42.990
The Knights of Hanoi!
How dare you!

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:45.159
If you've hurt even a single
byte off my companions...

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.160
Flame...?

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:47.427
FLAME!!!!

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.629
The Hanoi didn't
trap us in here.

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:51.665
It was Windy and Lightning.

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.168
What?
I don't understand...

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:55.602
What don't you
understand?

00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:57.605
It's quite normal
to lock up a traitor.

00:13:57.705 --> 00:14:00.841
A traitor like Ai.
And a traitor like you, Flame.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.277
Lightning,
will you do the honors?

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:04.511
Certainly.

00:14:08.182 --> 00:14:08.816
Look out!

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:11.651
Activating anti-Ignis algorithm!

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:15.790
Ha!

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.225
Looks like our pal's
program came in handy.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.129
And he created extras for you.

00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:28.969
I am free!

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:30.871
Wee!

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:32.973
Windy!
You're in for it now!

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.277
You better get your wallet
cuz we're making you pay!

00:14:36.377 --> 00:14:37.644
Wait your turn.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.714
I still have
this Varis to dust away.

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:42.383
It's my turn!

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.483
I draw!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.819
It's not just a draw.
It's your final draw.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.655
Your final draw ever.
How does that feel?

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:50.023
(smirks)

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:51.325
That's unexpected.

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:52.659
What's with the smirk?

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.828
I was picturing
how fun it'll be

00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:57.397
to shove your own words
down your throat.

00:14:57.731 --> 00:15:00.367
I'll start by activating
my Field Spell,

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.802
BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH,

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:05.505
to revive one ROKKET monster
that's in my graveyard!

00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:09.009
Come on back,
ANESTHROKKET DRAGON!

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:12.946
Then I summon my Tuner
ROKKET SYNCHRON from my hand!!

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:17.117
It's a Tuner monster.

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:18.452
Huh?

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.922
(Varis)
Next, ROKKET SYNCHRON's
special ability activates!

00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:24.725
When I successfully
summon ROKKET SYNCHRON,

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:26.860
I can resurrect
a Level 5 or higher

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.097
Dark Attribute Dragon from
my graveyard in defense mode

00:15:30.197 --> 00:15:32.399
by negating
its special abilities!

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.269
Now go, SPEEDBURST DRAGON!

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:36.404
The one drawback

00:15:36.504 --> 00:15:38.705
is that it's destroyed
at the end of the turn,

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.607
but I won't have
to worry about that

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:43.010
because it won't
stick around for long!

00:15:43.244 --> 00:15:45.011
Watch this, Windy!

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.951
My Level 1 ROKKET SYNCHRON

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.754
tunes with my Level 1
ANESTHROKKET DRAGON

00:15:53.854 --> 00:15:56.456
and Level 6 SPEEDBURST DRAGON!

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.532
Varis... can Synchro Summon?

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:12.639
The fuel of the cosmos mixes
with the boundaries of speed...

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:14.908
to transcend the beyond!

00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:16.476
I Synchro Summon!

00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:20.614
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:33.861
(Varis)
The fuel of the cosmos mixes
with the boundaries of speed...

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.529
to transcend the beyond!

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.431
I Synchro Summon!

00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:39.699
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:16:41.469 --> 00:16:42.335
Ah!

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:43.504
Oh man...

00:16:43.604 --> 00:16:45.839
Varis has revamped
his deck.

00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:47.007
(groans)

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.411
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON's
special ability activates!

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.347
When this dragon
is Synchro Summoned,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.650
it equips one Link Monster
from my graveyard.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.920
And for every Link Arrow
that the Link Monster has,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.323
SAVAGE DRAGON gains
one Borrel Counter.

00:17:03.424 --> 00:17:06.393
So I'll equip it
with BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:08.929
Since BORRELOAD
DRAGON has four Links,

00:17:09.063 --> 00:17:12.032
SAVAGE DRAGON gains
four Borrel Counters!

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.602
BORRELOAD DRAGON used
to be his main dude,

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:17.238
but now it's cast
for best supporting role!

00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:21.007
Meaning his cards are
more powerful than before.

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:23.410
This isn't... good.

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.746
How could I not
have predicted this?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.581
He's only a human!

00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:31.718
(Varis)
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON has
another special ability!

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:35.356
It gains half the attack points
of the monster that it equips!

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:38.758
BORRELOAD DRAGON has
3000 attack points,

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:43.697
so SAVAGE DRAGON's
attack points increase to 4500!

00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:47.567
I still have one last maneuver
to shut you down forever!

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.636
My BAHAMUT BOMBER's
special ability

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:52.005
can destroy one card
in your Spell &amp; Trap Zone,

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.407
meaning your BORRELOAD DRAGON,

00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:55.409
and deal you
500 points of damage!

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:57.244
And you only have
100 life points left!

00:17:57.378 --> 00:17:59.747
Meaning you would still be alive
if you never brought it out!

00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:00.647
(Varis)
Don't worry.

00:18:00.747 --> 00:18:03.316
I'll still be alive anyway.

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:08.389
My BORRELOADSAVAGE DRAGON
has yet a third ability!

00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:10.491
By using one Borrel Counter,

00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:13.493
it negates BAHAMAUT BOMBER's
special ability!

00:18:15.328 --> 00:18:16.763
Noooooo!

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.733
Yes.
And it's over, Windy!

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:21.535
Attack!

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:24.471
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.976
Ahh.

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.318
Aahh!

00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:46.493
Well, that took the air
out of his sail.

00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:49.096
Light...ning...

00:18:49.163 --> 00:18:50.664
Help me...

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:51.765
Help you?

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:53.233
Why?

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:55.469
You're the one who wanted
to duel him.

00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:57.771
You're the one
who chose to lose.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.274
You knew the consequences.

00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:01.775
No... I don't...

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:03.544
I don't want to be erased.

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:05.011
Finish it.

00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:07.881
No stop!
Don't do it!

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:13.887
(groaning)

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:15.388
Windy...

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:18.358
I... don't... want...

00:19:18.459 --> 00:19:20.961
to be... erased...

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:22.796
Lightning!
Save him!

00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:31.605
Thank... you...

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.974
I couldn't help
but to overhear you

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:36.443
asking Lightning
for help, Ai.

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.112
Yeah, what of it?

00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:40.681
Me and Windy might not
see eye to eye,

00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:43.049
but that doesn't
mean I want him gone!

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:44.985
(Lightning)
But after
what we just witnessed,

00:19:45.052 --> 00:19:47.054
I don't believe
your fellow humans

00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:49.022
agree with that statement.

00:19:49.122 --> 00:19:50.391
How about you, Flame?

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:52.393
Which side are you on?

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:54.829
(Flame)
I am on the side of peace.

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:56.029
(Soulburner)
As am I.

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:57.965
Then you're in the minority

00:19:58.065 --> 00:19:59.867
because there can
never be peace.

00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:02.702
That's the one thing
we agree on.

00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:03.537
(groans)

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.172
(Ai)
C'mon, Lightning!

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:06.707
You know I'm not good at this,

00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:09.643
but do I have to appeal
to your logic again?

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.346
Without Windy,
you're all on your own!

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:15.883
I'm not as alone
as you may think, Ai.

00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:17.717
(gasps)
Soulburner, it's them!

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:18.885
Bohman and--

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:20.454
(Ai)
And his cheerleader.

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:21.721
(Playmaker)
Good, it saves me the trouble

00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:22.822
of finding you two.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.291
Because I won't
rest until I learn

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.692
where you're hiding Jin's soul.

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:27.361
Hiding?

00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:29.329
It hasn't been hiding.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:32.900
In fact,
it's been here all this time.

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:34.367
Say what?

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:41.308
No way...

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:43.376
Can this truly be...

00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:47.714
Lightning's counterpart is Jin!
