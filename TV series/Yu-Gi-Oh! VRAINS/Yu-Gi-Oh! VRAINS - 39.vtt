00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.404
(Ai)
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS!"

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.408
(laughing)

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.243
Well done, Playmaker...

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.446
I had this duel won,
until I didn't.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.582
Even though you tricked me
into defeating myself,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.286
Master Varis will not fall
for such deceptions.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.489
That is why he is the
leader of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.158
The one who will be
your downfall.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.294
My one true master.

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.196
I don't care.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.598
(chuckles)

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.132
So you say.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.800
But know this:

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.403
Your tale will end
in tragedy!

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:37.738
(chuckling)

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.107
It is already written!

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.108
(loud rumbling)

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.817
(groaning)
Hurry!

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.452
Faster, Playmaker!

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.623
Because if that bridge
goes down, so do you!

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.291
(screaming)

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:02.662
(theme song playing)

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.755
(panting)

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.658
Ah!
Playmaker!

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.159
(screaming)

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.129
Oh, no! Playmaker's
falling into the abyss!

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.430
Poor guy's done for!

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:14.401
Why couldn't you spring
for the parachute app?

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.069
(gasps)

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.608
(Ai screaming)

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.377
I'm getting the dizzies!

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:29.449
(Pigeon)
Did the abyss just
regurgitate him?

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.919
Did you create
that Data Storm?

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:34.154
Love to take
the credit, but no.

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:36.924
If it wasn't you,
then who did I sense?

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:38.325
Beats me.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.561
But don't you have important
things to worry about?

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.496
You know, like that
tower over there?

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.965
A billion miles tall,
give or take a billion?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.466
It's over halfway done!

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.470
And that means we have less
than three hours left, Ai.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.571
Let's go.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.305
He's on the move, boss,

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:53.707
and it looks like
he's makin' a beeline

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.309
for the tower!

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.644
Well, then so are we,
so get your hustle hustlin'

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.780
and follow those
toothpicks, got it?!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.982
Consider it got, boss!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.451
Good. Now watch
the sway would ya?

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.286
I don't wanna be deletin'
my dinner!

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:08.321
Right, boss, my bad!

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.498
Oh, no!

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.699
It's okay.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.674
Hmph.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.178
I know where you're
going, George.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.682
And I also know that
there's no stopping you.

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.150
Then why are you
standing in my way?

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:39.120
Scared I might not come back?

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.721
Just be careful, George.

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.790
Not just for me,
but also for the children.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.293
You got nothing
to worry about.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.063
What you oughta be doin' is
worrying about Varis's health

00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:52.166
'cause I'm out
to cole slaw 'em!

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.668
Then please promise me
you'll come back.

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:57.938
Heh.
You're talkin' to The Gore!

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.207
Makin' comebacks'
is my thing!

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.344
All right,
I made it to the tower.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.716
Just because it's
within your sights

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.752
doesn't mean
you've made it.

00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:15.756
I'm surprised someone not named
Playmaker would get this far.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.093
But this is as close
as you will get.

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.261
Let me guess,
'cause you're gonna stop me.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:22.630
Yes, Gore.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.264
You're not as dumb
as you look.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.734
Says the guy wearing a helmet
with four zits.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:32.206
Your blabberin' don't
intimidate me none.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:34.908
I do hope your dueling's
better than your grammar.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.411
Or this battle
will be a short one.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.381
I'm giving you one last chance
to turn around and leave.

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:42.749
They teach you that
in clichÃ© school?

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.951
Tell me, Varis,

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.586
when's the last time someone
took you up on that offer?

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.422
You'd be surprised.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:51.225
It happens more often
than you think, Gore.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.626
Yeah, right!

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.595
That's 'cause you've been
dealin' with tenderloins...

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:57.965
But now you're facin'
a real duelist!

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.968
Gore, why are you so desperate
to rush to your demise?

00:05:02.068 --> 00:05:05.472
Are you that eager
to join your friend Blue Angel,

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:09.643
digitized into nothing more
than bits and pieces
of indiscriminate data?

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:11.845
What?

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:12.913
Blue Angel's gone?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.982
Very much so.

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:17.251
She put up a worthy fight;

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.452
she just didn't
have the skills.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.456
But you're not the only one
who suffered loss...

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.092
I will avenge Spectre's defeat.

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.128
But I can't do that
against you.

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:29.496
Too bad, bub!

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:32.366
'cause you won't even get
the chance to duel Playmaker!

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:35.135
Not after I put you down
for the count!

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.571
Then you leave me
no choice.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.173
I haven't forgotten that you
singlehandedly defeated

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.608
many of my Hanoi.

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:44.811
So ending you will be
a nice consolation prize.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:48.115
Yeah? Look how
I'm shaking.

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:50.984
(Gore)
Don't forget
what Playmaker said...

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.586
(Playmaker)
If you do find Varis...

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.788
Make sure to be
extra careful.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.524
Ghost Gal warned me of some
powerful new card.

00:05:57.624 --> 00:05:59.859
(Gore)
Varis may have a new card,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.897
but I have a new deck...
packed full of power punchers!

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:06.566
Now ring the bell!

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.470
'Cause I'm rarin' to take you
apart piece by piece!

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:14.040
Time to duel!
Time to duel!

00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:23.417
You ready, porkchop?

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:24.885
It's my turn.

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:28.088
I'll start off
by summoning this bruiser!

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.223
Gouki Suprex!

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:35.396
And when Suprex steps
into the ring, he also brings

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.366
his tag team partner...
Gouki Twistcobra!

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.536
Now watch these two Gouki's
double team the circuit!

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:48.142
The summoning conditions
require two Goukis

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:53.246
So I set Gouki Twistcobra and
Gouki Suprex in the Link Arrows!

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.516
And now I Link Summon!

00:06:55.549 --> 00:07:00.220
Link 2 Gouki Jet Ogre!

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:03.957
When Suprex and Twistcobra leave
the ring for the graveyard,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.461
their special ability activates,
letting me draw

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:11.598
two new Gouki cards from my deck
and add 'em to my hand.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.434
(Pigeon)
Whoa!

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.270
Your peepers
peep that glow?

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:19.373
We gotta tell Playmaker!

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.541
(Frog)
Hey, Playmaker, hold up!

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.878
There's a duel goin' on
at three o'clock!

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:25.879
Three?

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:27.114
I missed lunch?

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:30.117
(sighs)
This is not
the time for jokes, Ai.

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:31.285
Nice one!

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:33.787
The Gore must be dueling now.

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.655
You should log out.

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:37.824
It's only more
dangerous from here.

00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.494
Nope!
We're in this
to the end!

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:43.063
The birdbrain and I are coverin'
your story,

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.966
so we're gonna be stickin'
to you like lint on a lollipop!

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.135
We won't let you out
of our sight--

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:49.270
(both gasp)

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.737
(Pigeon)
Yikes, he's fast.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.108
Quit squawkin' and kick your
cardio into overdrive!

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.443
Right, boss!

00:07:56.543 --> 00:08:00.447
And next I activate the
spell card Gouki Re-match.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.483
It lets me summon a pair of
Goukis with different levels

00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:04.885
in defense mode!

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.522
But they ain't
stickin' around!

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:11.225
'cause I'm creatin'
another circuit!

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:14.528
That'll require two or more
Gouki Monsters!

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:17.832
So, I'm gonna set Gouki Suprex
and Gouki Jet Ogre

00:08:17.865 --> 00:08:19.733
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:23.270
I Link Summon!

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:26.473
Link 3 Gouki Thunder Ogre!

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.449
I activate Thunder Ogre's
special ability to summon

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:39.286
another Gouki from my hand to
join him in this match!

00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:41.021
(growling)

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.391
Now get in the tussle,
Gouki Suprex!

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:51.498
And when I summon Gouki Suprex,
I can also summon

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:53.066
Gouki Ripscorpio!

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:56.803
Your move, Varis.

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:03.077
(Ai)
There he is!

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.611
Check out Gore's monsters!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.847
Their biceps have biceps!

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.448
You jelly?

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.718
Not really.

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:13.353
And neither is Varis.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.622
Sorry to steal your
spotlight, Playmaker.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:19.026
But not really.
You're done duelin' for today.

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:22.262
'cause I'll pin
this jobber for ya.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:25.232
It appears the only thing
that can overshadow your
confidence...

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.334
is your total delusion.

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.336
It is my turn!

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.842
You know that as journalists,
we gotta be impartial.

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.576
But go, Gore!
Win this!

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.577
Yeah!

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.914
Gore's been on a hot
winning streak

00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:42.082
against the Knights
of Hanoi lately.

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.350
But Varis...

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.519
This is a totally different
level of skill

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:49.022
that he's facing off against.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.391
It doesn't get more
flash than this!

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.861
(children)
Let's go, Gore!

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.730
Gore's gonna beat this guy
and he's gonna win!

00:09:56.764 --> 00:09:58.299
We're all rooting for you!

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.867
I'm so worried.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:02.535
If George loses
he can never come home.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.005
Never be scared
to confront a bully.

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:08.576
Isn't that what you
teach these tykes?

00:10:08.676 --> 00:10:11.344
Since you have a Link Monster
on your field...

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.348
I can summon...
my Gateway Dragon.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:18.552
(roars)

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:22.522
And by activating its special
ability... I can then summon

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:25.292
another dragon straight from my
hand as long as it's level

00:10:25.393 --> 00:10:27.394
is four or lower.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.297
Emerge, Sniffer Dragon!

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.871
And Sniffer Dragon's ability
sniffs out another copy

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:41.408
from my deck
which I also summon!

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:44.444
Behold!

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:47.013
What you can do
I can do better.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.515
The summoning conditions..

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.218
require at least two
of my monsters.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:55.089
So I set Gateway Dragon
and my two Sniffer Dragons

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:57.758
in the Link Arrows!

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.426
(roaring)

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:04.331
I Link Summon!

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.667
Link 3 Triple Burst Dragon!

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:11.839
(Gore)
That's a lot of attack points.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.574
But it don't mean nuthin'
'cause I can use Twistcobra

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.977
to increase my attack
points too.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.081
(Varis)
Since my Triple Burst Dragon has
the same number of links as your

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:25.819
Thunder Ogre, I'm allowed to
activate my spell Arrow Charge!

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.923
It lets me draw two cards...

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.092
which you're also
allowed to see.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:35.962
But knowing what I possess will
not help you in the least Gore!

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.766
Not when I use your
Thunder Ogre's special ability

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.769
against you to summon a monster
next to its link!

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:46.506
Rise up,
Triggering Wurm!

00:11:46.606 --> 00:11:50.477
Do you know what's the best
form of sabotage?

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.812
The one that you
inflict on yourself.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.080
(annoyed growl)

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:54.814
And thanks to your help,

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.417
I can manifest
my circuit once again!

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:00.854
This time I require at least
two Effect Monsters,

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:04.091
so I set Triggering Wurm
and Triple Burst Dragon

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.859
in the Link Arrows!

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.401
I Link Summon!

00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:17.337
Link 4 Topologic Bomber Dragon!

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:30.517
That's the best monster
he's got in his stable.

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:35.222
This certainly doesn't
bode well for Gore.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:39.259
Next up, Triggering Wurm's
special ability activates!

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:43.664
Since I used it to Link Summon
Topologic Bomber Dragon,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:45.999
it can resurrect itself
from my graveyard

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:49.569
next to Bomber Dragon's link!

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:53.974
And this in turn triggers my
Topologic's special ability!

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.475
Ooh, I remember this!

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:57.044
Not good!

00:12:57.077 --> 00:13:01.882
(Varis)
When a monster is summoned next
to a Link Monster's link,

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:05.219
Topologic Bomber Dragon
destroys all monsters

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:07.787
in both our Main Monster Zones!

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:09.756
Oh, no!

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.827
Twistcobra can help me out
before it's destroyed!

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:17.130
It uses its special ability
to tribute Ripscorpio

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:19.767
and give all its attack points
to Thunder Ogre

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.934
until the end of the turn!

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.947
That all ya got?

00:13:33.981 --> 00:13:36.650
Since I destroyed my own
Triggering Wurm,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.052
I am allowed to draw
one card from my deck

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.454
and then add it to my hand.

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:43.424
You weren't as slick as ya
thought, ya curtain jerker.

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:45.959
Your Bomber Dragon
destroys monsters

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.761
in the Main Monster Zone.

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:51.432
But Thunder Ogre's
in the Extra Monster Zone.

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:53.400
So it's standing tall!

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.436
And since ya destroyed a monster
next to its link,

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:58.773
it gains 400 attack points!

00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:02.476
And since ya destroyed
three of my Goukis,

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.012
each of their
abilities lets me draw a card!

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:07.147
One plus one plus one.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.383
I bet even you can do
that math.

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:11.685
But just in case
that's three cards.

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:14.455
Carry the one...
Yup, checks out!

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.490
That changes nothing!

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:20.327
I will now activate my spell
card Link Protection!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.631
Topologic Bomber Dragon can no
longer be destroyed in battle,

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.967
and any battle damage we take

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.836
will be reduced to zero.

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:30.837
Ready?

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:32.539
Topologic Bomber Dragon!

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:35.375
Attack Gouki Thunder Ogre!

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:45.218
Why? His monster's
weaker than Gore's!

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:46.887
What a doofy goofus!

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.222
And my Bomber Dragon
automatically destroys

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:51.324
any monster it battles!

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:55.695
Ooh.

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:57.364
Guess I'm the doofy goofus!

00:14:57.464 --> 00:14:59.366
Or goofy doofus...
Foofus goofus.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.570
But this is only the beginning
of your problems.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.539
Topologic's ability
deals you damage equal

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:08.342
to Thunder Ogre's
attack points!

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.076
Now unleash the pain!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:17.184
There's no way you're gonna make
me tap out that easy Varis!

00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.954
By discarding Gouki Octostretch
from my hand,

00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:21.589
the damage is cut
in half!

00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:22.622
(grunts)

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.931
That's a nice play
you made.

00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:34.267
But it doesn't make you
a Playmaker.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.169
No wonder you
could never beat him.

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:37.604
I end my turn.

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:41.408
(Gore)
It doesn't matter if this creep
looks down on me,

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.411
'Cause the only faces
that matter are the ones

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.679
that look up to me!

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:49.049
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:15:49.083 --> 00:15:51.084
Get ready, Varis!

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:54.054
I activate the spell
Gouki Re-match!

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:58.725
This resurrects two Goukis from
my graveyard in defense mode!

00:16:00.694 --> 00:16:04.832
And I'll use 'em...
to mash my circuit!

00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.634
I need to use two Goukis!

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.936
And two Goukis are exactly

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:11.838
what I have in front of me
on my field!

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:13.940
Link the circuit!

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:17.678
I Link Summon!

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:21.314
Link 2 Gouki Heel Ogre!

00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:23.683
(battle cry)

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.454
Hmph.

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.322
(Varis)
Did you summon your new monster

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:32.259
in front of Topologic Bomber
Dragon's link?

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:36.663
My oh my, what a blunder because
it gets instantly destroyed.

00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:38.465
That's no mistake.

00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:40.534
Because I wanted it
to be destroyed.

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:43.471
Is that so?

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:46.072
And why would you
desire that?

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:47.474
Guess you don't
know everythin'!

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.477
'cause when a monster next
to Heel Ogre's link activates

00:16:50.578 --> 00:16:52.813
its ability, not only
is it negated,

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.282
but your monster's
also destroyed!

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:58.919
In other words, your Dragon's
goin' up in flames!

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:00.420
Impossible!

00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:08.495
(roaring)

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.038
No!

00:17:17.071 --> 00:17:20.040
Score one for Gore!

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:23.210
He did it!
Awesome!

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.213
I used your own monster
against ya.

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:30.050
That's the best
kind of sabotage.

00:17:30.084 --> 00:17:33.587
But this ride ain't over
'cause Heel Ogre can re-summon

00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:36.857
a Gouki Link Monster
from my graveyard!

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.325
So Gouki Thunder Ogre.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.360
is coming back from retirement!

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:45.098
And since I sent Gouki Suprex
and Twistcobra

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:46.866
to the showers earlier,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.703
their special abilities let me
draw two more Gouki cards

00:17:49.737 --> 00:17:51.905
from my deck.

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:54.708
Gore's deck was always solid,
but he's enhanced it

00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:57.511
with new cards to turn
this duel in his favor.

00:17:57.544 --> 00:17:59.179
Wait, what did
you say?

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.814
Was that a compliment?

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:03.383
You actually know
how to do that?

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.119
But I worry that Varis
remains unfazed.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:08.488
You may think you
have the lead,

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:11.291
but a single card
can change the duel.

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:14.394
By banishing Link Protection

00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:16.464
along with Topologic
Bomber Dragon,

00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:19.800
you can't attack me unless you
have at least the same number

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:23.103
of Link Monsters
as Topologic has links.

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:24.938
That Dragon's Link 4,

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:27.608
so Gore needs four
Link Monsters to attack.

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.276
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.078
I already have two...

00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.614
And gettin' two more
ain't a problem!

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:37.317
First up, I summon Gouki
Suprex from my hand!

00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:43.123
Then, its special ability lets
me summon Gouki Ripscorpio!

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:46.560
And that's only the start,

00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:49.296
'cause I got plenty more
monsters in my hand.

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:52.299
By sending one Gouki
in my hand to my graveyard,

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:56.236
I can summon Gouki Headbatt
in defense mode!

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.107
And Headbatt's special ability
gives Thunder Ogre

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:01.975
800 attack points
until the end of the turn!

00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:08.014
All right it's time--
for me to mash my circuit!

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.487
The summoning conditions
are two or more Goukis!

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:19.359
So I set Gouki Suprex,
Ripscorpio and Headbatt
in the Link Arrows!

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:27.334
I Link Summon...
Link 3 Gouki The Great Ogre!

00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:37.011
Three down, one to go!

00:19:37.044 --> 00:19:40.981
Since Gouki Ripscorpio
and Headbatt
went to the graveyard...

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:42.449
(grunts)

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:45.553
...their special abilities let
me draw two more Gouki cards

00:19:45.653 --> 00:19:47.187
from my deck!

00:19:47.288 --> 00:19:50.490
Next I activate
the spell Gouki Roar.

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:54.695
Whenever my Gouki attacks, it's
bulked up by 300 attack points

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.563
for every Gouki on my field!

00:19:58.499 --> 00:20:01.201
Last but not least,
I activate...

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.370
this Gouki Face Turn spell.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.974
By givin' Gouki Roar the
heave-ho, I can summon a Monster

00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:08.341
from my graveyard.

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:11.344
Fly on back, Gouki Jet Ogre!

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.183
Oh yeah,
that's four for Gore!

00:20:16.283 --> 00:20:18.185
Attack for the V... victory!

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.353
(chuckles)

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.354
Boogie with me,
Playmaker!

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:23.724
Umm... I take that as a no?

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:25.225
What are you
worried about?

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:27.061
Gore has this in the bag!

00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:28.562
Perhaps.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.033
Or perhaps not...

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.302
That facedown card...

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.638
I've got kids counting on me

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:41.041
to save Link VRAINS
and put the Hanoi on ice!

00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:43.343
Beginning with you!

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:44.879
Is that so.

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:48.181
Then don't disappoint those
children, Gore.

00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.884
Go ahead and finish me.

00:20:50.984 --> 00:20:52.386
Oh, I will.

00:20:52.486 --> 00:20:56.857
Gouki The Great Ogre,
attack Varis directly!

00:20:56.957 --> 00:21:00.927
Remember the time I said a
single card can change the duel?

00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:04.465
This is the card
I was talking about!

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:05.465
(whimpers)

00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:07.334
Turn down
the high beams, wouldya!

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.073
(screaming)

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.408
(Playmaker)
Oh no...

00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:18.412
(Varis)
I activate Mirror Force!

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.881
Every monster on your field
in attack mode...

00:21:21.915 --> 00:21:23.950
is destroyed.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.953
Every... single... one.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:32.526
(Gore)
My Monsters!

00:21:32.593 --> 00:21:33.594
No!

00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:35.095
This can't be!

00:21:42.536 --> 00:21:45.906
So this is the card Ghost Gal
warned us about...

00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:48.209
He got me!

00:21:48.242 --> 00:21:51.211
(maniacal laughter)

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.256
âªâªâª
