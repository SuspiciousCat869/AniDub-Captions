WEBVTT

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:06.640
(Voice A)
Zaizen, recent events have
made it a very troubling time

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.009
for SOL Technologies.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.778
(Voice B)
If our investors learn

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.780
that the Queen
is out of commission,

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.448
it will mean disaster.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.951
(Voice C)
Zaizen, bring this
situation under control.

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.786
Immediately.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.259
If the Queen's MIA,

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.427
who called you
for an emergency meeting?

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.296
The Kings did.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.431
The Kings?

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.866
I never heard anything
about the Kings before.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.034
And more
importantly...

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.503
How much royalty do
we have in this company?

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.605
The Kings aren't
royalty, Hayami...

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.574
They're our biggest
shareholders.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.309
Oh! I get it now!

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:44.778
Since you're running SOL Tech
while the Queen's away,

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.913
they called to give you
a pep talk, right?

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:49.449
Or the opposite...

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.953
(crosstalk)

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.454
(Theodore)
Yusaku. Wait up!

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:56.957
Hey, uh...

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.359
Can I get your opinion
on something?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.195
What's up?

00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:02.996
What's wrong?
Uh...

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.565
Eh, don't worry
about it.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.200
You sure?

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.736
Yeah...

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.238
It was nothing.
Not a big deal at all, promise.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.506
(phone vibrating)

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:15.842
It's a text from Kolter.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.745
He wants us to come
see him immediately.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:20.146
Let's go.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.518
Somebody sent an email
to your secret account?

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:26.820
Mhmm.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.690
Requesting to meet
Playmaker and Soulburner.

00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:32.059
So who's
the sender?

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.193
It's Zaizen.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.994
(gasps)

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.262
He'll be waiting for you two

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.365
at Central Station
inside LINK VRAINS.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.668
Wait, I thought they
shut down LINK VRAINS.

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:42.069
Guess not for you.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.072
If LINK VRAINS is locked out
for everyone else,

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.542
what better place for a super
secret secure meeting, right?

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.510
Wanna go see what's up?

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:51.979
Yes, of course.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.748
If Zaizen needs our help,
then we will give it to him.

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:56.250
Agreed.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.717
And I'm coming, too.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.686
(Both)
Hmm.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:09.262
♪♪♪

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:16.563
Gentlemen...

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.131
Glad you both
made it.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.867
But I don't recall
inviting a third...

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.970
I enjoy crashing parties...

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.939
Okay then.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.309
So Zaizen,
why the secret rendezvous?

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:31.779
I'll tell you when
the others arrive.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:33.213
You're expecting others?

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.319
(Soulburner)
Hey if this ain't
a sight for sore eyes.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.188
Feels like it's been... forever.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:42.989
Hey there, Gore.

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.457
You're looking
a whole lot better.

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:45.993
Sure am.

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:48.662
And I'm feelin'
a lot better too.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.397
Thanks to me?

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:51.832
(chuckles)

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.167
What, are you fishin'
for more compliments?

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.437
Calling this lineup together...

00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:58.839
Must mean something
big has happened.

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:01.541
(Zaizen)
Yes, something big did happen.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:04.278
You see, yesterday

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:05.879
someone went after The Queen,

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:09.182
SOL Tech's top executive
and put her out of commission.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.551
Ooh, that is big.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.222
(Zaizen)
The culprit executed the assault

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.557
by hacking one of SOL Tech's
androids...

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.927
You guys were attacked
by your own product?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.227
That's hilarious.

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:22.396
You may laugh,

00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:24.698
but this is no
laughing matter.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.967
The culprit stole
the Queen's code key

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.203
in order to gain control
of SOL Tech's mainframe.

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:31.872
Okay, I get it.

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:35.042
You want us to get
this code key back for ya.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.677
That's not what I want.

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:39.780
What I want to hire you to do
is protect me.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:41.882
Protect you, huh?

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:43.216
And why you need that?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.053
Because I'm going
to be attacked next.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:48.889
You see, there are
two code keys that exist.

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.858
And the second one is with me.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.393
And you need both to control
the mainframe.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:55.062
So it's only a matter of time

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.797
until the culprit comes for me.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:58.298
And you want us
to protect you

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.300
so that your key
won't get stolen.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:01.936
C'mon,

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.271
it can't be that
bad of a thing.

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.939
We all hacked
into your mainframe

00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:07.274
one time
or another.

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.342
Just change your password
and move on.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:10.811
We can't do that

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:13.080
because these keys
are special master keys

00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:14.748
that control
the whole mainframe.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.917
And whoever gains
control of the mainframe

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.685
gains control
of the whole company.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.455
And since SOL Tech's
tech is in everything,

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.458
cell phones, traffic lights,
toasters even,

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.460
if you control SOL Tech,
you control the world.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:29.162
(Zaizen)
That's right.

00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:32.299
And if the culprit decides
to misuse this technology,

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:34.534
he can throw
the world into chaos.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.271
(Soulburner)
And we already know he knows
his way around technology.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.608
Cuz he was able to hack into
SOLtiS to attack the Queen,

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.343
and that's not easy.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:44.845
(Kolter)
I hear that.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:48.648
Zaizen, do you have any clue
who this culprit is?

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.918
I have more than a clue.
I know exactly who he is.

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:54.454
What!?

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.691
He left a video.
See for yourself.

00:06:00.428 --> 00:06:01.762
Hi!

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.063
Whaaat's up?!

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.332
Guess who has two thumbs

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.100
and just beat the Queen?

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.702
Yep!
This guy!

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.672
Those two are SOLtiS.

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.307
And that, Zaizen,

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:16.510
leaves just you to cross out
on my to do list.

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:17.377
Yep!

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.679
And...

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:22.015
to think we were once working
on the same team, meatbag.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:23.183
On the same team?

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:25.386
But how, I've never even
met him before.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.088
Cuz "Ai" may look
different on the outside,

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.357
but I'm still "Ai"
on the inside.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.426
Get it? It's me! Ai!

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:35.662
(gasps)

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:37.197
Ai?

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:41.668
Ai?

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:42.502
(Ai laughs)

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:46.406
And I'm Roboppi.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.174
Roboppi?!

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:49.876
Zaizen,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.313
the Queen's code key is useless
unless I have yours as well.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.149
So you can expect a visit
from me very soon

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:59.152
and I'll do to you
what I did to the Queen!

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:01.721
Yeah, ta-ta!
Ta-ta!

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.425
Ai...

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.427
It can't be...

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.963
This has all gotta be
some kinda trick.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.599
Ai's just prankin' us
like he always does.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:15.068
I wish this was
all just a prank.

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:17.905
But taking down the Queen
means that this isn't one.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:19.774
And the only thing
that is preventing Ai

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:22.876
from taking control
of the world is my code key.

00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:25.979
C'mon, this is Ai we're
talking about here.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.415
He's not suddenly gonna
turn on us, is he?

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.750
Of course it is,

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.652
cuz it was trying
to fool us.

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:34.387
Playing the long con
to gain our trust

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.390
so that it can backstab us
at the best possible moment.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:40.460
How can you say that
when Ai saved your life?

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.163
It's an AI after all,

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:44.097
and AIs aren't to be trusted.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:45.799
Everyone!

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.601
No matter what his motive is,

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:51.071
the truth remains that Ai
is after my code key.

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:52.572
And I think we
can all agree

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.909
that having any one
individual control

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:58.245
all of SOL Tech's resources
isn't a good idea.

00:07:58.312 --> 00:07:59.579
Agreed.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.347
Hmm.

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.681
Playmaker...

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:03.517
I get it.

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:06.153
I know what I'm asking
isn't easy for you.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.723
Because it means you may
have to fight your friend.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.826
I wish there was another way,
but will you help me?

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.162
I'll think about it.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.635
Man, crazy times,
huh, Yusaku?

00:08:22.436 --> 00:08:23.838
Makes what I was gonna
tell you earlier

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.606
seem like
small potatoes.

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.708
What did you want
to tell me?

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:30.143
I was gonna tell you
that I was going back home.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.846
But I'm putting
that plan on pause.

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.316
I can't go home to my family

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:37.550
until my other family
is all good again.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.219
Cuz the one thing I know

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.454
is that we're not
all on the same page yet,

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.224
so I'm gonna stick around
to help write the final chapter

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.660
and make sure
we're all at peace.

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:49.496
I know that's what Flame
would want me to do to.

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.031
I see.

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.201
I bet this is all just a big
misunderstanding.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:55.936
You're right.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:57.804
It has to be.

00:08:58.438 --> 00:08:59.640
Ai wouldn't do this.

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:03.410
He wouldn't do this if he
didn't have a good reason.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:05.512
I hear ya.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.581
No matter what,

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.883
I still believe in Ai.

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:15.422
I'm surprised
you wanted to meet.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.390
Well I could use your help.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:21.228
Yes, I heard what happened
to your Queen.

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.629
My condolences.

00:09:22.963 --> 00:09:24.765
Knowing how much
you hate SOL Tech,

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.367
I doubt you mean that.

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:27.867
You're right.
I don't.

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.937
And now the Dark Ignis
is hunting you,

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:31.572
just like I'm
hunting it.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.541
I should thank you, Zaizen,

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:36.677
for successfully drawing it
out into the open for me.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:40.014
But if Ai finds me,
I could lose my existence.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.550
That sounds more
like a you problem

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.084
instead of a me problem.

00:09:44.217 --> 00:09:45.619
But lucky for you

00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:47.120
I have aa ally.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:48.588
An ally?

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.023
Who?

00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:52.792
Look.

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:57.631
Who's this?

00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.633
It's an AI that I created

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:02.002
to hunt and destroy
the ignis.

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:07.674
Mr. Zaizen.
My name is Pandor.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.043
Very surprising,
Varis.

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:12.713
Based on how much
you despise AI's,

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.448
I'm surprised you would
create one yourself.

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:18.051
(Varis)
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:21.255
And don't compare Pandor
to those out-of-control rogues

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:24.859
like the Ignis or your primitive
Neanderthal SOLtiS.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.060
Zaizen,

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:29.029
I've perfectly programmed
Pandor to serve one function,

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:32.766
and that is to eliminate
the Ignis.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.002
And it is programmed
to do nothing else.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:38.706
Any emotion
or function

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:40.875
outside of these
parameters,

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:43.377
any hint of free will,

00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:45.412
are immediately
deleted.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:49.783
So it can never pose a threat
against humans like those Ignis.

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:51.618
Isn't that right?

00:10:53.787 --> 00:10:56.089
Yes. We are here
to serve you.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.058
There's four
of them?

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:01.629
We are four in body
but only one in mind.

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:03.797
So if one enters a duel

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.800
all the data collected
will be shared

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.133
with the other three.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.604
Zaizen, take a look
at your Duel Disk.

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:11.938
Ah.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.843
We have downloaded
all the duel data we have

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:18.479
on the Dark Ignis
to your Duel Disk.

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:19.780
As we gather
more data,

00:11:19.847 --> 00:11:21.115
we will update
our records

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:23.784
to enhance your
dueling capabilities.

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.119
Now you've
never been

00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:27.454
in a better position
to win, Zaizen.

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.123
Correct, sir.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:31.792
Your odds of victory
have greatly increased.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.460
I hope you're right.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.162
Now then...

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.631
There's one last thing
to discuss.

00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:52.479
Well, Yusaku.

00:11:52.613 --> 00:11:54.114
It's been real.

00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:55.582
It's been good.

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:58.752
And at times,
it's been real good.

00:11:59.353 --> 00:12:00.921
Wait, Ai!
Huh?

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:03.056
Don't leave
with my property.

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:04.925
Huh?

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.094
Oh yeah,
the Duel Disk.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:09.697
It's been my home
for so long that I forgot.

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:11.031
Wait, did I say "home?"

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:14.000
I meant "jail." Ahem.
Toodles!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.005
Ai...

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:29.482
(suspenseful music)

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:35.923
(Student A)
See you tomorrow!

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:36.523
(Student B)
Catch ya later!
(Student A)
Bye!

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.359
Yusaaaaaaaaaaaaku!

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.392
Helpmeeeee!

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:40.727
What's up?

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:41.729
Well,

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.063
I'm trying to find Playmaker

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:44.865
but with Link VRAINS closed,

00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.201
I don't have a clue
where to start looking!

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:49.703
If you were Playmaker
where would you be?

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.539
And what do you want
with Playmaker, Shima?

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:55.176
Oh, it's not me, it's Skye.

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:57.378
She's the one that
asked me to find him.

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:00.080
Can you get in touch
with him for me?

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.415
After all you two
are soulmates, right?

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:04.918
Aww, man, how do I find him?

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:08.122
I just know that the answer's
right there in front of my eyes.

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.658
If only I was able
to see it!

00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:12.826
May as well go and hit
the message boards!

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:19.399
(Skye)
Akira?

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.067
Huh?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.802
What are you doing here?

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:23.236
Why aren't you at work?

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:26.741
Is everything okay
at the office?

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.042
I guess you caught me
playing hooky.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.580
Truth is, the office has been
getting to me lately.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.981
I just needed to take
a little time out.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.750
Akira...

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.985
It's funny,

00:13:38.085 --> 00:13:39.786
how when your life's
in danger

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.055
you start seeing
things differently.

00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.558
Start realizing what's
really important.

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.594
Are you hungry?

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:49.330
Cuz I just happen to know

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.299
a great hot dog
sandwich stand nearby.

00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:54.534
Yep!
Right there.

00:13:56.437 --> 00:13:57.237
Enjoy!

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:58.205
(gasps)

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.342
Who?
It's him.

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:05.045
Hey Skye.

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:05.979
(Skye)
Hey, Yusaku.

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:07.882
Here to help out
at the hot dog stand?

00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:09.983
(Zaizen)
You know the owner
of that stand?

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:12.719
(Zaizen)
I see.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.855
So, you're Playmaker.

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:17.124
It all makes sense now.

00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:18.859
That's why you were
able to save Skye

00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:20.293
and take her to the hospital.

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:23.664
I know it's late,

00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:25.999
but I'd really
like to say thank you.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:27.368
(laughs)

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.102
And all this time
I thought it was

00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.138
becuz you were her boyfriend.

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.873
What a relief.

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.542
Yes. Becuz that truly
would be horrible...

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.211
now wouldn't it, Zaizen?

00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:38.646
(phone ringing)
Uh-umm...

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.980
Oh, my phone.

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:41.948
I gotta take this!
Hello?

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.352
I see. I'll be
there at once.

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:47.354
Sorry,

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:48.822
I must return to work.

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:51.992
Oh, and Skye.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:53.494
Well,

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:55.528
I'll do my best to make it
home for dinner.

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:57.965
With Ai after me,

00:14:58.032 --> 00:14:59.566
don't know how many
more chances

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:01.501
we'll get to eat
together, right?

00:15:10.845 --> 00:15:12.413
So you're
Playmaker, huh?

00:15:12.947 --> 00:15:15.182
You sure fooled me...
Yusaku.

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.417
Shima told me you
wanted to see me.

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:18.885
Do you need my help?

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.120
Well,

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.889
it's actually the opposite,
Yusaku.

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:27.093
I wanted to know
if Playmaker needed my help.

00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:28.061
Your help?

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:29.263
Mhmm.

00:15:29.963 --> 00:15:32.365
If you're going to protect
my brother from Ai,

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:33.433
then there's a good chance

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:34.934
that you're gonna
have to duel him.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.870
And that's gotta
be rough.

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.373
So I thought,
you know,

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.442
maybe you'd like
a friendly ear to talk to.

00:15:42.876 --> 00:15:45.412
Because if you told me
that I had to duel Aqua,

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:46.880
I don't think I could.

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:49.049
You're right, Skye.
I don't either.

00:15:49.183 --> 00:15:51.285
And I don't know
for sure what I'll do

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:53.219
until I have to face
that decision.

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.924
But... what if you
never have to?

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:57.757
Never have to?

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.693
(Skye)
Yeah, Yusaku.

00:16:00.627 --> 00:16:03.296
As much as Akira
can use your help,

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.265
it's way more
important for you...

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:07.601
to look after yourself.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.803
You should stay
out of this battle

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:12.772
and let us take on Ai
without you.

00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:15.075
(sighs)

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:17.844
You have saved me and my brother

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:20.447
not once but more times
than I can count.

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:23.317
And more times
than I can count plus one

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.951
is getting
kinda greedy.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.288
So let us figure this out.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.290
Just this once.

00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:34.761
Eh.

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:36.696
Thanks for everything.

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:52.445
♪♪♪

00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:54.247
See ya!

00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:11.899
(Zaizen)
Thank you, everyone.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:12.933
Glad you're all here.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.734
Not all of us.

00:17:15.135 --> 00:17:17.003
Yes, but we'll just have
to make do.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:18.505
So this is
everyone.

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:21.007
Well, not quite.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.345
Oh great.

00:17:25.412 --> 00:17:28.482
Varis and his merry
band of misfits.

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:29.683
That's right.

00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:32.085
I asked for their help,
and they agreed.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.088
Of course
they did.

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.659
They trust the Ignis
even less than I do.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.561
(Ghost Gal)
Akira, you do realize
you're teaming up

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:44.898
with the ones who wanna take
your whole company down, right?

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:48.202
That was in the past, Ghost Gal.
Not anymore.

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:51.705
All we care about is getting rid
of the last of the Ignis

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.073
and nothing more.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.075
Let's be clear.

00:17:55.175 --> 00:17:57.978
If they wanna stop Ai
then we're on the same page.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.648
But getting rid
of him permanently?

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:03.150
We're not even on
the same bookshelf.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.151
Really now?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.319
So that means
you're totally fine

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.954
with the fact
that the Dark Ignis

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:10.491
will keep returning
to hunt your brother down?

00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:12.292
Of course not,
Varis.

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.561
But there's always
another solution.

00:18:14.928 --> 00:18:16.130
Unless there's not.

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:16.763
(gasps)

00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:17.464
(gasps)

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:20.400
And here's the simple truth,
so listen up.

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:22.135
You're all excellent duelists,

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:24.205
but not a single one of you
can come close

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.306
to being as elite as me.

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.242
Who here can actually say

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:31.445
that they're better than me
and can defeat me in a duel?

00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:33.413
Admit it, you need me.

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:35.249
(grunts)

00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:37.417
I don't like this.

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:39.252
I don't like this one bit.

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:41.789
Neither do I,
Soulburner.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.825
But once Akira here
gave them our location,

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:46.159
there's no
going back.

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:47.795
That's right.

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:50.498
You may not like it
but this is my call.

00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:53.267
It is my life that's
on the line after all.

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:54.901
So I'll protect it
my way.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.570
Whatever you say.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.139
As long as you're willing
to accept the fallout.

00:18:59.974 --> 00:19:02.543
Whatever the fallout
ends up being.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:06.379
I have been from the very moment
this all started.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.714
Akira...

00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:10.116
Well, what's the plan?

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:15.122
(Zaizen)
What you see before you
is our battleground.

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.356
Right now, we're standing

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.558
at the very center
of this prism.

00:19:18.659 --> 00:19:19.660
This structure is

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:22.296
one of the most secure locations
in the network.

00:19:22.363 --> 00:19:24.164
Since the walls
are impenetrable,

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:27.601
the only way in or out to get
where we're currently standing

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.369
is through these two corridors:

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.839
one on the west
and one on the east.

00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:35.475
Blue Maiden and I will stay here
where it's most secure.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.812
The rest of you
will position yourselves

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:40.514
at these corridors.

00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:41.314
Ghost Gal,

00:19:41.949 --> 00:19:43.050
The Shepherd

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.485
and Spectre
at the east corridor.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.554
Gore and the other Hanoi...

00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:49.522
you take the west.

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:53.326
Varis and Soulburner,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.730
you two position yourselves
outside of each corridor.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:03.370
You'll be our spotters

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.839
so we know exactly
where Ai is coming from.

00:20:05.972 --> 00:20:06.973
Good.

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.776
Cuz that means I'll be
the first to take it down.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.213
I've got a question, Zaizen.

00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:15.549
What if Ai decides to attack you
in the real world,

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:16.950
like he did with your Queen?

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:20.487
Yeah, cuz all the security
in here won't matter

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:22.689
if you get taken down
out there.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:26.794
And if we figured out this flaw,
you know that Ai did too.

00:20:27.194 --> 00:20:28.896
No need to worry about that.

00:20:28.996 --> 00:20:30.131
Don't be distracted

00:20:30.197 --> 00:20:32.165
and just do your part
and I'll be fine.

00:20:32.966 --> 00:20:34.968
Okay, Zaizen, if you say so.

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:36.804
One last thing.

00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:39.839
Varis brought a gift
to aid us in our duel.

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:40.941
The floor is yours.

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:44.811
(Varis)
Blue Maiden,

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:46.646
Ghost Gal, Gore,

00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:49.549
I've transferred Pandor
into your Duel Disks.

00:20:49.649 --> 00:20:52.185
They'll aid you
in taking down the Ignis.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.020
(gasps)

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:56.990
Now, everyone get
to your positions!

00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:04.865
Our target's
straight ahead

00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.533
but he's not alone.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.002
Yeah, who knew he had
so many friends.

00:21:09.203 --> 00:21:10.604
(Ai)
Yes, yes.
(Roboppi)
Blue Maiden?

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:12.706
(Ai)
The usual suspects.
(Roboppi)
Soulburner?

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:15.009
(Ai)
Oh wow! Varis?

00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:16.042
Weird.

00:21:16.176 --> 00:21:17.678
No Playmaker.

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:20.180
I guess that he decided
not to show up?

00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:24.117
Seems so.

00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:25.385
(beeping sound)

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:26.386
(gasps)

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:26.953
Who's that?

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:32.759
Playmaker.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.527
I knew you'd come.

00:21:36.363 --> 00:21:37.464
Sorry I'm late.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.300
Blue Maiden told me
to stay out of this fight.

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:41.635
But I can't,

00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:44.071
not if I have
even the slightest chance

00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:47.073
to end this fight
in a peaceful way.

00:21:47.574 --> 00:21:48.542
(Ai)
Glad you made it!

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:51.045
Cuz you can't spell
party without Playmaker!

00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:53.613
(Roboppi)
P-A-R--
Where's the T?

00:22:01.288 --> 00:22:02.622
Get ready!

00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:06.526
Let's have some fun!

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.672
