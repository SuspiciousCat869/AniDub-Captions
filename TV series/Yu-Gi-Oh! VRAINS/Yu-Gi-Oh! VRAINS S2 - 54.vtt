WEBVTT

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:04.237
<i>(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...</i>

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.112
(Kolter)
Playmaker, I ID'ed
the guy chasing you.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.615
His name's The Shepherd,
and he's bad news.

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:16.750
(Zaizen)
Listen Emma,
I need you to find

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.786
the whereabouts
of all the Ignis.

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:22.356
I know where two of them are--
with Playmaker and Soulburner.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.024
But as for
the remaining four...

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.759
That's where you come in.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:28.862
We're all clear.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.598
(Ghost Gal)
Heyyyyy.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.801
So, what's the deal
with the new updated look there?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.004
I didn't come here
to entertain anyone,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:38.405
I'm here on a mission.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.973
Time to Speed Duel!

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.310
I'm Link Summoning...

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.413
Link 3 SHOOTINGCODE TALKER!

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.447
(Shootingcode Talker grunts)

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:51.184
(Shepherd)
I activate my facedown card!

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.686
CAPTURE DRONE!

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.955
So your SHOOTINGCODE TALKER

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.424
is rendered less than useless!

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.692
What?

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.063
(Shepherd)
I Link Summon!

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.033
Link 3...
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.869
Aww glitch!

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.205
I thought we had
victory in our sights,

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.007
but now I'm seeing
he's got us in his!

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.807
This isn't looking too good.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.142
The Shepherd has
the strongest monster in play

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:24.211
while Playmaker's
is all chained up.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.948
Playmaker...

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.384
I activate BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:34.154
special ability to recommission
a DRONE from my graveyard

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.824
and summon it next
to my GENERAL's link.

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:39.392
Rise, DRONE PAWN!

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:44.165
Next, I activate the spell...

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:45.932
DRONE LAUNCHER UNIT

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.869
and equip it on
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL.

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:52.072
It protects my GENERAL
from being targeted

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:55.643
by any of your effects
or special abilities.

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:56.977
(Ai)
Whaaaat?

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.313
So the only way to destroy
your jet is to attack it?

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:01.514
But our monsters
aren't strong enough.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.516
Imagine that.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.218
I'm trying to counter you.

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:06.286
That's why this is
called Duel Monsters

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.289
and not Solitaire Monsters.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.290
(Ai)
Whatever, dad.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.293
(Shepherd)
And with DRONE LAUNCHER UNIT's
additional effect,

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:16.296
you take 100 points of damage
for every Link Arrow in play.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.998
Whaaaaaat?

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:22.036
That's 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... 6.
Yeah! Six arrows!

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:25.338
I saw you put one finger
back down.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.807
Or did you?

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.477
(Shepherd)
Just because you miscounted
doesn't change the fact

00:03:29.477 --> 00:03:32.012
that there are still seven
Link Arrows.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.714
Huh? Oh yeah...

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.483
(Shepherd)
You take 700 points of damage!

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.986
(Playmaker groans)

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.658
Just in case,
I'll place this card facedown...

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.494
But you're about to find out

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.297
I already have everything
I need to win this duel.

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:52.733
By activating
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.202
second ability,
one of my other DRONES

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:59.206
with 1,000 or lower attack
points can attack you directly.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.708
Fire, DRONE PAWN!

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:07.014
(Playmaker groans)

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:08.515
And whenever my DRONE

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.618
successfully attacks you
directly,

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:13.720
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL allows me
to tribute that DRONE

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.757
to deal you damage
equal to its attack points.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.294
That's another 600
points of damage.

00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:22.630
But that's only part one.

00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:24.097
BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.700
is also allowed
to attack you directly.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.206
(explosion pounds)

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:33.407
(Playmaker groans)

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:34.675
(computer calculating)

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:37.578
(Shepherd)
And like before,
I can tribute my SERGEANT

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:40.447
to deal you
800 points of damage.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:42.916
(explosion booms)

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.050
(Playmaker groans)

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:46.186
(computer calculating)

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:50.557
(Ai)
We're already down to 12.5%
of our starting life points?

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.192
Oh, now you can count.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.127
But with my
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:56.530
final attack on your
CLOCK WYVERN,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.131
I'll do the math for you.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.066
(Ai whimpers)

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.634
(Shepherd)
It will drop to zero!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:03.971
I activate my trap card
CURE CONVERSION!

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:06.407
By tributing my CLOCK WYVERN,

00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:09.242
I can immediately force
this battle to end.

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:11.845
Then I draw one card,

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.780
and if it happens
to be a monster card,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.617
I regain life points equal
to its attack points.

00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:17.450
(Playmaker groans)

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.321
It appears that I was successful
in drawing a monster card.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.289
(Ai)
Woohoo!

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.191
Presenting CYBERSE WIZARD!

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:26.960
That's 1,800 life points
straight into the bank!

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:29.196
(Shepherd)
Are you sure
that's what you wanted?

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:29.963
Why not?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.965
Because now you have
too many life points

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:33.266
to activate your Skill.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.469
Y-Yeah,
but we don't need it!

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.136
Wrong.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.106
Your Skill's the only chance
of saving your hide.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:42.576
Without it, I predict
I'll defeat you in two turns,

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:43.911
and I'm always right.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.345
We'll see about that.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.346
(Shepherd snaps fingers)
One.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:47.180
I draw!

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:51.018
I activate my spell,
CYBERSE BRIDGE!

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:55.089
By discarding a Cyberse monster
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.958
I can move the monster
in my Extra Monster Zone

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.827
to my Main Monster Zone.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.896
So I send my CYBERSE WIZARD
to the graveyard

00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:06.033
to reposition
my SHOOTINGCODE TALKER.

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.669
Then I draw another card,
and if it's a monster,

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.138
I can revive a Cyberse
from my graveyard

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.907
that has the same Level
as the monster I drew.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:16.243
So you're hoping to
get lucky, huh?

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.212
You must be desperate.

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.179
(Playmaker)
Perhaps.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.415
But that doesn't make it
the wrong move.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.684
This BITROOPER is Level 4,

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:25.252
just like my CLOCK WYVERN!

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.887
(Clock Wyvern growls)

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.156
Next, by cutting its
attack points in half,

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.425
CLOCK WYVERN can summon
a CLOCK TOKEN

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.193
to the field
in attack mode.

00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:37.565
And I'll use them...

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:39.599
to then create my circuit!

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:43.236
I set CLOCK WYVERN
and CLOCK TOKEN

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:44.871
in the Link Arrows!

00:06:46.473 --> 00:06:47.908
I Link Summon!

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.810
Link 2 CYBERSE WITCH!

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.082
(Playmaker)
I Link Summon!

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.651
Link 2 CYBERSE WITCH!

00:06:57.818 --> 00:07:01.155
Next, I'm able to summon
BITROOPER from my hand

00:07:01.155 --> 00:07:03.724
by discarding my
TRASH HACKER to the graveyard.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:07.227
(Shepherd)
So... you now have two
Link Monsters

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.596
and that third...
thing.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.399
But as long as I have
CAPTURE DRONE on my field,

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.735
your Link Monsters can't attack.

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.704
I can see how that
would be a problem for me...

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.773
if I didn't
already have a solution.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.709
Since I summoned a monster
next to CYBERSE WITCH's link,

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.045
her ability lets me
add CYNET RITUAL

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.081
and a Cyberse Ritual Monster
from my deck to my hand...

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:30.483
by banishing a spell
from my graveyard.

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.819
Ritual cards?

00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:35.723
My CYBERSE WITCH's
ability also resummons

00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:38.091
a CYBERSE monster
from my graveyard.

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.659
I'm bringing back...

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.328
CYBERSE WIZARD!

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:43.496
(Cyberse Wizard groans)

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:47.801
I activate...

00:07:48.369 --> 00:07:51.404
my Ritual Spell Card,
CYNET RITUAL!

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:54.475
To complete this ritual,

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.477
I must tribute monsters
from my hand

00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:59.780
or my field whose total Level
equals or exceeds the monster

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.148
I intend to summon,

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:05.151
so I tribute my Level 4
CYBERSE WIZARD and BITROOPER!

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.356
Together,
their Levels add up to 8--

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.225
which is more than I require!

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:14.060
These two souls
offer their essence

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.063
to break the barriers
of reality

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.233
and conjure the ultimate
sorcerer to this realm!

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.301
I Ritual Summon...

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.204
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:25.772
(Cyberse Magician groans)

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.010
CYBERSE MAGICIAN's a
Ritual Monster,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.544
not a Link Monster.

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.380
So your CAPTURE DRONE
can't stop it from attackin'!

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.315
(Playmaker)
I place one card facedown.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:39.452
Now CYBERSE MAGICIAN,
attack BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:42.656
And by banishing
TRASH HACKER

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.057
from my graveyard...

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:47.694
it negates your BATTLEDRONE
GENERAL's special abilities!

00:08:48.963 --> 00:08:50.464
In addition, your GENERAL

00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:53.166
can no longer be destroyed
in battle this turn.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:57.037
But in exchange, the damage
you take will be doubled!

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.039
(Shepherd grunts)

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.841
(Playmaker)
And I will maximize that damage!

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.443
When CYBERSE MAGICIAN
battles a Link Monster,

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:05.912
he gains 1,000 attack points!

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.784
Hope you're not super fond
o' your life points,

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.619
‘cause you're gonna lose
more than half of ‘em

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.221
when we blast ya!

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:15.288
You wish.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.791
I activate DEMOLITION DRONE!

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.961
By tributing one of the DRONES
I have on my field,

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:24.265
this trap card cuts
the damage I take in half.

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:27.267
So I'll retire
my BATTLEDRONE GENERAL,

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:29.870
along with
its DRONE LAUNCHER UNIT.

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:31.404
(Ai)
Whaaaat?

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.273
You got rid of
your best monster?

00:09:33.373 --> 00:09:35.675
Of course--
because the only thing

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.945
that matters is
what's best for me.

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:40.281
Every card I have is
expendable,

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.050
as long as it works
to my advantage.

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:46.087
(Playmaker)
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!
Cyber Magic Attack!

00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:47.921
(explosion roars)

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.224
(computer calculating)

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:53.059
Well, he saved himself
a few life points,

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:54.861
but if he thinks
that was worth it, well...

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:57.797
I don't see it.
And I got 20/20 hindsight.

00:09:57.797 --> 00:10:00.201
What matters is that
he thought it was worth it.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.668
So we have to be careful.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.005
(Ai screams)

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.274
(Ai)
You call this careful?

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.012
Are you still following me?

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:16.082
Because all you're doing
is following me to your demise.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.788
(Shepherd)
It's my turn.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:22.789
(snaps fingers)

00:10:24.525 --> 00:10:25.559
I draw!

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:27.761
My CAPTURE DRONE activates,

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.864
summoning three DRONE
TOKENS to my field.

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:35.936
And I'll use these DRONES
to re-forge my circuit!

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.606
I set one DRONE TOKEN
in the Link Arrow.

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:43.109
I Link Summon...

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:46.880
Link 1 BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT!

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.717
And I'll set the
other two DRONE TOKENS

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:54.187
in the Link Arrows
to Link Summon again!

00:10:57.557 --> 00:11:01.628
I Link Summon
Link 2 MEDICDRONE DOCK!

00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:06.333
Next, I activate
the Equip Spell ASSEMBLE DRONE!

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.502
By equipping it on a DRONE

00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:12.506
Link Monster in my graveyard,
I can resummon it to the field!

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:16.676
Return to the front lines,
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:20.014
ASSEMBLE DRONE also raises
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:22.582
attack points by 500.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.153
Aww, I thought that glider
was gone for good.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.458
(Shepherd)
You thought wrong.
And BATTLEDRONE GENERAL

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:33.360
uses its special ability
again to resummon

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.128
DRONE PAWN next to its link.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:41.034
But while my DRONE PAWN
is in play,

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:44.338
my BATTLEDRONE GENERAL
can't attack you.

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:46.139
Phew-- that's good.

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.842
I thought he was gonna paint
our plaster for a sec!

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.310
No, it's not good at all--

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.680
did you already forget
what happened last turn?

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.781
(Ai)
That was like
ten minutes ago!

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:57.151
Then it's my pleasure
to remind you

00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:58.586
that my GENERAL's ability

00:11:58.686 --> 00:12:02.022
allows DRONE PAWN
to attack you directly.

00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:03.357
(Playmaker)
But CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.392
cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.262
(Playmaker groans)

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:09.663
(computer calculating)

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:12.532
And once again,
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:14.368
lets me tribute
my DRONE PAWN

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:17.671
to deal you damage
equal to its attack points.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.739
(Playmaker)
You may be using
the same move as before,

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.975
but the difference this time
is that CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:24.878
is there to protect
half my life points.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:25.912
(Playmaker groans)

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:29.416
(Shepherd)
So instead of losing quickly,

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:32.253
you want to drip feed
your demise.

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:34.521
Fine--
it doesn't matter to me.

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.158
BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT,
attack Playmaker directly!

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.696
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!
Do your laser gazer thing again!

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:46.333
(explosion booms)

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.035
(computer calculating)

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.737
(Shepherd)
I tribute BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:53.406
to deal you
even more damage!

00:12:58.245 --> 00:12:59.079
(Playmaker groans)

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:03.784
Your new moves
are keeping you alive,

00:13:03.817 --> 00:13:05.953
but they're not enough
to save you.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.088
Not when I have
new tricks of my own.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:10.791
I activate my Skill,
Drone Force!

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:14.795
Your monster loses 200 attack
points for every DRONE card

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:17.164
in my graveyard
until the end of this turn.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.166
But he has like...
two DRONES!

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.969
(Shepherd)
If you meant five,
you'd be right.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:22.903
(Ai whimpers)

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.305
(Shepherd)
Your CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:27.307
loses 1,000 attack points,

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.644
and those points are transferred
to BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.881
And since DRONE PAWN
is no longer on my field,

00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.317
BATTLEDDONE GENERAL is free
to attack!

00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:38.652
Take out CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:41.221
Not so fast.
When my MAGICIAN battles

00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:44.891
a Link Monster, he gains
1,000 additional attack points!

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.464
So what? He's still
weaker than my monster!

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:54.968
At least dull the damage
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:13:58.305 --> 00:13:59.306
(Playmaker groans)

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.276
(Shepherd)
You're down to 200 life points.

00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:04.478
And when MEDICDRONE DOCK
finishes off

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:07.515
CYBERSE WITCH,
you'll be down to zero!

00:14:07.548 --> 00:14:09.716
Aww glitch!

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.852
I'm now activating
the trap card

00:14:11.852 --> 00:14:13.653
EXCESS LESSER LINKER!

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.490
Since my CYBERSE WITCH
is only Link 2,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.225
her attack points
become the same

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:19.693
as the monster
she's battling!

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:24.698
(explosion booms)

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:26.634
That was close!

00:14:26.634 --> 00:14:29.770
Well, I said you'd lose
in two turns--

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.207
but you're still here...
And I'm usually never wrong.

00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:34.708
(Ai)
Well you're wrong
about that too.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.877
Since this duel
is going to continue....

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.212
When my MEDICDRONE DOCK
is destroyed,

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:42.382
we gain 1,000 life points,
including you.

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:43.150
(Playmaker gasps)

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.819
What's wrong?
Don't like my gift?

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:46.987
Nah, we're good!

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.388
You can keep
those life points!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.023
Cuz we didn't
bring you anything,

00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:51.691
not even a coffee cake.

00:14:51.691 --> 00:14:54.328
We have too many life points
again to use our Skill!

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.063
Don't feel too bad.

00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:59.734
Feel proud that I'll defeat you
in three turns instead of two.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.102
That's if you can get to
three turns cause me

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.204
and my partner
are done messin' aroun,

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.439
and that's no lie--
trust me!

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:09.609
Why would I
ever trust an AI?

00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:13.713
(Kenneth)
And now for my surprise...

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.950
(Kenneth's Mother)
Oh no, please
tell me you didn't.

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:16.916
(Kenneth snaps fingers)

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.618
(Kenneth's Mother gasps)

00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:20.621
Happy Birthday, Mom!

00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:21.856
(Kenneth's mother laughs)

00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:23.391
(Kenneth's Mother)
Only one candle?

00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:24.792
Where are the other 63?

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:25.759
(Kenneth laughs)

00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:27.595
It was so sweet of you

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:28.629
to treat me to dinner,

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:30.697
but you should be
saving every penny.

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:32.866
My finances are fine.

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:36.036
Besides, they keep me
so busy at the office these days

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.438
that I don't have time
to spend money on anything.

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:41.075
Except, that is,
for an occasional night out

00:15:41.075 --> 00:15:42.943
with the greatest mom
of all time!

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:44.778
Oh, sweetheart!

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:49.416
<i>(Taxi's AI)
Greetings.</i>

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.618
Uh, dear--
this car's missing

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.354
something pretty important,
like a driver.

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:55.555
(Kenneth chuckles)

00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:56.757
Who needs a driver
when you can have

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:59.192
the most advanced AI
do the driving for you.

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:02.963
Take us to 132 Clairmont
Street please.

00:16:03.364 --> 00:16:05.131
<i>(Taxi's AI)
Destination acknowledged.</i>

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.005
You know what?

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:13.507
If I can save up enough,

00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:15.675
next year I'm gonna get you
one of those new

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.777
AI house-bots
for your birthday.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:20.013
I can dust
my own house, thanks.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.849
Leave all that grunt
work for the AIs, Mom!

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:25.019
You can get out
and enjoy life!

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:26.987
But I enjoy cleaning!

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.189
Uh-oh.

00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:29.523
That looks serious.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.758
<i>(Taxi's AI)
Collision ahead.</i>

00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:32.259
<i>Re-calculating route...</i>

00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:35.362
Oh no!
Something's not right.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:36.931
The AI's malfunctioning.

00:16:36.931 --> 00:16:39.500
No! How do you stop
this thing?!

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:40.801
Brace yourself Mom!

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.102
(explosion roars)

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.442
(Doctor)
There's no easy way to put this.

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:51.678
Your mother is
in very bad shape.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.615
We've done everything
we possibly can for her...

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:57.751
but I'm afraid she
may never fully recover.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:16:59.452
I'm sorry.

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.756
(Kenneth growls)

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.664
(Superior Officer A)
Doesn't this guy ever sleep?

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:12.933
(Superior Officer B)
No, he's been working 25-8

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:14.568
ever since he joined the squad.

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:16.636
He's tracked and deleted
more rogue AIs

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:18.339
than all the rest of us
put together!

00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:21.242
The world would be
a far better place

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:23.243
if AIs never
existed!

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.078
Huh?

00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:25.545
(Ai)
What's with this guy?

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.414
It's like I wronged him
personally

00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:29.249
when I wrong
everyone equally!

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:31.252
It's our turn, Ai.

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.386
Well...

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:34.421
just make sure
it's not our last one.

00:17:34.922 --> 00:17:36.156
I draw!

00:17:37.024 --> 00:17:38.859
Draw whatever you want.

00:17:38.859 --> 00:17:41.595
One card won't change
the outcome of this duel.

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:43.430
You're absolutely right.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.031
(Shepherd grunts)

00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:46.567
That's why I'm using
more than one card!

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.702
I activate DIMENSION LINK!

00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:50.671
By paying half
of my life points,

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.573
I am then allowed to banish
my SHOOTINGCODE TALKER.

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.848
Since your CAPTURE DRONE
is no longer chaining up

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.717
my SHOOTINGCODE TALKER,
your card is destroyed!

00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:06.153
And without CAPTURE DRONE
to stop us,

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.755
our Link Monsters are
allowed to attack ya!

00:18:08.989 --> 00:18:12.793
Not if I play my trap
card DRONE CORDON!

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:16.129
It prevents your Link Monsters
from attacking once again.

00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:19.466
Looks like you two
are back to square one.

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:23.136
(Ai)
Aww-- that's the
worst square to be in!

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:25.139
But since I lowered
my life points,

00:18:25.139 --> 00:18:27.140
I can finally use my Skill!

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:32.045
(Playmaker shouts)
(Ai)
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:36.149
All right it's time!
Go Storm Access!

00:18:43.924 --> 00:18:45.325
I'm now activating

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:48.162
CYNET RITUAL's effect
from my graveyard!

00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:50.497
When I have no monsters
on my field,

00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:52.299
I can banish
CYNET RITUAL

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:55.702
and CYBERSE MAGICIAN
to summon two CYNET TOKENS!

00:18:57.103 --> 00:19:00.540
And I'll use them
to create the ultimate circuit!

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:02.876
The summoning conditions are

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.878
two Cyberse Monsters.

00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.148
I Link Summon!

00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:09.649
Link 2 CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:14.321
When SPARTOI
is successfully Link Summoned,

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:17.490
I'm then allowed to add
CYNET FUSION to my hand.

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.793
Next I send my spell card

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:22.563
DIMENSION LINK from the field
to the graveyard.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.198
And by doing this...

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.366
I can negate
the special abilities

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.535
of the SHOOTINGCODE TALKER
I banished

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.938
and raise
its attack points by 600

00:19:30.938 --> 00:19:33.707
to resummon it next to
CLOCK SPARTOI's link!

00:19:34.842 --> 00:19:37.878
This bad boy's strong enough
to take out your GENERAL!

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:39.512
But my DRONE CORDON

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:41.548
won't let your Link
Monster attack.

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:44.351
I never said
that it would attack.

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.219
Instead, I'm activating

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:48.689
CLOCK SPARTOI's
special ability to summon

00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:51.358
a Cyberse from my graveyard
next to its link!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.560
Come out, CLOCK WYVERN!

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.794
(Clock Wyvern growls)

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:58.065
And I'll use this to unite them!

00:19:58.132 --> 00:19:59.967
(gasps) No...

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:02.002
I now activate the spell card

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:03.269
CYNET FUSION!

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:06.707
It allows me to fuse my
three monsters together into one

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:09.976
so that I may summon a new
Cyberse Fusion Monster!

00:20:11.212 --> 00:20:12.847
I fuse CLOCK WYVERN,

00:20:12.847 --> 00:20:14.381
SHOOTINGCODE TALKER,

00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:16.383
and CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:18.385
(Shepherd grunts)

00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:21.288
You're so done for!

00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:23.724
(Playmaker)
By fusing my monsters,

00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:27.294
I merge them into a new,
even more powerful creation!

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.063
I Fusion Summon!

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:35.635
(thunder rumbling)

00:20:36.203 --> 00:20:39.206
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.274
(thunder rumbles)

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.384
(Clock Dragon growls)

00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:55.055
(Shepherd gasps)

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:57.824
CLOCK DRAGON's
special ability activates!

00:20:57.824 --> 00:20:59.660
Since I used two Link Monsters--

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.728
CLOCK SPARTOI and
SHOOTINGCODE TALKER--

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:03.397
to Fusion Summon my DRAGON,

00:21:03.397 --> 00:21:05.232
I send a card
from the top of my deck

00:21:05.232 --> 00:21:08.101
to the graveyard
for each of their Link Arrows.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:12.105
(Ai)
So down down right
plus top left down equals 5!

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:15.275
(Playmaker)
Therefore, I send
five cards to the graveyard.

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:16.777
But my CLOCK DRAGON

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:19.613
gains 1,000 attack
points for each one!

00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:21.882
(Clock Dragon screeches)

00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:25.285
This is impossible...

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:26.686
(Playmaker)
It's not only possible...

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:27.387
(Shepherd gasps)

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:29.789
...it's actually happening.

00:21:29.856 --> 00:21:33.360
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,
attack BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:21:33.427 --> 00:21:35.296
(Ai)
And when CLOCK DRAGON strikes,

00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:37.130
your time's up, pal!

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.340
(magic fire charging)

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.777
This is far
from over, Playmaker.

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:51.411
(computer calculating)

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.782
That may be so Shepherd,

00:21:54.882 --> 00:21:56.583
but for now, it is.
