WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.271
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:07.641
R-O-B-O-P-P-I!

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.409
Beat those meatbags...

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.512
Make them cry!

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.514
I think that the sudden
spike in your intelligence

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.316
has overwhelmed your systems

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.651
and now you're having trouble

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.486
processing all these
new feelings.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.321
Instead of dueling,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.989
please let us help you.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.525
Let's talk things out instead
of fighting things out.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:27.828
C'mon, Playmaker, really?

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.529
You're trying
to trick me now too?

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.832
Roboppi's brain
received a boost.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.601
But his emotional programming
definitely didn't.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.804
This seems to have
resulted in a glitch

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:40.241
where Roboppi thinks
no one but Ai can be trusted.

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.243
There's only one way
to stop you from tricking me!

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:44.311
Beat you!

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.414
LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.115
Hang HEATLEO out to dry!

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.653
(groans)

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.787
(grunts)

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.756
This duel isn't over yet.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.858
I get to summon
SALAMANGREAT GAZELLE!

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.396
I activate APPLIANCER REDUCTION!

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.832
It banishes the GAZELLE
you just summoned

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.534
so it can ante-lope
on out of here!

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:08.702
No!

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:11.538
I'll go ahead and place
these two cards facedown

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.173
and end my turn.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.642
The same robot
that cleaned our clocks

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.511
is now cleaning his!

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.146
You're up, Soulburner!

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.681
Meaning it's your turn.

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.749
(grunts)

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.251
Not that you're up
in life points or anything!

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:35.595
♪♪♪

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:28.949
(whistles)

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.317
Ro..bop..pi!

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.319
Win... this... duel!

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.459
(Kolter)
Soulburner's only slightly
behind Roboppi in life points.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.227
But when it comes to monsters,

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:42.963
Soulburner's outnumbered
three to zip!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.801
Know what,

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.538
after I finish mopping up
the floor with you,

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:55.475
I'll wipe out the whole world
until I rule the universe!

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.079
And nobody is gonna
be able to stop me.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.849
Because being the greatest
is my prophecy!

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.787
A prophecy is when
the pictures in my head

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.155
reveal the future.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.491
I saw myself glow bright

00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:12.159
and melt like butter in a pan

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:14.361
except the pan
was the whole universe

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:16.029
and my Master said
these pictures mean

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.864
I'm gonna become
one with the universe

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.700
meaning every planet and comet
and asteroid and star

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.169
and all the black space
in between

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.504
because I'm the chosen one

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.939
that's gonna rule
everything and--

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.106
Okay!

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.275
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:30.611
First off,

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:33.013
I'm going to summon
SALAMANGREAT FALCO!

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:39.153
Then SPINNY's special
ability activates,

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.455
summoning itself
back from my graveyard!

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.793
Now I'll use them
to Link Summon!

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.330
Link 2 SALAMANGREAT
SUNLIGHT WOLF!

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.704
Since I sent my SALAMANGREAT
FALCO to the graveyard,

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.941
I get to place
SALAMANGREAT CLAW facedown.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.213
Then I activate JACK JAGUAR's
special ability!

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.615
By returning HEATLEO
to my Extra Deck,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.452
I can resurrect JACK JAGUAR
next to SUNLIGHT WOLF's link!

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:18.925
Next I'll use
SUNLIGHT WOLF's ability

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.428
to get SALAMANGREAT FALCO back.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.463
(sighs)

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:26.433
How many cards
do you have in that deck?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.702
(Soulburner)
Just the right amount!

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:33.440
I Link Summon
Link 1 SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX!

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.011
BALELYNX's ability lets me draw

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:39.212
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY
from my deck.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:41.581
I now have everything I need

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:44.518
to blaze my circuit
for a third time!

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.253
The summoning conditions require

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.922
at least two
Fire Effect Monsters!

00:04:49.056 --> 00:04:54.261
I Link Summon!
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.632
How many lives
does that cat have?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.303
HEATLEO's ability activates,

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:05.071
sending another facedown card
to your deck!

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.475
And I'll follow that up

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:11.311
by activating
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY

00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.847
to Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.487
Rise again
from the valley of flames,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.323
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.163
HEATLEO's ability activates,

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:32.032
sending another facedown card
to your deck!

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:35.635
(grunts)

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:37.304
And then next,

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:41.108
by equipping SALAMANGREAT CLAW
on to my HEATLEO,

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:44.311
this Equip Spell allows
HEATLEO to attack three times!

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.583
(grunts)

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.085
Soulburner's really
bringing the heat.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:53.854
Not only did he get rid

00:05:53.988 --> 00:05:56.189
of all of Roboppi's
facedown cards,

00:05:56.323 --> 00:06:00.093
but now his HEATLEO can attack
not once or twice but thrice.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:01.728
HEATLEO!

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.564
Take LAUNDRY DRAGON
to the cleaners!

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.401
(Playmaker)
If this attack gets through,

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.471
Soulburner's comeback
will be nearly complete.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.374
I can't believe I'm gonna lose!
This can't be happening!

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.376
It just can't be happening!
I don't wanna lose!

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:16.376
I don't wanna!

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:19.546
So that's why I'm not gonna!

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.019
I'm not losin'
this duel Soulburner

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:27.888
'cause you don't have
enough brawn to beat my brains!

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:32.592
I activate the Field Spell
APPLIANCER ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD!

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.061
(explosion)

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:37.063
(explosion)

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.066
When your monster attacks,

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.934
I can move a Link 1 APPLIANCER

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.203
to a different spot
in my Main Monster Zone.

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.572
And now that my two monsters
are co-linked,

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:47.474
CELTOPUS's ability activates,

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.243
energizing my LAUNDRY DRAGON's
attack points!

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:54.815
I didn't know

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:57.250
that your ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD
has that effect.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.086
Well...

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.789
You don't know a lot of things.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:04.491
Remember I did say
that I was smarter than you.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.627
And now I'm provin' it!

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.130
Go, LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.999
If LAUNDRY DRAGON is co-linked

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.269
during the time
it battles your monster,

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.971
neither one of us will take
any battle damage,

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:20.207
but your monster gets banished!

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:25.111
Your kitty used up
another one of its lives.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.751
It looks like I'm back
in control of this duel.

00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:32.752
Huh?
You sure
about that?

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:34.287
You may be smart,

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:35.989
and you may now know
a lot of things,

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:38.292
Huh?
but you still don't
know everything.

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.793
Well like what?

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.630
Like my brand spanking new
SALAMANGREAT ZEBROID X!

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:47.233
When you banish
my SALAMANGREAT Link Monster,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.204
ZEBROID X's special
ability activates!

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.806
I get to summon
ZERBROID X to my field,

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.408
along with another
SALAMANGREAT!

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.610
JACK JAGUAR!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.851
Like those two are gonna
make any difference.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.787
Oh they will because
these two SALAMANGREATs

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:09.990
allow me to build
the Overlay Network!

00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.391
Whaaat?

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.693
You're going to use'em
to Xyz Summon?

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:17.198
I overlay my Level 4
SALAMANGREAT ZEBROID X

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.565
and JACK JAGUAR!

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:29.042
The scorching dragon
that boils the oceans

00:08:29.176 --> 00:08:33.280
and incinerates the sky,
arrives in a pillar of glory!

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.784
I now Xyz Summon!

00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:45.158
Rank 4 SALAMANGREAT
BLAZE DRAGON!

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:52.232
When I use SALAMANGREAT
ZEBROID X to Xyz Summon,

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.001
my Xyz Monster will gain
300 attack points

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.937
for every one
of its Overlay Units.

00:08:57.504 --> 00:09:01.742
Therefore, BLAZE DRAGON
gains 600 attack points.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.212
That thing's got
2900 attack points!

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.080
(Kolter)
Nice!

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:10.417
Soulburner's new monster
is now stronger than Roboppi's.

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.253
Now BLAZE DRAGON!

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.688
Attack LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:17.758
And I'll combo it
with this card here!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.960
The spell SALAMANGREAT TAIL!

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:25.432
BLAZE DRAGON gains attack points
equal to its defense points,

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:28.335
and I regain that same
amount of life points!

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.173
Soulburner must be thinking
that it's now or never

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.409
cuz he's going all out to win.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.045
My CELTOPUS powers up
LAUNDRY DRAGON again!

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.748
You'll still take 1600 damage,

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:44.285
and you only have
1000 life points left!

00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:46.720
It's over, Roboppi!

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:48.956
No it's not cuz I banish

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.258
APPLIANCER REDUCTION
from my graveyard

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.593
to cut the damage
I take in half!

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.569
(screams)

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:08.608
(sighs)

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.379
(laughs)

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:18.018
(gasps)

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.253
I almost finished him off.

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:22.255
But almost isn't good enough.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.426
With this, my turn ends.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.761
As does SALAMANGREAT
TAIL's effect,

00:10:27.895 --> 00:10:31.598
so BLAZE DRAGON's attack points
drop back to 2900.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.903
(Roboppi panting)

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.239
(Roboppi)
You... tried to destroy me...

00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.675
You really tried to destroy me

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:44.078
and erase me from existence.

00:10:44.178 --> 00:10:46.613
You okay?
You're soundin' kinda different.

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.415
(Roboppi)
You said we were friends.

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:51.752
You said we were friends,
but you tried to destroy me.

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:53.387
You tried to destroy me.

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.757
It just hit me that you
actually want to destroy me.

00:10:57.424 --> 00:11:00.126
But I don't want
to be destroyed.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.663
So if you're going
to destroy me...

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.432
I'll destroy you first!

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.835
And you can't stop me because...

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.771
I have the power
of the universe!

00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:14.140
(laughs)

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:18.144
When I'm through with you,
you'll be nothing but atoms!

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:19.846
(gasps)

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:21.648
Gulp.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.520
It's my turn!

00:11:28.322 --> 00:11:29.155
I draw!

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.827
I activate the spell card
APPLIANCER TEST!

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.366
It resurrects Link 1 APPLIANCERS
from my graveyard

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.535
so that they're co-linked
with the APPLIANCER

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.970
that's in the Extra
Monster Zone.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:47.975
I resummon VACCULEPHANT
and PROPELION

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.076
next to CELTOPUS' links!

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:55.482
But when I use this spell,
their attack points drop to 0.

00:11:57.918 --> 00:11:59.119
But that doesn't matter to me

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:01.855
because I only care
about its special abilities!

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:03.724
When VACCULEPHANT is co-linked,

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:06.726
it automatically destroys
one of your monsters!

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:09.062
(laughs)

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:11.398
Your BLAZE DRAGON
is about to hit the road!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.432
Say bye bye!

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.101
Actually Roboppi,

00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:17.371
whenever SALAMANGREAT BLAZE
DRAGON's gonna be destroyed...

00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:20.740
it can use one Overlay Unit
to save itself!

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:23.310
(gasps)

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:26.580
But that means it used up
one of its two Overlay Units.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.382
So, that means
your lame ol' monster

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.885
loses 300 of its attack points!

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:35.222
Making it that much easier
to destroy!

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.760
Now I'll Plug
and Play my circuit!

00:12:39.894 --> 00:12:44.064
I Link Summon
Link 1 LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.034
And then,

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:51.305
ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD's
effect activates!

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.241
I get COPYBOKKLE back
from my graveyard!

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:58.545
Once again, I'll Link Summon!

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.917
Link 1 APPLIANCER DRYER DRAKE!

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.591
When DRYER DRAKE is co-linked,
it gains 1000 attack points.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.162
Now instead of just one,

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.664
two monsters are co-linked
with CELTOPUS.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:18.965
Count 'em!

00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:20.300
(grunts)

00:13:20.434 --> 00:13:22.703
That means CELTOPUS
will give your monsters

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.938
2000 attack points
during battle.

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:25.940
That's right!

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:30.710
So in a battle between dragons,
mine is coming out on top!

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:34.114
CELTOPUS, charge up my dragon!

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:37.985
Go LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:40.220
Destroy BLAZE DRAGON!

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:41.622
Yeah right!

00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:44.057
By getting rid
of a SALAMANGREAT spell

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.625
or trap card from my hand,

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.296
I can activate
my SALAMANGREAT RING!

00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:51.799
As long as this trap card
is in play,

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:54.568
my SALAMANGREATS gain
500 attack points

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:57.571
and are immune to your monster's
special abilities!

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:00.073
Even with that
attack point boost,

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.177
your BLAZE DRAGON is still
weaker than my LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:06.680
(grunts)

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:11.819
BLAZE DRAGON uses up
its last remaining Overlay Unit

00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:13.320
so that it won't be destroyed!

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.726
But your DRAGON's attack points
are gonna drop by another 300!

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:25.699
Making it just weak enough
for my DRYER DRAKE to destroy!

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:27.767
DRYER DRAKE, attack!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.504
Dry him up!

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.008
It's not over yet!

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.845
My BLAZE DRAGON has
one last ability!

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:41.515
If you attack my BLAZE DRAGON
when it has no Overlay Units,

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:43.149
I can use it to Xyz Summon

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.619
another copy of this
same monster!

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.121
Say what!

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:51.725
I use SALAMANGREAT BLAZE DRAGON
to rebuild the Overlay Network!

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:57.497
Reincarnation Xyz Summon!

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.435
Strike the inferno,
SALAMANGREAT BLAZE DRAGON!

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:06.674
Well that's new.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.244
Seems HEATLEO's not the only one
that can reincarnate.

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:12.746
First, SALAMANGREAT
RING's effect

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.449
raises its attack points by 500.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.718
And when my BLAZE DRAGON
reincarnates,

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:22.556
its special ability destroys
one of your monsters.

00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:25.425
So your LAUNDRY DRAGON's
gettin' cleaned up!

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.231
(Playmaker)
If LAUNDRY DRAGON is destroyed,

00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:33.533
DRYER DRAKE's attack points
will drop,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.569
making it weaker
than BLAZE DRAGON.

00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:39.707
(grunts)

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.175
You think that move's
actually gonna work, meatbag?

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.612
Because... trust me it-it won't!

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:49.883
I play APPLIANCER COATING
from my graveyard!

00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:53.054
When an APPLIANCER Link Monster
is destroyed

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.421
by a special ability,

00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:56.690
I can resummon it
so that it's co-linked

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:58.692
with my other Link Monster.

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.427
Meaning a meatbag like you

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.296
can never keep
my LAUNDRY DRAGON down!

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:06.166
What?

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:08.301
Then I get to banish
your BALELYNX

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.805
and my APPLIANCER COATING
from our graveyards.

00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:13.841
(laughs)

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:17.011
I'm miles ahead of every move
you choose to make!

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:20.014
You're easier to solve
than a two piece jigsaw puzzle!

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:20.781
Attack!

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.317
Now power up its attack,
CELTOPUS!

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.828
BLAZE DRAGON uses
one of its Overlay Units

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:36.429
to avoid being destroyed!

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:40.800
But I still have
another monster left

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.802
that I can use
to attack you with!

00:16:43.804 --> 00:16:48.642
LAUNDRY DRAGON!
Exterminate his BLAZE DRAGON!

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:52.646
I have a better idea.

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:55.349
CELTOPUS, why not raise
its attack points

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:57.484
to pummel him even harder!

00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:09.529
I survived that attack, Roboppi!

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:10.898
(Roboppi)
Yeah, for now.

00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:11.898
Huh?

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:14.668
But you think I'm gonna
let you off the hook?

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:18.205
I'm a perfect AI that'll
conquer the universe.

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.707
You think I'd actually
let you survive this turn

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.910
and give you another chance
to attack me?

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:25.178
Well there's
no chance-no chance.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:26.647
(all gasp)

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:31.152
When DRYER DRAKE is co-linked,
its special ability activates.

00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:34.254
It switches places
with a Link 1 APPLIANCER

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.889
in my Main Monster Zone.

00:17:36.557 --> 00:17:38.925
And the monster that
it switches places with

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:41.161
can attack twice in one turn.

00:17:43.564 --> 00:17:47.201
Meaning LAUNDRY DRAGON
can attack you again!

00:17:47.468 --> 00:17:48.369
(grunts)

00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:50.204
I don't have any monsters
left on my field,

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:52.672
so there's no way
I can stop this attack.

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:57.911
(laughs)

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.215
Everyone had a tough time
dueling you except for me!

00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:05.252
Except for me, the r-r-ruler
of the u-u-universe!

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:07.655
You never stood a chance
against my intellect

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:10.390
because it keeps growing
and growing and growing!

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:13.127
I'm so smart now I've
even surpassed my Master!

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.829
In fact, he should be
calling me Master!

00:18:15.963 --> 00:18:18.899
Everyone is nothing!
Nothing compared to me!

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.968
The truth is

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.870
I'm the only one that's
worthy to rule the universe.

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:26.540
Rule the uni-...
Rule the uni-...

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:30.778
Aww man.
Is he glitchin' out?

00:18:30.878 --> 00:18:31.745
(Roboppi)
Rule the uni-...

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:33.280
Rule the uni-...
Rule the uni-...

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:36.550
Error... Error... Error...

00:18:39.487 --> 00:18:42.322
But Roboppi doesn't want
to rule the universe.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:43.491
Huh?

00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.493
Roboppi doesn't want
to hurt his friends either.

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:50.831
Roboppi ends his turn
without attacking.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.767
Say what?
You're not attacking?

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:55.569
Take that back!

00:18:56.237 --> 00:18:58.706
But Roboppi doesn't
want to attack.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.775
I don't care what you want,
attack him and end this!

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.143
No.

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:05.779
It's my prophecy to win!

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:09.116
Prophecy?

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.183
What's that?

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:12.352
It's when the pic-

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.228
Roboppi?
You good?

00:19:21.362 --> 00:19:23.197
(Playmaker)
Roboppi fought against himself

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:26.800
because he, the real Roboppi,
never wanted to hurt us.

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:30.470
Roboppi's systems overloaded.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.005
(gasps)

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:34.174
Well then, who won the duel?

00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:38.144
Huh?

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.850
Roboppi must clean.

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:45.986
Clean and sweep
before Yusaku comes home.

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:48.955
Yusaku loves
when his room is clean.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:52.525
And When Yusaku is happy,
Roboppi is happy.

00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:12.345
You have to win this duel.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:13.780
I can't.

00:20:18.818 --> 00:20:20.121
It's my turn.

00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:21.187
I draw.

00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.194
I activate this card,
the spell RISING FIRE.

00:20:27.795 --> 00:20:30.163
When there are
no monsters on my field,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.633
I can resurrect a Fire Attribute
monster from my graveyard.

00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:36.169
So HEATLEO comes back into play.

00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:39.273
Here goes.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:42.142
HEATLEO, attack DRYER DRAKE!

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:47.347
Well pal...

00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:50.317
The duel is done.

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:53.454
Duel?
What duel?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.055
Roboppi doesn't duel.

00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:57.525
Uhhh.

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.059
That's pretty.

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:02.462
Bye, my friends.

00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:05.232
Roboppi wishes you good luck!

00:21:16.377 --> 00:21:17.377
Roboppi...

00:21:18.712 --> 00:21:21.015
(Ai)
Now that that lil'
bitty bot is gone

00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:23.249
I can finally get
some peace and quiet!

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:27.087
But I could use a lil' bit
of noise around here.

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:28.889
Just a little.

00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.765
(both gasp)

00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:41.601
(Soulburner)
What's that?

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.007
Check this.

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:50.343
It's a letter... from Ai.

00:22:02.289 --> 00:22:07.294
