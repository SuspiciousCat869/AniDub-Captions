Check his stats!

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.161
Interesting.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:35.962
That should be helpful.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:36.797
(Ai)
Yup!

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.131
Here goes!

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:39.466
Let's Speed Duel!

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:43.136
The boards are sayin'
Playmaker's back in town!

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:46.473
And if you follow the time
stamps, he's headin' that a way!

00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:47.674
Good sluthin'!

00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:49.343
That'll let us get the
jump on this story!

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.911
So, hurry up
and hop to it!

00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:52.646
(Pigeon)
Right, Boss!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.149
♪♪♪

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:56.484
(Light Human)
I'll go first.

00:16:56.517 --> 00:17:00.220
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:03.057
I draw!

00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:06.660
I discard Dotscaper, and
I then summon Defcon Bird!

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:10.898
And Dotscaper's special
ability allows it

00:17:10.898 --> 00:17:13.734
to resurrect itself
from my graveyard!

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:17.504
I now have exactly what I
need to create my circuit.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.241
The summoning condition
requires one Level 1 monster.

00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:23.310
I Link Summon.

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:25.712
Link 1 Linkuriboh.

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:26.813
(Linky babbles)

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:28.548
Go get 'em, Linky!

00:17:28.582 --> 00:17:30.418
(Linky babbles)

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:33.219
Next, I summon Cyberse
Wizard in attack mode.

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:34.521
(Yusaku grunts)

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.526
This allows me to
Link Summon again.

00:17:40.394 --> 00:17:41.595
The summoning conditions

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:44.932
require two Level 3 or
higher Cyberse monsters.

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.199
I Link Summon.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:48.134
Link 2 Elphase.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.406
For every monster
next to his link,

00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:55.041
Elphase gains 300 attack points.

00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:59.713
Now Linkuriboh,
attack him directly!

00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:02.482
(Linky babbles)

00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:06.820
And I'll follow that
up with my Elphase.

00:18:07.821 --> 00:18:10.790
(Elphase grunting)

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:16.096
He's already down
to 1400 life points.

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.598
This duel's
gonna be a cinch.

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:20.167
I see you're still
underestimating your opponents?

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.601
(Light Human)
It's my turn.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.271
I summon
Hydradrive Booster.

00:18:28.242 --> 00:18:29.977
Hmm,
I feel like

00:18:30.043 --> 00:18:31.745
I should know
that monster.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:32.946
Do you?

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.915
I do not, but my
senses are telling me

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.218
that it's a Cyberse monster.

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:38.418
What?

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:39.919
So then, do ya think
this light bulb

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.756
could have something to do
with destroying the Cyberse?

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.326
Wait, the Cyberse
has been destroyed?

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:47.828
Oh, sure now
you wanna catch up.

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.964
Just gas
that gasbag!

00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.899
That's what I'm
planning to do.

00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:54.935
I activate the trap
Hydradrive Generator,

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.804
which allows me to summon
one Hydradrive Token.

00:19:01.342 --> 00:19:03.443
Next, I generate my circuit.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:09.983
The summoning condition
is one Hydradrive monster.

00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:11.285
I Link Summon.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:13.520
Link 1 Flow Hydradrive.

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:21.195
Next, I activate the
Field Spell Castle Link.

00:19:21.195 --> 00:19:25.198
It allows me to move a Link
Monster to the Main Monster Zone

00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:27.033
in the direction it points to.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.204
Um, why would he do that?

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:34.207
And since I have fewer life
points

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:36.376
than I started
with in this duel,

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:39.880
I'm allowed to use my
Skill, Marker's Portal.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.284
Took you long enough.

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:46.186
You had me worried for a second,

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.954
but I don't need
to worry anymore.

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:53.293
My Skill allows
me to activate a Link Spell.

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:54.561
A Link Spell?

00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:55.863
I never
heard of that!

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:57.465
(Light Human) I can
only have one Link Spell

00:19:57.498 --> 00:19:59.165
on my field at a time,

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:02.436
and it must be placed next
to a Link Monster's link.

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:06.339
I activate the Link
Spell Judgment Arrows,

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.175
And like all other Link Spells,

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:12.213
this one cannot be negated
nor destroyed by your effects.

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:15.783
I generate my circuit for
a second time this turn

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.718
to Link Summon Link
1 Flow Hydradrive.

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:24.557
(Ai) Hey, you
cheating cheater!

00:20:24.624 --> 00:20:26.861
You can't Link
Summon to that spot!

00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:28.695
There's no Link
Arrow pointing to it!

00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:31.231
You're wrong,
there is an arrow.

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:33.066
The one pointing
from his Link Spell.

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:35.669
What, Link
Spells have links?

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:37.337
Well, I guess
it's in the name.

00:20:37.337 --> 00:20:39.472
(Light Human)
I place one card facedown.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.778
Next, when you have a Wind
Attribute monster on your field,

00:20:44.811 --> 00:20:46.847
Flow Hydradrive's
special ability

00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:49.883
allows it to attack your
life points directly.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.353
And your Elphase's
Attribute is Wind.

00:20:57.891 --> 00:21:01.361
The effect of Judgment
Arrows now activates.

00:21:01.395 --> 00:21:04.031
When the monster linked
to this spell battles,

00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:07.267
its attack points double
when calculating damage.

00:21:12.506 --> 00:21:15.242
(screams)

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:20.714
My second Flow Hydradrive
attacks you directly.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.518
I'm back
for a sec,

00:21:24.552 --> 00:21:26.787
and I'm gonna get
glitched already?

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:28.421
