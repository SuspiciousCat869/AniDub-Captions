Oh hi, Playmaker!

How do you know
about my identity?

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:13.280
I'm the one who
helped you out yesterday.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:15.950
So that means you're Soulburner.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.351
You might not believe it,

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.086

a lot in common.

able to get an exact location...

it down to this spot.

were any more clues...

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:47.080

Yes!

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:33.253
It's not every day

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:34.955
we get to duel our hero!

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.757
Your hero, not mine.

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:39.126
And I would prefer
not to be captured,

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.227
understand?

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:42.095
You better listen
to your lil' buddy

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:44.732
because I'm not lookin'
to be your role model.

00:07:44.732 --> 00:07:46.433
We'll see about that.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.901
(grunts)

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:49.369
Let's Speed Duel!

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:54.808
(grunts)

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.643
I'm gonna go first, bub.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.312
So here I go!

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:00.080
Isn't this cool, Flame?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.549
We're actually getting to
battle The Gore in a duel!

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:04.718
Yes, exciting.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.487
My exhilaration
knows no bounds.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.989
But in case you were wondering,

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.524
this is called sarcasm

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.826
where I say what
I don't actually believe.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:13.894
Understand?

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:14.795
Good.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.163
On the serious side,

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.565
I've analyzed Gore's
previous matches.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.334
And his strategy
evolves greatly

00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:21.668
from one duel to the next,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.837
making him quite
unpredictable.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.140
So the only thing we can
expect is the unexpected.

00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:29.776
(Flame)
Be on your guard, Soulburner.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.645
I use my Skill!

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:33.813
Dinowrestle Revolution!

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.317
I get to activate
the Field Spell

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:38.819
WORLD DINO WRESTLING
from my deck!

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:41.521
With it, Every time
my DINOWRESTLERS

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.858
attack your monster,
they gain 200 attack points!

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.527
Gore already used
his Skill.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:50.864
Uh-huh. And it's one that
he's never used before.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:55.536
I summon my
DINOWRESTLER CAPOEIRAPTOR

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:56.637
to the field!

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.039
(wind blows)

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.105
(computer chirping)

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.842
It's not just his Skill.

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:04.711
He's not playing with
his Gouki Deck anymore.

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:07.181
I said to expect
the unexpected,

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:10.717
but this even exceeds
my unexpectations.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.352
(sighs)

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.553
Yeah I bet!

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.423
Next I activate
the spell DINOMUSCLE!

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:18.625
It pumps up my DINOWRESTLER

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.527
with 400 more attack points!

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.429
(timer beeping)

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.798
With that I end my turn.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.566
Okay Soulburner,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.736
show me what you think you got!

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.938
You don't need to tell me twice!

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.540
It's my turn!

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.041
I draw!

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:37.044
By sending SALAMANGREAT FALCO
to the graveyard,

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:38.712
SALAMANGREAT MEER

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:42.015
can summon itself
directly from my hand!

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.083
Come on out!

00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:45.085
(computer chirping)

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.355
But it won't be stickin'
around for very long.

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:51.392
Cuz I can return this
SALAMANGREAT to my hand

00:09:51.392 --> 00:09:53.394
to trigger FALCO's
special ability

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.796
and revive the bird
from my graveyard.

00:09:55.796 --> 00:09:57.464
(computer chirping)

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:00.100
And when an ability sends
MEER back to my hand,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.768
I get to resummon
it to the field.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:03.404
So I guess I was
wrong when I said

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:04.738
it wasn't stickin' around.

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:06.673
(computer chirping)

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:08.442
I follow that up by summoning

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:10.844
SALAMANGREAT JACK JAGUAR!

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:13.513
(computer chirping)

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.750
(Gore)
He's got everything
he needs to Link Summon.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.685
I blaze the circuit,

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.722
that scorches the
path to the future!

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.223
(explosion)

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:24.858
The summoning conditions

00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:27.460
require at least
two Fire Monsters!

00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:28.895
And I have three!

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.931
I set SALAMANGREAT FALCO,

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:34.501
MEER and JACK JAGUAR
in the Link Arrows!

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.037
I Link Summon!

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:38.205
(roaring)

00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:39.940
(explosion)

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.108
(Soulburner)
Link 3

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:44.011
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:45.345
(roaring)

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:47.914

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.884

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.434
Oh, man.

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:10.103
If we let Gore's DINOWRESTLER
survive until the next turn,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.805
that's really gonna stink for us

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.441
because then he'll have the
strongest monster in play.

00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:15.776
(Flame)
I agree.

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.010
So the smart move is

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.146
to do whatever we
can to get rid of it.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.248
You read my mind Flame.

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:23.283
Since I Link Summoned HEATLEO,

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.118
its special ability activates.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.687
letting me return one of your

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:28.355
spell or trap
cards to your deck.

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:31.458
So you can say goodbye
to your DINOMUSCLE!

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.664
(Soulburner)
And without that muscle,

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:39.866
your CAPOEIRAPTOR
loses 400 attack points.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.935
(timer beeping)

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.070
But that's only step one.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.140
My JACK JAGUAR has
an ability too.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.810
I hate to wake
a sleeping kitty cat but...

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.679
if I return one of
my other SALAMANGREATS

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:54.515
that's in the
graveyard to my deck,

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:56.583
I can resummon JACK JAGUAR

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:58.185
next to HEATLEO's link.

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.188
So I return SALAMANGREAT FALCO

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:03.190
to my deck so that JACK JAGUAR

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.325
can pounce right
back into the game!

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:09.429
(computer chirping)

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.332
Next, I'll place this facedown.

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:14.868
All right!
HEATLEO!

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:17.304
Destroy CAPOEIRAPTOR!

00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.840
Blazing Blast!

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.642
(roaring)

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.844
Too bad but CAPOEIRAPTOR

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:26.213
can't be destroyed when
it's in attack mode.

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:27.247
What?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.415
Oh byte.

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.684
Well, at least he
still takes damage.

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:31.518
(Gore groans)

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:32.686
(timer beeping)

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.421
(Gore)
After the battle,

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.024
my wrestler automatically
switches to defense mode.

00:12:37.024 --> 00:12:38.058
Ah!

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:40.194
If it's in defense,
that means

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:42.029
it can now be destroyed.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:45.065
And we still have our
JACK JAGUAR to attack with.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.533
Plus its special ability

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:47.968
allows it to still deal damage

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.337
even if Gore's
monster's in defense mode.

00:12:50.337 --> 00:12:53.540
All right, tear ‘em to
shreds JACK JAGUAR!

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.542
Clamp those claws!

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:57.911
When I have a
DINOWRESTLER in the ring,

00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.479
WORLD DINO WRESTLING's effect

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.482
only allows one monster
to attack per turn.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.952
So JACK JAGUAR ain't doin' jack!

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.119
What?

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.123
He said JACK JAGUAR
is not doing any Jack.

00:13:09.123 --> 00:13:10.491
Weren't you listening?

00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:13.260
(giggling)

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.095
(Soulburner)
Yeah, yeah. I heard him.

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:17.732
Then what's...
with the gigglin'?

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:19.967
I know the stakes
are high and everything,

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:21.101
but you don't
know what it's like

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.403
to duel one of your heroes!

00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:24.238
It's a dream come true!

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:25.739
(Soulburner)
So if I'm dreamin'

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:26.941
don't wake me up!

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:28.942
Unless of course it's
to duel you for real.

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:30.911
But this is isn't
a dream... right?

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:34.281
(reporters)
Mr. Gore! Mr. Gore!
Over here!

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:36.583
(reporter A)
Just one question for
the "VRAINS Times"!

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:39.386
Tell us Mr. Gore, what
made you risk your life

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:40.988
to try to save LINK VRAINS?

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:42.089
The kids.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.257
Knowing that the
smiles on their faces

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.827
would just vanish if
I didn't do somethin'?

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:49.063
That's all the
motivation I needed.

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.898
Yes, yes, that's nice
and everything, Mr. Gore.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:54.267
But can we talk about
the true hero of all this?

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.402
(Gore grunts)

00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:56.871
(Reporter A)
You know who I'm
talking about--

00:13:56.871 --> 00:13:57.871
Playmaker!

00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:59.373
What's he doing these days?

00:13:59.373 --> 00:14:01.475
Don't know.
Haven't seen him.

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:02.543
(Reporter B)
You haven't?

00:14:02.543 --> 00:14:03.877
But aren't you his sidekick?

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.312
Or at least his apprentice?

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:06.447
(Reporter A)
We want to ask him--

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:08.782
how did he singlehandedly
save the day?

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.218
Excuse me, our readers
would like to know.

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:14.154
Do you think Playmaker is
all that or all that n'more?

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:15.556
Oh yes.
What is your answer

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.023
to that burning question?

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.159
(Reporter B)
If LINK VRAINS is
ever in trouble again,

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:21.194
can we count on
Playmaker to save us?

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.063
(Reporter A)
Have we seen the
last of Playmaker?

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.064
Get out!

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:25.165
(reporters screaming)

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:27.034
All of you!
Get out!

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.669
(Female Reporter)
So sorry, Mr.Gore

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:30.470
So no comment on Playmaker?

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:36.142
(Gore)
They cared less about
me than a side of

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:38.445
cole slaw in a 20-piece meal.

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.114
All they wanted to know about

00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:42.783
was Playmaker this,
and Playmaker that.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.018
<i>I know it's easy
to fault the press,</i>

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.687
<i>but they don't know
the true story</i>

00:14:46.687 --> 00:14:48.655
<i>of what happened
like you and I do.</i>

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:50.858
<i>How Playmaker had
no chance to defeat</i>

00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:52.292
<i>Varis without your help.</i>

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:54.462
<i>Try not to
let it get to you.</i>

00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:56.697
(Gore)
That's easy
for him to say.

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.566
It's not like he was once
on top of the leagues.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.202
And now everyone thinks
he's chump change.

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:04.238
Well, I'll
show ‘em that

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:06.073
Gore's never down
for the count.

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:07.741
I'm gonna change my focus,

00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:10.244
not on the gleam and
the glamour of the spotlight

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:11.946
but on getting the win,

00:15:11.946 --> 00:15:13.947
the win against Playmaker.

00:15:14.882 --> 00:15:17.584
So this Soulburner
may think I'm his hero.

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.087
But that hero ain't
around no more.

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:23.757
And I have no problem
takin' down my former fans!

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:25.592
It's my turn!

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.027
I draw!

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.397
When my CAPOEIRAPTOR
is in defense mode

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:33.566
I can summon
another CAPOEIRAPTOR

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:34.601
from my deck!

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:36.871
(computer chirping)

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:37.871
(roaring)

00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:39.707
Next, I summon

00:15:39.707 --> 00:15:41.575
DINOWRESTLER CAPAPTERA!

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:43.743
(electrical chirping)

00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:46.213
And with that

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.381
I can mash up my circuit!

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.219
The summoning conditions require

00:15:52.219 --> 00:15:54.021
two or more DINOWRESTLERS.

00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.558
So I set two
DINOWRESTLER CAPOEIRAPTORS

00:15:57.558 --> 00:16:00.327
and one DINOWRESTLER
CAPAPTERA in the Link Arrows!

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:03.463
I Link Summon!

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:05.532
Link 3

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:09.303
DINOWRESTLER KING
T WREXTLE!
(roaring)

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:11.104
(computer chirping)

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:15.576
I Link Summon!

00:16:15.576 --> 00:16:16.777
Link 3

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:19.947
DINOWRESTLER KING
T WREXTLE!
(roaring)

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.614
(computer chirping)

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:24.818
And the king of the ring isn't
done flexing its muscles!

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.988
Since I used
CAPAPTERA to Link Summon

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:30.858
KING T WREXTLE gains
1,000 attack points

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:32.425
until the end of this turn!

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.460
(timer beeping)

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:36.129
That sure is a lot
of attack points.

00:16:36.129 --> 00:16:37.330
Indeed.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.466
(Gore)
Soulburner is
forcin' me to duel

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:41.001
at the top of my game.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.938
Must be cuz he went through the
Lost Incident like Playmaker.

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:47.674
That incident didn't
make no cupcakes.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.243
(Gore)
So you don't
think I got what

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:52.145
it takes to outduel Playmaker.

00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:54.281
No Gore, I said
that those who went

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:56.950
through the Lost Incident
had to fight to survive.

00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:00.854
Not for fame or glory
like a celebrity duelist,

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.723
but for survival.

00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:04.658
That takes a certain
kind of heart.

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:07.928
How could you possibly expect
to compete against that?

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:11.398
(Gore)
Zaizen doesn't know
the first thing about me.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:14.167
If he thinks the
Lost Incident was bad,

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:17.137
then he doesn't know
the meaning of the word “lost".

00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:20.540
Don't let my championship
belts and trophies fool ya.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.410
I was raised in
the grime and the gore.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.013
They had to
win a duel to eat?

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:28.548
At least they were
given a chance to eat!

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:31.017
I had nothing.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:32.986
Nothing at all.

00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:34.921
Until dueling saved me.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.825
I finally had a chance
to control my fate

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:40.093
with my own hands.

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:42.362
And I wasn't gonna let go.

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:45.032
Duelin' showed
me that no matter

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:46.367
how bad things were,

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:48.034
you can rise up out of it.

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:49.869
But it also taught me

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:51.572
that if you let
your guard down--

00:17:51.572 --> 00:17:53.007
even for a moment--

00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:55.409
someone's gonna come
and steal your shine

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.344
and kick you back
into the trenches.

00:17:58.012 --> 00:18:00.113
That's why I gotta
keep winning--

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:04.417
and not let anyone stop
me ‘til I reach the top!

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:06.386
Not Playmaker,

00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:07.421
not anyone!

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:11.258
So I won't let no
fireball burn me out!

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:12.926
Go!

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.427
KING T WREXTLE!

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.063

My Field Spell
WORLD DINO WRESTLING

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.869

attack points by 200!

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:24.571
(timer beeping)

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.742
I have a card that
can deal with that--

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:28.909
No.

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:30.978
You don't because KING
T WREXTLE's ability

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:33.747
stops ya from using
spell or trap cards!

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:34.648
What?

00:18:34.648 --> 00:18:36.216
(Gore)
Now you see who the real

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.484
king of the jungle is!

Face it, burner boy.

00:18:48.094 --> 00:18:50.097
You thought you
were gonna stop me.

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.432
But you ain't nothing more
than a speed bump.

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:54.568
Cuz I got my sights
on bigger game--

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:56.370
and you ain't Playmaker.

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:58.639
You're goin' down,
he's goin' down

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.975
and no paparazzi's
gonna be callin' me

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:02.476
a sidekick ever again!

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:03.510
Umm...

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.846
Yeah. So I was
totally followin' ya.

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:08.315
Til the end.

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:11.151
With that sidekick
paparazzi stuff.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:14.454
Right now, you're
sounding kinda...

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.356
like, well, a tool.

00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:18.692
Say what now?

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:20.127
What did you call me?

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:21.328
(Soulburner)
A tool.

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:23.831
Not a useful one like
a wrench or a hammer,

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:26.366
but the one that's
like a sad mopey dope.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:27.768
You know what?

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:29.670
You're kinda bummin' me out.

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.339
I don't know if this is
a phase you're goin' through.

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:35.108
But c'mon and snap out of
it already would ya?

Really now!

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.711

Because I do!

(grunts)

00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:41.048
Cuz you're my hero.

00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:42.783
Not because you had
the splashiest cards

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:44.384
or the best strategies.

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:46.653
But because no one
tried harder than you.

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:48.188
And that meant a lot to me.

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:51.057
I saw how an ordinary guy

00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:53.159
worked with his friends
to stop the greatest

00:19:55.228 --> 00:19:57.164
just cuz he refused to give up.

00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:59.500
Because he always
believed in himself--

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.768
so if I believed in myself,

00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:03.370
I could make it too!
