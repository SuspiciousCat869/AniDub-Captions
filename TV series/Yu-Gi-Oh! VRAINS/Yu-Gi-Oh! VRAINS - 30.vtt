♪♪♪

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.519
I'm extremely pleased to report
that my upgraded Artificial Army

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.321
has cleaned LINK VRAINS
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.058
Excellent work,
Kitamura.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.759
Just doing my job, sir.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.629
Though I doubt I need to remind
you that we wouldn't

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:12.633
have had these problems
if you did your job properly
in the first place.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.334
The past is the past.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.870
I assure you
it won't happen again.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.072
As you can see for yourself.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.776
They have LINK VRAINS covered
like fur on a grizzly.

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:23.810
There's not a single
hacker out there

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.647
who could penetrate
this gauntlet!

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:27.781
Or so you claim.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.384
Do not worry,
your wiseness.

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.986
With the network secure,
I shall redouble our efforts

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.589
in capturing and delivering
the Ignis to you

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.424
on a silver platter.

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:39.059
Very well.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.995
'Cause when I succeed,
they'll line that silver platter

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.232
in gold and platinum
and diamonds galore!

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.603
Even Monster Reborn couldn't
resurrect my career like I did.

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:53.307
(Kitamura humming)

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:54.942
We have big problems, Chief!

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.477
<i>Like double code red!</i>

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:58.612
Calm yourself.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.113
It can't be that bad.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.016
<i>The Artificial Army's
getting knocked offline!</i>

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.619
Ahh... Oh!

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:06.987
Say what!?

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.656
That's impossible!

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.690
Our sensors must
be malfunctioning.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.192
(man)
<i>It's no malfunction, sir.</i>

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.563
<i>The AI units are
definitely being erased.</i>

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:17.130
Being erased!?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.400
Just like my career!

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.068
(woman)
<i>What are your orders, sir?</i>

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:22.670
Umm... Ohh...

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.638
My orders are to fix this!

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:26.640
Or you're fired!
<i>Right, sir.</i>

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.509
<i>But can you be more
specific on the how?</i>

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.511
Ohh... You can
figure it out.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.780
Ohh...

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:37.017
Here ya go.
Two hot dogs
with everything.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.352
Do they have
marshmallows on them?

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:43.023
Uh... nope.
No marshmallows.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.993
Then technically they don't
have everything.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:50.197
Touché, my man, you got me there
but still, they're delish!

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:54.468
<i>I've been tallying your sales,
Kolter, they're impressive.</i>

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:58.605
<i>You just sold two dogs
to that guy, so that makes
a total of... two.</i>

00:03:58.672 --> 00:03:59.873
Pretty nice, right?

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:03.110
<i>Um, yeah, I guess...
Better than one.</i>

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.178
Twice as better.

00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:06.080
<i>Technically true.</i>

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:08.114
Yusaku, how's
LINK VRAINS lookin'?

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.418
No one has seen a single Knight
of Hanoi in the past few days.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.187
So duelists are feeling
safe to return.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.525
Looks like life in LINK VRAINS
is finally back to normal.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.227
<i>Or it could be the calm
before the storm.</i>

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.930
It's true that Varis
is still out there.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.932
<i>And out for payback!</i>

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.400
That's right.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:29.069
I don't know which is actually
worse though,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.771
hearing that Varis
is up to something

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.907
or not hearing a single
thing from Varis at all.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.344
But if my suspicions
are correct...

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.415
Uh, you okay?

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:45.252
<i>Yusaku, was your Link Sense
workin' OT like mine?</i>

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.422
Yeah, I saw some kind
of sphere with tentacles.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.123
That's called an octopus.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.893
Kolter, it wasn't an octopus.

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:55.762
<i>Whatever it was, it's bad news
and I'm not squidding!</i>

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.398
Let's gear up.
We need to go find out

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.668
what that sphere is.
On it.

00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:05.805
(Zaizen)
SOL Technologies sent out
a press release stating

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.342
that they've completely
eradicated the Knights of Hanoi.

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.444
So LINK VRAINS
is perfectly safe.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:14.314
(Emma)
Everything sounds peachy,
so why did you drag me here?

00:05:14.348 --> 00:05:17.351
(Zaizen)
Though, that was the official
word from Sol Technologies,

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.987
I heard that the company logs
state that we're secretly

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.155
staffing up on security
coders and programmers.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.124
(Emma)
Doesn't hurt to be careful.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.126
Or it could mean
that the Knights of Hanoi

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.994
aren't actually gone.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.831
And I would like you
to find out what
they may be up to.

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:34.101
Interesting.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.469
I believe that Ghost Gal
can make a quick jaunt

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:40.508
into LINK VRAINS as long
as the check clears, Akira.

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:41.575
It will.

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.677
Report what you
find only to me.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.012
Of course, darling.

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.480
Can't let your bosses know

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.315
you're snooping
behind their back.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.184
Don't worry,
just our little secret.

00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:55.188
We've reached
a crisis point.

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.125
Losing Faust,
Baira and Dr. Genome

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:00.027
is a major setback
for the Hanoi,

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:02.896
but a greater
tragedy for me.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:06.066
They would not have fallen
if I had simply carried out

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.837
our mission instead of obsessing
over defeating Playmaker.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.006
But I shall stray no longer.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.377
My sole focus now is to carry
out our master plan.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.211
(Spectre)
Are you sure, Varis?

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.680
Once you launch the program,

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.683
that means you will never get to
avenge your loss to Playmaker.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:27.087
(Varis)
Like how these three sacrificed
themselves for me,

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.690
we all must make sacrifices
for the greater cause, Specter.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.092
And there is no greater cause

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:36.096
than the complete and utter
destruction of LINK VRAINS.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.370
(Kolter)
Check this out, Yusaku.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:46.173
I present to you the LVSS!

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.509
<i>LVSS? Is that the new name
for your food truck?</i>

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:52.312
<i>The Low Visitor Sandwich Stand?</i>

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.014
Not a sandwich.
It's actually stands

00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:55.982
for the Link Vrains
Search System.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.984
You see, it's a tracker
I cooked up that detects

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.821
even the smallest
abnormalities.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.989
<i>How small?</i>

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:03.891
As tiny as you.
<i>Rude!</i>

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.760
Plus, it also pings your
location in real time,

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:09.463
so I'm your eye in the sky
whenever you're in the network.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:11.832
And I'm also working
on a few other upgrades,

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.234
but they're not
quite working yet.

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.871
Think of it as post-release
downloadable content, but free.

00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:22.809
(gasps)

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.112
What is it, pal?
Sensed something?

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.918
Bingo.
The LVSS is detecting that one

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:36.157
of LINK VRAINS'S structural
programs is being overwritten.

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:37.157
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:38.625
You logging in, Yusaku?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.129
<i>Just for the record,
I think it's abnormal</i>

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.631
<i>that you wanna check out
an abnormality.</i>

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.100
I don't have a choice.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.936
There are three reasons why
I must go and investigate this.

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:51.705
<i>One: 'Cause you're the real
abnormality?</i>

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:55.041
Number one: The Knights of Hanoi
may be behind this

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:57.278
and they
must always be defeated.

00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:00.380
Number two: Even if it's not
the Knights of Hanoi,

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:02.515
the very infrastructure
of LINK VRAINS

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:05.519
is in serious jeopardy
if this is left unchecked.

00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.521
<i>True...</i>

00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.891
And three: If Varis sees that
I'm logged into LINK VRAINS,

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.193
it may entice him
to emerge from hiding.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.631
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:47.695
(Ghost Gal)
Everything sure looks
peaceful to me.

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:51.231
But if Zaizen's right, this is
just the surface of the onion.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.304
You never know what you'll find
when you pull a few layers back.

00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:01.241
That's why I never leave home
without my toolkit.

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.043
(beeping)

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:08.014
Lock into anything
out of the ordinary, okay?

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.552
Happy hunting, my fireflies.

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:41.782
(Kolter)
<i>How's it goin, bud?</i>

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.684
The target should
be straight ahead.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.552
<i>And straight up dangerous.</i>

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.023
(Kolter)
What's wrong?

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.260
(Playmaker)
<i>It's fine,
nothing to worry about.</i>

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.730
<i>Really? Nothing to worry about?</i>
It's true.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.300
<i>Um, you just put yourself
in the spin cycle 'cause
your brain glitched!</i>

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.902
If the blasts
are getting stronger

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.070
it means we're closing
in on the source.

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:10.410
(AI)
<i>Looks like we're not
the only ones.</i>

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.213
Let's follow 'em.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.548
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:43.410
<i>Why'd they stop
on this rooftop?</i>

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:49.082
(Ghost Gal)
Well, well, fancy
meeting you here.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:51.118
Not that I'm that surprised.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.888
<i>It's Gore Gal!</i>
Eh, close.

00:10:53.921 --> 00:10:56.523
Anyway, if the problem's
big enough to attract

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.759
the both of us, it must
be worse than I expected.

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:07.634
Will you share
what you know?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.402
<i>Yeah, spill it lady!</i>

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:11.672
Since 50% of you
asked so nicely,

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:14.140
SOL Tech thinks
there's trouble brewing.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.476
SOL Tech, huh?

00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:17.311
Uh-huh, so I figured

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.113
I'd come here for
a little looky loo.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:22.682
<i>Along with a swarm of fleas?</i>

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.485
They're fireflies,
silly.

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:27.254
Or nano drones if you
want to be technical.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:30.357
I've programmed them to find
anything out of the ordinary.

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:32.960
Because non-ordinary
usually means big money.

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:34.929
And they hit the jackpot.

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:37.664
Well, if you're tracking
the same thing I am,

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.700
you'll be much safer
if you log out.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.101
I'm sure you're right.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:43.337
But unless you're the guy
who invented the seat belt,

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:46.172
no one ever made
a profit off of safe.

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.391
Ciao!

00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:06.426
<i>Wow, she just jumped
towards danger</i>

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:08.395
<i>without a second thought.</i>

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.731
<i>She's everything
I hope I'll never be.</i>

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:12.099
<i>What do you think
she'll find?</i>

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:13.700
The same thing we will.

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.035
Here we go Ai.

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:23.910
Who knew LINK VRAINS
had its own sewer system?

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:26.213
It's how they dispose
of corrupted data.

00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:28.048
Have you been
down here before?

00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:29.249
I get around.

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:31.852
In fact, I've infiltrated
more virtual worlds

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:34.755
than you can name, Playmaker.

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:37.024
<i>And it makes sense that you
gotta run through the sewers</i>

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:39.993
<i>if you wanna
do your dirty work, uch!</i>

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.429
(Ghost Gal)
This path leads
to a processing center

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:44.899
where old data is deleted.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:48.635
<i>Did you mean "Path"
or did you mean "paths"?</i>

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:51.539
<i>'Cause, you know,
the one little "S"
makes all the difference.</i>

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:54.341
<i>Details, lady, details.</i>

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.810
My fireflies headed
down the right tunnel.

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:59.413
<i>Well?
Which way, Magellan?</i>

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:02.549
Beats me, I'm afraid
we'll have to split up.

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.952
I'll let you take the left
while I take the right, 'kay?

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.821
<i>Or, on the other hand,</i>

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:11.092
<i>how about you take the left
and we take the right?!</i>

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.894
What? How adorable!

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.462
You little suspicious
so-and-so!

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:18.099
<i>Uh, yeah, look, lady.</i>

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:20.667
<i>It's not that I don't trust
you, but I don't trust you.</i>

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.437
And you shouldn't.
You're so smart!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.773
Playmaker is lucky
to have you.

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.275
<i>A compliment?
No meatbag's ever said</i>

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:30.744
<i>anything nice to me before!</i>

00:13:30.778 --> 00:13:32.079
<i>I don't know
how to process this.</i>

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.914
Then how about a game?

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.949
Let's each draw a card.

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.618
And whoever draws
the prettiest one

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:39.753
gets to choose
which way to go.

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:42.623
<i>It is on!</i>

00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:45.892
<i>I can outdraw any duelist,
analog or digital.</i>

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:46.961
<i>But how do you know
I won't try to cheat?</i>

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.829
Don't be so modest.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:51.165
We both know it's impossible
to cheat an A.I.

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:53.133
that's as intelligent as you.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.801
<i>Huh, true.</i>

00:13:56.536 --> 00:13:58.706
(laughs)

00:13:58.772 --> 00:14:00.507
Pick a card.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.943
<i>Huh?</i>

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:06.146
<i>(groaning)</i>

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:09.316
<i>Right arm energized for maximum
draw efficiency!</i>

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.718
<i>Switching over
to card selection mode!</i>

00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:15.022
<i>Deck analysis program
optimized and engaged!</i>

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.390
<i>Commence processing!</i>

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.493
<i>Heart of the cards, guide me!</i>

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.362
<i>I draw!</i>

00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:30.170
<i>Um... is this pretty?
Uh...</i>

00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:32.139
Well, pretty ugly.

00:14:32.173 --> 00:14:34.674
It's the least attractive
card in my deck.

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.278
It's not your day.
Which means I win

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.012
without even
having to draw!

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:41.882
I'll take the right tunnel,
so you take the left.

00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:42.883
Toodles.

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:50.024
<i>How could I lose?
Oh, ohh...</i>

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:54.127
You failed to notice
that all the cards in her deck
were exactly the same.

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:56.863
<i>What!?
Ya mean she schemed me?</i>

00:14:56.963 --> 00:14:59.866
Clearly.
And using the easiest
trick in the book.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.935
<i>Does that mean
I'm gullible?</i>

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:04.672
<i>I thought that word didn't
exist in the dictionary.</i>

00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:06.740
Be that as it may,
we won't get anything

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.842
accomplished
by remaining here.

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.844
Let's get moving
and see what lies ahead

00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:12.412
down this tunnel
on the left, Ai.

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.251
Sorry, Playmaker,
I don't feel

00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:20.587
like letting you share
in my profits.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.747
(AI whispers)
<i>Psst... In the water!</i>

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:47.847
Yeah.

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:53.553
<i>Eh, it swam away.</i>

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.024
<i>(screaming)
Or not!</i>

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.364
(growls)

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:12.672
(roars)

00:16:20.147 --> 00:16:21.448
(roars)

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:28.522
<i>Faster, Playmaker! Faster!</i>

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:29.522
I know!

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.663
There's the processing center.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:41.168
A security shield, huh?

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:45.405
Nothing I can't hack...
literally.

00:16:53.748 --> 00:16:56.950
So this is what
my fireflies detected.

00:16:56.984 --> 00:17:00.587
Just a tad bigger than
the usual treasures I find,

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.357
but a lot creepier.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.759
What is that thing?

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:13.234
Yusaku! I'm pickin' up
some crazy energy spikes.

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:16.636
Fireflies, do me a favor
and analyze that blob.

00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:26.580
Good.
The data's flowing in.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.416
Hmm.

00:17:37.324 --> 00:17:38.725
(growls)

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:41.394
<i>It's getting stronger
and faster!</i>

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.097
It's not like
I'm trying to run slow!

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:53.474
No way.

00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.809
These energy readings
are off the charts.

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:58.412
As if this blob is absorbing
all the data energy

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:00.047
that's flowing into this room.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.749
Return to me, fireflies!

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:07.487
Where are you going?

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:19.132
Huh?

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:24.104
Tsk-tsk, you should have
never come here, Ghost Gal.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.075
Varis.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:31.145
You know what they say about
the cat who got too curious

00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:32.946
for her own good,
don't you?

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:35.116
Um... Nope!

00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:38.285
But maybe you can enlighten
me some other day.

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.253
I'm free February 30th.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.894
I'm afraid I can't
allow you to leave

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.962
after you've seen
what's going on here.

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:51.164
I don't need
your permission.

00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:00.273
You can't run.

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:02.943
Listen, Varis, I don't even
know what I'm looking at.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.545
But someone that
you tell might.

00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:06.680
You got me there.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.648
But if you won't let me
go around you,

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:11.017
I'll just go
through you.
Go ahead.

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:14.021
I have a few new cards
in my deck I want to test out.

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:16.356
And it would be
my pleasure to allow you

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.492
to be the first
duelist to see them.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.527
You're such
the gentleman, Varis.

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.462
But you don't
intimidate me.

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:23.463
Ready to duel?

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.199
Hmm.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:27.968
Oh, it seems you are.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.870
But... I'm not! Later!

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:39.346
(Varis)
Shutting all corridors.

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:41.682
But I can still log out.

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:44.051
(beeping)

00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:47.020
Not if I jam
the signal, Ghost Gal.

00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:48.989
Ahh...

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:53.727
(Varis)
Any more tricks up your sleeve?

00:19:53.827 --> 00:19:56.397
Just one.

00:19:56.497 --> 00:19:59.199
It's time
to Speed Duel.
It's time to
speed duel.

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.901
I'll go first!

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:03.270
I begin by summoning
Altergeist Marionetter.

00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:10.443
And her special ability
lets me take a trap card

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.647
from my deck
and place it facedown.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.850
Then I'll place another
card from my hand facedown.

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:22.189
