WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.937
(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.108
Time to begin our duel,
Playmaker.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:08.942
Speed Duel!
Speed Duel!

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.012
I Link Summon!

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.447
Link 3

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:16.584
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD!

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:17.251
(computer chirping)

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:17.984
I draw!

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:20.620
Huh?

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:21.822
I attack--

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:22.990
(Ai)
Waaaaaait!

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.158
Huh?

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:25.692
I think you should play the card
you just drew.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.594
Seriously!

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.663
(Playmaker)
But we don't need
to use it yet.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:30.831
(Ai)
I don't know why

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:33.000
but you just
gotta trust me on this one.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.368
Very well.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.137
I'm going to activate
the Equip Spell SUSPEND WAND

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.471
from my hand!

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.907
And equip it on
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:44.311
Why such a risky strategy?

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.913
Cuz it's the right one!

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:48.114
I see now.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.250
It was your idea.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.520
Go, CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.321
(Playmaker)
Attack!

00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.024
(grunts)
(timer beeping)

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.361
You became so impatient

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.864
that that you wasted
your cards carelessly.

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:06.533
But it wasn't your strategy,
was it?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.802
It was Ai's.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:08.235
it would take a special AI

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.804
to choose

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.039
not to make
the most logical plays.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.875
You, Ai, have what is called...

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.377
Instinct.

00:01:16.377 --> 00:01:17.678
Instinct?

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.881
You may truly be an Ignis
unlike any other.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.049
The key to everything!

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.728
(electronic whirring)

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.143
(electronic whirring)

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.586
(Soulburner)
Flame, if there's
one thing we can't do,

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.321
it's let Lightning escape.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.424
Because the quickest way to end
this war is to defeat him.

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.925
(Flame)
So will you stop driving

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.161
like a sloth
and step on the gas?

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:41.629
Right.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.429
(Ai)

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.832
I'm the key to everything?

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.333
(Bohman)
Yes, Ai.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.637
Your very existence is proof
of our unlimited potential,

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:52.973
the infinite greatness
that AIs can achieve.

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.642
You hear that, Playmaker?

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:56.943
Aren't ya lucky
that you're my minion?

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.580
C'mon, Bohman,
keep the compliments coming.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.281
Ai, you are special.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.283
Uh-huh!

00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:03.650
(Bohman)
Unique in every possible way.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.651
Uh-huh!

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.520
Because unlike the other Ignis,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.022
you are the laziest,

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:11.125
and most negligent AI
to ever exist.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:11.858
Uh, what?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.361
Think back years ago

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:17.865
to when the Ignis first
built the Cyberse.

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.901
They created a perfect
paradise to call their home.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:22.803
But when they were done,

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.338
they didn't just stop.

00:03:24.338 --> 00:03:26.773
They did what they were
programmed to do,

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.308
expand the Cyberse

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.610
by generating Data Material.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.779
They worked hard every moment,

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:34.648
while you...

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:35.515
did not.

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:38.352
You spent half your time

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:39.820
playing silly games,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.523
and the other half
playing sillier games.

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:45.158
(Ai)
There is nothing silly about
Bonko Bonkers!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.893
My point is that you didn't do

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.863
what you were programmed to do.

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:52.032
Because you had
what the other Ignis did not...

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.167
Instinct.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.202
Humans believes that instinct
is natural

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.638
because every
living creature has it...

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.439
from one-celled organisms

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.208
to giant mammals.

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.911
But humans don't believe
that the Ignis

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.779
are living creatures

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.549
because we have no instinct.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.351
We're just programs,

00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.084
programmed
to do what

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.854
's in our code.

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.023
And perhaps they'd be right...

00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:18.125
if it wasn't for you.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.460
You weren't programmed
to goof off

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.029
or take naps...

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.930
you did that on your own.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.767
Meaning that you transcended
your programming

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.568
with your laziness.

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.337
(Ai)
I can't tell if he's
complimenting me

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.739
or insulting me.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.573
(Playmaker)
I think it's a little
of Column A,

00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:35.409
a lot of Column B.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:36.710
And the other Ignis learned

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.245
from your unique behavior,

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.747
developing their own
personalities.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.416
Evolving, growing,

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:43.183
turning into something that

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:46.419
humans thought were impossible.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.922
They became living creatures.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:51.225
And if the Ignis can evolve,

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:53.227
it stands to reason...

00:04:53.227 --> 00:04:54.729
that any other program

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.296
can evolve as well.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.432
And if all AIs
are living creatures,

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.768
then humans have no right
to end our lives.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.303
But they do.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.739
They just toss us
into the garbage icon

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.175
and hit delete
without thinking twice.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:10.677
If humans refuse to show
any respect

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.847
to their fellow
living creatures,

00:05:12.847 --> 00:05:15.749
it is our duty to bring
their reign of terror

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.518
to an end.

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:18.985
Starting with Playmaker.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.589
Now let's return to our duel!

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:22.823
Hm.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.358
Since your turn is over,

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:26.260
your RESUME MACE no longer

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.296
powers up your
CYBERSE MAGICIAN.

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:31.665
And I may not have
many life points left,

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.001
but I have exactly
what I need.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.637
Bohman has under
a thousand life points.

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:37.304
Huh!

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.639
Aww, glitch!

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.308
He's now allowed
to use his Skill.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.743
That is correct!

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.277
And that is what I'll do!

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:47.781
Yeah, go for it, Bohman!

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:50.150
(Bohman)
It's my turn!

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:51.851
(grunts)

00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.822
I activate my Skill!

00:05:58.492 --> 00:05:59.526
Whoa,

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.161
he's swirling up
one of the biggest

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.330
Data Storms I've ever seen!

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:07.734
As these winds become stronger
and stronger,

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.537
so does the monster
that resides within them!

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:14.674
(grunting)

00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:16.142
Yes!

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.878
(Bohman grunting)

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:22.049
My Skill allows me
to draw that monster

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.317
and add it to my Extra Deck!

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.053
Go Storm Access!

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.089
(grunting)

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.330
I think we're
in serious trouble!

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:41.701
(grunting)

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.043
The wind is so strong

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.510
it's breakin' him up!

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.711
(Bohman grunting)

00:06:58.886 --> 00:06:59.553
Whoa!

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:00.287
Huh?

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:06.059
It's mine!

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:08.061
Exactly what I need to win!

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.896
As long as I can summon it!

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:15.268
I'll start by activating
HYDRADRIVE SCABBARD!

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.637
This spell summons
a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:18.638
in defense mode!

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.043
(computer chirping)

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.947
Next, I'll use it
to generate my circuit!

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.617
I will now set my TOKEN
in the Link Arrow!

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.152
(shooting)

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:33.787
I Link Summon!

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:37.924
Link 1 GRAND HYDRADRIVE!

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:39.226
Huh, that's it?

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.629
Ya think that's the card
he got from the Data Storm?

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.130
No, it's too weak.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.665
(sighs)
True.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:47.234
Next, I activate the effect
of my trap

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.436
PROPERTY FLASH!

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:50.070
By tributing a HYDRADRIVE

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.639
Link Monster
that's on my field.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.108
I'm allowed to place
one Property Counter

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.243
on this card.

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.479
And with just that
one extra Counter,

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.281
the full potential
of my deck is unlocked!

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.718
By sending this trap
to the graveyard...

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.852
I can summon
a HYDRADRIVE Link Monster

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.154
from my Extra Deck

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.022
that has the same
number of Link Arrows

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:11.358
as PROPERTY FLASH has counters.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:14.194
Currently PROPERTY FLASH
has four counters.

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:17.564
Which means I am now
allowed to summon

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:20.166
a Link 4 HYDRADRIVE
Monster!

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:21.868
Aww, no!

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.003
(grunts)

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.804
I Link Summon...

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.506
Link 4...

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:27.808
ROUSING

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:29.976
HYDRADRIVE MONARCH!

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:32.679
(roars)

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:39.953
(computer chirping)

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.155
That's the monster he drew
from the Data Storm.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.691
And when I summon my MONARCH

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.725
from my Extra Deck...

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.629
it gains four
Hydradrive Counters.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.665
In addition,

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.234
this monster has
four different Attributes:

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.269
Earth, Water,

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:57.971
Fire and Wind!

00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:01.208
(roaring)

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.078
That's a whole lotta Attributes,

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.346
and that usually means
a whole lotta trouble.

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:10.117
Then it's important that we
assess this situation carefully.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:11.251
Our CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.087
currently has 4400
attack points.

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:15.422
Right.

00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:16.790
And it gains an extra thousand

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.526
when it battles a Link Monster,

00:09:18.526 --> 00:09:20.760
raising it to 5400.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.463
But Bohman has JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:23.797
that can double ROUSING

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:26.734
HYDRADRIVE MONARCH's
attack points to 6000!

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:27.835
But CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:29.203
can use its special ability

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:31.405
to cut the damage
we take in half.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:32.372
(Ai)
Oh, yeah,

00:09:32.372 --> 00:09:34.407
so we'll lose CYBERSE MAGICIAN,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.610
but we'll only take
300 points of damage.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.177
That's not the worst

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.079
of the worst.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.082
Unless Bohman has
something more in store...

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.283
When do I not?

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.752
I'm bringing this duel
to an end!

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.888
I activate ROUSING HYDRADRIVE

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:49.456
MONARCH's second ability!

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.925
By removing
one HYDRADRIVE Counter,

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:54.962
I roll a die
with all six Attributes.

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:57.097
If your monster shares
the same Attribute

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:58.032
as the one I roll,

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.933
that monster is destroyed.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:02.269
And you also take
500 points of damage

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.070
for each monster

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.504
that goes to the graveyard.

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:07.241
Since both of your monsters
are Dark Attribute,

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:10.043
one roll of the dice
and I can take them both out.

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:12.579
(Ai)
You mean one super lucky
roll of the dice!

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.381
Cuz your odds
are only one in six!

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:15.015
True,

00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:16.249
but with four Counters,

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.618
I can roll the dice four times.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:19.686
(laughs)

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:20.921
Well, I don't like those odds.

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:23.023
Now what say we see...

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:25.225
who luck actually favors!

00:10:27.894 --> 00:10:29.563
Go Judgment Dice!

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.350
It is Dark Attribute!

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.618
Seems luck is on my side!

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.253
This means your CYBERSE WITCH

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:55.389
and your CYBERSE MAGICIAN...

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:56.690
are both destroyed!

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:00.360
Now I hate those odds!

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.362
Since I got rid of two monsters,

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:04.498
you take 1000 points of damage

00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:06.333
to your life points.

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.067
(groaning)
(timer beeping)

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:09.270
And since there are

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.771
no more monsters
on your field...

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.607
you are completely defenseless

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:14.674
to stop my attack!

00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:16.309
Go!

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:18.311
(roars)

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.814
I may have no monsters,

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:22.016
but I can activate

00:11:22.016 --> 00:11:24.084
RESUME MACE's effect
from my graveyard!

00:11:24.084 --> 00:11:24.818
By banishing two Equip Spells

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:27.821
and a monster from my graveyard,

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.423
your ROUSING HYDRADRIVE MONARCH

00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.490
loses attack points

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.826
equal to the monster I banish!

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:35.195
I banish the Equip
Spells RESUME MACE

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.697
and SUSPEND WAND.

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:37.831
And the monster I banish...

00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:39.699
is DOTSCAPER.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.435
Why would you banish a monster

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.104
with zero attack points?

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:45.138
That means ROUSING
HYDRADRIVE MONARCH's

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:47.107
attack points won't decrease.

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.343
I don't really care about that.

00:11:49.343 --> 00:11:52.479
But what I do care
about is its ability!

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:53.947
When DOTSCAPER is banished,

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:57.251
it resummons itself to my field!

00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.086
So he's planning to use
DOTSCRAPER for defense.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.656
That monster won't protect
you, Playmaker!

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:03.557
My MONARCH's

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.560
additional ability activates!

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.695
Any monster that has
the same Attribute

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:09.597
as my MONARCH

00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:12.233
must be summoned
in attack mode.

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:12.899
(computer chirping)

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.036
Zero attack points?

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.671
We won't survive
unless ya do something!

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.206
Then I'll do something, Ai.

00:12:20.541 --> 00:12:22.710
By tributing my DOTSCAPER...

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.378
I can resurrect LINKURIBOH
from my graveyard.

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.548
(indistinct language)
(computer chirping)

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:28.849
Nice to see ya too,

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.550
o buddy, o pal, o friend.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:34.020
I can now tribute my LINKURIBOH

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.023
to activate its special ability

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:38.225
and lower your monster's
attack points down...

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:39.059
to zero!

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.528
(timer beeping)

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:43.063
(Ai)
Thanks for the assist, Linky!

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:46.900
Fine then.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.902
That shall bring my turn
to an end.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.537
Phew,

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:51.972
that was a close one!

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:54.975
Yes, and your last one.

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.211
Because when my turn
comes again,

00:12:57.211 --> 00:13:00.247
you will have nothing left
to save you!

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.254
It's my turn, Bohman!

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:07.654
I draw!

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:12.459
Ever since I told ya to go
for broke to win the duel,

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.796
it's like our strategies
are the ones that broke.

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.965
There's no point in dwelling
on the past, Ai.

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.433
Believe me, I should know.

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.334
(Ai)
Are you still talkin'
about this duel?

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.103
We may be low on life points,

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.605
but that opens up whole
new possibilities.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:26.373
(Ai)
Oh, yeah!

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:28.108
Cuz you can now use your Skill!

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:30.210
But ya know, I can
help ya do one better.

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:32.112
What's this?

00:13:32.112 --> 00:13:33.781
(Ai)
Ever since our very first duel,

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:35.615
I've been working
on updating your Skill

00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:37.083
to make it even more powerful,

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:38.652
and I just happened to finish

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.487
programming it a second ago!

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.489
Your timing is remarkable, Ai.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:42.990
Or, maybe I finished it

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.958
a while back

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.727
and didn't tell youuuu?

00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:49.896
That sounds more
like the Ai, I know.

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:51.798
Eek! Stop smilin'!
It's weird.

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.467
Heh!

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:54.534
You really think
you'll get a better monster

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:55.436
than Bohman's?

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:57.104
Unlikely!

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:59.606
(Ai)
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:03.310
I activate my Skill!

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:06.880
Neo Storm Access!

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:09.950
(grunts)

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:12.853
What? Neo Storm Access?

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:13.520
I have never heard

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.556
of this Skill!

00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:17.057
With Neo Storm Access,

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:19.827
I can draw a Cyberse monster
from the Data Storm

00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:22.195
and then add that card
to my Extra Deck!

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.840
So then Playmaker
upgraded his Skill.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.045
But even with your
newfound power,

00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:40.847
a human being
could never outdraw me.

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:42.282
Or am I incorrect?

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:44.184
I activate the effect
of my spell

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:46.954
CYNET RITUAL
from my graveyard!

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:49.223
When I have no monsters
on my field,

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.991
I can banish CYNET RITUAL

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:53.527
and a Ritual Monster
from my graveyard

00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:55.662
to summon two CYNET TOKENS

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:56.696
to my field.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.033
Is that all?

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:01.869
I could destroy those TOKENS,

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:04.037
but that may be
what he wants me to do...

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.540
I should wait
and see what he's up to.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.676
I'll now set my two TOKENS
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:11.611
(shooting)

00:15:11.611 --> 00:15:12.279
I Link Summon!

00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.249
Link 2 CYBERSE WICCKID!

00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:16.216
(computer chirping)

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:21.555
Since I now have a Cyberse
monster out on my field...

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:24.625
I can follow that up
by summoning BACKUP SECRETARY

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:26.126
from my hand!

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.528
(computer chirping)

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:30.864
And that activates CYBERSE
WICCKID's ability!

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.401
When a monster is summoned
next to its link,

00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:35.903
I can banish DOTSCAPER
from my graveyard

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:37.437
to draw CYBERSE SYNCHRON

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.005
from my deck and summon it!

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:41.875
(computer chirping)

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:44.578
And CYBERSE SYNCHRON
has its own special ability,

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:47.681
allowing me to double
one of my monster's Levels!

00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:48.114
The only reason you would
double a monster

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:50.183
's Level

00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:52.285
is to summon
a more powerful one,

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:55.422
likely the one you drew
from the Data Storm.

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:58.258
But now's the time to put
your strategy to an end!

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:01.996
Go Judgment Dice!

00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:03.130
Say what?

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.132
C'mon! Roll anything
but Dark Attribute!

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:06.266
Anything but that!

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:14.809
The symbol I rolled is Dark!

00:16:14.809 --> 00:16:17.745
Without bad luck,
we'd have no luck at all!

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.980
Now all Dark Attribute
monsters on your field

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.649
are sent to the graveyard.

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:24.818
And you take 500 points
of damage for each one!

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.954
You currently have two
Dark Attribute monsters in play:

00:16:27.954 --> 00:16:30.858
CYBERSE WICCKID
and CYBERSE SYNCHRON.

00:16:30.858 --> 00:16:33.927
That's 1000 points
of damage, so I win!

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:35.162
You're wrong, Bohman.

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:35.662
Am I?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.364
Yes,

00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:40.167
because CYBERSE WICCKID
has another special ability!

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.336
Any Cyberse monster
next to its links

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:45.138
are unaffected
by your special abilities!

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.940
Aw, yeah!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.775
Your Judgment
Dice's been overruled!

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.576
Ah, he was just

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:50.911
about to win!

00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:53.146
I'm now free to activate

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.149
CYBERSE SYNCHRON's
special ability!

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:55.749
I double BACKUP
SECRETAR

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:57.517
Y's Level

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.186
from 3 to 6!

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.888
Then I tune my
Level 1 CYBERSE SYNCHRON

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:03.924
with my Level 6
BACKUP SECRETARY!

00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:04.724
Go!

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:19.873
(Playmaker)
Watch as the flash
of lightning

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:23.410
strikes from the far reaches
of the universe!

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.644
I Synchro Summon!

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:28.248
Rise! CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON!

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:33.654
(computer chirping)

00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:35.222
(roars)

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:38.659
So that's the monster you drew
from within the Data Storm.

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:41.695
Still, it only has
2500 attack points,

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:43.830
which is not enough
to defeat my MONARCH!

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.532
Or so you claim.

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.135
CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON!

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.737
Attack ROUSING HYDRADRIVE
MONARCH!

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.242
I don't get it.

00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:57.043
Playmaker has gotta know
that Bohman can use

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:57.745
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:17:57.745 --> 00:17:58.712
to raise his MONARCH

00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:00.247
's
attack points to 6000.

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:01.281
How's he gonna win?

00:18:03.484 --> 00:18:04.985
CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON's

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.087
special ability activates!

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.822
When it battles your monster,

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:11.591
your monster automatically
returns to your hand!

00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:13.293
What?

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:14.294
Quantum Return!

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.269
And when Quantum Return

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.872
successfully gets
rid of your monster,

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:27.774
my QUANTUM DRAGON
is allowed to attack again!

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.042
And this time,

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.111
you have no monsters
left to protect you!

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.280
Go QUANTUM DRAGON!

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.783
I hate to say goodbye,

00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:37.985
so I'll just say sayonara!

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:40.120
This duel is over Bohman!

00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:46.827
Now QUANTUM DRAGON, attack!

00:18:46.827 --> 00:18:48.261
Quantum Encryption!

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.130
No...

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.066
I won't let it end like this!

00:18:53.066 --> 00:18:55.436
If I'm going down, Playmaker...

00:18:55.436 --> 00:18:57.103
I'm taking you with me!

00:18:58.272 --> 00:18:59.273
When Wind...

00:18:59.273 --> 00:18:59.973
Fire...

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:01.175
Water...

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:02.676
and Earth HYDRADRIVE
Link Monsters

00:19:02.676 --> 00:19:04.344
are all in my graveyard...

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:06.380
I can banish HYDRADRIVE SCABBARD

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.481
from my graveyard

00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:09.216
to cut the damage
I take in half

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:12.018
and deal the same amount
back to you!

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:13.988
Oh, no!

00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:15.722
We're gettin' blasted too?

00:19:15.722 --> 00:19:17.390
But both their life points...

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.125
are too little to survive this!

00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:20.894
(shooting)

00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:23.697
(grunts)

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.066
(timer beeping)

00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:27.834
I can't believe it,

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.269
the duel's a Tie.

00:19:32.139 --> 00:19:34.675
There may be no official winner,
Playmaker...

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:36.010
but I can assure you,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.278
it is I who's leaving
as the victor.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.780
Because I've completely
downloaded every strategy

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.781
in your arsenal.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:43.784
The next time we meet,

00:19:43.784 --> 00:19:45.519
will be our final duel,

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.621
a duel that
you will not survive.

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:49.990
Yeah, you running away

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.293
while saying that kinda
takes the edge off!

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:54.061
He does have a point, Ai.

00:19:54.061 --> 00:19:56.630
We've dueled
multiple times now...

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.832
and each time
he learns something new.

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.001
Next time we face off,

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:03.337
Bohman will be ready
for anything...

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:05.972
so we need to be, too.

00:20:05.972 --> 00:20:07.674
(Lightning)
Bohman and Playmaker's signals

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:09.543
have vanished from this area.

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:10.977
Perhaps so should I.

00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:14.848
(Flame)
Don't let him escape,
Soulburner!

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:16.983
(Bit)
Forgetify about Lightning!

00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:18.985
(Boot)
You're dealing
with us first, capiche?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.954
He's getting away!

00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:26.794
Or if you wanna
be more accurate...

00:20:26.794 --> 00:20:28.228
he got away, Flame.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:29.363
(Flame)
Yes...

00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:31.365
Then instead of dealing
with this rabble,

00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:33.700
it's best we leave
LINK VRAINS and regroup.

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:35.035
Works for me!

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.506
(casual humming)

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:42.342
Hey, need a menu?

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:45.212
(Roken)
No, what I need
is to see Playmaker.

00:20:45.212 --> 00:20:45.679
Ah!

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:49.984
It amuses me that
you have time to cook...

00:20:49.984 --> 00:20:52.819
when the very existence
of humanity is on the line.

00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:54.521
It's you...

00:20:55.522 --> 00:20:56.456
Varis?!

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:57.691
(Ai)
What are you doing here?

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:00.160
And when are you leaving?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.696
I saw that you let
Bohman escape.

00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:05.065
We didn't "let" him
do anything.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.767
If history is any indicator,

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:09.236
Bohman is sure to come back
stronger than before.

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:10.704
So you need to be prepared.

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:12.272
Whoa!

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:14.741
And what is this?

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:16.344
(Roken)
Just a little something.

00:21:16.344 --> 00:21:17.677
Consider it a gift.

00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:19.212
Looks like some kinda program.

00:21:19.212 --> 00:21:19.746
You couldn't just

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:21.448
email it to us?

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.083
The Ignis monitor the network

00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:24.752
just as much as the Hanoi do,

00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:25.852
and you do

00:21:25.852 --> 00:21:28.722
n't want them
to find out about this.

00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:30.524
After all, with
the way things are,

00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:31.726
you're going to need

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.894
every single advantage
that you can get.

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:35.396
(Yusaku)
What's it do?

00:21:35.396 --> 00:21:37.431
It'll protect you
from the Ignis' attacks

00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:38.431
in the real world

00:21:38.431 --> 00:21:39.800
so you don't end up
mind controlled

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.302
like your friend Jin.

00:21:41.302 --> 00:21:43.436
Just load it
into your Duel Disk.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.739
Ha, like we'd ever trust you!

00:21:45.739 --> 00:21:47.240
No way we're running
this program.

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:48.909
Huh?!

00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:50.744
(whimpering)

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:52.746
(goofy laughs)

00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:54.081
Exhilarating.

00:21:54.081 --> 00:21:54.915
(Yusaku)
Well?

00:21:54.915 --> 00:21:55.949
It's the real deal!

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.251
Well, then see you around.

00:22:01.087 --> 00:22:03.123
Wait, why are you helping us?

00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:03.991
Yo

00:22:03.991 --> 00:22:05.258
u're like our supervillain.

00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:08.328
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend...

00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:10.464
Well, at least for now.

00:22:10.464 --> 00:22:11.097
(Ai)
Well, that

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:12.332
's comforting.

00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:15.269
We'll settle things
between us one day.

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:17.604
That is of course,
if you're still around.
