It's an epic smackdown
between The Gore</i>

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.106
<i>and the PhD of DNA--
Dr. Genome!</i>

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.474
Stomp him good,
Gore!

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.909
Make this clash flash!

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:09.910
(crowd chanting)
Go, Gore!

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.011
Go, Gore!

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.179
Go, Gore!

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.313
Go, Gore!

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.015
Have you ever heard
or seen anything

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.516
about a Data Gale before?

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.784
Nah, man.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:18.919
But it can't be
coincidence

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.154
that it sounds
just like a Data Storm.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.257
I think a Data Gale creates
winds strong enough

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.758
to allow them
to Speed Duel.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.193

Ding-ding-ding!

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.828

'Cause only
<i>moi</i> can create

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:33.000
an authentic Ignis-certified
OG Data Storm!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.102
I should sue for
copyright infringement,

but I don't know how
that law works.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.139
Ya know,
Gore might appreciate

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.474
a friendly hand.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.976
No, I don't think
that he would.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.745
When I saw him
at the hospital,

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.779
it was clear to me

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.914
that this fight
is truly his own.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.485
(Manager)
Good luck, George.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.021
Mackendrick's well-being
depends on your victory,

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.823

cost you your own.

Now let's Speed Duel!
Now let's Speed Duel!

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.761
It's brains before brawn,
so I'll go first!

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.929
I draw!

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.764
Let's see what I have.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.000
This couldn't be
any more perfect!

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:14.501
I mean, for me.

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.136
Not so much
for you, Gore.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:18.972
I figured,
ya cyclopean egghead.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.907
Ooh, look at Gore
trying to impress me

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.710
with his fancy
$5 words.

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:23.944
But none of that
will help you--

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.113
for I have analyzed
your dueling DNA,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.149
so I know all your moves
before you even make them!

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.753
You're like a book
I've read 20 times over!

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.455
Maybe there's
a new chapter.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:35.455
What?

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.758
What chapter
do you mean?

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:38.959
Make a move

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.128
and you'll find out,
ya quack!

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.296
Trash talk--

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.064
the crutch
of the unsophisticated.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.900
But I shall let my cards
do all the talking.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.268
By discarding a Helixx monster

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.404
I can summon
Helixx Marmotroll!

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.772
(growling)

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:54.408
I didn't think
he'd troll me literally.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.777
Once per turn,
Marmotroll's special ability

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:59.580
reduces the battle damage
I take to zero.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:02.182
So that means even
your most brutal pounding

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.785
won't leave me with
the tiniest bruise.

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:06.320
You sure about
that, pal?

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:07.788

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:10.524
Oh, very sure,
but please, give it a try.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:11.825
I am so gonna enjoy

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.894
pinning the tail
on this donkey!

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.129
My turn!

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:16.463
♪♪♪

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:20.567
I summon Gouki Suprex!

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.604
And when Suprex
steps into the ring,

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.939
I'm allowed to summon
another

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:26.607
Gouki from my hand!

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.877
Slither on out,
Gouki Twistcobra!

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.013

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:35.215
And next, this monster's
gonna be joinin'

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:37.551
my tag team
to form a triple threat!

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.687
By sending Gouki Riscorpio

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.656
from my hand
to the graveyard...

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.391
I can summon my Gouki Headbatt

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.694
to the field
in defense mode!

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.295
Come on out!

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.700
And its special ability
gives Gouki Suprex

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.803
800 more
attack points--

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.437
not that I need it!

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.006
Because...

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.609
I'm mashing up
my circuit!

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:04.745
Here it comes,
people!

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.579
He's Link Summoning!

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.249
The summoning
conditions require

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.584
at least two Gouki Monsters.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.921
So I set Gouki Headbatt,
Twistcobra, and Suprex

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.755
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.058
Get to it, Goukis!

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.460
I Link Summon!

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:24.197
Link 3
Gouki Thunder Ogre!

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:28.569
Whoa!

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.604
We've never seen
that monster before!

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.040
Gore's stepping up his game!

00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:35.842
For every Gouki I used
to Link Summon,

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.211
I get to draw
another Gouki card!

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:42.616
That totals up to three new
cards, if you're countin'!

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.284
Yes, yes.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.754
I've expected every single
one of those moves.

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.356
But you won't be
able to predict

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.191
what's comin' next!

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.593
(Manager)
Dr. Genome
doesn't realize that

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:55.729
George is willing to do anything
to save Mackendrick,

00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:58.899
even it if means
getting his hands dirty.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.803
I activate the spell
Gouki Dark Mask!

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:05.172
I equip the spell
Gouki Dark Mask

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.640
on my Thunder Ogre,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.576
unleashing
its inner rage

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:11.912
and transforming it into
Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.847
(snarling)

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.449
This mask just unleashed

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.319
the uncontrollable
in my monster!

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:20.754
So even I'm scared
what it's gonna do to ya!

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:23.623
<i>When I duel, there's
a line I never cross.</i>

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:25.925
<i>But for you, I'm making
an exception!</i>

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.528
'Cause you
crossed the line first

00:05:27.595 --> 00:05:29.330
by deletin' Mack!

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.832
So if you're playin'
no holds barred...

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:33.701
(grunting)

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.170
... you ain't dealin'
with Gore no more.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.605
You're facin' Grim Gore!

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.141
And Grim Gore's
all about servin' up

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.476
a heap of defeat!

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.449
I'll crush
the vowel out of you

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.784
and squish you
into a gnome!

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:51.919
(gasping)

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.687
Gore made a heel turn!

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.356
(Ai)
Why's everyone
freakin' out over a mask?

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:59.459
I mean, it does make him
more handsome, but...

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.460
It's a symbol,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.362
that he's changing up
his dueling style.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.597
That's right.

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:04.597
In wrestling lingo,

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.566
Gore went and turned
into a "heel."

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.701
Unlike a "face"

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.703
who plays things all
fair and square,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.206
a "heel" isn't above
pushin' the boundaries.

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:13.707
I hope you're wearing
a parachute,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.009
'cause you're about
to crash outta this duel!

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.511
Such intimidating words.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.013
You're just trying
to scare me, I see.

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:21.849
You won't be
seein' nothin'!

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.584
Not after I activate
my spell

00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:25.518
Gouki Poison Mist!

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.192
(whimpering)

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:34.528
Right in my ocular!

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.564
How can I duel
without my vision?

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:38.031
That's your problem.

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.233
You go figure
it out, crybaby.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.235
While you're busy

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:43.137
wipin' the goo
outta your eye duct,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.339
I'll be wipin' the floor
with ya when I use

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.509
Dark Thunder Ogre's
special ability to summon

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:51.711
Gouki Riscorpio
next to its link!

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.414
Go!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.215
Punish that puny punk!

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:03.590
Uh, okay.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.092
I'm not sure if that's
the move I would have made.

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:08.262
Why would he attack
with Riscorpio?

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:10.230
It has fewer
attack points.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:11.565
(Ai)
Humans!

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.303
There ain't
no gain without some pain!

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.306
Dark Thunder Ogre's
ability activates!

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.975
Since a monster
that it was linked to was

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:23.710
just destroyed in battle,

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:26.246
it gains 400 more
attack points.

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:29.583
(growling)

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.385
(Ai)
So that's why he attacked.

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:32.553
Pretty good play.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:34.588
Now Gore's Thunder Ogre
has the same number

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:36.323
of attack
points as Genome's.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.158
Yeah, that's true.

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:40.761
But I doubt that
he's stopping here.

00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:44.264
Since Dark Thunder Ogre
used its special ability,

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.166
it's allowed to fire
500 points

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.069
of damage
straight at you!

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:50.604
Go, Ultimo Thunder!

00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:58.745
(whimpering)

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.820
(Ai)
I kinda like this Grim Gore.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:08.822
Does that make me a bad guy?

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:11.525
Well, it certainly doesn't
make you a good guy.

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.194
Since my Gouki Riscorpio
took a head dive

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:15.662
straight into
the graveyard,

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.197
I can add a Gouki card

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.999
straight from
my deck to my hand!

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.000
(Genome cackling)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.702
That ability, eh?

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:22.936
Well now, Gore,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.138
I believe I've seen
that same move before,

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:26.806
in one of your
previous duels.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.808
Am I correct?

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.808
Yeah?

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.310
So what, Genome?

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.147
I do cutting-edge
genetic research.

00:08:33.147 --> 00:08:36.150
DNA from great duelists
fuel my experiments.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.286
Of course, Playmaker's
DNA tops my wish list!

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.789
<i>I just find it
so utterly fascinating</i>

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:43.290
<i>that for someone
who supposedly</i>

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:44.691
<i>made a big change,</i>

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.827
<i>you would still use
the same moves.</i>

00:08:46.827 --> 00:08:48.796
<i>As if you can't
change your true essence,</i>

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.563
<i>your dueling DNA.</i>

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.499
You mean the moves
that got you scared?

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.701
Oh, do they?

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:55.135
Or does it only
appear that way,

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.638
similar to how you appear
to be a different duelist.

00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:59.940
That's just vocabulary.

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:03.710
Genome, I won't let your
words mess up my game!

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.846
'Cause I got
me a new skill!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.182
Rising Rage lets me
resurrect my Gouki

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:10.684
that was destroyed
in battle this turn!

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:14.521
Riscorpio's attackin'
Helixx Marmotroll again,

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:17.557
with a lil' help from
Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:20.727
(grunting)

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:30.103
(Ai)
I'd hate to be thrown
so hard that I get...

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.772
But that means
Dark Thunder Ogre

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.207
powers up again.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:34.608
It's a savage
way to battle,

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.544
but I highly doubt Grim Gore
will lose any sleep.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.715
Dark Thunder Ogre gains
another 400 attack points!

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:44.885
(groaning)

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.219
(Grim Gore)
And zaps you again!

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:48.188
Ultimo Thunder!

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:02.236
Looks like this duel's
gettin' to ya, bub.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.371
So if ya wanna play
hide-and-seek instead,

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:06.873
ready or not,
here I come!

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:13.013
Found ya!

00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:22.723
What a blow!

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.725
That had to have been
the flashest attack ever!

00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:30.564
You may have destroyed
Marmotroll,

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.800
but I didn't take
any battle damage.

00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:34.534
Well, I'm glad,
'cause that means I get

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.703
a ton more chances
to wail on ya.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:39.040
You actually think
you're winning this duel.

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:41.075
As if I didn't expect
this very situation.

00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:42.576
It's quite hilarious.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:43.710
Let's see if
you're still laughin'

00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:46.279
when you're a crack
in the pavement!

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:52.719
♪♪♪

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:54.121
As a man of science,

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.357
I am quite curious
about something.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.557
Do you really
believe that mask

00:10:57.557 --> 00:10:59.259
makes you a different
duelist?

00:10:59.293 --> 00:11:01.528
It's not just
the mask, egghead.

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:04.131
It's all of the days
that led to the mask.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.033
(Grim Gore)
After my duel
against Playmaker--

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.737
I mean my loss against
Playmaker--

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.571
the only ones
left to cheer for me

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:14.274
were those rug rats
at the orphanage.

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:16.443
And that was
enough for me.

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:17.811
Or it should've been.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.114
But Playmaker
was their hero.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.782
He was everyone's hero.

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:24.418
Heck,
he was my hero.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:25.786
But you're not
a true duelist

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:27.921
unless you wanna
beat your heroes.

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:30.424
So I studied every duel
he ever fought.

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:32.592
And I realized
that my style of dueling

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:34.361
wasn't cuttin'
it no more.

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:36.830
That I would never
defeat Playmaker.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.133
I think my dueling days
are done.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.668
Now, don't be hasty.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.770
I know that you honed
your techniques

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.605
over many long years,

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:47.607
but how about taking a fresh
approach to dueling?

00:11:47.607 --> 00:11:48.975
Not a tweak
here and there

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:51.778
but a whole new style
you've never done before?

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.916
You mean...
start from scratch?

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.418
So this ain't
the old Gore!

00:11:58.452 --> 00:11:59.820
That Gore's gone.

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:02.156
He took the bus
to Bye-byeville!

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.658
Now I'm all refocused
on winning.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.493
'Cause everybody
loves a winner!

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:08.995
And Grim Gore
is nothin' but a winner!

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:12.699
(MC)
This is one doozie
of a duel, folks,

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.035
and it's only gonna
get doozier!

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.905
(Ai)
He changed because
of you, Playmaker?

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:20.341
This guy would never do that.

00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:22.843
There's never anything wrong
with evolving your methods

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:25.012
and taking your
dueling in a new direction.

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:26.313
I mean, I've had
to simplify things

00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:27.815
and slow down my play
at times

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:29.550
in order for
you to keep up, Ai.

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:30.684
(snickering)

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:32.153
You think you've
changed?

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:33.420
Huh?

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:36.223
You said you're starting from
scratch, but that's not true.

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:37.858
Why, just last turn

00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:40.494
I saw that you made
the exact same move

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:43.030
that you used in your duel
against Playmaker.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.199
You're still hanging
on to old techniques.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:46.433
So despite that mask,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.834
you're the same
ol' Gore.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.870
Because a person
can't truly change.

00:12:49.903 --> 00:12:51.905
No matter how hard
they pretend.

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:52.906
Am I right?

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.308
No, you're wrong!

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.509
I'm nothing
like I was before!

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.745
I'm a winner!

00:12:57.811 --> 00:13:00.014
You are who
your DNA says you are,

00:13:00.014 --> 00:13:02.215
and it says you're
a loser!

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:03.984
It's my turn!

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.918
I draw!

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.055
I activate the spell card

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:10.724
Graveyard Incubation
from my hand!

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:14.761
I resurrect two Marmotrolls
from my graveyard,

00:13:14.795 --> 00:13:16.263
but they lose
their abilities

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:18.431
and all of their
attack points.

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:20.301
Oh well, that's
no concern of mine!

00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:21.568
(cackling)

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:30.444
Because I'm using these
two to Link Summon!

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.612
The summoning conditions

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.780
require two
Helixx monsters,

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.916
which is exactly
what I have!

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:42.056
I Link Summon!

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:45.593
Link 2,
Helixx Gothiclone!

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:46.826
(growling)

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.263
(MC)
Whoa!

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:51.565
The doc summoned a...
whole lot of nothin'?

00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:53.234
It has no attack points.

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:56.069
And now that I have
a Link Monster on my field,

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:59.706
I'm allowed to automatically
summon Helixx Dreadrat.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.376
Then I place
one card facedown.

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:05.845
Gothiclone, attack
Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.317
(Ai)
He's also attacking with
a weaker monster?

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:11.652
Is this a thing?

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:14.288
It's a little thing we
humans call strategy, Ai.

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.956
You blundered it up.

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:19.126
Dark Thunder Ogre,
destroy that clone!

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.661
(Genome)
Nuh-uh-uh.

00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:22.796
Gothiclone's attack points
become the same

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.898
as the monster
it's battling.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.801
So they're both toast?

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:29.469
(snickering)

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.039
Incorrect again,
my dear simpleton.

00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:33.607
Once per turn,

00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:36.477
Gothiclone can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:37.477
Oh yeah?

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:38.845
Once per turn
Thunder Ogre

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.780
can't be destroyed
in battle either!

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:43.116
So who's
the simpleton now?

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:50.991
Ooh, boy!

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:53.393
They're both down
for the count!

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:57.164
(chuckling)

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.999
Now where oh where
have I witnessed

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.101
a double
knockdown before?

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.537
Ah yes!

00:15:03.571 --> 00:15:06.340
In your duel against
Playmaker!

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:08.408
Further proof
that that mask

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:09.543
cannot hide the fact that

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:11.878
you're still the same
ol' pathetic Gore.

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:16.583
And your dueling DNA
is inferior to mine!

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:19.253
You failed to see
that my Gothiclone

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:20.721
has another ability.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.056
It can tribute a monster
that's next to its link,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.725
and then I can deal
you damage

00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:27.261
equal to its attack points!

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:31.398
So take 1,200 points
of damage, Grimmy Gore!

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.707
You're quite lucky it didn't
go and break the skin.

00:15:39.707 --> 00:15:41.441
With that I end my turn,

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:42.610
and Gothiclone's
attack points

00:15:42.677 --> 00:15:44.377
drop back to nil.

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:47.113
Heh!
Pathetic!

00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:50.184
It's my turn!

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:51.852
Ya know what, Genome?

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:53.887
Our DNA
does say who we are.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.356
But guess what, ya quack,
you're only half right.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.393
Ya see, 'cause our
DNA isn't everything!

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:00.827
How I grew up,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.663
all the struggles
I had to face--

00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:04.298
<i>and how I overcame them--</i>

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:05.933
<i>that tells me more
of who I am</i>

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.635
<i>than those three letters!</i>

00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:09.937
And I'm about
to prove it to ya!

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.906
Good luck.

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:15.742
I'll start by summoning
Gouki Riscorpio from my hand!

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:21.081
Then Dark Thunder Ogre
flexes its pecs

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:23.950
to let me summon another
Gouki next to its link!

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:27.321
Gouki Twistcobra's
joinin' my squad!

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:30.624
And it's usin' its special
ability to tribute Riscorpio

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:31.791
and add its attack points

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:33.794
to another
one of my monsters!

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:36.530
My Dark Thunder Ogre
was already mighty tough,

00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:37.931
but now it's even tougher,

00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:40.033
which is mighty
bad news for you!

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:42.168
Now power up those
attack points,

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:43.770
Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:49.343
Scary.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:51.011
But that ain't
the last of it!

00:16:51.078 --> 00:16:53.614
When Riscorpio heads
to the graveyard...

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:56.617
I'm allowed to draw one
Gouki card from my deck.

00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:58.785
I activate this spell

00:16:58.785 --> 00:17:01.355
and hit ya with
Gouki Serpent Slash!

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:03.223
You take damage equal
to the difference

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.825
between Thunder Ogre's
current attack points

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.861
and its original
attack points!

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:08.828
Huh...

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:12.199
(growling)

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:13.667
(Ai)
Wait, that's...

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.137
carry the one...
3,100 points!

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.505
Which is more points
than Genome's got.

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:20.374
Seems Gore
pulled it off.

00:17:20.407 --> 00:17:22.476
Go, Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.377
Pin him for
the three count!

00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:29.216
(Grim Gore)
Dark Thunder Ogre,

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:31.685
pin him for the three count!

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:34.354
You actually think
you're going to win?

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.256
Why wouldn't I?

00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:39.159
For every move you make,
I have a counter move!

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:42.829
My trap Regeneration Cure
lowers your damage to nil!

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:51.205
(Ai)
Well, GG couldn't
get that GG.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:53.840
You shouldn't abbreviate
Gore's chances, Ai.

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:57.177
Then Gore better
think of something ASAP.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.246
Regeneration's Cure
additional effect

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:01.214
lets me summon
a Helixx Token

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:02.949
in defense mode!

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:07.654
There's nothing more
I can do but end my turn.

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:10.457
(AI)
By doing so, Dark Thunder Ogre's

00:18:10.491 --> 00:18:12.459
attack points return to 3,000.

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.428
This sure ain't
lookin' good for Gore.

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:17.564
(Ai)
You can even say
it's looking "grim."

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:18.766
Get it?

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:19.766
I'll be here all night.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.569
I'll draw a card.

00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:23.070
Let's see...

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.873
I activate Dreadrat's
special ability

00:18:25.906 --> 00:18:28.608
to resummon
it from my graveyard!

00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:30.911
Good luck.

00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:37.317
Watch as I unlock
my monsters' true potential!

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:42.789
I require two Helixx
monsters to Link Summon,

00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:45.626
so I set my Helixx Token
and Helixx Dreadrat

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:47.427
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.663
Link the circuit!

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.801
Witness genetic perfection!

00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:02.309
Link 2 Helixx
Necro Darwin!

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:07.314
When our Link Monsters
are linked to each other,

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.650
you are not permitted to attack
my Necro Darwin!

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.152
(Grim Gore)
No way!

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:14.854
I'm also required
to banish my Dreadrat,

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.023
not that I care.

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:19.159
It has served its purpose
perfectly for me.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.796
Now then, with my
masterpiece produced,

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:23.864
I can toss that lab rat
out with the rest

00:19:23.897 --> 00:19:26.834
of the failed experiments
and biotech detritus.

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.168
The same way
I'm tossing all your

00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:30.104
monsters in the garbage heap!

00:19:30.137 --> 00:19:34.207
Necro Darwin,
atomize his Gouki Twistcobra!

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.982
My Twistcobra
may be a goner,

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:44.051
but it ain't
goin' down quietly!

00:19:44.118 --> 00:19:47.220
Its ability lets me draw
a Gouki from my deck!

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:49.724
But that's not all,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.059
'cause you see
Twistcobra then energizes

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:53.460
my Dark Thunder Ogre

00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:55.629
with 400 more
attack points!

00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:57.898
And I finish off
the combo by zappin' ya

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:00.067
for 400 more points
of damage!

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:02.302
Ultimo Thunder!

00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:05.139
That's not gonna work.

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.007
Not anymore!

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:10.377
Darwin, if you would please
cancel out this damage?

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:14.348
And then Darwin's
attack points double

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.317
until the end of this turn.

00:20:16.317 --> 00:20:19.352
A turn which I'll
make sure is your last!

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:25.892
Helixx Gothiclone,
rematch Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:20:26.493 --> 00:20:27.727
But first,

00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:31.164
raise your attack points
to equal his!

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:33.734
And remember
that once per turn,

00:20:33.801 --> 00:20:36.336
Gothiclone can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.205
Well, you remember
that goes the same

00:20:38.272 --> 00:20:40.440
for my Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.882
Whoa!

00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:51.017
They hit the replay button
for KO part two!

00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:52.018
No.

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:53.387
No replay.

00:20:53.454 --> 00:20:55.388
Not with Gothiclone's
ability!

00:20:57.691 --> 00:20:59.526
(growling)

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.794
By tributing the monster

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:02.729
that's linked
to Helixx Gothiclone,

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:05.633
you take damage equal
to its attack points!

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:08.368
All 3,600
of Necro Darwin's,

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:09.603
more than enough to erase

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.605
every one of your
life points!

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.373
(Ai)
Aww, glitch!

00:21:13.406 --> 00:21:16.377
Gore's gonna lose and I'll
have to pay up on his bet!

00:21:16.377 --> 00:21:17.911
You remember, right?

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:21.882
The one where he'll reveal
Playmaker's secret identity?

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:25.118
Maybe you oughta put on a wig
and glasses already.

00:21:26.253 --> 00:21:27.221
It ain't over yet,

00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:30.691
'cause I'm discarding
Gouki Octostretch!

00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:33.560
It cuts any of
the damage I take in half!

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.631
(groaning)

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:45.272
He's still alive
but, like, barely.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.707
Yusaku?

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:55.849
♪♪♪
