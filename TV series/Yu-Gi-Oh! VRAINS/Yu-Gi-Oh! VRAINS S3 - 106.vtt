WEBVTT

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.288
(Blue Maiden)
They're moving into position,
Akira.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.824
(Zaizen)
Good. Now listen, everyone!

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.495
We don't know which corridor
Ai will attack, so stay alert.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.967
Those meatbags don't
want us to reach Zaizen.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.669
They have the entire place
sealed up

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.304
tighter than a paint can.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.606
So do you really think
we can get past ‘em?

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.409
After all, master,
there are 12 o' them

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.843
and only two of us.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:44.978
Hmm.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:49.316
In a duel it's not quantity
that counts, but quality.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.350
Quality?

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:51.751
What do ya mean?

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.855
I ranked all our duelists from
the strongest to the weakest,

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.756
with the crème de
la creme at the top

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.360
and the sour de la
sour at the bottom.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:02.730
I think, ya forgot to put
Playmaker on the chart.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:05.866
(Ai)
Oh, he's there...
livin' in the basement.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:06.733
What?

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.668
But I thought he
was one o' the best.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.137
He was one of the best,

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.406
back when he was
teamed up with the bestest.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.242
The guy waaaaay up there!

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:18.812
Wow, that's off the charts!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.715
Yeah,
because I am off the charts.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.350
You are the master!

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.352
(Ai)
I put you on the chart, too.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.019
Huh?

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.855
Am I up there with you?

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.689
(Ai)
Mmmm, not exactly...

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:31.658
Whaaat?

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:32.927
Way down there?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.063
Yes, of course,
because you haven't dueled yet.

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:38.031
But you can move up quick.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.533
Really? How?

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.702
It's as easy as 1-2-3.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.204
You just have to beat all
the high-ranked opponents

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.573
that you face today.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.542
Do that and you'll shoot
straight up the pyramid!

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:49.843
Then watch out!

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:52.379
I'm gonna mop
the floor with ‘em!

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:53.881
That's the spirit!

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:56.416
Now let's go show
‘em what you can do!

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.624
♪

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:05.819
They're here!

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:06.853
(Blue Maiden)
This is it!

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:09.022
(Zaizen)
Playmaker! Soulburner! Varis!

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.524
They're heading your way!

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.392
(Playmaker)
Got it! We're moving in!

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.063
(Zaizen gasps)
They split into three!

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:18.699
(Soulburner)
Three of ‘em?

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.801
But I thought we just had to
worry about Ai and Roboppi.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:23.603
The more the better,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.772
because then there's more
of them for me to defeat.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:36.683
Ai!

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:38.451
(laughs mockingly)

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:41.955
I found Ai.
I'm in pursuit!

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.694
Hey, Playmaker!

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.128
Ya look smaller!

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.731
Ai! Why are you fighting us?

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:54.502
After we worked hard so that
humans and Ai's could co-exist!

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.704
Yeah, we did, didn't we?

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:59.773
But since then I learned that
we made a huge mistake--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.577
because it turns out that
Lightning was right all along.

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:05.612
Lightning was right?

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:07.581
You must be joking!

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:08.682
You were there Ai,

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.285
you know that everything
he did was to trick you!

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:14.087
Why would you ever want
to follow in his footsteps?

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.423
Why? For one reason:

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:19.292
Under his lies there
was something true.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.694
The truth is,

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.597
me and you meatbags
aren't meant to be buds.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.299
You're wrong.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.767
What would Flame and Aqua think
if they were here right now?

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.003
I don't know what they'd think.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.708
They're both gone,
so I'm the last Ignis.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:38.278
And the only way to ensure we
don't go extinct is to wipe out

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:39.513
you meatbags.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.580
Ai...

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.584
What's goin' on?

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:45.919
There's three of it!

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:47.854
How is that possible?

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:48.788
Huh?

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:52.359
(Ai)
Time to duel at last!

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.362
All right, Soulburner,
are you ready to duel?

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.598
Without Flame to help you,

00:04:57.898 --> 00:04:59.967
you don't stand a
chance against me.

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:02.736
Listen--I don't want
to have to duel you, Ai.

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:04.605
And if Flame were here with me,

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.941
I know he wouldn't
want to duel you either.

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.609
Except you don't have
any choice, do you?

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.812
If you want to keep on existing.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.247
(grunts)

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.284
Hello, Varis.

00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:19.953
I bet I'm not gonna
have to twist your arm

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.455
to convince you to duel me.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:25.425
Then you are not mistaken,
because I am eager to duel you.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:30.631
In that case, enjoy it while
it lasts cuz it won't last long.

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.599
Which Ai is the real Ai?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.003
For now, they have to
assume that they're all real.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.104
Be careful!

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.406
And don't let your guard down!

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.774
Right.

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.009
Obviously.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.012
Ai, I don't want to duel you,
but I will if I must.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.250
And while I'm at it,

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:52.987
I'll show you the
error of your ways!

00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:55.689
You can try, but you'll fail.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.192
(all)
Let's duel!

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:05.098
(all)
Let's duel!

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.669
They've started.

00:06:08.802 --> 00:06:10.036
Indeed.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.706
I'll go first, Playmaker.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.810
I activate the Field Spell
IGNISTER A.I.LAND *!

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.680
When I don't have any monsters
in my Main Monster Zone,

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.217
an @IGNISTER can be
summoned from my hand

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.019
if it's Level is 4 or lower.

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:28.221
Come on out, ACHICHI @IGNISTER!

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.025
And I'm going to use
it to Link Summon!

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.861
Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:40.534
And then I can use IGNISTER
A.I.LAND's effect again

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.470
to summon DOYON @IGNISTER!

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:46.040
Then DOYON's own ability

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:49.075
lets me retrieve ACHICHI
from my graveyard.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:51.745
Which I'll immediately summon.

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.917
Next, I set ACHICHI,

00:06:57.017 --> 00:07:00.220
DOYON and LINGURIBOH
in the Link Arrows!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.289
I Link Summon!

00:07:02.423 --> 00:07:05.725
Link 3 FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:12.399
They're all the same.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:14.168
Those three Ai's
don't just look alike,

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.436
they're dueling
exactly alike, too!

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:18.038
What?

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:19.406
(Ai)
Just ta let you know,

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.642
my FIRE PHOENIX
is tougher to get rid of

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.277
than a case o' the hiccups

00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:25.712
cuz when an effect
or ability destroys it,

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:27.881
I get to resummon
it on the next turn,

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:31.151
and oh, I also get to destroy
one of your monsters!

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:33.820
But that's just the appetizer.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.322
Here's the main course!

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:39.125
I activate A.I. A.I. WALL
and use it on FIRE PHOENIX!

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:41.628
(groans)

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.563
What's this?

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:46.099
That may look
like a bunch o' Ai's

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.668
playin' Ring Around the Enemy,

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:51.138
but contrary to appearances,
this spell is no game!

00:07:51.238 --> 00:07:54.208
For every Link Arrow
that FIRE PHOENIX has,

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.109
A.I. A.I. WALL gains a counter.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.580
And as long as there's a single
counter on this card,

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.316
neither you nor I
are allowed to attack.

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:05.486
At least temporarily.

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:07.955
You see, A.I. A.I. WALL
loses one counter

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.823
at the end of each of our turns.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.126
So we can't attack
for three turns.

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:15.462
Yes theoretically,
but there is a catch.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.799
Every time a Link Monster is
summoned on your field,

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.168
A.I. A.I. WALL gains
another counter.

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.036
And that'll extend the time.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:26.173
So you're hopin' to drag
this duel out forever, huh?

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.375
It's stalling for time...

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.979
keeping us busy while
it carries out its real plan!

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:34.347
That's some great
detective work!

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.216
Great but late.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:38.852
(Kolter)
Two new blips on the radar!

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:40.820
Is that the real Ai?

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.990
It is indeed!

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:46.326
And the three of
us are Ai's decoys.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.394
(grunts)

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.868
Heh. Two down.

00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:56.036
(gasps)

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.438
Baira and Genome are gone!

00:08:58.505 --> 00:08:59.806
It's over?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.207
So fast?

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:05.379
Now, I have a clear path
leading straight to Zaizen!

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:07.080
(Faust)
Think again, Ignis!

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.116
Your journey ends here.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:12.386
No matter what it takes,
I will delete you!

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.055
Oh yeah?
Then prove it, meatbag.

00:09:20.628 --> 00:09:24.064
Master's gonna beat everybody
before I get a chance to duel!

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:27.400
I gotta find somebody to
duel so I can rank up quick.

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.205
(The Shepherd)
Or we can find you!

00:09:31.372 --> 00:09:32.105
(grunts)

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:35.009
Hold it, squirt!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.911
Whoa, my first duel is gonna
be against The Shepherd

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:39.112
and Gore Gal?

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:40.547
Not if you back down.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:42.283
(Pandor)
Caution is advised.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.385
I possess no dueling
data for this Roboppi.

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:46.753
Well, hello!

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:48.889
Who's that teeny
tiny fella ya got there?

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.424
I'm no fella.

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:52.126
My name is Pandor.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:54.528
I'm an anti-Ignis AI.

00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:59.700
Then that's a lucky thing
for me, ‘cuz I'm not an Ignis!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.835
Now I'm takin' on both o' you
together,

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:03.937
so c'mon and let's get dueling!

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:05.705
Do you seriously think

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.675
you can duel the
two of us at once?

00:10:07.742 --> 00:10:09.209
That's insulting.

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.177
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.379
Do me a favor and
save the hurt feelings

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.415
till we end this and
chase down Ai.

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:14.948
(scoffs)

00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:15.883
Fine.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.051
Cool!
My first duel ever!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.286
It's gonna be so awesome!

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.888
(all)
Let's duel!

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.398
I'll let you choose whether
you wanna go first or second.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.201
Aw, aren't you the sweetest.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.069
Oh oh oh oh!

00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:39.607
I also promise I won't use
my Skill during our duel!

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:40.674
(both)
Huh?

00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:42.909
But the both o'
you can feel free

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:44.578
to use your Skills if ya wanna.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:45.546
Really?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.881
You're that confident,
are you, hon?

00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:49.182
No no no!

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:51.551
It's just if I wanna
rank up quicker,

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:54.855
then I have to make this duel
as hard for me as possible!

00:10:55.056 --> 00:10:57.057
You were already
way out of your league

00:10:57.191 --> 00:10:58.959
before you hamstrung yourself.

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.696
But you just sealed
your own demise!

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.006
Mind if I go first?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.608
Hey, yeah I do!

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.344
Well, at least he asked.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.848
I'll start by summoning
DUPLICATE DRONE from my hand.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.656
Next, I activate DUPLICATE
DRONE's special ability.

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:32.793
When I already have one
DUPLICATE DRONE in play,

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.528
I can summon a second
copy from my hand.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.200
I also get to summon
SCUD DRONE from my hand

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.636
as long as I have
another DRONE monster

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:44.438
already on my field.

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.640
And I'll use it to Link Summon!

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.946
Link 1 BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT!

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:59.086
I'll use my remaining two DRONES

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:00.687
to Link Summon again!

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:03.657
Link 2 BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.327
But I'm not stopping here!

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.000
I set BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT
and WARRANT in the Link Arrows!!

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.405
I Link Summon!

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.741
Link 3 BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:25.746
(gasps) Awesome!

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:28.916
That's like a really
really cool monster!

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.753
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:36.257
And that triggers
BATTLEDRONE's special ability.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.991
At the end of my turn,

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:41.195
if I have no monsters in
my Main Monster Zone,

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:44.331
BATTLEDRONE resurrects
itself from my graveyard.

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.301
It's your turn.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:48.335
Finally!

00:12:48.736 --> 00:12:50.036
Here I go!

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:52.472
I draw!

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:55.976
I summon APPLIANCER
SOCKETROLL in attack mode!

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:58.412
(squeals)

00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:01.081
And when I have a
SOCKETROLL on my field,

00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:03.717
I get to summon a second
APPLIANCER SOCKETROLL

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.219
from my hand,
so that's just what I'll do!

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.557
And should I bring out
another buddy of yours?

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.725
(squeals)

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.560
Okay then, my lil' friend,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.062
I guess I'll have to make
your wish come true!

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.065
When I summon a
second SOCKETROLL,

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:20.767
I get to summon a third
SOCKETROLL from my deck!!

00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:22.936
(squealing)

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:26.106
Getting three monsters on your
first turn is pretty impressive.

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:28.542
If you think that's cool,
watch this!

00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:30.310
Here I go!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.646
Time to plug in my circuit!

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:37.651
The summoning conditions
require two Level 1 APPLIANCERS!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.055
I Link Summon!

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:45.926
Link 2 APPLIANCER CELTOPUS!

00:13:48.729 --> 00:13:50.297
That was pretty fun!

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:51.432
(squeals)

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.400
So I wanna do it again!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.269
But this time, I Link Summon

00:13:55.369 --> 00:13:58.738
Link 1 APPLIANCER
VACCULEPHANT!

00:13:59.974 --> 00:14:01.842
My APPLIANCERS
help each other out

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:04.378
cuz when my CELTOPUS
is linked to another monster,

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.780
you can't target it
for effects or attacks!

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:11.051
And as for my other APPLIANCER,

00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:14.020
when my VACCULEPHANT's
linked up with my CELTOPUS

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:16.623
I get to destroy one
of your monsters!

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:19.626
Vacuum up BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:22.028
You wish!

00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:25.299
I activate the trap
CAMOUFLAGE DRONE!

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:27.968
As long as this
card is on the field,

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.004
my DRONES aren't affected
by your special abilities

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:33.040
nor can they be
destroyed in battle!

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:35.342
So go sniff somewhere else!

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.844
Aww, I thought I had ya.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:39.613
Whatevs!

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.183
I activate the spell
APPLIANCER REUSE!

00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:46.854
It restores an APPLIANCER
from my graveyard

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:48.688
so that I can use it again!

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:51.025
Say hi again to SOCKETROLL!

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:54.861
Then say bye cuz I'm
using it to Link Summon

00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:58.164
Link 1 APPLIANCER PROPELION!

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.568
(growls)

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:08.041
I play one card facedown.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:12.179
And then, my VACCULEPHANT's
gonna attack your plane!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.583
(The Shepherd)
You're making mistakes
worse than an amateur.

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:19.452
My “plane ” has more attack
points than your VACCULEPHANT.

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:22.389
Are you always
this super grumpy?

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:24.758
Or are you just mad
cuz you're wrong?

00:15:24.858 --> 00:15:27.428
When a monster that's
co-linked to CELTOPUS battles,

00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.797
CELTOPUS gives
it 1000 attack points

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.299
for every monster
it's co-linked to!

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:33.200
No!

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.735
(Roboppi)
“No? ” Uh uh!

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:35.669
Yeah!

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:39.907
3000 attack points!

00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:43.209
That's bad, but I can
take some of the edge off.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.714
I activate my Skill!
Drone Force!

00:15:46.781 --> 00:15:49.716
For every DRONE
that's in my graveyard,

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.585
your monster loses
200 attack points,

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:56.090
and my Link Monster
gains those points

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:58.092
until the end of the turn.

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:00.961
(Pandor)
There are four
DRONES in the graveyard.

00:16:01.095 --> 00:16:04.298
So your VACCULEPHANT
loses 800 attack points

00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:07.100
while BATTLEDRAONE
WARRANT gains 800.

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.136
You made my monster weaker,

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.738
but ya can't stop it
from havin' a blast!

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:14.441
(growls)

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.413
(growls)

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:24.684
(grunts)

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:25.853
Are you okay?

00:16:25.953 --> 00:16:28.355
Yeah. It barely stung.

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.591
But it did sting right?

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:32.092
Now that the attack's over,

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:35.528
VACCULEPHANT's attack
points drop back down to 200.

00:16:35.628 --> 00:16:38.999
Now it's my PROPELION's
turn to attack your Airplane!

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:42.602
And like last time,
CELTOPUS also gives PROPELION

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:44.938
2000 attack points!

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.643
(explosion roars)

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:51.244
(groans)

00:16:53.613 --> 00:16:55.849
That one so had to have stung!

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.318
Wish I could keep goin'

00:16:57.418 --> 00:16:59.786
but I ran outa monsters
to attack you with.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:04.992
Too bad but,
I guess my turn's done!

00:17:05.159 --> 00:17:08.161
When your turn is over,
my CAMOUFLAGE DRONE

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:09.930
is automatically destroyed.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.700
And my Skill ‘s effect
also comes to an end,

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:15.635
so your monster's attack
points return to normal.

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.473
So now it's your turn, Gore Gal.

00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:22.042
Take it away!

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:24.845
Next time let me go first.

00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:26.313
Don't rub it in.

00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:28.882
That “kid ” may look
all sweet and na ïve,

00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:31.651
but it's really a
sophisticated program.

00:17:31.985 --> 00:17:33.254
Wow whee!

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:36.189
Nobody's ever called
me sophisticated before!

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.059
My Master promised
he'd polish up my smarts

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:41.228
and that's exactly what he did!

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.596
He programmed me

00:17:42.696 --> 00:17:45.099
with everything he
knew about everything--

00:17:45.199 --> 00:17:47.334
and boy, did he open my eyes.

00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:49.970
You humans really
are something else!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.739
The whole world is a
huge mess because o' you--

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:55.509
and none o' you guys
ever took time to tidy up!

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:58.178
It's not too late to put
things back in order, though,

00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:00.914
if you all would just step
aside and let someone else

00:18:01.048 --> 00:18:02.382
take over the top job.

00:18:02.482 --> 00:18:03.617
Meaning you?

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:06.821
Nah, I'm talkin' about
my awesome Master!

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.489
Just like he fixed me up great,

00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:10.324
he can do the same
for the whole world,

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:13.461
and I'm helpin' him--
by sweepin' you away!

00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.729
You have us all wrong, Roboppi.

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:18.899
It's useless to try
reasoning with an appliance,

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:20.668
no matter how advanced it is.

00:18:20.768 --> 00:18:23.303
The only way to stop
it is to shut it down.

00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:25.439
Yeah I sorta kinda agree.

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:28.709
This blah, blah,
blah won't get us anywhere.

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:32.379
Let's go back to dueling ‘cuz
it's way more exciting and fun!

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.948
Okay, Roboppi.

00:18:35.382 --> 00:18:36.416
It's my turn.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.218
Draw!

00:18:38.318 --> 00:18:41.721
I'll start off by summoning
ALTERGEIST MARIONETTER!

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:47.260
Due to its special ability,
I can select an

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:50.831
ALTERGEIST trap card
from my deck and put it in play.

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:55.135
So I place ALTERGEIST HAUNTED
ROCK facedown on my field.

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.571
A haunted trap
card sounds scary,

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:59.440
but yours doesn't
scare me a bit.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.609
Since I know it's comin',
I can deal with it.

00:19:02.676 --> 00:19:04.478
Unless you don't have time to.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:09.049
This trap card is a special one
that I can activate immediately.

00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:11.685
So that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.786
Ha.

00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:13.854
(whines)

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:17.324
I have to discard one
ALTERGEIST from my hand.

00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.228
But then, whenever
I activate a trap card,

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:24.998
I get to summon ALTERGEIST
MULTIFAKER from my hand.

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:31.171
Now that I have two ALTERGEISTS,

00:19:31.538 --> 00:19:34.374
I'll use them...
to Link Summon!

00:19:39.313 --> 00:19:42.349
Link 2 ALTERGEIST HEXSTIA!

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.018
(growls)

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:49.990
With that,
a world of options opens up.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.694
First, it lets me retrieve
ALTERGEIST POOKUERY

00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:55.028
from my graveyard.

00:19:56.563 --> 00:20:00.467
Second, it triggers my
FIJIALERT's special ability!

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.971
It lets me summon my
FIJIALERT's next to my brother's

00:20:04.104 --> 00:20:05.639
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's link.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.608
(growls)

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:12.980
You don't mind if I use
your monster, do you?

00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:14.948
Yes. But go ahead.

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:15.883
Hm.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.219
My FIJIALERT's ability...

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:21.221
lets me transform one
Link Monster in play

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:22.989
into an ALTERGEIST!

00:20:23.156 --> 00:20:26.794
So BATTLEDRONE WARRANT
now counts as an ALTERGEIST!

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:29.496
Next, I'm going to Link Summon!

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.499
And I can use the
POOKUERY that's in my hand

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.502
to count for one of the monsters
required to Link Summon!

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.205
I'm creating a circuit..

00:20:38.806 --> 00:20:40.340
that links the known...

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:41.975
with the unknown!

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:47.481
The summoning conditions require
at least two ALTERGEISTS.

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.551
So I set POOKUERY, FIJIALERT's

00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:53.654
and the now-ALTERGEIST
BATTLEDRONE WARRANT

00:20:53.721 --> 00:20:55.356
in the Link Arrows!

00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:58.992
Manifesting from the
edge of nightmares!

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:00.561
I Link Summon!

00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:04.197
Link 4 ALTERGEIST MEMORYGANT!

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:08.869
But that's not all!

00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:12.205
When I summon a monster
next to HEXSTIA's link,

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:14.542
HEXSTIA gains its attack points!

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:17.544
MEMORYGANT
has 2800 attack points,

00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:20.547
so HEXSTIA powers up to 4300.

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:23.049
Whoa!

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.220
That's an awful big number of
attack points for one Monster!

00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:30.057
My chances aren't
lookin' too good right now.

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:33.193
You shouldn't have dueled
me and my brother at once.

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:36.062
Because together,
we're unstoppable!
