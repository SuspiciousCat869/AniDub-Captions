WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.304
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.108
(Ghost Gal)
People are getting zapped again!

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.010
Bohman is using
his Neuron Link

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.012
so that he can absorb
everyone's energy

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.147
in order to power his duel.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.984
We need to shut
this system down now.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.986
(Ai)
It's another Data Storm!

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:24.357
I use more humans to activate
Master Storm Access!

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.529
So you think you can sever
Bohman's Neuron Link

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.531
by pulling LINK VRAINS and
Mirror LINK VRAINS apart?

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.867
(Hanoi)
Yes, but only with your help.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.804
<i>It won't be easy,
but it's the only way.</i>

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.840
Unbelievable-- the Hanoi
actually expect me

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.676
to work with them,
after all they did?

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.477
Oh, lighten up, Akira.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.181
They just want our help
in stopping a common foe.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.649
Tell the Hanoi that
the plan is a go.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.486
(Playmaker)
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.789
Rise up,
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.192
(screeching)

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:00.895
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON's
ability activates!

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.596
By discarding three cards,

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:06.533
my DRAGON gains 1000
attack points per card.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.670
(Ai)
It's now stronger
than your DRAGRID.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.705
You said you prepared
for everything,

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:16.209
but it seems you didn't
prepare for this!

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.140
Stay alert everyone--
when Bohman activates its Skill,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.042
that's our chance
to strike.

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.046
That is correct, and we will
only have mere moments

00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:27.213
to try to separate
the two LINK VRAINS

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.982
and sever Bohman's
its Neuron Link.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:33.286
Let's hope our new
partners are up to the task.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.733
It's panic central
out there,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.702
and I'm sure that
it's only gonna get worse.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:50.937
Try not to focus on them,

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:55.075
focus on what we have
to do to save them.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.017
You really stepped in the
sauce this time, Bohman!

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.454
Our QUANTUM DRAGON is now
stronger than your DRAGRID!

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:09.156
Yes, but I do not
understand

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:12.193
how that is supposed
to concern me.

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:13.627
Huh?

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.695
You also summoned
that QUANTUM DRAGON

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.132
on your previous turn in an
attempt to destroy my DRAGRID.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.503
And I recall that it didn't
turn out so well for you.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.938
But that was then
and this is now!

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:28.308
And what makes you believe
that now is any better?

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.644
Since that turn, even as
we have been dueling,

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.780
I have used my
Neuron Link to continue

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.715
absorbing human minds.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:37.551
I have also been putting
those minds to work,

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.452
using them
to conceive of new

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:44.624
and different tactics to
use against you, Playmaker.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.661
You tried to outthink me
before but could not--

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.630
so logically it will be
impossible for you

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.200
to outthink me now.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.835
I know that
it won't be easy,

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.004
but I also know
nothing is impossible.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:59.440
But we know only
one of us can be right,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.576
so I'm gonna prove
you wrong!

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:08.082
If you think you can,
then go for it.

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:09.750
Ya know how I was
really confident

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.751
like forty seconds ago?

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.687
Well, that was before
I got to thinkin'--

00:04:13.687 --> 00:04:15.756
our attack is only gonna
work as long as Bohman

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.893
doesn't activate
his Skill again.

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:23.030
But with his Neuron Link,
you know he's gonna--

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.399
you just know he's gonna!

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.100
Ugh!

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.370
<i>Then perhaps the Hanoi
can be of assistance.</i>

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.008
<i>But don't respond, or you'll
attract Bohman's attention.</i>

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.911
<i>Since time is of
the essence, I'll be brief.</i>

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:38.746
<i>We are working with Zaizen
and Ghost Gal</i>

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:40.914
<i>to pull the two
Link VRAINS apart,</i>

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:42.750
<i>which will sever
Bohman's Neuron Link.</i>

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.718
<i>But this can only
be done the instant</i>

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.388
<i>it activates its Skill.</i>

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:51.792
<i>That will also be the optimal
moment for you to attack.</i>

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:54.094
<i>Get ready...</i>

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.933
I activate my Skill!

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.837
If you're gonna do
somethin', do it now!

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.410
(Klarissa) <i>Bohman
activated its Skill.</i>

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.747
Initiate the program now!
(laughing)

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:16.116
Initiating now.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.818
(Alec)
Zaizen, upload the virus!

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.986
(Zaizen)
Uploading!

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.331
Oh, come on!

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.333
The security system
blocked the virus

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.402
from launching automatically.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.172
So we're gonna have to
trigger it manually.

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.441
Let me handle it.

00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:44.177
After all, I did help
design the security system.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.151
Our attack from outside
LINK VRAINS

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.853
is at maximum strength.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:56.990
Let's hope the attack from
inside LINK VRAINS also works.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.525
(Bohman)
Something feels off.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:02.529
Someone's attempting to hack
their way into my system!

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.932
I see that it's
Zaizen and Ghost Gal!

00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.567
And the Knights of Hanoi!

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:09.703
(Ai)
Aw, glitch! Busted!

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:14.008
And with that,
the security system's clear!

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:16.543
Continue with the upload!

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.919
Watch out!

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:30.390
Emma, no!
Well, don't just sit there.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.728
You have a job to finish,
so finish it.

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:45.071
Now activating
the virus... go!

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.378
(Bohman)
Their plan was quite clever.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.882
But a plan is only
as good as its execution.

00:06:54.882 --> 00:06:58.185
And in this, your friends
failed, miserably.

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.888
Instead of breaking
my Neuron Link,

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:03.490
they both fell prey to it.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.729
The minds of Zaizen
and Ghost Gal now belong to me.

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:14.201
Zaizen, and Ghost Gal,
as well?

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.242
Despite all of the evidence,

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:24.244
you still thought
their plan could work?

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.117
Akira... I'm here.

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.619
Sky!

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:35.756
Were you foolishly
hoping for a miracle?

00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:37.157
(growling)

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.460
I wasn't hoping
for a miracle.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.729
I just believe
in my friends.

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.263
Playmaker!

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.999
Well, this time your
friends failed you.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.468
Watch, as I acquire
a new card

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.537
from the Data Storm!

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:56.143
Master Storm Access!

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.410
What's this?

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.480
Bohman's Skill
didn't activate.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.948
But I thought Bohman
stopped Zaizen

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:02.349
from workin' his plan!

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.684
Did your plan work?

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:07.320
I don't see how
without Zaizen's assistance.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.002
He did it.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.005
<i>Zaizen and Ghost Gal
severed the Neuron Link.</i>

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.608
<i>But it cost them dearly.</i>

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:33.213
Seems my friends
didn't fail.

00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:38.018
(Ai)
Uh, maybe Bohman
should lie down.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.854
This can't be!

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:48.295
You see that?
And you see that?

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:50.664
Ghosts!

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:52.032
Those aren't ghosts.

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.667
These are all people
who've been trapped

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.636
inside of Link VRAINS.

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:59.106
Well, they look
like ghosts to me!

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:01.274
The Neuron Link has been
taken out of commission!

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.778
Excellent,
now log out as many people

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:06.079
as you can, and do it now!

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.883
<i>Chief! It's working!</i>

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.718
<i>You did it!</i>

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.921
<i>Chief? Hello?</i>

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.924
<i>Zaizen? Zaizen!</i>

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.601
Playmaker, we can't
let Zaizen and Gore Gal

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.903
sacrifice themselves
for nothing!

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.706
We won't, we'll seize
the chance they gave us...

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:37.578
and attack with--
our DRAGON!

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:39.680
I still have one last move!

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.449
I activate CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID's

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:45.218
special ability!

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:48.054
Judgment Dice!

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.760
No way! It stopped on
the Light icon!

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.129
And that Attribute
doesn't help you.

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:56.730
Meaning you will be
unable to stop

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.099
our upcoming attack,
Bohman!

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:03.737
Make the play, Playmaker!

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:07.074
Attack!
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:10:07.074 --> 00:10:10.777
destroy CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID!

00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:18.952
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!
Clean his clock!

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.856
Pulsating Surge!

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.264
Oh yeah!
Bossed n' tossed!

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.268
Our life points
are now equal.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:38.072
You can call us
life point buddies!

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:41.242
(Bohman)
No, I don't think I will.

00:10:41.242 --> 00:10:43.243
Hey, Boss!
I think Playmaker's chances

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:45.279
are way better
than Bohman's now.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.548
Easy, there, listen up!

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:49.250
Winning's no sure thing.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.084
I'd say Playmaker's
chances of winning

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:57.190
are just over 100 percent.
[laughing]

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.194
But ya can't have more than
a hundred percent of anything!

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.529
I disagree with that
two hundred percent!

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:05.365
You two seem to feel
that this duel

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:07.434
has turned
in your favor,

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:11.137
but I assure you,
it has not.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:16.843
What's he doing?

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:23.417
Aw, glitch!

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:26.854
He mashed the two LINK
VRAINS back together again!

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:28.655
(Bohman)
Yes, thus allowing

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:32.292
my Neuron Link
to return to full strength.

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.662
You see, your bonds
of friendship

00:11:34.662 --> 00:11:36.697
may have
broken my Neuron Link,

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.132
but unlike your bonds,

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:41.968
mine are more than
capable of being restored.

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:43.837
And when they are
fully restored,

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:46.140
I will use them
to absorb more humans

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.976
and draw further
strength into me!

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.980
Our plan failed!

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.449
Is there really no way
to defeat this thing?

00:11:56.449 --> 00:12:01.856
Hmm, his Neuron Link
isn't fully juiced-up yet...

00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:05.725
And it never will be
while I'm on duty!

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:09.196
Ai, stop!

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:12.566
Hang tight, Playmaker,
I got this!

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.735
Ai, wait!
What are you doing?

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:17.004
I'm livin' large
and takin' charge--

00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:20.007
'cause somebody's gotta shut
down that Neuron Link!

00:12:20.007 --> 00:12:22.076
Hold on,
you're doing what?

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.376
I'm pretty sure
you heard me.

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:26.813
So pretending that you didn't?
Kinda rude.

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:30.984
This is unreal--
I just don't believe it!

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:36.223
The Dark Ignis is trying to stop
the Neuron Link by itself.

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:39.226
You'd give up your own
existence for these humans?

00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.895
Ai, you don't need
to do this!

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:45.065
I know I don't need to,
I want to.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:48.202
Besides, you gotta win
this duel for everybody,

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:51.705
and that won't happen if Bohman
gets his Neuron Link back.

00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.674
I'll stop you!

00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:55.809
Stay away!

00:12:57.144 --> 00:13:01.148
Remember, Playmaker, this isn't
just our duel anymore--

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:04.451
it's Kolter's duel too!
And Soulburner's!

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.153
And Blue Maiden's
and Zaizen's,

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.990
and Gore Gal's!

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.762
Even Varis and Spectre's!

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:16.630
Come back!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.098
This duel is for everybody

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:22.536
who fell so we could
make it here!

00:13:22.536 --> 00:13:26.306
And I'm not forgetting Flame,
Aqua and Earth too!

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.442
Or Windy and Lightning!

00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:30.444
'Cause even though it wasn't
what we pictured,

00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:32.246
they wanted peace too.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:34.215
So if we're all gonna
win this together,

00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:35.482
I gotta do my part,

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:38.485
even if I gotta leave
a few parts of me behind!

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.220
And after all this is over,

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.955
if you wanna
build a statue of me,

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:44.392
I'm not gonna say no.

00:13:44.392 --> 00:13:49.496
So just win this duel.
Later, Playmaker!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.768
(Playmaker)
Ai!

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.678
Good-bye, Master.

00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:06.147
How utterly pointless.

00:14:06.147 --> 00:14:10.050
To think that a program would
sacrifice itself for a human?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.651
Pointless, huh?

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:15.188
Yes, pointless-- I'm only
speaking the truth, Playmaker.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.558
You're wrong!

00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:21.562
What Ai just did has given me
a chance to win this duel.

00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:23.997
That's the opposite
of pointless!

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:27.000
And if you still don't
believe me, I'll prove it to
you!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.203
Speeches and words
will not win you this duel--

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.373
it's the cards and
strategies that will,

00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.775
and I have
the advantage in both.

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:37.178
But only for now.

00:14:37.178 --> 00:14:39.346
For you see even though
you hold an advantage,

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.881
that doesn't mean
it's going to last.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.218
Then you are bound
to be disappointed

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:47.220
when the advantage
remains mine and you lose.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.724
You are only
a human after all.

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:52.326
Now back to the duel.

00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:54.228
I draw.

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:59.233
First I will activate the spell
card HYDRADRIVE READVENT!

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.602
I can resurrect a monster
from my graveyard

00:15:01.602 --> 00:15:03.904
by negating its
special abilities,

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:06.239
as long as my monster
has fewer attack points

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:10.678
than the strongest
monster on your field.

00:15:10.678 --> 00:15:15.916
Return,
CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID!

00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:20.087
My DRAGRID will be
automatically destroyed

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:23.390
at the end of my turn-- but this
duel won't last that long.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.126
B-B-Boss! Bohman's
baddest bullying brute

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.627
is back in battle!

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:29.429
Baloney, bub!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.599
Our boy's beefier brawler
will best Bohman's behemoth!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:38.572
I activate my Link Spell!
Go JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:42.943
I bake bat back!
Bound the banic balarm!

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:46.046
JUDGMENT ARROWS can double
DRAGRID's attack points,

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:48.915
making it stronger
than CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON.

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:52.252
That'll spell doom
for Playmaker!

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:54.621
I told you before
that Ai's sacrifice

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.725
was pointless and I will
now demonstrate why.

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:02.862
I activate my Skill!
Your Skill?

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:11.805
I activate my Skill!
Your Skill?

00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:17.978
But how? The Neuron Link
was already destroyed!

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.350
How can this be possible?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.819
Because rather than
absorb human energy,

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.756
I can instead absorb
the energy of this world

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:32.326
to fuel my Skill!
(shouting)

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:35.862
Fly!

00:16:35.862 --> 00:16:39.633
My head is spinning, Boss!
My whole body is!

00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:41.168
Oh no!

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.303
It can use its Skill
without a Neuron Link,

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:47.007
so then all of our hard work
was for nothing.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:50.143
What you're doing
will destroy this world!

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:53.180
Destroying this world
is a small price to pay,

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.482
if you are defeated.

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:58.652
And now,
by using my Skill...

00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:03.723
A new card arrives into
the palm of my hand!

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:10.497
And I'll now generate
my circuit to summon it!

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:14.735
I set my DRAGRID
in the Link Arrow!

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:18.238
Bear witness to a monster
that has no equal!

00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:21.708
The very embodiment
of perfection!

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.644
I Link Summon!

00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:29.683
Link 5 PERFECTRON
HYDRADRIVE DRAGON!

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.188
PERFECTRON uses
its special ability

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:39.926
to gain five
HYDRADRIVE Counters.

00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:42.996
And that is only
the beginning.

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:45.432
For each HYDRADRIVE Counter

00:17:45.432 --> 00:17:49.803
my PERFECTRON gains
an extra 1000 attack points.

00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:56.010
It has 5000 attack points!?

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.412
Even worse--
with JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:17:58.412 --> 00:18:00.547
Bohman's attack points
will be doubled!

00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:02.549
That means
this single attack

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:06.587
will not only put an end
to Playmaker and this duel...

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:10.891
but also this entire world
and every human in existence!

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.160
It's over!
Not so fast!

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.165
I activate the trap card
RETURN RISK RESERVOIR!

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:21.769
It revives a Level 1 monster
from my graveyard.

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:25.873
Come back, PROTRON!

00:18:25.873 --> 00:18:29.310
Next, I activate
LINKURIBOH's special ability!

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.245
Then by tributing PROTRON,

00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:35.248
I can resurrect LINKURIBOH
from my graveyard!

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:39.653
And due to RETURN RISK
RESERVOIR's effect,

00:18:39.653 --> 00:18:43.290
I draw a card-- ha!

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.993
None of that
changes anything!

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.896
PERFECTRON HYDRADRIVE
DRAGON-- attack!

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:51.298
I'll use LINKURIBOH's
ability!

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:54.134
By tributing it,
your monster's attack points

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:58.072
drop to 0 until
the end of the turn.

00:18:58.072 --> 00:19:01.041
Huh. This move neutralized
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:04.111
because doubling 0
attack points is still 0.

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:06.347
And if it doesn't have
any attack points,

00:19:06.347 --> 00:19:09.350
there's no way that it will
decide to attack him.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.822
Hmm. Was that strategy of yours
supposed to scare me off?

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:18.158
Because I'm still going
to attack you now!

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.165
What?
But why would you?

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.868
Because, I have
the superior monster

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:30.170
with the superior abilities.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.874
Several of which you're
about to experience!

00:19:33.874 --> 00:19:36.843
First I'll take no damage
from this battle.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.212
And second, by removing
one Counter

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:42.315
PERFECTRON cannot
be destroyed.

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:48.822
What's the point of
that attack?

00:19:48.822 --> 00:19:51.692
All that attack did was
waste a HYDRADRIVE Counter.

00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.661
You're up to something.

00:19:53.661 --> 00:19:57.898
Something else indeed,
and it's this...

00:19:57.898 --> 00:20:00.234
When PERFECTRON HYDRADRIVE
DRAGON battles,

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:02.836
not only are all your
monsters destroyed,

00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:06.006
but you also take
300 points of damage

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:09.343
for every HYDRADRIVE Link
Monster in my graveyard.

00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:10.944
What?

00:20:10.944 --> 00:20:14.348
Bohman has eight monsters in
the grave that fit that bill.

00:20:14.348 --> 00:20:19.286
That means Playmaker is going
to take 2400 points of damage!

00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:31.064
With that attack
I end my turn.

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:34.935
Playmaker managed
to hang on.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.803
By a thread.

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:41.842
Look where your
stubbornness has gotten you--

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:43.443
laying on the ground
in pain

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:45.979
when all that could've
been avoided.

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:52.786
Maybe so, but know
that my stubbornness

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:57.324
has also given me a chance
to win this duel.

00:20:57.324 --> 00:21:00.927
A chance I won't waste.
