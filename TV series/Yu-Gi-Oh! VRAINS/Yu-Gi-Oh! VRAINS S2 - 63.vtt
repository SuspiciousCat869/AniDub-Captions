WEBVTT

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.237
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS".

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:07.174
(Akira)
The Shepherd never
told me he was the one

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.409
responsible for
creating the portal.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.678
Where are we?

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.915
(Flame)
Stuck inside the
Shepherd's trap, unfortunately.

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.185
Where's Shepherd now, Flame?

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:21.455
(Flame)
I believe
we have our answer!

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:23.356
(Shepherd)
Why don't you
and your Ignis

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:25.592
come up here and join me?

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.197
(Both) Time to duel!

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.631
I've looked into your memories

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.502
and can strike you
to your very core!

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:36.469
Despair from the Dark!

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.076
No!

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.411
Anything but this!

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.519
(Flame)
Soulburner, you must get
a hold of yourself!

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.255
(Shepherd)
Now, I will collect
the two things

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:59.759
I'm here for... a
victory and an Ignis!

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:03.697
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me!

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:11.398
(Both) Ready?

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:12.332
Speed Duel!

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:19.105
I'm going first and I
Summon Gouki Suprex!

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.076
And thanks to its
special ability,

00:02:22.076 --> 00:02:25.212
I can also Summon
Gouki Riscorpio!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.150
And next, by discarding
Gouki Twistcobra,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.319
I can Summon Gouki
Headbatt in Defence Mode

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.087
and Headbatt's special ability

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.557
gives my Suprex
800 Attack Points!

00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:42.463
(Ai)
This guy uses
Gouki monsters too?

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:45.766
And now I mash
down my circuit!

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.736
The Summoning conditions
require at least two Goukis,

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.071
but I'll use all three!

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:56.109
I Link Summon Link-3
Gouki the Solid Ogre!

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:58.912
(Ai)
Another Gouki?

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.647
Are they on sale or something?

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.551
Since I sent three of my
Goukis to the Graveyard,

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:07.320
I can draw three new
Gouki cards from my Deck,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.657
and one of them is the
Spell Gouki Rematch!

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.559
It lets me bring back two Goukis

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:15.795
from my Graveyard
in Defence Mode!

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:22.002
Next up, I'm activating
the Spell Card Gouki Unity!

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.371
Since I have a Gouki
Link Monster in my

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:25.439
Extra Monster Zone,

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:27.341
Goukis in my Main Monster Zone

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.477
can't be destroyed in
battle or by effects!

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.347
And when my Goukis battle,
I take no damage either!

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.616
(Ai)
That means we can
barely do anything!

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.552
No, you're wrong!

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.988
You can't do anything at all!

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.457
(Shepherd) Now,
Despair from the Dark,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.359
destroy Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.505
With nothing left to defend you,

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:02.409
my second Despair from the
Dark attacks you directly!

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.949
And with my third
Despair from the Dark,

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:12.018
you are finished, Soulburner!

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.355
(Flame)
Snap out of it,
Soulburner!

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.389
Ha!

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.092
Don't worry, I'm good, Flame!

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.128
Shepherd, if your
monster attacks me

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.797
while I have less than
1,000 Life Points,

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:27.400
I can Summon Salamangreat
Parro from my hand!

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.605
And due to Parro's
special ability,

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.573
its Attack Points
become the same

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:37.077
as that of another Salamangreat
that's in my Graveyard,

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:41.381
meaning it becomes as strong
as my Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:52.259
(Shepherd)
You must be proud,

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.594
you managed to
survive my attacks,

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:58.599
just like you managed
to survive 10 years ago.

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:02.336
Yes, I know all about
what you experienced

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.672
during the Lost Incident

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:07.974
and how it still
affects you to this day.

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:11.144
Just because you survive
something doesn't mean

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:15.782
those memories can't still
torment you, paralyse you.

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:27.260
I know you wish you could
snap your fingers

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:31.265
and it would all go away,
but that's not happening!

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:34.602
The only thing going away
will be your existence

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.938
after I defeat you,
along with your Ignis.

00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:41.608
So enjoy your turn,
it will be your last.

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.643
(Flame) Don't listen
to him, Soulburner,

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.779
don't let him get
inside your head!

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.415
(Shepherd)
Oh, I'm
already there,

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.418
that's how I know
I've already won!

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.758
I draw!

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:00.227
By sending Stack
Reviver to the Graveyard

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.930
I can then Summon my Bitrooper!

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.335
And next up, I Summon
Cyberse Gadget!

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.705
And Cyberse Gadget's
Special Ability

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.040
revives Stack Reviver
from my Graveyard!

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:19.179
Which I'll use to
create my circuit!

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.083
The Summoning conditions
require two monsters.

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.488
I Link Summon Link-2
Security Dragon!

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.064
If Stack Reviver is one
of the two monsters I use

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.333
to Link Summon, I'm
allowed to resummon

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:41.735
the other monster,
Cyberse Gadget!

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:45.505
And then I activate
Security Dragon's ability

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.174
to send your Gouki
Riscorpio back to your hand!

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.580
Oh no you don't, not
when I have Twistcobra!

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.982
It lets me Tribute Riscorpio

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.887
So that I can give all
2,300 of its Attack Points

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.888
to my Solid Ogre!

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.392
(Ai)
4,700?

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.762
Yeah, I'd say
that's pretty solid.

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:10.330
Uh-huh, that's right,
unlike your choices!

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.399
Even a newb knows you
should've gotten rid

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.302
of my Solid Ogre
instead of Riscorpio!

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:17.905
(Ai)
Well, maybe
you just happen to

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.974
only hang out with
really smart noobs!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.108
Maybe!

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:23.811
They also know when Riscorpio
goes to the Graveyard,

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:26.613
I can draw Gouki
Suprex from my Deck!

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.751
You're in all this trouble

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.286
because you made
one silly mistake.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.391
I disagree, because
I don't make mistakes!

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:40.160
I set all three of my
monsters in the Link Arrows

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:41.461
to Link Summon

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.799
Link-4 Firewall Dragon!

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.245
You played Firewall Dragon?

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:01.681
And since I just sent my
Cyberse Gadget to the Graveyard,

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:04.885
I can Summon one Gadget Token!

00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:07.521
But that's not all!

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.989
When I have a Cyberse in play,

00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:11.658
I can Summon Backup Secretary.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:14.861
With that, I can Link
Summon once again!

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:18.031
The Summoning conditions
require two Cyberse monsters.

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:23.169
I Link Summon Link-2
Flame Administrator!

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.041
And its special ability
gives all my Link Monsters

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.610
an additional 800 Attack Points!

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:37.017
Next, I'll use another
ability, Firewall Dragon's!

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.853
When a monster that's
next to its Link

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:43.190
is sent to the Graveyard, I
can Summon Dual Assembwurm!

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.025
Now, come on out!

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.697
Ha, you may have
three monsters in play,

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:51.865
but none of them

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.334
have enough Attack Points
to destroy my Solid Ogre!

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.537
That won't be a problem.

00:08:57.604 --> 00:08:58.605
Wha?

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:02.409
Because my Firewall
has a second ability.

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:05.879
For every monster that's
co-linked with Firewall Dragon,

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:07.914
I can return a
monster to your hand.

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.117
Since it's co-linked
to two monsters,

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.121
Firewall Dragon
dismisses both

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:17.757
your Twistcobra and
your Solid Ogre!

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:21.761
(Ai)
That was shocking!

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:22.963
Get it?

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.298
Huh?

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:27.401
With that, my monsters
can attack you directly

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:29.370
because you have
nothing to defend with.

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:31.238
Now, end this Duel!

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:48.922
(Ai)
Later, dude!

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:50.056
Kolter, come in!

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:51.758
How's your work coming along?

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.760
Funny you should
ask, Playmaker,

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.729
'cause I just finished it.

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.931
One keystroke and
we're good to go!

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:01.502
Error?

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:02.335
No!

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.004
How can this be?

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.411
Someone's trying really hard

00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.080
to hack through the
Shepherd's trap.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.517
But I can hardly say
that he's succeeding.

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.956
The Shepherd uses a unique
process to code his programme,

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:24.425
so you can't get through
unless you know what it is,

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.525
like I do.

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:29.896
Hey, Kolter,
nothing's changed.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.900
(Kolter)
I know nothing's
changed, don't remind me!

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.835
(Woman) I'm surprised he
made it this far.

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:37.271
He almost has it figured out,

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:40.073
but those last few
steps are a beast,

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.508
so count yourself
lucky you have

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:44.244
a beast slayer like
me on your side.

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.913
(Shepherd)
You choose to suffer

00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:50.116
when the smart decision
is to surrender.

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:52.853
You might think that
makes you a hero.

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.788
It doesn't.

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.423
It makes you a fool.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.259
Yep, that's me.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.361
(Shepherd)
You put on a brave face

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:03.497
but I know beneath the surface

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:06.032
lies a constant
presence of fear!

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:10.971
If you say so, but I won't
let you take me off my game,

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:14.407
especially since I
just drew Rising Fire!

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:17.311
By equipping this Spell on a
monster in my graveyard,

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.513
I can bring it back to life!

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:23.750
So, Salamangreat Heatleo,
rise from the ashes!

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:32.826
Next I activate my Field
Spell Salamangreat Sanctuary!

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:36.263
Like last time, I can use
a Salamangreat Link Monster

00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:38.665
on my field to Link
Summon another copy

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.200
of that same monster.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.570
I blaze my circuit by setting

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:45.805
Salamangreat Heatleo
in the Link Arrow!

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.151
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:11:57.151 --> 00:12:03.523
Rise again from the valley of
flames, Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:11.398
(Shepherd)
Another Reincarnation
Link Summon?

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:14.734
You tried this strategy last
time and it didn't work!

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.971
What makes you think this time
will be any different?

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:19.806
'Cause it is different.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.141
(Shepherd)
Hmm?

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:24.311
Because, unlike last time,
my Salamangreat Heatleo

00:12:24.344 --> 00:12:27.013
was equipped with the
Spell Rising Fire!

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.051
And when Rising Fire is
sent to the Graveyard,

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.154
I can banish all copies
of one particular monster

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.722
that you have in play!

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:39.393
With that monster being

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.494
your Despair from the Dark!

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:44.264
Leave this game and
never come back!

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:47.167
(Shepherd)
No!

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.572
There's more!

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:53.640
Your Life Points are
also gonna take damage

00:12:53.674 --> 00:12:56.043
equal to Despair from
the Dark's Attack Points,

00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:59.245
which equals 2,800!

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:00.981
(Shepherd)
This shouldn't be possible!

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.650
When I looked into
your memories,

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:05.786
Despair from the Dark
paralysed you in fear!

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:07.621
Why aren't you
afraid anymore?

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.756
Anymore?

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.424
I never was!

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.759
(Flame)
What could've
given you that idea?

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:16.396
(Shepherd)
I know what I heard,
you said it yourself!

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:18.332
(Flame)
Oh no,
Shepherd is using

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:20.500
Soulburner's greatest
fear against him!

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:23.036
(Shepherd)
Unless you were lying!

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:24.304
(Flame)
I most certainly
was not!

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.708
It was his greatest
fear, just not anymore!

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:28.909
That's right!

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:30.711
But I sold it
pretty good, right?

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:32.212
(Flame)
Eh, B minus.

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:34.381
It's atleast a solid B!

00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:44.825
Not bad, Soulburner.

00:13:44.892 --> 00:13:47.328
Here's the thing, what
you saw in my memories

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:49.729
was totally real,
Despair from the Dark

00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:52.566
really was one of the
scariest times in my life!

00:13:52.566 --> 00:13:55.135
(Flame)
But the memory
you saw was incomplete,

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:58.305
you didn't get to see
what happened afterwards.

00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.073
(Shepherd)
Afterwards?

00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:04.211
(Flame)
Yes, because
I scrambled your access.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.380
(Shepherd)
It was incomplete?

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:08.548
You think we
should fill him in?

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:10.350
(Flame)
Why not?

00:14:12.453 --> 00:14:13.821
(Flame)
Calm down, Theodore!

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:17.023
Just look at you, you're
so scared of my monster

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:20.226
that you're not
even able to Duel!

00:14:20.293 --> 00:14:25.298
But that's your problem and
I'm about to make it worse.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.305
I Summon a monster that's just
as spooky, Skull Conductor!

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:34.174
Now Skull Conductor will
attack Valkyrian Knight

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:36.009
and orchestrate its demise!

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:42.216
And by comboing it with my
Field Spell, Edge of Darkness,

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:44.885
Skull Conductor gains
100 Attack Points

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:47.721
for every zombie-type
monster on my field,

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:58.632
so I can deal you
even more damage!

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:03.270
(Flame)
Are you okay,
Theodore?

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:07.941
Next, Despair from the Dark
attacks Phoenix Gearfried

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:12.345
and Edge of Darkness also
gives it 200 Attack Points.

00:15:19.452 --> 00:15:21.388
Please, no more!

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.523
That sounds like
you're giving up.

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:25.592
(Flame)
Theodore, giving up
is the one thing

00:15:25.626 --> 00:15:27.527
you must never do!

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.030
(Theodore)
What's the point?

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.367
Whenever I see that
monster, I just can't.

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:34.702
(Flame)
I know you're scared,

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:36.837
but you're not scared
of the monster,

00:15:36.837 --> 00:15:39.573
you're scared of what
that monster represents,

00:15:39.607 --> 00:15:41.408
the Lost Incident

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.345
and how you lost your
parents because of it.

00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:47.581
Do not forget that I was
created based upon you,

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.783
so I share in the
loss that you feel.

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:52.853
After my Skull
Conductor battles,

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:55.222
it automatically gets destroyed.

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.523
How nice for you!

00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:01.494
Then I place one card
face-down and end my turn.

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:04.097
(Flame)
As difficult
as it will be,

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:07.601
you must confront your pain
instead of hiding from it,

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:11.472
because that is the only way
you can overcome your fears,

00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:13.940
and that is how
you can move on.

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:17.077
And you don't have to do it
alone, I'm here with you!

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:20.513
Together, we can let
your spirit reincarnate!

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:28.255
Now, let us win this duel!

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:32.926
Let's go!

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.929
It's my turn.

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:37.431
I draw!

00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:40.600
I activate my Equip
Spell, Rising Fire!

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:45.472
I equip in on Phoenix Gearfried

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.474
to resurrect it
from my Graveyard

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.744
with 500 additional
Attack Points!

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:56.616
Next up, I'll activate this,
the Spell Card Tempest Fire!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.587
It destroys my Phoenix Gearfried

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:02.322
and we both take damage equal to

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:05.326
its original Attack
Points, that's 2,800!

00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:06.159
What?

00:17:08.062 --> 00:17:09.997
Also, it destroys
a monster

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.099
that has equal or fewer Attack
Points than my Gearfried,

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:16.469
and you take damage equal to
half of its Attack Points.

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:18.505
This can't be!

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.840
But it can!

00:17:19.874 --> 00:17:22.009
By destroying Despair
from the Dark,

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.145
you're out of Life
Points, Redley!

00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:27.414
It's time I overcame my
fears to win this duel!

00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:35.522
All right, I won,
I did it!

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:37.391
(Flame)
I knew you would,

00:17:37.424 --> 00:17:39.560
because I saw a
fire in your eyes

00:17:39.593 --> 00:17:41.528
that could never
be extinguished!

00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:42.863
Oh, you did, huh?

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.566
Uh, what was your
name again?

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:46.666
(Flame)
Oh, how rude!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.568
I never introduced
myself.

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:51.304
I'm Flame,
F-L-A-M-E!

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:54.641
The F stands for formidable,
the L is for lively,

00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:55.643
the A is for--

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:58.078
Whoa, come on, slow
down there, Flame.

00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:00.547
You don't have to go and
tell me what your name means.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.082
(Flame)
Wha?

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:03.784
You don't like it?

00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:05.085
Fine, go on.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.755
(Flame)
The A is
for awesome, the N--

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:10.390
Flame helped me get
over my fears that day

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:11.926
and I've never
looked back!

00:18:11.959 --> 00:18:14.461
That is, until today
when you made me.

00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:16.396
But your scare
tactics backfired,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.500
'cause all you did was remind
me of how far I've come!

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:24.071
Anyways, since I Link
Summoned Salamangreat Heatleo,

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.373
I get to pick one of
your Spell or Trap Cards

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:28.375
and return it to your Deck.

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:31.378
So I'm sending back
your Drone Barricade!

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.914
(Shepherd)
You can't
if I banish it first!

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.949
And by doing so,
I can play

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:39.119
another Drone
Barricade from my Deck.

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:41.588
Then I'll just have to
get rid of that one, too!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.425
When you have a Spell or
Trap Card on your field

00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:48.428
and I have at least three
Salamangreat monsters

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:52.333
in my Graveyard, I can
discard Salamangreat Foxer

00:18:52.399 --> 00:18:56.236
to return Salamangreat
Heatleo to my Extra Deck!

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:57.771
And as a nice little bonus,

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:01.608
I also get to destroy one
of your Spell or Trap Cards,

00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.544
so your Barricade
is torn down again!

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:08.481
(Flame)
Without that trap you
can now attack him directly,

00:19:09.617 --> 00:19:11.785
but he does have
another card in play.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.222
(Shepherd)
What's wrong?

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:17.624
Are you afraid?

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:19.893
Afraid?

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.628
No, I'm not afraid.

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:25.131
But that doesn't
mean I'm careless.

00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.801
(Shepherd)
That's just another
way to say you're afraid.

00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:29.703
You may have
convinced yourself

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.705
that you've overcome
your fears,

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:33.440
but you haven't
convinced me!

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:34.841
Oh, then
I will now.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:40.614
Heatleo, attack his Life Points
directly and finish him off!

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.650
(Shepherd)
You fool, I--

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:46.787
(Woman)
Boop!

00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:47.721
Wha?

00:19:47.788 --> 00:19:49.990
Guess today's my lucky day.

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:06.940
This whole place
is falling apart!

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:08.942
(Flame)
Playmaker
hacked the trap!

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:11.678
(Shepherd)
I'll get you next time!

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.150
Hey, the Duel isn't over yet!

00:20:16.183 --> 00:20:17.050
Come back!

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:29.163
(Playmaker)
Soulburner!

00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:30.797
(Flame)
Playmaker!

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.671
Oh man, I was just
about to blast that joker.

00:20:36.704 --> 00:20:38.505
Good to see you, too.

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:41.775
Hey, Kolter, your
programme worked out.

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:43.443
Soulburner's safe.

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:44.778
(Kolter)
Music to my ears.

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:52.052
(Shepherd)
My trap is unhackable,
without help that is.

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:54.788
Come on now, I
saved you from a loss!

00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:57.824
(Shepherd)
I had Soulburner
right where I wanted him!

00:20:57.824 --> 00:20:59.993
Sure, Shep,
whatever you say.

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:02.763
(Shepherd)
Yes, it is whatever I say,

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:07.000
and I say you've interfered
for the last time, Ghost Gal!
