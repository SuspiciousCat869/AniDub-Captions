that Ignis has been
lying to you this entire time.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:11.678
And do you want
to know why, Playmaker?

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:15.716
That Ignis's
code ID is IGN006,

00:10:15.749 --> 00:10:18.685
meaning it was created based
on the sixth test subject.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.087
So?
Guh!

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:24.591
So... the sixth test subject
in the Lost Incident...

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:26.560
was you, Playmaker!

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:28.128
You and the other children

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:31.298
were merely guinea pigs
for my father's pet project

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.301
to create an AI
with free will.

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:37.237
Every duel you fought,
every meal you missed,

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:41.041
that Ignis was watching you
the whole time.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:46.447
Observing and analyzing you,
but never interfering.

00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:49.416
Is it getting
hot in here? Heh.

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:53.386
The Ignis grew and matured
much faster than we expected.

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.089
They even constructed
their own world

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:58.059
where only the Ignis
could live,

00:10:58.092 --> 00:10:59.960
known as The Cyberse.

00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:01.962
Wait, the Cyberse?

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:04.097
But your Ignis
hid the Cyberse

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.466
before I had
a chance to destroy it.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.570
You knew none of this,
did you, Playmaker?

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:13.139
That AI has been lying to you
all this time.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.242
It knew who you were
the moment you met,

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:17.611
but it pretended
to lose its memories,

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:20.280
deceiving you
every step of the way.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.283
If an AI is capable
of lying and trickery,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.118
what more can they do?

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.756
What other threats
are they concealing from us?

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:31.258
No human on Earth
must make the foolish mistake

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:33.794
of going and trusting
the Ignis!

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:36.363
So don't be
that fool, Playmaker!

00:11:36.464 --> 00:11:38.632
Destroy that Ignis!

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.201
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't listen to him!

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.770
I wasn't lying to you.

00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:44.905
I mean, maybe in
the technical definition,

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.574
but-- but, you know, but...

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:49.075
Okay look,
here's the deal.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:52.012
When I was on the lam,
I couldn't trust anybody.

00:11:52.113 --> 00:11:53.948
Not for a second.

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.916
So when you locked me up
in your Duel Disk,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.151
I thought you were
another one of the bad guys!

00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:01.488
However, when I analyzed
your face's bone structure,

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:04.524
I knew that you were the same
kid from those experiments.

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:07.227
But I still didn't know
if you were a bad guy or not.

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.696
I didn't know if you
had a grudge against me.

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:12.600
And by the time
I figured out

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.735
that you were
sorta kinda okay,

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.903
it was too late
to say anything.

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:18.839
And that's 1000% the truth,

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.375
even though I know saying
1000 instead of 100

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.844
makes it seem suspicious,
but it's true!

00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:26.080
But you did
deceive your friend.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.415
Well... uh...

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:33.020
Whoever said
he was my friend?

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.020
(gasps)

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:36.690
Nooo!
Not like this!

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:38.025
Come on, buddy!

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:40.994
Your best option
is to remain silent.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:44.932
Even though I believe that
you're incapable of doing that.

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:48.468
Uhh! M-M-My lips are sealed.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:51.905
Saying your lips are sealed
means your lips aren't sealed.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:54.175
Touché.
(whimpers)

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:57.978
Whether this Ignis
tricked me or not...

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.815
I won't let you destroy
Link VRAINS.

00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:03.450
Varis, it's
still your turn.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.587
Heh. Very well!

00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:11.091
After I defeat you, I will
finish off that Ignis!

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:18.098
♪♪♪

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.737
You have committed
countless crimes, Varis.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.373
However, this one
outdoes them all of them.

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.276
I won't let you destroy
this world.

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.746
Oh? Really now.

00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.115
Instead of Link VRAINS,

00:13:34.215 --> 00:13:36.383
you should be more worried
about yourself!

00:13:36.417 --> 00:13:37.384
(Ai)
Oh, I am.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:38.618
Watch out!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.325
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.330
It's almost as if destiny

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.832
wants me to win this battle
against you.

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:57.070
I summon...
Spin-Headed Behemoth!

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:03.877
Next, I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.148
All he does is summon a monster
that's weaker than ours?

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.782
And in attack mode?

00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:11.184
If that's not fishy,
then sushi ain't scrumptious.

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.987
It's so obviously a trap
that maybe...

00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:15.322
it's not a trap!

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:16.990
Like a non-trap trap!

00:14:17.024 --> 00:14:18.659
(Playmaker)
Maybe you should
shut your trap.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.294
(whimpers)

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:25.499

Aaaah! Danger!

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.335
Danger!

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:29.936
(grunting)

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:34.441
Uhh. Keep on your toes, bud.

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:36.977
Running out of life points
is only one of the many ways

00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:38.979
that you can
lose this duel!

00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:40.981
(grunts)
It's my turn!

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:41.982
I draw!

00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:45.885
I summon this card!

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:48.622
Fault Tolerlancer!

00:14:48.656 --> 00:14:49.990
(whinnies)

00:14:52.126 --> 00:14:55.662
And then... Fault Tolerlancer's
special ability

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:57.998
switches itself
to defense mode!

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:04.338
Defense? But Varis has
no monsters to block with.

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.007
You can't attack
his life points
if you're defending.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.176
(Playmaker)
He might not have monsters,

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:11.711
but he does have
a facedown card.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.915
One last thing, if you
duel Varis, be careful,

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:16.383
even more than before.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.884
He now has a card...

No, this can't be!

00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:27.194
Ghost Gal and Gore
lost their own duels

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:29.930
because of his facedown card,
Mirror Force.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.398
They sacrificed themselves

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:33.867
so I wouldn't make the same
mistake they did.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.202
And I won't!

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:38.005
When Fault Tolerlancer
is in defense mode,

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:39.339
my other monster
in attack mode

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:41.541

Wow!

Uh, I mean... mmm!

Attack Spin-Headed Behemoth!

00:15:58.526 --> 00:16:00.894
So you think you have me
all figured out.

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:04.798
Then allow me put your instincts
to the test, Playmaker!

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:06.633
I activate the trap

He still played it?
But why?

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:22.249
I don't know,

00:16:22.283 --> 00:16:24.684

we're gonna find out!

You fool! Heh!

When Spin-Headed Behemoth
is attacked,

00:16:43.504 --> 00:16:45.772
all your monsters

You really thought
I wouldn't be prepared?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.182
Your lack of vigilance
will cost you

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:56.950
as Mirror Force destroys

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.952

Argh.

We got bodied.

of your misery, Playmaker.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.470
Since I just destroyed a monster
of yours using Mirror Force,

I am allowed to summon

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:24.478
Actually, I destroyed
more than one monster, didn't I?

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:27.314
That means Overflow Dragon's

'Cause if you don't, you may
as well just end your turn!

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:45.793
with 800 attack points
until the end of the turn!

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.928
(beeping)

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:51.798
Flash Charge Dragon,
attack Playmaker directly.

00:18:53.067 --> 00:18:56.403
(clanking, whirring)

00:18:56.437 --> 00:18:57.404
(grunts)

00:18:57.437 --> 00:18:58.405
(whimpers)

00:18:58.439 --> 00:19:01.441
Go, Blasting Cannon Bombardment!

00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:07.781
(Playmaker and Ai grunting)

00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:12.018
Um, you okay?

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:13.487
Yusaku!

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.121
(Ai)
Don't keel over now.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.990
We still have
a chance at this.

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:19.459
Blast Powder Dragon
has 800 attack points,

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.362
but we have 900
life points!

00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.064
So we'll
survive this turn!

00:19:23.164 --> 00:19:25.900
I wouldn't be so sure of that,
you malware.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.135
You're not getting
another turn!

00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:30.303
Since the monster
Blast Powder Dragon

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.172
powered up
and dealt you damage,

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:35.141
it itself gains
800 attack points.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.346
What?! But 1600
attack points

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:41.515
is more than
900 life points!

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:42.817
Stupid math!

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.518
Uhh!

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:47.320
With this final attack,
you're finished!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.990
And no calculations
can save you now!
