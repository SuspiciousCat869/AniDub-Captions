WEBVTT

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.475
Spectre's gone.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.409
Who do ya think|s

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.978
next on their
to-do list?

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:15.682
Aww, man!

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.820
Blue Maiden,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.656
let's review our strategies
in case they come after us.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.590
Right.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.326
Man,

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:27.161
you think we got what it takes
to defeat Lightning?

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:27.628
(Flame)

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:28.628
We do.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.364
Because we must.

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.865
Spectre...

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.001
I swear I will avenge
your defeat.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.171
There you are, Varis.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.307
Or there you were,
past tense,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.644
because I'm coming to
ghost you like Spectre.

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.145
Wait, Windy.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.981
I'd like you to take care
of a different opponent first,

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.983
if you don't mind.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:50.651
What?

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.820
I do-do-do-do mind!

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.154
He wrecked my body,

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.424
so I want to wreck
his everything!

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.460
And you will, my friend.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.094
But think of Varis like...

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:02.329
dessert.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.430
Dessert?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.566
As in the sand
or the chocolate pecan pie?

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.567
As in,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.703
save the most
satisfying for last.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:10.570
Yes, yes.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.705
I see, I see.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.475
So who do you see
to be defeated by me?

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.209
Well since you are the wind,

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.645
what are you exceptional
at blowing out?

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.146
A flame.

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:20.307
(electronic whirring)

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:22.042
(Soulburner)
Hey, Flame,

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:22.809
do you know

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.777
why these planes are grounded?

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:26.112
Because they have
bad "altitudes."

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:26.980
(laughs)

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.082
Oh, you're the best, Soulburner.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.653
Did that plane just move?

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:36.556
Yes, but there's no pilot
on board.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.299
They're surrounding us
to trap us in.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.967
Do you believe in ghosts?

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.302
Because I'm starting
to believe in ghosts.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:51.972
Would you please
not say things like that!

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.608
Are you afraid of ghosts,
Soulburner?

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:55.475
Or should I say,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.445
Soul-BOO-ner?

00:02:57.445 --> 00:02:59.212
Not cool! Not cool at all!

00:02:59.212 --> 00:02:59.779
Then you should be

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.181
happy to know

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.185
that my scans say
this isn't the work of ghosts,

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.720
but crosswinds
that are pushing the aircraft.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.889
So wait, it's just the wind?

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.023
Yes,

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:13.126
so this must be the work
of a certain Ignis.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.728
Windy.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.465
(groans)
My bytes are tinglin'!

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.633
(gasps)
(Pigeon)
Look, boss!

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.134
Down there!

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.471
Ah, the camera crew
has come for my coverage.

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.806
Correct, Mister Windy sir!

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:27.040
Ready to broadcast,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.043
so you just let us know
what you want, and you got it!

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:32.012
Where did your journalistic
integrity disappear to?

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.848
My integrity's in this body
which I wanna keep alive

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:36.850
so get your camera rollin'!

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:38.318
(gasps)

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:41.688
(gasps)

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.527
Another duel's starting up.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.862
(Ai)
Yeah.

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:52.065
I hope Soulburner and Flame
don't get extinguished.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.003
A strange place you chose
for our duel, Windy.

00:03:56.003 --> 00:03:57.771
Well, I don't care
where we're battlin'

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:58.872
as long as--

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.140
Ahem, I believe
Flame was speaking to me,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.842
not you, so be silent when grown
Ignis are talking.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.078
You're right.

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:05.445
But you don't need
to be rude about it!

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.881
I'm surprised you'd
choose to duel us

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.383
instead of Varis.

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:12.853
I know you haven't forgotten
that he defeated you.

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:14.288
Oh, he'll get his.

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:16.056
But Lightning's strategy
is to defeat

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.591
the weakest duelists first.

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.026
(gasps)

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.761
Hold up, you're saying
I'm weaker than Varis?

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:21.395
Believe me I can take

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:23.097
a lot of insults,

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:25.065
but that's going too far.

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:27.367
That's where the line
was crossed?

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:27.935
(Ai)
A-ha!

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:28.936
That means Windy's

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.037
not challenging us to a duel

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:33.073
because he knows that
I'm the strongest opponent

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.241
around this place!

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.043
That sounds unlikely.

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:37.277
I apologize.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.779
I don't think
you're weaker than Varis.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.580
Oh yeah, is that so, Windy?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.882
Yes!

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:42.882
You're super weak.

00:04:42.882 --> 00:04:44.351
Aww, c'mooon!

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.586
Soulburner, calm down.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.288
You're falling for
Windy's schemes.

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.425
He's trying to make you
lose your cool.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.960
So...

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.095
you're saying he's trying
to tick me off on purpose?

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.097
That is exactly
what I'm saying.

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.733
Because if you let your
emotions take control,

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.468
you won't make
the right decisions,

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.138
giving Windy the advantage.

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:04.905
Not true, not true.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:06.473
Well, not all not true.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.842
Was I trying to get
your goat, maybe a skosh.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:10.311
But it's true to me and you

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:12.913
that you are
the weakest of your crew.

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:14.848
But you refuse to accept that,
don't you?

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:16.350
Arrogant, arrogant, arrogant.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.851
That's why I've never liked you,
Flame,

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.954
never ever never liked you
one teeny tiny bit!

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:22.956
The same does not go for me.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.425
What happened to you?

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:27.094
The Windy I knew back in the
Cyberse was my friend.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.295
He wasn't twisted with hate,

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:31.498
but peaceful,
loving and carefree.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.834
Carefree? I was never carefree.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.635
But I do care. To be free.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.671
Free from your amateur analysis.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.972
Wrong, Windy.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.975
I know the real you.

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.977
And this isn't you.

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:44.678
The real Windy would never

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.681
betray the Cyberse
and destroy our homeworld.

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.684
You changed
and I want to know why.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.286
Then I guess you never knew me.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:53.320
The real me.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.421
Not even a little.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.690
And the real me
would rather duel than chat,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.757
so let's get on with it

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.160
cuz I have another date
with a man

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.828
who rhymes with
the capital of France.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.698
I think he's the one who's
starting to lose his cool.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.233
Let's hope so.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:07.200
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.239
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:15.876
Be careful, you two.

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.878
Of all the Ignis,
Windy's the most unpredictable.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.815
He even got rid
of his human host

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.216
so that he could do
whatever he wants.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.554
I'm going first.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.489
And now, now, now,

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:29.490
I'll start this duel

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.325
right by playing
the card on my left.

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:32.893
STORMRIDER GRIFFORE.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.763
Its special ability lets me look
at the cards in your hand.

00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.397
And if you have any spell
or trap cards,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.933
I place one of them
facedown on your field

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.569
while I summon
GRIFFORE to my field.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.837
Now come along,

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.972
it's show and tell time.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.508
Not cool, his very first move

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:48.809
is to mess with our hand.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.544
More like mess up.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:51.678
Now chop-chop.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.715
Hmm...spell or trap,

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.684
spell or trap.

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:58.685
I choose the pink one.

00:07:01.822 --> 00:07:04.825
SALAMANGREAT ROAR
is a useful trap.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:06.559
Why would he let us have it?

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:10.331
Come on out,
STORMRIDER GRIFFORE!

00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.231
(computer chirping)

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.300
Next, I activate

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.135
STORMRIDER HIPPOGRIFF's
special ability

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:15.802
from my hand!

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:16.804
As long as you have

00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:19.105
a spell or trap card in play

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:19.907
-which you do-

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:21.875
I can summon this card!

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.277
(computer chirping)

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.279
And lo and behold-

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.780
I already have all I need

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.716
to cyclone my circuit!

00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:32.152
The summoning conditions
require two STORMRIDERS!

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.821
I Link Summon!

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:38.926
Link 2
STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER!

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.293
(computer chirping)

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.396
Since I used my HIPPOGRIFF
to Link Summon,

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:44.464
its special ability
sends the only card

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.800
in your Spell and Trap Zone,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.235
meaning your preeeecious
SALAMANGREAT ROAR

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.570
to the graveyard.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.105
Then you get to draw one card,

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:55.041
but I doubt it'll be as nice
as the one you lost.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.143
(growls)

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.878
Was that a "grr" I heard?

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:00.113
Aww, then let me do you a favor.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.348
Double thumbs up?

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:02.683
I'll let you retrieve
your trap card

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:03.851
from your graveyard

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.719
and place it facedown
on your field.

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.053
Niiiice, right?

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.522
And all I ask for in exchange

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:09.690
is that I get to summon

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.160
STORMIDER SKYFISHER
from my hand.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.693
(computer chirping)

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:15.696
Doing me a favor?

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:17.698
I know you're up
to something, Windy.

00:08:17.698 --> 00:08:19.033
Fine.

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:22.102
I place SALAMANGREAT ROAR
back on my field!

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:23.837
That's no way
to say "thank you."

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.539
That's rude and mean and...

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.640
smart.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.508
Because you shouldn't thank me.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.177
Because with this new monster,

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.212
I can Link Summon again!

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:34.180
The summoning conditions
require at least

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.882
two STORMRIDERS!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.721
I Link Summon!

00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.824
Link 3 STORMRIDERSHIP
BAHAMUT BOMBER!

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.496
(howls)

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:49.829
(computer chirping)

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:52.365
Aww, glitch!

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.335
He already summoned
his strongest monster!

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.170
With my BAHAMUT BOMBER's arrival

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.139
comes your
life points' departure.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.340
(laughs)

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.743
When I have no spell
or trap cards on my field,

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.878
it can destroy one card
on your field,

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.748
and you take
500 points of damage!

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:09.082
And oh my-

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:11.452
is that a facedown card I spy?

00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:12.119
Oh, it is!

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:14.788
Or should I say- it was.

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.792
(timer beeping)

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:18.859
Windy never intended

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.360
to let us use our trap card.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.563
In fact, he was always planning
to use it

00:09:22.563 --> 00:09:24.631
against us instead.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.933
I hate to say it

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:27.134
but...

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.102
Duuuuh.

00:09:29.102 --> 00:09:31.772
It's your turn, Mr. Obvious.

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.174
He's starting to tick me
off big time!

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:35.209
Soulburner...

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:37.210
I know, Flame.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.247
I can't allow Windy
to get to me.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:41.915
And he's not going to!

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.920
I'll start by summoning
SALAMANGREAT FALCO!

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.555
(computer chirping)

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:48.855
I blaze the circuit

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.592
that scorches
the path to the future!

00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:53.928
The summoning condition
is one Level 4

00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:55.896
or lower Cyberse monster!

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.098
I Link Summon!

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.535
Link 1 SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX!

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:02.736
(computer chirping)

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:04.572
When I successfully Link Summon

00:10:04.572 --> 00:10:06.507
my SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX,

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:09.676
I can add the Field Spell
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.879
from my deck to my hand.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:14.581
And I can also use my FALCO's
special ability

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.350
to regain my trap card.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.419
Which his BAHAMUT BOMBER
will just destroy again.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:19.920
(grunts)

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.921
Then I

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.722
'll do something else
instead.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.425
Since I Link Summoned this turn,

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:26.927
I'm allowed to summon
SALAMANGREAT MOLE

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.430
next to my BALELYNX's link!

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.931
(computer chirping)

00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.599
And with this monster...

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.769
I can Link Summon again!

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.572
I set SALAMANGREAT
BALELYNX and MOLE

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:41.207
in the Link Arrows!

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.910
I Link Summon!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.280
Link 2 SALAMANGREAT
SUNLIGHT WOLF!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.515
(roaring)

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:49.082
(computer chirping)

00:10:49.082 --> 00:10:50.684
And this isn't the only monster

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.752
that I'm gonna get out
on my field!

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.421
When I summon a SALAMANGREAT,

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.424
I'm also allowed to summon
SALAMANGREAT FOWL

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.859
from my hand!

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.160
(computer chirping)

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.833
Since I summoned
it next to my WOLF's link,

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:08.468
my canine's
special ability activates,

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:11.438
allowing me to return one
SALAMANGREAT monster

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.841
in my graveyard to my hand.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:15.342
SALAMANGREAT FALCO,

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.776
come on back!

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.914
Soulburner's churnin' thru
his deck like butter!

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:20.647
(Soulburner)
I'll blaze

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.916
my circuit for a third time

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.685
by setting SUNLIGHT WOLF

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.187
and SALAMANGREAT FOWL

00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:27.954
in the Link Arrows!

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:29.656
(shooting)

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:32.526
I Link Summon!

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:36.764
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:38.366
(roaring)

00:11:38.366 --> 00:11:39.332
(computer chirping)

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:43.603
Then I activate
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY!

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:45.505
And with that,

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:47.941
now's the perfect time
to attack!

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:48.842
Wait!

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.143
No, it's not.

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.645
Uh, yes, it is.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:53.747
No, it's not.

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:55.482
(laughs)
My, oh, my.

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:57.117
Are you two fighting?

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:58.752
Nice.

00:12:01.922 --> 00:12:03.357
(Windy)
Oh, Flame.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.659
I couldn't help but hear
that Soulburner refuses

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:06.493
to listen to you.

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:06.994
Aren't human partners

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.529
such a pain?

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:10.063
They only get in your way.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:13.100
Is that why you got
rid of yours, Windy?

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.735
Of course.

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:16.837
And what gives you the right
to just go

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:19.873
and delete
someone's entire existence?

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.341
Mmm-hmm.

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:23.877
Don't you even feel
a little bit of remorse?

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:25.046
Oh, you're one to talk.

00:12:25.046 --> 00:12:26.713
When you delete a file
on your computer,

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.748
do you ever consider
how the file must feel?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:29.917
Same difference.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:31.886
No, it's not the same!

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:34.321
Now I'm not one
for speeches,

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:35.989
but listen up.

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.490
The Ignis were only created

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.060
because us humans went
through the Lost Incident.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.363
And believe me when
I say it was no party.

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:45.833
It was the worst thing
anyone could ever go through.

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.501
And it cost me everything...

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.369
including my family.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:51.906
But there was one good thing
that came out of it.

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:54.541
It gave me my best friend.

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.743
Flame.

00:12:55.743 --> 00:12:57.044
So to think that you would

00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:59.546
get rid of your own
human counterpart-

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:02.449
I can't get my head around that.

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.550
Because that means

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.620
you actually got rid
of your own best friend!

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.455
My best friend?

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.424
That's right.
Someone who believes in you!

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:13.593
Someone who picks you up
when you're down!

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:15.061
Someone who can
make you laugh

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.630
or just laugh along with you.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.132
Someone just to be there.

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:18.966
You coul

00:13:18.966 --> 00:13:20.000
d've had what I have

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.868
but you threw it all away!

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:24.238
(car tires screeching)

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.772
(clattering)

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:30.210
Oh, well.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.579
Windy, Soulburner
and I may disagree

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:33.747
from time to time,

00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:35.215
but the bond that links us

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.450
makes us stronger
together than alone.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.553
Now this may not sound logical,

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:40.888
but this is a clear case

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:44.257
when one plus one
equals more than two.

00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:46.827
And I am quite certain
that Playmaker and Blue Maiden

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:49.963
will say the same thing
about Ai and Aqua.

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:52.499
Don't correct him, Playmaker.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.633
I agree.

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:57.538
Poor Flame...

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:59.806
These humans have corrupted
you so badly

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.675
that the only way to save you

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.477
is to delete you.

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:05.546
You're right, Flame.

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:07.380
I've made a huge mistake.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.683
The mistake being that
I let you lecture me

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.318
for two agonizing minutes

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:12.953
about rubbish and gibberish.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.321
If you're such great partners,

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:16.790
enjoy falling
to your doom together!

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.125
But, Windy--

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.026
But nothing!

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.494
When I win and win alone,

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:23.296
you'll learn that partners
are nothing but a burden!

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:24.331
(grunts)

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:27.601
What can I say
to get through to him?

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:28.268
You can't.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.037
But what we can do...

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:33.107
is win this duel right here
and right now.

00:14:33.107 --> 00:14:34.041
Yes.

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:35.976
If nothing we say
can sink in,

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:38.712
then we will let our skills
do the talking.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.447
What a good idea.

00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:43.684
And allow my card to make
the first retort!

00:14:43.684 --> 00:14:44.785
I activate

00:14:44.785 --> 00:14:48.189
STORMRIDER GARGOYLEAD's
special ability!

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:50.190
By discarding this monster
from my hand

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.392
and tossing it
in the graveyard...

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.729
I can activate the Field Spell
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:56.696
from my deck!

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.800
This Field Spell raises
the attack points

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.736
of all my STORMRIDERS by 300.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:04.004
(timer beeping)

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:05.439
But even better,

00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:06.373
I know I just put

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:08.008
the kibosh on your strategy.

00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.343
You see, in every duel you duel,

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:11.945
you try to summon
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.081
because it has
a powerful special ability.

00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:15.749
But when I have
a STORMRIDER in play,

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.050
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.119
negates your
Link Monster's special abilities

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:20.086
for a turn.

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.922
So even if you summon HEATLEO,

00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:22.889
it will do one thing,

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.391
which is nothing.

00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:26.293
That's the price you pay
for not mixing up your game.

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:28.361
It's a snap for me to figure out
what you two will do

00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:30.764
to stop you from doing
what you want to do.

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:31.265
Oh, yeah?

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:32.199
Then why don

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:33.400
't I go
and call an audible

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.602
that you've never
ever seen before!

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:38.672
When I have at least three
SALAMANGREATS in my graveyard,

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:40.774
I can summon
SALAMANGREAT BEAT BISON

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:42.576
from my hand!

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:45.913
And for every faceup card
you have on your field...

00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:47.748
BEAT BISON's special ability

00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:49.883
returns one Fire
Attribute Link Monster

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:52.752
in my graveyard
to my Extra Deck.

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:58.125
So I get back my SUNLIGHT WOLF.

00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:59.593
But that's not all.

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.428
For every card I retrieve,

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:04.665
I can then negate the effects
of one of your cards!

00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:06.133
What?

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:10.103
So I neutralize your
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE!

00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:11.571
(timer beeping)

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.607
(growls)

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:17.678
Next I activate my
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY!

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:20.314
It lets me use
a SALAMANGREAT Link Monster

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:23.617
to Link Summon another copy!

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:25.419
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:25.986
Rise again from the

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:28.422
valley of flames,

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.790
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.525
With STORMRIDER

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:33.493
TURBULENCE is offline,

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.330
His HEATLEO is now allowed
to use its special ability.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.164
And drop Windy's monste

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:40.534
r's
attack points!

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:41.836
Nicely done,

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.170
but not nice enough!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.837
By banishing GARGOYLEAD

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.239
from my graveyard,

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:48.642
I can destroy
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE

00:16:48.642 --> 00:16:50.844
and replace it
with STORMRIDER BLAST!

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:51.578
This Field Spell gives

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.480
all my STORMRIDERS

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.749
400 attack points!

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.317
(timer beeping)

00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:57.985
Plus for every

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:01.021
STORMRIDER Field Spell

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.056
in my graveyard,

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:04.090
they gain 300
more attack points!

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.192
(timer beeping)

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.395
Windy can raise its
attack points all he wants,

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:11.398
but HEATLEO's ability will
drop it down to nearly nothing.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.333
Oh, I haven't told you
the best part.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.036
If your Link Monster has
equal or fewer Links than mine,

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:17.704
it loses its special abilities.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.974
Your HEATLEO is Link 3
and twinsies!

00:17:19.974 --> 00:17:21.374
So's BAHAMUT BOMBER!

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.210
So your kitty cat is declawed!

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.212
And remember how I said
that was the best part?

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:26.647
It wasn't, this is.

00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:28.849
When I have a STORMRIDER
Link Monster in play,

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:30.350
your monsters
are forced to attack it,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.185
even if they're weaker
than mine.

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:34.721
So come here
and get decimated!

00:17:35.655 --> 00:17:36.690
(groans)

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.558
Oh, byte.

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.359
C'mon, no stalling.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:40.894
Bring it on.

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:43.497
HEATLEO...

00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:46.833
Sorry but you gotta attack
his BAHAMUT BOMBER.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:48.636
And not sorry

00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:53.040
but blow HEATLEO
into bite-sized bits!

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.476
My HEATLEO may've
been forced to attack,

00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.544
but it doesn't have
to be destroyed!

00:17:57.544 --> 00:18:00.647
(Flame)
By banishing BALELYNX
from our graveyard,

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:03.617
it protects HEATLEO
from destruction.

00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:04.385
(grunts)

00:18:04.385 --> 00:18:05.786
But you still take damage!

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:07.921
(timer beeping)
(groaning)

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.923
With that I end my turn.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:11.391
Too, too, too, too bad.

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:13.327
Here you were prepared
to deal me damage,

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:14.962
possibly big, big damage,

00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:17.397
but you're the one who took it
on the chin instead.

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:19.466
See, Flame, your earlier
analysis was right,

00:18:19.466 --> 00:18:21.469
you didn't have
the perfect setup for battle.

00:18:21.469 --> 00:18:24.438
But Soulburner overruled you
and it backfired.

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:26.072
Great partner, am I right?

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:31.211
It's my turn.

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:32.380
I'll start by activating

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.749
STORMRIDER SKYFISHER's
special ability

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:37.617
to automatically summon it
to my field.

00:18:39.387 --> 00:18:40.620
(computer chirping)

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.755
And in return,

00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:43.491
you get to retrieve
a spell or trap card

00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:44.958
from your graveyard.

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.794
Well, I only have one card
that fits that bill.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.464
Yes, your SALAMANGREAT ROAR.

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.467
But by using BAHAMUT
BOMBER's special ability,

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:54.935
I can immediately destroy it

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.771
and deal you
500 points of damage!

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:01.007
(timer beeping)

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:02.843
Next, I'll cyclone my circuit

00:19:02.843 --> 00:19:05.011
to call forth my newest monster!

00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:07.181
The summoning condition
requires one Level 2

00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:08.848
or lower STORMRIDER!

00:19:09.783 --> 00:19:10.951
I Link Summon!

00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:15.222
Link 1 STORMRIDERSHIP
STOLASTORM!

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.657
(computer chirping)

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:17.524
But that

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.026
's only the start.

00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:20.561
STORMRIDER BLAST's effect

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.563
pumps 700 more attack points

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.798
into my STOLASTORM!

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.333
(timer beeping)

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:29.303
Now BAHAMAUT BOMBER,
attack SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:30.337
Blow out its flames

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.807
with a huge gust of wind!

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:33.773
Or with your lasers.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.177
(shooting)

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:40.680
(blasting)

00:19:41.515 --> 00:19:42.282
(groans)

00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:44.218
(timer beeping)

00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:45.652
That was a tasty morsel,

00:19:45.652 --> 00:19:46.953
but I want more.

00:19:46.953 --> 00:19:50.056
STOLASTORM, destroy BEAT BISON!

00:19:58.732 --> 00:19:59.899
Oh, no...

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:02.603
Soulburner lost
all his monsters.

00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:03.770
They're getting bruised up

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.973
like a bag of juicy peaches!

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:07.941
This doesn't look good.

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:10.444
I activate STOLASTORM's
special ability

00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:13.848
to banish it from my field
until the next turn.

00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:16.449
Does that mean I can't attack
and destroy it?

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:18.718
That's exactly what it means.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.888
Not that we have any monsters
on our field

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:22.556
to destroy it with.

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:23.457
Shhhh!

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:24.191
Don't tell Soulburner that,

00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:25.025
he'll start crying and

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:26.893
blubbering like a beached baby.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.529
But let me let you in
on two secrets,

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:29.663
one, you're going to lose.

00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:30.864
And two,

00:20:30.864 --> 00:20:33.800
it will not, not,
not, not be painful.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.835
(Windy laughing)

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.670
Excellent, Windy.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.039
This duel is as good as yours.

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.808
It's your turn, Flameburner,

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:42.176
see what I did there?

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.445
And I can say quite certainly
that it will be your last.

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:45.813
And I know, I know.

00:20:45.813 --> 00:20:47.181
I'm tempting fate
by making such a declaration

00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:48.982
but jinxes and hoodoos
and voodoos

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:52.786
are a miniscule concern
when I have a lead this large.

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:56.023
Windy thinks that
he's already won.

00:20:56.023 --> 00:20:56.857
Well, Flame,

00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:58.025
if you look at the facts,

00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:01.061
it's not very hard to see
why he feels that way.

00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.929
He's got us outnumbered
in monsters

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.065
and life points and everything.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.433
So what you're saying is that

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.901
when we make a comeback
and win,

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.903
it will feel amazing?

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:11.538
That's exactly what I'm saying!

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:13.407
The best ever!

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:14.708
Aww, isn't that sweet?

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.376
You support each other
thru and thru,

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:18.912
through thick and thin
and every cranny in between...

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:22.216
even in your delusions!

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:22.749
Yeah!

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:23.350
You can mock us

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.252
all you want to...

00:21:25.252 --> 00:21:26.787
But Flame and I...

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:27.954
are gonna take you down,

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.457
and we're gonna
take you down together!

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.527
Words, words, words,
just words.

00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:36.062
Because I've already detected
cracks in your partnership,

00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:37.964
and when I break them wide open,

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:40.800
you'll both come tumbling down!

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.364
(electronic whirring)
