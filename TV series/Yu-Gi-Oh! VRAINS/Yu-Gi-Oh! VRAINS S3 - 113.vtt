WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.271
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.007
(gasps)

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.976
Was that island there before?

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.012
Better go check it out!

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:15.282
Mmm.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.450
Hi there, Soulburner!

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.519
Roboppi,

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.088
what're you doing
on this tiny little island?

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.458
This is my kingdom
an' I'm the ruler!

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.260
No trespassers
allowed,

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:28.162
so go away,
Soulburner!

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.631
I'm not leaving, Roboppi,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.333
not until you tell me
where Ai is hiding out, got it?

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.835
If you beat me,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.470
I'll tell you exactly where
you can find my Master.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:38.839
You're on.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.440
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:43.344
(Kolter)
Playmaker!

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.312
Soulburner found Roboppi.

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.480
I'm sending you
the coordinates now.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.987
(Ai)
So Roboppi's facing
that hothead Burnsie.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.521
This should be fun.

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.656
(Roboppi)
I Link Summon!

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.759
Link 2 APPLIANCER CELTOPUS!

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.598
Link 1 APPLIANCER PROPELION!

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.867
The devourer of dust!

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.069
APPLIANCER VACCULEPHANT!

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.039
(Soulburner)
Man...

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.641
He already summoned
three monsters

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.309
on his very first turn?

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:18.011
I may not rule the universe yet,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.413
but so far,
I'm rulin' this duel!

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.916
(laughs)

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:34.728
♪♪♪

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:32.953
C'mon...

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:35.288
You'd better get your going
going, Playmaker.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.724
Soulburner's duel
against Roboppi

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.259
has already started.

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:51.404
Huh?

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:57.978
Roboppi.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.381
Well hello there,
Playmaker!

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:03.016
It is awfully good
to see ya!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.786
But it'll also be good
to see ya leave.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.454
See, this is my kingdom.

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:09.356
And like my Master says,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.358
no meatbags are allowed here!

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.026
Not without a passport or visa.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.862
Where's Ai, Soulburner?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.899
If I win, he'll spill the beans.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.502
That's the info we're
dueling for, Playmaker.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.103
Yep, but that's
a big 'if'.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.504
See,

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.974
you're up against the future
ruler of the whole galaxy!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.844
And my Master says I have
more brains than a dinosaur!

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.846
And dinosaurs are big!
Meaning I have big brains!

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:35.048
Hard to believe
what you've become.

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:36.650
It's true,

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.118
I was just like every other
brainless robot

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:40.354
'til my Master dueled Bohman.

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:43.823
Then my brain reset
and went into overdrive!

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.294
That's when Ai's back up
triggered inside you no doubt.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.463
Master swore
he'd improve my AI...

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.065
And boy did he ever!!

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.033
And boy does it feel great!

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:53.834
Man...

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.502
Gotta admit I'm kinda jealous.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.172
If there was a switch
to make me smarter,

00:03:58.272 --> 00:04:00.340
I'd flip it,
maybe then I'd pass math--

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.110
Wait, I didn't pass math cuz
I never showed up to class.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.345
Point is,
since you're smart now,

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:07.181
you gotta know hurting
people isn't right.

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:08.715
That's why we want to find Ai,

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:10.750
so we can talk with him
and work things out.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:11.685
Yeah...

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.253
I might've believed you...

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.022
Back when I was a bot...

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.624
But now that I'm all grown up,

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.526
you can't trick me
and do ya wanna know why?

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.529
Becuase my noggin' knows
that you're trying to trick me.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:23.764
(Soulburner)
Uh no, I'm not.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.132
That's what
tricksters say

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.867
when they're trying
to trick you!

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.035
You want to know
where Ai is

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:30.904
so you can do bad stuff to him,
and I won't let ya!

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.573
Even if you weren't lying,

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.741
how can we work together
when I'm ruling

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.543
the whole universe!

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.513
Cuz I'll be ruling it
all by myself, ya know.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:42.082
That's right, absolute power!

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:45.353
Okay, maybe I'll give you
a teensy piece of the pie

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.686
and let ya run Earth.

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.389
I think that sounded
like an insult.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.393
Nah, insults aren't
my thing so you're good!

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.297
And the truth is,
you should be happy!

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.731
I'm letting you be a ruler

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.199
when you're not
even smart enough

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.667
to use a ruler.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.404
Okay, hold on,
this time around...

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.305
That didn't sound
like an insult.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.806
That was
an insult.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.409
Listen Roboppi,

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.244
I think there's
something wrong with you.

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:14.247
The Roboppi that I know is kind
and would never insult anyone.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.184
I think that the sudden
spike in your intelligence

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.986
has overwhelmed
your systems

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.320
and now you're
having trouble

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.155
processing all these
new feelings.

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.091
Instead
of dueling,

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.792
please let us
help you.

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:28.328
Let's talk things out instead
of fighting things out.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.597
C'mon, Playmaker, really?

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.799
You're trying
to trick me now too?

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.768
I thought you were
better than that.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:36.804
Bet ya wouldn't
want to talk it out

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.438
if your side
was winning.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.007
You're only saying
all of this stuff

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.741
because you're
losing.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.744
That's not true.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.145
Playmaker, there's
what we want

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.681
and what we get.

00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:49.483
And it sure feels
like we're getting a duel.

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.619
So let's duel
with all we've got!

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.653
Good luck with that!

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.325
R-O-B-O-P-P-I!

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.093
Beat those meatbags.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.262
Make them cry!

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:06.366
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.535
Time to take you down.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.641
Here goes... my draw!

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:19.880
I'll start by summoning
SALAMANGREAT GAZELLE!

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.320
I use its ability to send
my SPINNY to the graveyard.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.358
And doing so activates
SPINNY's ability.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.393
When there's
a SALAMANGREAT on my field,

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:36.229
I can resurrect it
from my graveyard.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.233
And with these two monsters

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.203
I will now build
the Overlay Network!

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:02.656
Watch this, Roboppi!

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.126
This wild steed blazes
through the tundra

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.095
to torch every illusion!

00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:10.130
I Xyz Summon!

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.267
Rank 3 SALAMANGREAT
MIRAGESTALLIO!

00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.039
Now, I'll use its ability!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.976
By using one of its
Overlay Units,

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:24.878
MIRAGESTALLIO summons
a SALAMANGREAT monster

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.981
from my deck in defense mode!

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:30.283
So here's SALAMANGREAT
JACK JAGUAR!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:32.986
And now I'll use them...

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:36.556
To Link Summon!

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:41.761
Link 2 SALAMANGREAT
SUNLIGHT WOLF!

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.833
Since I used
SALAMANGREAT MIRAGESTALLIO

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:48.702
to Link Summon my SUNLIGHT WOLF,

00:07:48.769 --> 00:07:50.938
its special ability activates,

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:51.972
which ends up sending

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.107
one monster back
to its owner's hand.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.577
So your PROPELION's turnin' tail
and going home!

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.780
That so isn't gonna happen.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:03.650
Because I'm activating
my spell APPLIANCER COATING!

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:08.188
It protects my APPLIANCER
from your special ability!

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.625
And I also get to draw a card.

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.794
You've stopped Plan A,

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.797
but there's plenty more letters
in the alphabet Roboppi!

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.799
By returning MIRAGESTALLIO
to my Extra Deck,

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.637
I can resurrect JACK JAGUAR!

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:28.342
And this summon triggers
SUNLIGHT WOLF's ability!

00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:31.044
When a monster is summoned
next to its link,

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:34.615
I retrieve GAZELLE
from my graveyard!

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.818
Yeah, I guess that's
pretty okay for a Plan B

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.553
but nothing too scary.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:42.556
So let's try Plan C then.
Go!

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.625
I Link Summon!

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:49.896
Rise, Link 1
SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX!

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:54.568
Due to BALELYNX's ability,

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.171
I get to draw SALAMANGREAT
SANCTUARY from my deck!

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.374
But I'm not done!

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:03.343
I'm firing up
my circuit a third time!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.580
The summoning conditions require

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.915
at least two Fire Effect
Monsters!

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.518
I Link Summon!

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.255
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.426
And I'll use HEATLIO'S ability

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:22.863
to send one of your spell
or trap cards back to your deck!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.031
Resounding Roar!

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.070
Whaaaat?

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.174
I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop messing with my cards!

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:36.610
Next, I activate
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY!

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:40.113
This Field Spell lets me use
a SALAMANGREAT Link Monster

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.250
to summon another copy
of that exact same monster!

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.620
Hey, I know this move.

00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.089
It's the one that's
been seriously scorchin'

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:50.957
duelists left and right!

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.462
Now rise again
from the valley of flames

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:58.098
to scorch the land
in a raging inferno!

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:04.070
I Reincarnation Link Summon!
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.374
I don't like this
Plan C one bit.

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:13.413
PROPELION vs HEATLEO?

00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:14.748
This is unreal.

00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:18.052
A fight between
their two top monsters!

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:22.389
But only one can be tiptop,
who will it be?!

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.962
(Soulburner)
Which monster should I fight?

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.897
Your CELTOPUS
is a tempting target

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.698
cuz it has 0 attack points,

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:33.133
but I know
that I can't attack it

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.835
when it's linked
to another monster.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:36.770
So that's out of the picture,

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:39.173
not that it was ever
in the picture to start with.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.408
Cuz I think it'll be
more fun to see

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:44.545
which of our top monsters
stays at the top!

00:10:44.612 --> 00:10:46.580
When HEATLEO is reincarnated,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.582
it can change
your monster's attack points

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:51.351
to become the same
as one that's in my graveyard!

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:53.554
BALELYNX has 500 attack points,

00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:56.890
so now, so will your PROPELION!

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.025
Flame Possession!

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:01.795
(grunts)

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:04.832
Ya know, all you're
doing is being annoying!

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:08.168
Your HEATLEO may have
2300 attack points,

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.137
but when my PROPELION battles,

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:11.806
it gains 1000 attack points

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:15.142
for every monster that CELTOPUS
is co-linked with!

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:18.645
Meaning my PROPELION
gains 2000 attack points,

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:21.748
powering it up
to a total of 2500.

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:24.819
Which is still more
than your HEATLEO's!

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:27.154
It may have more points for now.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:30.157
But that'll change when
I equip SALAMANGREAT CLAW

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:32.959
and SALAMANGREAT FANG
on to HEATLEO!

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:39.033
SALAMANGREAT FANG gives
HEATLEO 300 attack points

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.468
for every Link Arrow
that's on my field.

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:44.971
Since I have three,
HEATLEO gains 900 attack points!

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.441
(grunts)

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:51.312
And SALAMANGREAT CLAW's effect

00:11:51.412 --> 00:11:54.948
allows HEATLEO to attack
your monsters three times!

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:57.350
(grunts)

00:11:57.651 --> 00:11:58.185
Ha.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:11:59.486
Now Roboppi...

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.320
Let's fight!

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:03.257
HEATLEO!
Attack PROPELION!

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.494
I tricked you into attacking
my monster, Soulburner!

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.264
Sure, I told you
about CELTOPUS's ability

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:13.733
that powers up
my PROPELION to 2500.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.236
But what I didn't tell you about

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:18.405
is PROPELION's ability!

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:20.173
With it, once per turn,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.510
PROPELION cuts your monsters
attack points in half,

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:26.179
making your monster
weaker than mine!

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:36.390
But when HEATLEO is equipped
with SALAMANGREAT CLAW,

00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.727
then it cannot be
destroyed in battle!

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.561
And now that
the battle is over with

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:44.565
HEATLEO's attack points
return to normal.

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:47.101
CELTOPUS ability
is over for now too,

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:50.637
so PROPELION's attack points
drop back to 500.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.240
(grunts)

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:57.377
HEATLEO, attack PROPELION
for a second time!

00:12:57.678 --> 00:12:59.312
Blazing Blast!

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:04.485
CELTOPUS energizes
PROPELION back up to 2500!

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:06.453
Octo Charge!

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:08.622
Go right ahead

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:11.392
but this time PROPELION
can't use its ability

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:12.926
to weaken HEATLEO!

00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:19.499
(sighs)

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.769
Roboppi's feline is now offline.

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:24.772
Your monster isn't
the only thing

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.473
you're gonna lose, Roboppi!

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.909
You're losing life points too!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.645
When my HEATLEO destroys
your monster in battle,

00:13:31.778 --> 00:13:33.780
SALAMANGREAT FANG
deals you damage

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:36.616
equal to half your monster's
original attack points!

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.221
(grunts)

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.991
HEATLEO has one attack left!

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.659
Take out VACCULEPHANT!

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:47.827
Blazing Blast!

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:50.797
(grunts)

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.233
CELTOPUS's ability
gives VACCULEPHANT

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:56.870
1000 attack points to lessen
the damage that I take!

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:06.280
SALAMANGREAT FANG once again
deals you damage

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.950
equal to half of VACCULEPHANT's
original attack points!

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:12.519
(screams)

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.690
This duel started out rough,

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:19.726
but Souburner turned things
around quicker than quick.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.696
With that attack, I end my turn.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.364
You okay?

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.603
Course I'm okay.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.339
I just let my guard
down a lil' is all.

00:14:32.673 --> 00:14:33.640
Look Roboppi,

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.509
you know we don't
want to fight you.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.978
We just want
to know where Ai is.

00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:40.214
That's all.
Just tell us.

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.783
You really think
I'll just tell you

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.019
and betray my Master like that?

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:47.487
How about I do the opposite?

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.555
Defeat his enemy

00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:50.791
and make him proud
of me instead?

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:52.993
C'mon, I'm not your enemy.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.161
Do you remember
when we first met?

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:57.631
I asked if you were going
to be my new best friend

00:14:57.698 --> 00:15:00.234
and, well, you squeed
so I thought you were!

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:03.203
I used to think
you were my friend too

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.272
until you showed me
that you weren't!

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.075
That you didn't
really care about AIs!

00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:10.611
It's your fault
my Master's mad ya know!

00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:13.747
It's my fault?
How is it my fault?

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.384
Because...

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:19.119
You were supposed
to protect Flame.

00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:21.422
He was your partner,
he was your friend!

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:24.691
But you didn't protect him,
you let Bohman absorb him!

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:27.561
And then it was too late
to separate them.

00:15:27.628 --> 00:15:31.131
So all my Master could do
was watch as Flame got erased.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.866
And he tries to hide it

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:34.901
but I can tell
it tears him apart!

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.835
(gasps)

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.705
But none of this
would've happened...

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:43.076
had you been a good friend
and protected your partner!

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.544
Roboppi,

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.180
I wish we could
change the past.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.215
But we can't,

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.551
so the only thing we can
do is move forward,

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:54.021
and hope to not repeat
those same tragedies.

00:15:54.088 --> 00:15:56.623
That's just more talk
to try to trick me.

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:58.926
Everything that you say...

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.161
is a trick trick trick!

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:02.429
C'mon, man!

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.464
We are not trying to trick you!

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.136
Roboppi's brain
received a boost,

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.839
but his emotional programming
definitely didn't.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.141
This seems to have
resulted in a glitch

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:17.477
where Roboppi thinks no one
but Ai can be trusted.

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:20.981
There's only one way
to stop you from tricking me!

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:22.983
Beat you!

00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:27.321
My turn, Soulburner...

00:16:27.655 --> 00:16:28.989
to take you down!

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.824
I draw!

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:34.961
I summon APPLIANCER SOCKETROLL!

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.200
And I'll use it
to Plug in my circuit!

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.338
I Link Summon

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:47.807
Link 1 APPLIANCER KAPPA SCALE!

00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:53.781
And next up, I'm gonna activate
my Field Spell's effect!

00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:57.651
APPLIANCER ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD!

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.690
It lets me take SOCKETROLL
from my graveyard

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.892
and add it to my hand!

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:08.728
Next, I can tribute KAPPA SCALE
to activate its ability

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.398
and revive one APPLIANCER
Link Monster

00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:12.899
from my graveyard!

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:15.368
PROPELION!

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:16.536
Come on back!

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:23.743
And I'll use it
to Link Summon once again!

00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:27.747
Time to clean you up!

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:32.185
Link 1 APPLIANCER
LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:36.389
That's the monster
that you used to defeat

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:38.325
both The Shepherd
and Ghost Gal.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.492
Yep, that's right,

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.662
and now it's time
to run another load

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:44.998
and take out a load
of your life points, Soulburner!

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.500
Here I go!

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:49.370
LAUNDRY DRAGON,
attack SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:17:50.404 --> 00:17:53.640
But your LAUNDRY DRAGON
is weaker than my HEATLEO.

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.676
I know you're not
silly enough to attack

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:57.544
without another trick
up your sleeve.

00:17:57.878 --> 00:17:59.146
Yup, you're right.

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:02.949
CELTOPUS charges up
my DRAGON's attack points!

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:10.490
But it's still not strong
enough for you to win.

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:13.427
But that little fact
is about to change!

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.462
When LAUNDRY DRAGON
is co-linked,

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:17.764
its special ability activates!

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.602
First, we both don't take
any damage from this battle.

00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:23.370
And second, after the battle,

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:25.639
both our monsters are banished!

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:28.608
That means I'm gonna
lose my HEATLEO!

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.783
(grunts)

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:38.619
Next I play

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:41.955
the spell APPLIANCER RECYCLING!

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:45.459
When one of your monsters
leaves the field,

00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:47.961
APPLIANCER RECYCLING
lets me banish

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:49.629
one monster from my graveyard

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.998
and one monster
from your graveyard.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.969
So I banish APPLIANCER
KAPPA SCALE from my graveyard!

00:18:56.103 --> 00:18:58.772
And then banish
SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX

00:18:58.872 --> 00:19:00.440
from your graveyard!

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:02.376
But in exchange,

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:05.813
I get to revive one APPLIANCER
and summon it to my field,

00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:06.980
while you get to revive

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.549
one of your banished
Link Monsters

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.684
and summon it to your field.

00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:14.221
And neither monster can be
destroyed in battle this turn!

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:17.491
So then, which monster
are you bringing back?

00:19:17.858 --> 00:19:20.126
My trusty HEATLEO, that's who.

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:26.833
And I'm bringing back
my LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.205
LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.673
Hang HEATLEO out to dry!

00:19:35.442 --> 00:19:37.278
And when my DRAGON's
not co-linked,

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.145
it has a different ability!

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:41.515
Neither of us takes
any battle damage,

00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:44.451
but your monster's
automatically destroyed!

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:48.189
And then you take damage equal
to that monster's attack points!

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:52.025
Meanin' I'm getting'
rid of 2300 life points!

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.732
And due to APPLIANCER
RECYCLING's effect,

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:00.567
my LAUNDRY DRAGON...

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:03.003
can't be destroyed in battle!

00:20:09.643 --> 00:20:10.477
(grunts)

00:20:12.346 --> 00:20:15.348
(Playmaker)
Soulburner could've used
BALELYNX to negate that ability,

00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:17.718
if he had that monster
in his graveyard.

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:20.154
But Roboppi banished it
so that he wouldn't.

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:22.722
That's a top level technique.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.691
This duel isn't over yet!

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:27.694
I activate SALAMANGREAT
LEMMING's special ability!

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:30.130
By discarding it from my hand,

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:33.066
I get to summon
SALAMANGREAT GAZELLE!

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.372
Then due to GAZELLE's ability,

00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:42.343
I send one SALAMANGREAT
in my deck to the graveyard.

00:20:42.476 --> 00:20:45.345
If ya think that's gonna
change things, it won't.

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:48.115
I activate APPLIANCER REDUCTION!

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:50.684
It banishes the GAZELLE
you just summoned

00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:53.353
so it can ante-lope
on out of here!

00:20:55.122 --> 00:20:55.823
No!

00:20:56.524 --> 00:20:57.958
(Roboppi)
Then I get to draw a card

00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.928
for every different type
of APPLIANCER Link Monster

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:02.396
that's on my field.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.699
I'll go ahead and place
these two cards facedown

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.234
and end my turn.

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:09.870
The same robot
that cleaned our clocks

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:11.739
is now cleaning his!

00:21:12.072 --> 00:21:13.374
You're up, Soulburner!

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.242
Meaning it's your turn,

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:17.711
not that you're up
in life points or anything!

00:21:18.078 --> 00:21:19.412
(grunts)

00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:27.754
Pathetic meatbags,
they never stood a chance.

00:21:33.794 --> 00:21:38.798
