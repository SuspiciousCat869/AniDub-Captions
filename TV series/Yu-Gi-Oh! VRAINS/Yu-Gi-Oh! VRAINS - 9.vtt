(Playmaker)
Varis!

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.750
I only came here
for one reason.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.486
To acquire Playmaker's
Ignis from him.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:21.121
And you think I'll just
standby and do nothing?

If you want to
save Blue Angel.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.858
After all, it was our card

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.793
that infected her
with a virus.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.262
It was?

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.364
But I am in possession
of an antivirus

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.832
that can revive her.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.334
I'm challenging
Playmaker to a duel.

If Playmaker wins,

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.772
I'll give him the antivirus
to cure Blue Angel.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.806
But if I win,

I take his Ignis...

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:44.278
she will never
wake up again!

Do not make me
regret this later.

You know you're allowed to
say no to all this, right?

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.353

You better hope so

This is not an opinion--
it's a fact.

an Ignis,

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.590
Be careful, Yusaku.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.759
(Ai)
With what little data
we have on Varis,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.494
each nugget's
gotta come in handy.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.830
Then let's analyze
what we know.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.699
When I dueled one of
the Knights of Hanoi,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.701
he summoned a powerful
Cracking Dragon.

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.437
But since Varis is
the leader of the Hanoi,

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.005
he must have even more

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.174
powerful monsters
in his deck.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.844
(Ai)
Ugh... Cracking Dragon
was one tough nut to crack,

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.247
and you're telling me this
is gonna be worse?

00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:47.648
Don't tell me
you're scared.

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.950
(Ai)
Not as long as I go to
my Zen place.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.585
Aoooom...

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:53.286
Wait, I don't have
a Zen place.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.988
B-but it's fine!

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:56.791
Because no meat bag
in the universe

00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:00.093
has the processing
power to outduel me!

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.662
(Playmaker)
This is it.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:04.264
Ever since I laid eyes on you,

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.867
I knew this
moment would come.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:09.135
The moment to avenge
my past!

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:12.639
I am going to go
first in this duel.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.409
And by paying a thousand
of my life points...

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.744
... I can activate
my spell card

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.412
Dragonoid Generator.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.517
This allows me
to summon up to

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:26.186
two Dragonoid Tokens
every turn.

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:28.054
Take to the field!

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.660
(Ai)
He already has two monsters!

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.528
We've seen this
strategy before.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.363
I follow that up
by tributing

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:38.365
my two
Dragonoid Tokens,

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.100
which allows me
to summon...

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:43.403
... your old friend
Cracking Dragon!

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:46.139
(roaring)

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:57.518
(Ai)
Not Cracking Dragon!

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:59.486
That thing still
gives me nightmares!

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:01.421
Now that my turn is done,

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.590
Dragonoid Generator's
effect summons

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.092
a pair of Dragonoid Tokens
to your field

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.896
to match the two that
I have summoned to mine.

00:07:08.896 --> 00:07:10.464
(Ai)
Aww, sweet!

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:12.099
Unless there's a catch.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.733
Naturally.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.735
Has there ever
been a time

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.403
when there
wasn't a catch?

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:17.905
(Ai)
First time for everything?

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.406
This clearly
isn't one of them

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:22.142
because Varis will use this
summoning against us.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.981
Nothing gets past you,
now, does it, Playmaker?

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.616
But of course knowing
and surviving

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.885
are two entirely
different matters.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.421
Cracking Dragon's special
ability activates,

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.290
decreasing your
monsters' attack points

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.124
by 200 per Level!

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.094
And for every
point they lose,

00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:43.163
you suffer that same
amount as damage!

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.100
(Ai)
Humph!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.737
But you still left us with
two Tokens to work with!

00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:52.472
Which is plenty enough
for us to Link Summon!

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.242
My thoughts exactly.

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.277
I draw!

00:07:56.277 --> 00:07:57.444
Here I go!

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.713
Create the ultimate
circuit!

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:12.393
Link Arrows authorized!

00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:15.662
I require one monster
to Link Summon, so...

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:19.299
I now set a Dragonoid Token
in the Link Arrow!

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:23.336
Link the circuit!

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:28.808
I Link Summon
Link 1 Link Spider!

00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:35.716
(Ai)
Since Link Monsters
don't have Levels,

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.551
your Cracking Dragon's
special ability

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.686
can't activate to hurt us!

00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:41.855
(Playmaker)
Next, I activate

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.691
Link Spider's
special ability.

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.492
I can summon a monster
from my hand

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:47.360
to Link Spider's arrow!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:49.797
Come out, Bitron!

00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:50.697
Now!

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:55.335
Unlike your Spider,

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.471
that monster
does have a Level!

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.039
Take this!

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.182
Since Bitron
is a Cyberse Monster,

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:10.116
I'm now allowed to
summon...

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.253
... Backup Secretary!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.893
Summon all the peons
you like!

00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:20.727
Because
the more you do...

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:21.962
... the more you
trigger

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:23.764
my Cracking Dragon!

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.767
(Ai)
Ahh, I should've
brought my windbreaker.

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.235
Ahh...

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.003
I may have taken
damage,

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:32.272
but I can now
Link Summon again!

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.012
Link Arrows authorized!

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:40.414
This time
the summoning conditions

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.516
are two Cyberse Monsters.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:45.286
So I set my Bitron
and Backup Secretary

00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:47.387
in the Link Arrows!

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:50.357
Link the circuit!

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:55.028
I Link Summon
Link 2 Honeybot!

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.734
But I have no need to
stop at Honeybot...

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.570
because I can use her
to Link Summon again!

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.706
(Ai)
It's déjà vu, part two!

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.775
This Link Summon requires
at least two Effect Monsters.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.713
And my Link Spider and Honeybot
will fit the bill perfectly,

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:15.782
so I'm setting
them in the Link Arrows!

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.286
Link the circuit!

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:25.292
I Link Summon...
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:31.298
(Ghost Girl)
Playmaker Link Summoned
three whole times

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.433
just so he could get
Decode Talker?

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:34.735
Why go through all that sweat

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.270
when Cracking Dragon's
still stronger

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.071
than that purple fella?

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:41.041
Decode Talker
gains 500 attack points

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.176
for every monster
it's linked to.

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.548
Power Integration!

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.088
(Ai)
If only Varis placed
his Cracking Dragon

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:55.455
one space to the left

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:58.725
Decode Talker would've
gained 500 more attack points,

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.128
making our monster
stronger than his.

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.798
I can't believe
he got so lucky!

00:11:03.798 --> 00:11:05.966
That's one wrong way
of looking at it.

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.402
More like Varis
anticipated my tactics.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:09.603
(Varis)
That's right.

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:11.638
You're so utterly
predictable that I had

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:13.140
a counterstrategy
ready.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.442
You're not
the only one.

00:11:14.442 --> 00:11:15.910
What?

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.911
By tributing one
Dragonoid Token,

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.181
I can now summon
Capacitor Stalker

00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:22.349
from my hand to the field!

00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.355
And Capacitor Stalker's
special ability

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.457
energizes my
Decode Talker

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:33.360
with 800 additional
attack points!

00:11:37.764 --> 00:11:40.100
With 3,600 attack points
to wield,

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.301
Decode Talker now has

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.936
more than enough
power to crack your

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:44.605
Cracking Dragon
in half!

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:47.140
But your move shall
not go unpunished!

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.408
Cracking Dragon!

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:52.812
Zap away 1,000 attack points
from Capacitor Striker!

00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:57.818
And deal that thousand to
Playmaker's life points!

00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:58.785
(grunting)

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.559
That won't
slow me down!

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:12.566
Now, Decode Talker,
attack Cracking Dragon!

00:12:13.401 --> 00:12:16.002
Decode Destruction!

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:24.812
(Playmaker)
Decode Talker!

00:12:24.812 --> 00:12:26.680
Destroy Cracking Dragon!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.688
Not bad.

00:12:34.688 --> 00:12:36.690
Way to shish
that kebab!

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.559
(Ghost Girl)
Playmaker's improved his game.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:41.261
Cracking Dragon no longer
poses a challenge.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.730
Nicely done.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.731
(Varis)
Well, well,

00:12:43.731 --> 00:12:45.399
that was too easy
for you.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:47.534
But I do have much
more powerful monsters

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:49.036
waiting in my deck.

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:51.471
Then maybe you should've
summoned them!

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.007
Capacitor Striker!

00:12:53.007 --> 00:12:54.074
Go!

00:12:57.043 --> 00:12:59.346
With that attack,
I end my turn.

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:03.283
And Capacitor Stalker regains
all its attack points...

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.386
ready to face
whatever you've got.

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:07.488
(Ai)
Yup, but it won't be
anything special!

00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:09.122
I mean, look at his field.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.125
It's emptier than school
on a Saturday!

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:12.325
During a heat wave!

00:13:12.325 --> 00:13:13.627
In Antarctica!

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:15.429
He's out of resources
to summon anything

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:17.664
that could even
scare a mook like you.

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.233
Don't be so sure.

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:20.401
(Ai)
Huh?

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:21.969
I don't sense any fear

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.971
or insecurity
from him.

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:25.772
Even someone
as stoic as Varis

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:28.642
wouldn't be so calm if he
thought he was in trouble.

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.111
This fight has only
just begun.

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:32.780
(Ai)
I don't know.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.214
Maybe his avatar's
keepin' him cool,

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:36.483
but the real
Varis is in sweat city.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:39.653
Or maybe he's hoping you slip
off your board and get DQ'd.

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:42.089
Or maybe you need to
maintain your focus.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:45.091
(Ai)
Well, if you're trying to hurt
my feelings, you succeeded.

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:47.227
I mean, you didn't but I'm
trying to make you feel bad.

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.463
Though it may appear
as if you have the lead,

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.565
everything is proceeding
as I'd hoped.

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:54.467
(Ai)
That's what they all say
before they lose!

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:56.470
Watch and learn.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.038
I draw!

00:13:58.038 --> 00:13:59.039
This is just getting

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:01.341
worse and worse
for you, Playmaker.

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:03.610
I place this card
facedown.

00:14:07.148 --> 00:14:09.650
And when you have
a Link Monster on your field,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:10.784
I can summon this!

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:13.987
Gateway Dragon!

00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:19.226
True to its name,

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.997
this dragon will open
the gateway to my victory!

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:24.064
And it all begins

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:26.633
by activating
its special ability.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.170
Once per turn, Gateway Dragon
allows me to summon

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.871
another Dragon
from my hand

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.639
as long as its
Level is 4 or less.

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.710
Such as my Sniffer Dragon!

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:41.348
Sniffer Dragon has a special
ability of its own.

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:43.283
This monster sniffs out

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.652
another Sniffer Dragon
from my deck.

00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:47.555
But why
keep it in my hand...

00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:48.521
when I can summon it?

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:53.827
Never forget, Playmaker.

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:55.562
You're not the only one
who can Link Summon!

00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:09.009
Link Arrows authorized.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:12.112
I am required to have
two Level 4 or lower Dragons

00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:15.015
in order to fulfill the
summoning conditions.

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:17.084
Therefore I set
my Sniffer Dragon

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:19.119
and my Gateway Dragon
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:23.524 --> 00:15:24.524
Link the circuit!

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:29.263
I Link Summon...

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:31.364
Link 2
Twin Triangle Dragon!

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.439
Next, I pay 500 life points

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.175
to activate
its ability!

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.410
I can resurrect a monster
from my graveyard

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.945
and summon it next
to Twin Triangle's

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.780
link with one drawback.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.383
That monster is not allowed
to attack this turn

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:52.185
but such is the way of
things, isn't it, Playmaker?

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.454
Return to the field,
Cracking Dragon!

00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.793
It's all
falling into place.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.495
(Ai)
Heh-- that wasn't smart.

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:04.131
Why give up life points for
a monster that can't attack?

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.700
Especially when you have
barely any to start with.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.668
It's time.

00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:09.469
I'm activating my Skill.

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.405
One that you may be
familiar with, Playmaker!

00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:15.009
He didn't
care about his monster.

00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:16.843
He just wanted to lose
life points!

00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:18.178
(Ai)
But what's his Skill?

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:19.613
There's a bazillion of them.

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:22.315
Which ones require you to be
scraping by on life points?

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.852
I mean, other than
yours that is.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.687
Wait, you don't think...

00:16:26.687 --> 00:16:28.088
No one ever said that
two duelists

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.824
can't have
the same Skill.

00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:30.991
(Ai)
Aww, glitch!

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.293
As you already know,

00:16:32.293 --> 00:16:33.827
I can wield
the incredible power

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.596
of the Data Storm in
the palm of my hand.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.501
These winds
rage for me...

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.336
and me alone!

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:48.775
This wave
is much too modest.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:51.144
I demand more!

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:54.147
Now this is what a real
storm looks like, Playmaker,

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:56.150
you were just seizing
the breeze!

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.185
(Ai)
I don't wanna digitally drown!

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:12.433
Whoa!

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:14.968
(Ghost Girl whimpering)

00:17:14.968 --> 00:17:17.370
Ai said that the stronger
the Data Storm,

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.473
the more powerful
the monster that's inside!

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.246
I activate my Skill!

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:29.016
Once the fiercest monster
residing in these winds

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:30.651
is within my grasp,

00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:34.254
you have zero chance of
winning this duel, Playmaker!

00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:41.428
♪♪♪

00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:46.499
That's the monster
that I'm looking for!

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.001
Storm Access!

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:54.507
You're mine now.

00:17:56.811 --> 00:17:57.978
(gasping)
(Ai)
Hey!

00:17:57.978 --> 00:17:59.346
Storm Access
is my thing!

00:17:59.346 --> 00:18:01.247
Get your own thing,
you poser!

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:02.783
Ah, but I will be
the only one left

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:04.284
using this Skill...

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:06.387
after I delete you
from this world

00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:07.821
with my new
Link Monster!

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.324
Here I go!

00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:14.962
Link Arrows authorized!

00:18:14.962 --> 00:18:16.663
The summoning conditions
require

00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:18.932
at least two
Effect Monsters.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:20.334
I, however,
am going to set

00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:22.369
three of them in
the Link Arrows:

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:25.071
Twin Triangle Dragon
and Cracking Dragon,

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:26.706
along with my
Sniffer Dragon!

00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:30.877
Link the circuit!

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.882
(Ai)
Four arrows are glowin'!

00:18:34.882 --> 00:18:37.317
That means he's summoning
a Link 4 monster.

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:39.453
(Ai)
I've never seen
a Link that high!

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:41.254
♪♪♪

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:46.159
Ahh!

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:53.233
(Varis)
I Link Summon!

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:54.467
Behold the power of

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.870
Link 4
Topologic Bomber Dragon!

00:18:58.472 --> 00:18:59.807
I can barely hang on!

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:00.941
Ahh!

00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:02.175
(Ghost Girl groaning)

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.820
(Ai)
You got a plan,
right, Playmaker?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.987
Tell me you got a plan!

00:19:15.622 --> 00:19:17.291
Would that be fear
and desperation

00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:18.859
I hear
in your voice?

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:20.627
(Ai)
Umm... maybe?

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.196
He's just trying
to intimidate us.

00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:24.131
Decode Talker still has
more attack points

00:19:24.131 --> 00:19:25.699
than Bomber Dragon.

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.501
Yes, but only temporarily.

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.970
I activate
Dragonoid Generator's effect,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.205
which allows me to Summon
a Dragonoid Token!

00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:38.812
And that activates
Topologic Bomber Dragon's

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:40.681
special ability!

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:43.316
When a monster is summoned
next to its link,

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:46.120
Topologic Bomber Dragon
destroys all monsters

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.622
in both our
Main Monster Zones!

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:49.889
Oh no!

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:50.991
Annihilate them!

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:58.131
(groaning)

00:19:58.131 --> 00:19:59.866
(Ai)
No!

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:03.103
Your Decode Talker isn't
linked to any monsters now,

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:05.272
so its attack points
will plummet.

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:08.609
And it drops even further
because Capacitor Striker

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:10.477
no longer powers it up.

00:20:11.178 --> 00:20:12.612
Not so tough anymore.

00:20:12.612 --> 00:20:13.814
But you still
pay a price

00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:16.450
for destroying my
Capacitor Striker, Varis.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.853
When a special ability
destroys that monster,

00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:22.289
we both instantly
take 800 points of damage.

00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:30.163
Ah, you were short by
a hundred points.

00:20:30.163 --> 00:20:33.166
And that small difference
will cost you this game.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.635
(Ai groaning)

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:37.104
Topologic Bomber Dragon,
attack!

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:39.607
Take out his
Decode Talker!

00:20:39.607 --> 00:20:41.975
Malicious Mayhem!

00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:50.817
(groaning)

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:55.455
(Ai)
Phew-- we're still alive.

00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:56.456
Ha!

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:57.725
Did you really think that

00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:00.627
that was the end of
my assault on you?

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:02.363
Topologic Bomber Dragon

00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:04.865
activates
another ability!

00:21:04.865 --> 00:21:06.367
You take damage equal to

00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:09.369
your destroyed monster's
attack points!

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:12.673
This is not good!

00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:14.742
(Ai)
2,300 points of not good!

00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:17.043
This game is now over,
Playmaker.

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:19.546
Be gone and never return!
