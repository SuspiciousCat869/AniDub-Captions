WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.271
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:05.773
(Kolter)
Nice!

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.476
Soulburner's new monster
is now stronger than Roboppi's.

00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:11.311
Now BLAZE DRAGON!

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.613
Attack LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.483
(screams)

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.988
(Roboppi)
You... tried to destroy me...

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.423
And erase me from existence...

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.326
But I don't want
to be destroyed.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:31.464
LAUNDRY DRAGON!
Exterminate his BLAZE DRAGON!

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.270
I'm the only one that's
worthy to rule the universe...

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.272
Rule the uni-...
Rule the uni-...

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.509
Aww man.
Is he glitchin' out?

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.113
Roboppi ends his turn
without attacking.

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:49.116
Say what?
You're not attacking?

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.617
Take that back!

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.820
But Roboppi doesn't
want to attack.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.989
It's my prophecy to win!

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.925
Prophecy?
What's that?

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.862
Roboppi's systems overloaded.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.164
Here goes.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.300
HEATLEO, attack DRYER DRAKE!

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
Bye, my friends.
Roboppi wishes you good luck!

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.685
(Soulburner)
What's that?

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.325
It's a letter... from Ai.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:43.637
♪♪♪

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:50.270
This here is our ticket
to finding Ai.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.739
(Varis)
Which is why you'll
be giving it to me.

00:02:58.612 --> 00:02:59.613
Well, well...

00:02:59.747 --> 00:03:01.848
This just became interesting.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.185
Great, Varis.

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:05.552
What's he want?

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:07.320
And what exactly makes you think

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.023
that we would hand
this over to you?

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.891
We both want the same thing.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.526
To stop the Dark Ignis.

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.496
What you want and I want
differ greatly, Varis.

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:17.230
Either way...

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.565
Hand it over to me.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.000
No chance.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.136
This letter isn't
addressed to you.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:24.505
It's addressed
to Playmaker.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.507
I don't care if it's addressed
to the Loch Ness Monster,

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.344
if it has the Dark Ignis's
location, I want it.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:33.280
You really can't take no
for an answer, can ya?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.283
You should realize
that I'm doing you a favor.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.286
You don't have it in you
to do what must be done.

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.123
The Dark Ignis isn't
going to stop the war

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.190
just because you two
have a nice conversation

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.792
over tea
and cookies.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.829
The Dark Ignis
is only going to stop

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.699
if I erase it permanently
from existence.

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:54.468
And you can't do that,
and I don't blame you.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.503
You two have a long history.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.306
And that history gets
in the way of what must be done.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:02.576
So if you can't do it, I will.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:04.445
No, you won't.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.747
You heard him so you
can take your offer

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.415
and dump it in the trash.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:09.916
Besides, Varis,

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.752
even if you wanna
go after Ai,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.422
me and you, we have
some unfinished business.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.260
We never finished
our last duel.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.095
So why don't we
finish it now?

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.596
Why even bother.

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.799
It's just going to be
an easy victory for me.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.734
But I never go back on my word,

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.037
so let's get this duel started.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.739
Are you sure about this,
Soulburner?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.110
I've never been more sure
in my entire life.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:37.711
But let's have
some stakes.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.013
If I win, you'll have
to hand over that letter.

00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:43.784
Okay, but if I win,

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:45.919
you agree to leave
Ai alone forever!

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.455
That's fine by me

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:49.923
because if I'm not
capable of defeating you,

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:52.359
then that means
I'm not good enough...

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:53.928
to defeat a toaster.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.930
Well, you'll find out
I'm no toaster!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.469
For a duel of this magnitude,

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.272
I have the perfect
venue to do it justice.

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:07.073
(sighs)

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.812
This is the facility
where they locked us up

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.346
during the Lost Incident.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.117
This is way not cool,
even for you!

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.085
There's nothing cool
about reminding them

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.186
about the worst
time in their lives!

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:21.655
My, oh my...

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.957
You sure are a mean one, Varis.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.927
(Varis)
This is where everything
began for all of us.

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.361
So it's only fitting

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.932
that this is where everything
will end for you, Soulburner.

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.832
(grunts)

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.476
Thanks for the reminder,
not that I needed it.

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:45.779
The Lost Incident took
everything from me, everything.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.147
You have
to stay calm.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.450
Don't worry, I am calm.

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:51.786
I've never been
more calm in my life.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:52.986
But the fact remains.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.488
If it wasn't for you, Varis,

00:05:54.622 --> 00:05:56.456
the Lost Incident
would never have happened.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.159
And I'll make you
pay for that crime.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.328
Once again,

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:04.197
your facts about my involvement
are incorrect,

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.233
but I'm not here
to debate history.

00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:08.369
It's time to bring
the past to an end

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.470
if there's any hope
for a future.

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.872
For any of us.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.548
(Both)
It's time!
Let's duel!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.654
(Both)
It's time!
Let's duel!

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:30.891
Since you chose the setting,

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.361
I get to choose
to go first, Varis!

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.996
I summon SALAMANGREAT WOLVIE!

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.433
Next I activate
the spell FURY OF FIRE!

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.639
I'll only be allowed
to summon one monster

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:48.242
from my Extra Deck this turn,
but in exchange,

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:49.476
I can summon

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:52.546
two more SALAMANGREATS
from my hand in defense mode!

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:57.183
Soar, SALAMANGREAT FALCO
and SALAMANGREAT PARRO!

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.556
Now I'll use these two
to blaze my circuit!

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:07.895
The summoning conditions
require two Fire Monsters.

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:11.631
So I set FALCO and PARRO
in the Link Arrows!

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.667
I Link Summon!

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:17.571
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:23.977
You always summon
that monster, don't you?

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:26.247
I place one card facedown.

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:28.449
I end my turn.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.218
This sequence of moves
seems familiar.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.652
Heeeey!

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.121
Check that out.

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.457
He's using the same exact
opener as their last duel.

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.092
Seems like he's picking up...

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.562
right where they left off.

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.797
Since you've seen
these moves before

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.300
I don't want any excuses
when you lose.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.434
Don't you worry.

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.603
I was never planning
to make excuses

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.606
because I was never
planning to lose this duel.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.375
Now get ready!

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.108
I draw!

00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.110
I'll start things off

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.246
by activating
BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH!

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:01.448
This Field Spell
gives me the power

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.183
to summon
up to two ROKKET monsters

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:05.018
from my hand in defense mode.

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:08.389
Therefore I'm going to summon
my SILVERROKKET DRAGON

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:10.824
and ANESTHROKKET DRAGON!

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.227
Then BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH's
second effect

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.530
gives my ROKKETS
300 more defense points.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.335
Now watch as I manifest
my circuit!

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.372
I set ANESTHROKKET DRAGON

00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:28.174
and SILVERROKKET DRAGON
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.678
I Link Summon!

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.447
Link 2 QUADBORREL DRAGON!

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:38.151
But that's only the beginning!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.687
By discarding just one card,

00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:43.490
QUADBORREL can
destroy your monster.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:47.727
So I discard ROKKET RECHARGER
to destroy your HEATLEO!

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.332
(groans)

00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:56.336
But there's more
to QUADBORREL DRAGON's ability.

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.506
When it destroys
a Link Monster...

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.340
I get to summon or revive

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.177
a ROKKET monster
for every one of its links!

00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:05.546
Your HEATLEO had three links!

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:08.448
So three ROKKETS
join the battle!

00:09:09.683 --> 00:09:13.254
Next I activate NOCTOVISION
DRAGON's special ability!

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:15.055
It triggers whenever I summon

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.357
even a single
Dark Attribute Dragon,

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.527
and I summoned
a whole field of them!

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.096
I'm now allowed to summon

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.565
NOCTOVISION DRAGON
in defense mode!

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:30.904
That's four monsters.

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:32.239
This isn't good.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:33.374
And now...

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.742
I manifest my circuit again!

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:40.580
The summoning conditions require
at least three Effect Monsters!

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:42.383
I Link Summon!

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:45.418
Link 4 BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.261
Exactly what I didn't
want to see.

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.397
Due to NOCTOVISION's ability,

00:09:56.764 --> 00:10:00.233
when it's used to Link Summon,
I can draw a card from my deck!

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.403
My monsters have a total
of 4000 attack points,

00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:05.539
which is enough
to defeat you.

00:10:05.606 --> 00:10:07.908
And you have no monsters
to defend with!

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.844
Well this duel certainly
was a fast one.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.946
I didn't even get
my popcorn yet.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.182
(Soulburner)
Argh!
This is the worst!

00:10:15.249 --> 00:10:16.884
I've been wanting
this duel forever

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.085
and it's already ending?

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:19.619
You got what you want,

00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:21.355
but I'm giving you
what you deserve

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:22.589
for challenging me!

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:25.959
(groans)

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.299
This duel is over.

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:34.434
One last attack
from BORRELOAD DRAGON

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.736
and Soulburner's
out of life points.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.106
It's a hard lesson to learn.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.341
But you were never
close to my level!

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:45.078
BORRELOAD DRAGON,
attack and end this duel!

00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:54.754
(Varis)
BORRELOAD DRAGON!
Attack!

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:58.425
Looks like you fell
into my trap, Varis!

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:01.328
A trap known
as SALAMANGREAT GEYSER!

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.632
By returning HEATLEO
to my Extra Deck,

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:08.468
my trap drops your monster's
attack points!

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.770
BORRELOAD loses
a thousand attack points

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.441
for every link that HEATLEO has
until the end of the turn!

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.243
HEATLEO has three links,

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.280
so your BORRELOAD DRAGON
loses 3000 attack points!

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:23.450
(grunts)

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:24.652
And then...

00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:27.755
I get to draw a card
for every Link Monster

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.356
that's on your field!

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.593
Guess this duel isn't over yet.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:34.828
Nice one!

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:35.963
That was close!

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:39.866
Are you actually celebrating
the fact that you survived?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.068
Clearly, these moments
must be rare.

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:44.572
I end my turn.

00:11:44.838 --> 00:11:48.075
So SALAMANGREAT GEYSER's effect
also comes to an end.

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:51.311
And BORRELOAD DRAGON
regains its attack points.

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:54.414
You really thought you were
gonna win in a single turn.

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:57.484
You know to never
underestimate your opponent.

00:11:57.985 --> 00:11:59.686
I don't know if you
were being disrespectful

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.421
or just plain silly.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.689
Soulburner,

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:04.591
I can assure you that
it's one of the two,

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.226
and it wasn't silly.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.360
Yeah, right.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.063
My turn!

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.332
I feel like Varis
was brought into this world

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.667
for the sole purpose
of ruining my life.

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.635
If he thinks he's
gonna get some kudos

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:19.006
for stopping the Lost Incident,
he's not getting any from me.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:22.008
Just looking at this place
brings back memories,

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:24.345
and none of them are good.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:27.715
Instead, he's gonna
pay for his crimes!

00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:31.685
I'll start my turn by summoning
SALAMANGREAT SPINNY!

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:36.990
And use it
to blaze my circuit!

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:39.893
I Link Summon!

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:43.263
Link 1 SALAMANGREAT BALELYNX!

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:44.564
Next up,

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:47.234
I activate SALAMANGREAT
GAZELLE's ability!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.204
When a SALAMANGREAT
goes to the graveyard...

00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:53.473
I can automatically
summon it from my hand!

00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:59.180
And my BALELYNX
is no slouch either!

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:02.215
Now, whenever I Link Summon
this monster,

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:05.952
I can draw SALAMANGREAT
SANCTUARY from my deck!

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.756
And I got more
abilities I can use!

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.959
Whenever I successfully
summon SALAMANGREAT GAZELLE,

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.493
its special ability sends

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:15.929
one card in my deck
to the graveyard.

00:13:16.563 --> 00:13:19.399
So FUSION OF FIRE
goes to the grave!

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:22.602
But I'll now bring a monster
back from the graveyard!

00:13:22.702 --> 00:13:25.772
I can resummon SALAMANGREAT
SPINNY from my graveyard

00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:26.640
when I already have

00:13:26.774 --> 00:13:28.975
another SALAMANGREAT
on my field!

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:32.580
Another monster that's
weaker than mine.

00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:34.714
That may be the case for now,

00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:36.617
but I can use those
weak monsters

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:38.585
to build the Overlay Network!

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:56.603
I Xyz Summon!

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.111
This wild steed blazes
through the tundra

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.179
to torch every illusion!

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:10.351
Rank 3 SALAMANGREAT
MIRAGESTALLIO!

00:14:10.818 --> 00:14:13.053
Next, I activate its ability!

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.022
By using one Overlay Unit...

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:17.824
MIRAGESTALLIO summons

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:21.027
a SALAMANGREAT from my deck
in defense mode!

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.364
Here comes SALAMANGREAT
JACK JAGUAR!

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:27.701
Now I'll use BALELYNX

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.704
and MIRAGESTALLIO
to Link Summon again!

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.643
Link 2 SALAMANGREAT
SUNLIGHT WOLF!

00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.148
My army's getting
stronger and stronger!

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.284
Yeah...

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.852
But even after all that,

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.687
Soulburner's
monsters are no match

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.121
for BORRELLOAD DRAGON.

00:14:48.355 --> 00:14:51.058
(Playmaker)
With every new monster
that Soulburner summons,

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.527
his strategies
become more robust.

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:54.962
But the question is,

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:58.332
how many monsters can he summon
before he runs out of steam?

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:01.101
Once again...
I'll Link Summon!

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:03.937
But this is no
ordinary Link Summon!

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:06.840
I Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.944
Link 2 SALAMANGREAT
SUNLIGHT WOLF!

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:16.049
When my SUNLIGHT WOLF
reincarnates,

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:19.219
its special ability activates,
letting me recover

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:21.288
a SALAMANGREAT
spell or trap card

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:22.722
from my graveyard!

00:15:24.592 --> 00:15:27.594
So, I get back my spell card
FUSION OF FIRE!

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.564
Next, JACK JAGUAR's ability
activates!

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.767
By returning SALAMANGREAT
SPINNY to my deck,

00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:36.169
JACK JAGUAR resummons itself!

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:41.608
And doing so triggers
SUNLIGHT WOLF's special ability!

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.344
I get to retrieve
SALAMANGREAT WOLVIE!

00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:46.613
Then due to WOLVIE's
special ability,

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:49.282
I get to retrieve another card
from my graveyard!

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.053
My trap, SALAMANGREAT GEYSER!

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.256
Why do you keep recycling
those same useless cards.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.524
Because...

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:01.261
What you think is useless
is not useless now!

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:02.696
I set SUNLIGHT WOLF

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.998
and JACK JAGUAR
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:08.969
I Link Summon!

00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:12.973
Link 3 SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:25.018
HEATLEO's ability activates!

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.421
Sending one of your spell
or trap cards

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.322
directly back into your deck!

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.025
Resounding Roar!

00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:34.762
I see...

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.864
Since you know that you
can't overpower my monsters,

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.600
you're picking off
whatever you can

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:41.769
in an attempt
to create an opening.

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:42.970
But it won't work.

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.673
Last time I checked,
you're no psychic.

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.173
So you don't know that.

00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:49.309
Wrong. I do know!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.779
When I banish NOCTOVISION
DRAGON from my graveyard,

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:56.516
it protects my facedown card
from your special ability!

00:16:57.151 --> 00:16:57.984
What?

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.256
In other words...

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.524
HEATLEO's ability
has gone cold.

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.226
In that case...

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.997
I activate
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY!

00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:14.034
This Field Spell lets me use
HEATLEO to Link Summon itself!

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.541
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:24.011
Rise again
from the valley of flames,

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.346
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:31.985
And then when my SALAMANGREAT
HEATLEO is reincarnated,

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.054
it can change
your monster's attack points

00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:36.557
to become the same
as one that's in my graveyard.

00:17:37.258 --> 00:17:39.759
So your QUADBORREL DRAGON's
attack points

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:43.897
become the same
as BALELYNX's, just 500!

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.435
Oh yeah!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:50.871
Now I activate the spell card
FUSION OF FIRE!

00:17:51.372 --> 00:17:53.407
I can use your QUADBORREL DRAGON

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.743
to Fusion Summon a new
SALAMANGREAT monster!

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.846
A Soulburner surprise!

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.414
This is getting good.

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:02.883
You will do no such thing!

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.217
(sighs)

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:06.720
(Varis)
I tribute my QUADBORREL DRAGON

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:10.457
in order to activate the trap
BORREL BUSTER BARRIER!

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:13.627
I equip it
on to BORRELOAD DRAGON

00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:14.762
and place a Counter

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:17.597
for every link
that QUADBORREL DRAGON had.

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.569
Now that QUADBORREL DRAGON
is gone, Soulburner,

00:18:22.636 --> 00:18:24.371
you'll have to use
your own monsters

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:25.639
to Fusion Summon.

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:27.207
Well, well...

00:18:27.274 --> 00:18:29.610
Varis has squeezed
Soulburner's options

00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:31.378
like a bottle of ketchup!

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:32.813
(grunts)

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:34.915
Next time you talk trash,

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:37.584
you really should make sure
you can back it up.

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.552
Well I'm gonna back up
a dump truck

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.554
and dump the trash
back on your lawn

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.123
cuz I'm still gonna
Fusion Summon

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:44.291
using my monsters!

00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:46.259
I fuse my WOLVIE...

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.296
with the HEATLEO on my field!

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.437
When the flames consume the old,

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:59.740
a new creature emerges
to reign supreme!

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.609
SALAMANGREAT VIOLET CHIMERA!

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.379
When VIOLET CHIMERA is summoned,

00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:08.348
it gains half the attack points

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.817
of the two monsters
I used to summon it.

00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:13.988
Since SALAMANGREAT WOLVIE
and SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO

00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:16.457
have a combined
4000 attack points...

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.359
VIOLET CHIMERA gains
2000 attack points,

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.461
raising it to 4800!

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.832
That means it's stronger
than my BORRELOAD.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.935
Unreal,

00:19:28.002 --> 00:19:29.703
Soulburner
just turned the tables

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.639
and reset all the silverware.

00:19:32.006 --> 00:19:33.107
Just to be safe,

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:35.109
I equip VIOLET CHIMERA

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.844
with the Equip Spell
SALAMANGREAT KERNEL!

00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:40.514
Here I go!

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:45.018
VIOLET CHIMERA attack
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.221
And for more damage,

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.190
if you battle a monster
that's equipped

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:51.959
with SALAMANGREAT KERNEL,

00:19:52.026 --> 00:19:54.728
your monster loses
800 attack points!

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.196
What?

00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.401
Sweet, Soulburner!

00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:01.935
You're not the only one

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:04.505
that can lower
their opponent's attack points.

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:06.173
My BORRELOAD can reduce

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:09.109
a monster's attack
points by 500.

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:11.678
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it!

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:17.951
But my monster is still
stronger than yours!

00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:21.021
And just wait,

00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:22.857
it's going to get
even more powerful!

00:20:23.224 --> 00:20:25.526
Since your monster's
attack points changed,

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:28.328
VIOLET CHIMERA's
attack points double!

00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:32.399
It has 8600 attack points!

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.835
That's enough to end this duel!

00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:37.838
I activate
BORREL BUSTER BARRIER's effect!

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:39.773
By removing one Counter,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.775
the damage I take
is cut in half!

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:45.512
(groans)

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:49.683
Now, since the battle's over,

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:53.220
VIOLET CHIMERA's attack points
are no longer doubled.

00:20:54.054 --> 00:20:55.989
I place one card facedown

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.691
and end my turn.

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:00.760
You played everything you
had to try to take me down,

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:02.529
but you failed.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.432
Oh I have plenty
of resources left,

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:07.901
unlike the life points
you have left.

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:09.369
(thunders)

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:10.604
Hmmm.

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:13.107
Any duelist worth
a grain of salt

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.075
knows that a duel isn't over

00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:17.544
as long as you have
a single life point.

00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:22.949
And I am not one you should ever
give a second opportunity to.

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:35.528
