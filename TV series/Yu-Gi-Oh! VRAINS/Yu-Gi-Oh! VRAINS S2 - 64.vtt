WEBVTT

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:04.971
(Takeru)
Yusaku wait up.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.241
You're heading over to
Kolter's truck right?

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.177
Mind if I tag along
with you?

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.613
I found something that's
really gonna blow his mind--

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.514
(Shima)
Yusaku, Yusaku, Yusaku!

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.751
I know you've been
keeping secrets from me.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.620
A big one.

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:23.590
You and me need to have
a little chat, privately.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:26.626
Sorry, I'm kind of in the
middle of something Shima.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:28.495
Huh?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.197
That's too bad.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.200
'Cause I think you'll want
to hear what I have to say

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:35.835
'cause I'm not playing around

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.906
and you shouldn't
make me annoyed.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.007
If you catch my drift.

00:00:40.074 --> 00:00:42.142
Hey man it's cool.

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.811
We can catch up later.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.445
Enjoy your pow wow.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.183
Okay what is it Shima?

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.087
We can't talk out here.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.021
It's way too public.

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.358
'Cause you don't want
this secret getting out.

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.424
(Ai)
Ah this is the life.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:06.460
While millions of meatbags
are crammed down there like,

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.098
well meat in a bag, I got
the whole sky to myself.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.566
(Kolter)
Hey Ai!

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.468
Get down here a sec.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.104
I have a surprise for ya.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.439
A surprise, for me?

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.443
Huh surprise, surprise.

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:26.046
I figured as long as
your flying up there,

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.116
you can help me out with
some aerial advertising.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.752
I'm the most sophisticated
AI in the world,

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.956
but you're treating
me like a coupon! Huh!

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:38.158
(Ai)
That's Soulburner.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.760
He usually clings
to Playmaker

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.162
like a sock that just
came out of the dryer.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.431
So what's he doing
here all alone?

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.800
I smell something fishy.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.102
And fish sticks aren't
on Kolter's menu.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:50.604
Ow!

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:53.974
Ah!

00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:59.579
Since when did Duel Discs
start falling out of the sky?

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:03.217
Flame is it just me or does
that look like Ai right there?

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:05.653
It's most definitely him.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:09.056
I'd recognise that lazy
splayed out look anywhere.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:10.657
I wasn't
splayed out!

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.059
I got laid out.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.462
Yes by a flagpole
that you ran into.

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:18.632
But wait, that means
you can fly now?

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.234
(laughing)

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.870
That's right I can fly.

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:23.670
Get it?

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:24.971
Nice one.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.708
Theodore, this
gives me an idea.

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.176
Perhaps it would be
helpful

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.478
if I had a mode of
transportation as well.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.714
Nothing as silly
as a flying drone

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.117
but a 12 cylinder flame mobile.

00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.054
Think how much you'll save
on bus fare to school.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.854
Flame.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.190
I would rather
walk to school.

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:44.958
(Kolter)
Hey Teddy.

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.526
What brings you down here?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.229
Kolter, just the
person I wanted to see.

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:53.200
I know it's a bit late but

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:56.670
I never thanked you for saving
me from the Shepherd's trap.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.706
This isn't much
but I brought you a snack.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.674
Oh yeah?

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.075
You didn't
have to go through

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.777
all that trouble
on my account.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:06.179
Yeah and it looks
like he didn't.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.615
A single bag of goodies?

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:11.185
I know you said it wasn't
much and you're right.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:12.452
(Kolter)
Be nice.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.454
This is one more
bag of goodies than

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.790
I had this morning,
so that's way awesome.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:17.724
Thanks bud.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.429
You got my snack
so I got yours.

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:23.798
Take a load off
and I'll sling you a dog.

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:26.634
(Ai)
Speaking of loads,
where's Playmaker?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.769
Is his GPS on the fritz?

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:31.205
(Flame)
Actually he's
still at school.

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.340
Ooh did he
get detention?

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:36.377
No, he's meeting with
the one known as Shima.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.344
Shima?

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.447
Oh that would be
worse than detention.

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:45.085
(Yusaku)
I think we're alone
now, Shima.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.622
Well yeah but you can
never be too careful right?

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.923
What do you mean?

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:53.593
What I mean is,
you got careless Yusaku.

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:57.631
Or should I call you
Playmaker?

00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.200
(Shima)
That's right,
I know your secret.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:02.169
But what I'm gonna do with this

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.471
information all depends on you.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.676
(Takeru)
Hoo I'm stuffed.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.845
I don't know what's
more amazing Kolter,

00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:13.947
your delish
hotdog sandwiches

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.082
(Flame)
What?

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.818
or all this hacking hardware
that you fit into your van.

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.453
They're just tools
I use to get the job done.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.590
The real hacking's done up here.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.192
I can totally see

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:27.427
why you and Playmaker
make up the perfect team.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.798
You, Kolter, are the brains
while Playmaker's the brawn.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.133
(Ai)
As if!

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:32.933
Brawn?

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.368
With his spaghetti arms?

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.470
Them two were
scrambling like eggs

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.839
to get anything done
until I showed up.

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:42.109
Yes with your
spaghetti arms.

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:44.077
But I am curious
Kolter,

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.246
what led you to
collaborate with Yusaku?

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.183
Well it's, it's a long story.

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.518
(Ai)
Those are
the best stories!

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:55.455
Come on, story time,
tell us all the deets.

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:56.523
Leave nothing out.

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:59.793
(Ai)
Except for the boring
parts, skip those.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:01.561
All right.

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.333
I'll tell you how Yusaku and
I started working together.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.002
(Kolter)
But I gotta warn you,

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:11.171
if you're looking for a happy
tale, this isn't one of them.

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.175
The story begins when
Jin went missing.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:18.745
I didn't know it at the time
but my little bro got caught up

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.648
in the Lost Incident,
just like you and Yusaku.

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.415
I see!

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:25.586
I know it was
worse for Jin

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:27.588
but it wasn't easy
for me either.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:28.856
It was six months man.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.491
(Kolter)
Six months of
not knowing.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.393
Searching every day
and finding nothing.

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:35.896
But the one thing I never
did was give up hope.

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.998
So when I got the call
that they'd found him,

00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:39.767
I thought the worst was over.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.435
But, as it turns out, Jin's

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.403
troubles were only
getting started.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.409
Hey Jin, welcome home.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:49.843
Did you miss me buddy?

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.078
'Cause let me tell ya
I really missed you.

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.248
We got a lotta
catching up to do.

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:56.417
(Kolter)
But first, I got
a treat for you.

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:57.717
The park!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.153
'Cause I know you love
to feed the birds and...

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:02.656
Ah!

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:03.823
(Kolter)
Jin?

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.926
You okay Jin?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.828
Say something bud.

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:08.662
Please!

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.269
Jin was a friendly outgoing kid

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:18.805
but the Jin that left wasn't
the Jin that came back.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:21.442
His personality
hadn't just changed,

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:23.543
it was totally gone.

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:25.612
I asked everybody for answers.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:29.083
The police, the medics but
no one was giving anything

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:33.086
to a 14 year old kid except
for a pat on the head.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.389
And even if they wanted
to tell me something,

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:38.625
they couldn't because,
as we know now,

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:40.160
the entire Lost Incident was

00:07:40.227 --> 00:07:42.730
covered up as if
it never happened.

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.498
So I made my decision.

00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.667
If no one's going to save Jin,

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:48.802
then I'll have to do it myself.

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.738
And the first step
was to find out

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.473
everything I could
about the Lost Incident.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.275
Because the thing
about cover ups

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:58.145
is that the truth's
hidden but not erased.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.580
So I scoured every
text book I could find

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.017
to teach myself how to code
because I knew the info

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.885
had to be hiding
out there in some

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:07.487
random computer
waiting to be hacked

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:09.790
and that's when
I stumbled across a file

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.859
linking the Knights of Hanoi
to the Lost Incident.

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:15.462
Call it being brave
or call it being naive

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.064
but I knew I had
to step foot into

00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:19.833
Link VRAINS and
track the Hanoi down

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:23.103
and to tell you the truth,
they weren't that hard to find

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:27.007
because they were everywhere,
hunting for Cyberse cards.

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:30.978
(explosion)

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.811
Ah!

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:36.717
You ambushed me.

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.652
That wasn't fair.

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:40.387
Fair or not, a loss is a loss

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:42.623
so hand over your Cyberse cards.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:46.193
Which we'll delete, just
like we'll be deleting you.

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:46.994
What?

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:47.861
Delete me?

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.962
(Knight of Hanaoi)
Yes.

00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:52.732
The Hanoi don't ever leave
eye witnesses behind.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.001
Did you actually
think we would let you

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.004
get away after you've
seen our faces?

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.004
Oh no.

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:04.711
So long.

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:07.747
Ah!

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:11.218
(Knight Of Hanoi)
Keep up the hunt guys.

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:13.353
Erase every duelist you find.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:16.957
(Knight Of Hanoi) Like
the one hiding in the alley?

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.092
(Knight Of Hanoi)
Oh exactly.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:21.028
Yeah guy in the red hat,
we're talking about you.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.862
You didn't think we saw you?

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.633
(Knight Of Hanoi)
We have a runner.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:37.278
Come on, get him.

00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:38.612
He went that way.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.081
(Knight Of Hanoi)
It's a dead end.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:42.782
He ain't getting away now.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:44.951
(Yusaku)
You down there.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:48.955
Take my hand.

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:53.093
If you do want my
help, I suggest

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:53.960
you hurry.

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:56.196
Right.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.038
(Knight Of Hanoi)
Where'd he go?

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:08.108
We lost him.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.442
(Knight Of Hanoi)
That's impossible.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.344
Maybe he went down
that other alley.

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.782
(Yusaku) Are you okay?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.285
Well I am now.

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.287
Thank you for the save.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.089
I thought I was
toast back there.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.623
So you got a name bud?

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.793
Yes I do.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:29.696
You feel like
sharing it then?

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.463
Not really.

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.835
You should stay away from the
Hanoi for your own safety.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.070
Well that's not gonna happen!

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:40.874
Yeah I know those guys
are uber dangerous

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:44.411
but if they're the ones who
are behind the Lost Incident,

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.780
I'll track 'em down forever!

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.682
The Lost Incident?

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:51.685
(Kolter) Yeah, it's this thing
that messed up my brother

00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:55.389
and I can't cure him unless
I find out what happened.

00:10:55.423 --> 00:10:56.857
Be that as it may,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.626
Link VRAINS is
a dangerous place.

00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:02.829
You can't help your brother
if you yourself are erased.

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:05.165
Wait, hold up!

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.801
You had to have heard
something that could help me.

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:08.969
Anything.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:13.340
Take my advice, log out
and don't come back.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.109
I may not be around
next time to save you.

00:11:17.678 --> 00:11:19.245
But I didn't take his advice

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:20.981
and little did I know,
that'd get me

00:11:21.015 --> 00:11:23.149
into a whole world of trouble.

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:28.255
Yusaku warned me to
stop investigating

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:30.690
the Knights of Hanoi
but I didn't listen.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:34.528
Wow Kolter, we finally
found something in common.

00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:36.697
I tune him out
all the time too.

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:38.865
But Yusaku was right.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:42.736
Fact was, my dueling skills
were no match against the Hanoi.

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:46.773
(Knight Of Hanoi)
You again!

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:48.409
You won't get away this time.

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:50.911
You should've at least
gotten another avatar.

00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:54.447
(laughing)

00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:03.256
You're not vanishing this time
'cause we got you sandwiched.

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:09.262
(laughing)

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:12.532
(Yusaku)
You again?

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:18.805
(Kotler)
Yeah, me again.

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:23.677
Please don't be mad.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.078
And why would I be mad?

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:29.249
I'm not the one who completely
ignored my warning

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.585
and then got
trapped by the Hanoi

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:35.556
and then needed help,
to get rescued again.

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:36.757
You're mad.

00:12:36.757 --> 00:12:38.892
No I said
that I wasn't mad.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.262
I'm merely disappointed.

00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:45.699
Your face, what's wrong?

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:48.368
I'd rather you be
mad than disappointed.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.871
It would help me if you
would log yourself out

00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:52.839
but the Hanoi are
using jamming devices

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:55.876
to prevent you from
being able to do so.

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.712
Luckily those devices
aren't very powerful.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.651
If you can get up there,
you'll be out of jamming range.

00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:05.486
You better get moving.

00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:07.287
I will take care of the Hanoi.

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:15.829
Logging out.

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:21.635
(Knight of Hanoi)
How chivalrous.

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.804
So this here is the
trouble maker who's been

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.973
constantly going and
interfering with our plans.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.208
He's not what I expected.

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:31.044
Yeah I pictured someone
a lot less scrawny.

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.480
He has the muscles
of a kuriboh.

00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:36.750
Come on, don't
insult the kuriboh.

00:13:36.783 --> 00:13:39.886
But let's see if your
cards have any brawn.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.921
Time to duel.
Time to duel.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.428
I hope he's okay.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.164
(Kotler)
There he is.

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.934
I'm making the first move.

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.602
You ready?

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:59.039
Since I'm such a nice
guy, I'll end you quick.

00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:01.875
(Knight of Hanoi)
But not so quick that
I won't have my fun.

00:14:03.543 --> 00:14:06.146
I'll start by
summoning Jack Wyvern.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:13.287
And I'll equip my wyvern
with the spell Big Bang Shot,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.156
to give it 400
extra attack points.

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:21.895
Next I'm gonna place
one card face down

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:23.129
and end my turn.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.067
You're up kid.

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.668
Let's see what you can do.

00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:33.874
Come on kid, I can't spend
my entire day just on you.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.208
I got a quota to meet.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.310
You said this duel
would end quickly.

00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:41.815
And you're right, just not
the way that you expect.

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.283
I draw

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.720
when there are no
monsters out on my field,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.223
I can summon Photon
Thrasher, go!

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:59.065
Next up, I'm summoning this,
Marauding Captain!

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:05.271
When I successfully
summon Marauding Captain,

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:08.942
I can summon a level four or
lower monster from my hand.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:12.212
Come on out Exarion Universe!

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:17.184
You may have more
monsters than me

00:15:17.217 --> 00:15:20.287
but my one monster is
stronger than all of yours.

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.788
Didn't they ever take the time

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:24.058
to teach you quality
over quantity?

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:25.292
(laughing)

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:28.262
It's a lesson I
know quite well.

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:28.962
Say what.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.732
So I will change my
quantity into quality

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.267
but creating my circuit,
the summoning conditions

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:39.072
require two or more monsters
so I set Photon Thrasher,

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:44.110
Marauding Captain and Exarion
Universe in the link arrows.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.447
Link the circuit.

00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:54.254
I Link Summon, link two
Gaia Sabre the Lightning Shadow.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:04.831
(Yusaku)
I Link Summon, link two
Gaia Sabre the Lightning Shadow.

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:08.135
That guy summoned
a Link Monster.

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:11.838
Go Gaia Sabre attack and
destroy his Jack Wyvern.

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:17.478
Yeah right, I activate
the spell, Limiter Removal.

00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:20.013
It doubles my Jack
Wyvern's attack points,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.117
so your monster's the one who's
gonna get trashed not mine.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:27.454
Afraid not because I'm
activating the spell card,

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.656
Forbidden Lance from my hand.

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:33.594
Forbidden Lance not only
reduces Jack Wyvern's

00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:36.530
attack points by 800
but it also prevents

00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:39.500
other spell cards from
affecting your monster.

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:42.302
Rendering your Limiter
Removal useless.

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.570
No way!

00:16:43.604 --> 00:16:46.841
And since Forbidden Lance
also negates Big Bang Shot,

00:16:46.907 --> 00:16:50.343
your wyvern's attack
points drop to 1000.

00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:53.413
And you're not the only one who

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:55.349
has Limiter Removal
in their deck.

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:58.652
I use it to double Gaia
Saber's attack points.

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:01.888
No.

00:17:01.922 --> 00:17:04.157
That's enough to
end my life points.

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:05.859
Go Gaia Sabre!

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:07.694
Twisting sabre strike.

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:11.598
(explosion)

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:20.407
That's game and
a quick one at that.

00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:24.645
I've never seen anyone able
to take the Hanoi that fast.

00:17:24.678 --> 00:17:27.414
(Kotler)
If I wanna save Jin,
I gotta find a way

00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:29.249
to get him on my side.

00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:32.385
But the question is, how?

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:34.154
Come on guys, we've still got

00:17:34.188 --> 00:17:36.323
this kid outnumbered
five to one.

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:37.524
Yes you're correct.

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:40.894
So who wants to duel first?

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:42.162
Not it.

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:44.165
Hey wait a second,
who said we gotta duel

00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:47.300
this guy one on one when
we can gang up on him?

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.136
(Knight of Hanoi)
I like those odds.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.907
I wouldn't expect anything
less from a Knight of Hanoi.

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:57.477
Fair play's never been
in your dictionary.

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.545
Come on!

00:17:58.579 --> 00:17:59.913
Let's get him!

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:10.423
(Knight of Hanoi)
You can't run kid.

00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:17.731
Well you can,
but it won't help you.

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:21.801
(Kolter)
Heads up.

00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.470
And I mean up.

00:18:31.812 --> 00:18:35.148
(Kotler)
Since we have a foe in common,
how about we help each other?

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.451
Maybe meet up when you get
back to the real world?

00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.452
But how?

00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:40.621
Swing by the hot
dog stand in the park

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:42.055
and say the password.

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:46.993
Hope you enjoy your meal.

00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:53.234
Hey there what can I get you?

00:18:53.267 --> 00:18:55.068
One sandwich to go please.

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:57.470
Sure thing.

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:01.842
(Kolter)
Here you are but
I gotta correct you.

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:02.609
A hot dog--

00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:04.211
(Yusaku)
Isn't a sandwich.

00:19:04.278 --> 00:19:06.346
Because while sandwiches
come in many different types

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:10.351
of bread, hot dogs only come
in one, specialised bun.

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:13.486
Maybe next time,
pick a shorter password.

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.624
It's really you.

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:18.892
Hey wait hold up!

00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:20.561
My names Kolter.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:22.796
I figured you'd like to
know the name of the guy

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.998
who saved you and the
guy who you saved twice

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.968
but let's not make this
thing a competition

00:19:28.002 --> 00:19:30.837
(Kolter)
because we're both
on the same team.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.642
I know you told me to
stay out of Link VRAINS

00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:37.344
but you know
I can't do that 'cause

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:39.480
I gotta help
my brother Jin.

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:41.715
(Kolter)
Now I'm honest enough
to admit that if I go

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:43.617
to Link VRAINS and
face the Hanoi alone,

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:47.220
I'm not coming back safe and
sound but I still have to go!

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.223
And I could sure
use your help.

00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:51.325
It's not a one way street,

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.394
you watch my back
and I'll watch yours.

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:57.131
I may not be a great
duelist but you won't find

00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:00.033
a better hacker or
programmer anywhere.

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:01.968
Whatever info
you need to find,

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:03.970
whatever server you
gotta enter,

00:20:04.004 --> 00:20:06.106
I'm your man.

00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:08.375
Basically what I'm saying
is whatever your reason

00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:11.711
for taking on the Hanoi,
you don't have to do it alone

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.813
because I don't wanna
do it alone either.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.819
You're incorrect to think
that I would need any help

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:21.655
but that doesn't mean
I won't appreciate it.

00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:23.390
Kolter is it?

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:25.893
My name is Yusaku Fujiki.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.661
Let's get to work.
