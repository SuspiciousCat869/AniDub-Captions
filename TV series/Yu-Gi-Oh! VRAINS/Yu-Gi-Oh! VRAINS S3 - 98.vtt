WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.937
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.741
(Lightning)
Humans and Ignis
cannot coexist.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:11.912
This will only end when one side
conquers the other.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.981
Humans must not be deleted

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.916
and I'm going to make sure
that doesn't happen

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.684
by defeating you here and now!

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:21.121
(Lightning)
Please try your
very best, my friend.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.489
(Varis)
BORRELOAD DRAGON,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.626
attack ESTRANGEMENT DRAGON
and end--(gasps)

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.027
(Ai)
What's that portal?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.242
(Ai)
That's Jin, Kolter's brother.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:43.477
What's this?

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.646
I linked my myself
with Jin's data.

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:51.085
So if you defeat and delete me,
Jin will be deleted as well.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.686
This can't be!

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:55.489
So what will you do, Varis?

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.592
Will you continue
your attack, my friend?

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:07.067
♪♪♪

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.260
(Lightning)
So my friend,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.495
will you attack
and sacrifice Jin?

00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.798
(Varis)
Do you think I care
about Jin's existence?

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.300
Varis, no...

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.268
(Ai)
This is cheating, Lightning!

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:18.105
I resent your allegation.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.209
Is it really cheating to make
full use of my resources,

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.444
which, of course,
includes Jin here?

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.649
(Ai)
Yeah! It's the very definition
of cheating!

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.720
(Lightning)
Let's agree to disagree
as it seems we're consulting

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.822
differing dictionaries.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.757
And Varis, if you
don't care about Jin,

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.392
then perhaps you care about...

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.727
Spectre.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.830
He is, or should I say was,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.433
your most ardent ally,
wasn't he?

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:48.736
I've also linked his data to me.

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.372
So if you defeat me,
he will be erased as well.

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:53.707
(grunts)

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.278
Isn't it interesting how one
small change in circumstance

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:00.781
can put your entire game
on pause?

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.817
Will you admit that
I have out strategized you?

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.554
Or will you prove me wrong
and attack me?

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.491
I've put you to the test,

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.226
now let's see if you pass it!

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:14.694
(grunts)

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.231
This changes nothing, Ignis!

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.966
BORRELOAD, attack--

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.033
(Playmaker)
Don't do it!

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.068
(grunts)

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.105
Varis, you know that attacking
Lightning is not

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:25.105
the right decision.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:28.375
It's true that he has
to be stopped.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.178
But still, sacrificing
Jin and Spectre

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:32.780
isn't the way to do that!

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.049
Spectre understood
the risks he was taking

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.217
when he came here.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.119
I know, but that's not--

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.287
(Varis)
But nothing.

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.222
I'll do what I must.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.825
Just like you sacrificed Kolter.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.795
I did not sacrifice Kolter.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.963
He sacrificed himself.

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.832
Because that was the only way

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:54.100
he could help save
Jin and the rest of us,

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:56.436
humans and Ignis alike!

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:02.376
(laughing)

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:05.612
Playmaker, how amusing
that it is you

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.782
who is trying to convince
your foe to keep your other foe

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:10.951
from being permanently deleted.

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.686
Just because we're opponents

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:14.120
does not mean we're foes,
Lightning.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.357
And though we may have
mistakenly

00:04:16.357 --> 00:04:19.026
gotten into this mess,
there's always a way out of it.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:22.029
Mistake?
This is no mistake.

00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:24.765
You still don't realize
that this mistake you speak of

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:26.400
is all of my design?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.234
What?

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.703
To elucidate,
I'll have to take us back

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:31.538
to the Lost Incident,

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.707
an event that left
many of you mentally

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.009
and emotionally scarred,

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.544
including our
jittery friend here.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:40.848
The damage to Jin
was especially severe.

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:43.783
And I must confess
that was my doing.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.018
(grunts)

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:48.622
You see, even then I knew
how to invade the network.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.525
But I especially
enjoyed accessing Jin.

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.194
We played a delightful
little game together.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:56.564
It was always the same.

00:04:56.897 --> 00:04:59.734
Over and over I convinced him
that he'd been freed

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.468
from his confinement.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:04.071
That would make Jin very happy.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:08.242
But each time he learned
that his rescue was a deception.

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:11.345
And a rather
nightmarish one at that.

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:14.748
As a result, when Jin truly
was freed,

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.117
he didn't believe it was real.

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.586
And he still doesn't.

00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:22.623
Why would you go
to all that trouble?

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:24.591
(Lightning)
Logically, for control.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:27.461
You might say that I turned
Jin into my puppet.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.831
Through him, I manipulated
one event after another

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.967
until I led you all
to this precise moment.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:35.903
Now you must choose.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.739
Attack me now and Jin
will be erased.

00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:40.640
A tragic end, yes,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.576
but you might be
doing him a favor.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.178
Then again, if you refrain
from attacking,

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.847
you may miss your only chance
to win this duel.

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.516
What will it be?

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:51.284
Decide!

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.158
What will you do, Varis?

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.460
Victory could be yours
if you attack

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:04.698
but, by winning,
Jin and Spectre lose everything.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:08.702
I'll place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.638
And due to ESTRANGEMENT
DRAGON's special ability,

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.808
it leaves the field
and goes to the graveyard.

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:19.379
(laughing)

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.050
You had victory in
the palm of your hand,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.185
and you couldn't take it.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.222
That is why you're not
as great as the Ignis,

00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:30.424
because you don't have
the emotional programming

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:32.525
to make the correct
logical move.

00:06:34.328 --> 00:06:36.229
There's nothing fair
about this duel.

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:38.532
Why didn't he attack?

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.101
If the old Varis
had been given the chance

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:43.303
to take out that Ignis,
he would have seized it.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.474
You're right, but it seems
there's a new Varis now,

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:49.810
one with a new way of dueling.

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:51.878
Let's hope he knows
what he's doing,

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.080
for all our sakes.

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:56.650
Varis, you are nothing more
than a farce.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.486
And it's time to put
this comedy to an end.

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:00.554
(grunts)

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.055
It's my turn--

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:02.990
(Bohman)
Wait.

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:05.325
Did you just tell me to stop?

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:08.929
Yes. But only because
your actions have forced me to.

00:07:09.296 --> 00:07:10.163
What?

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.500
I find your tactics
unacceptable.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:17.270
No matter who the opponent,
you must show them respect.

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:19.639
When I dueled Soulburner,

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.876
I showed him the respect
that every opponent deserves.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.312
But then, without consulting me,

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.081
you had Windy interfere
by hurting Flame.

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.083
I won the duel,

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:33.487
but my victory was tainted
by your underhanded tactics.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.422
I won't let you do that again.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:37.224
How will you stop me?

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.993
By holding on to Jin
and Spectre's data

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.728
until your duel ends.

00:07:44.665 --> 00:07:45.498
What?

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:48.935
(whimpers)

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:53.106
(Ai)
Uh... You see what I saw?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.742
How dare you...

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.811
Give them back!

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.080
I will not, Lightning,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.616
I am no longer yours
to command.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.451
(grunts)

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.020
(Bohman)
You can prove we are
superior to humans...

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:12.059
by winning this duel honorably,
without using tricks.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.861
I am confident that
you will do so, Lightning.

00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:16.696
Thank you.

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:22.335
Now, duel fairly and let's see
who is truly superior.

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.938
Don't expect thanks.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:26.840
I never did.

00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.042
It makes no difference!

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:32.178
Either way I'm still
going to win this duel!

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:34.682
There will be a winner.

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.450
Only it's going to be me.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.456
It's my turn!

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:45.125
I draw!

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:48.662
I summon ARMATOS LEGIO SICA!

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.868
And I'll use it
to illuminate my circuit!

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:58.539
I set ARMATOS LEGIO SICA
in the Link Arrow

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:03.610
to Link Summon Link 1
ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:11.284
Next, I activate the spell card
ARMATOS FULGUR!

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:15.856
By tributing an ARMATOS
LEGIO Link Monster

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:18.425
that's on my field,
I can summon another

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:20.194
Link Monster from my Extra Deck

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.095
with the same
number of links.

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:27.100
Or to put it more simply,
I tribute ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.837
to summon AMATOS LEGIO
EQUES FLAMMA.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.343
Then I activate
the Link Spell

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.412
ARMATOS LEGIO PLUMBUM
TRIDENT's effect.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:42.516
By returning one Link Monster
in my graveyard

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:43.751
to my Extra Deck,

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:46.687
I can revive an ARMATOS
LEGIO and summon it next to

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:47.954
PLUMBUM TRIDENT's link.

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.525
So I return DECURION
to my Extra Deck

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.296
to summon ARMATOS LEGIO MAGNUS
DUX from my graveyard.

00:09:58.798 --> 00:09:59.566
(grunts)

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.868
That monster again...

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.004
Now let's cut to the chase,

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.873
when I attack, we both know
you'll use your effects

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.175
and I'll use mine,

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.611
so I already did
the calculations.

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:13.613
My MAGNUS DUX
will have 5000 attack points

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.083
while your BORRELOADS
will have 3000,

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:18.018
so that's 2000 damage.

00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:21.088
And you have
2000 life points left.

00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:25.025
Meaning, my victory
cannot be more exact.

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.799
You were a formidable foe,
my friend,

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:34.201
just not formidable enough.

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:37.037
But as a reward
for your noble attempt,

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:39.340
allow me to leave you
with a parting gift,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.609
about your past
before you are gone forever.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:44.178
About my past?

00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:47.547
Specifically, your father
Dr. Kogami,

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:50.418
and the truth
about his final moments.

00:10:50.418 --> 00:10:51.351
What?

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:56.090
When your father told his bosses
at SOL Technologies

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.027
that the Ignis would bring about
the end of mankind,

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:03.764
they exiled him
and shut down his research.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.634
That should come as
no surprise, really,

00:11:06.634 --> 00:11:10.070
because the Ignis
were a valuable asset.

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.073
When they created the Cyberse,

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:17.078
the Ignis generated a vast
quantity of data material.

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:20.114
The company came to depend
on that flow of data

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.248
for its operations,

00:11:21.248 --> 00:11:24.351
and they couldn't afford
to turn off the faucet.

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:27.354
So instead of
shutting down the Ignis,

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.422
they shut down
your father's work.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:33.026
But you believe they did worse
than that, don't you?

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:35.996
You are convinced that
SOL Technologies

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:37.597
put him into
a permanent sleep

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.634
so that he wouldn't
reveal what he knew.

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.570
But you're wrong.

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:46.240
During your father's exile,

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.142
I ran numerous simulations

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:50.444
to see if Ignis
and humans could coexist,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.747
and it just so happened
that your inquisitive father

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:56.116
was continuing to run
the same simulations.

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.752
So I knew it was only
a matter of time

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:02.156
till he stumbled upon
a deeply disturbing fact,

00:12:02.156 --> 00:12:05.358
that none of the Ignis
posed a threat to humankind,

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:06.694
except for one.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.597
You know which Ignis
I'm talking about, Varis,

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:11.731
because you reached
the same conclusion.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.302
Humans and Ignis couldn't
co-exist because of me.

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.571
Well, I couldn't let
that news get out.

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.474
So I infected your father
with a virus that left him

00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:21.808
silenced forever.

00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:23.310
You what?

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:26.213
I realize
you must be upset,

00:12:26.213 --> 00:12:29.816
but surely you can understand
it was my only logical choice.

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:33.186
My actions were purely
a matter of self-preservation.

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:37.191
I felt no personal animosity
toward your father

00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:39.326
when I entered
his private server.

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:42.862
I simply made a few subtle
tweaks to his VR headset.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.900
All this time, you assumed
that SOL Technologies

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.169
was the culprit behind
your father's condition

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:50.371
when it was me.

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:52.239
Just remember this, Varis,

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.308
I never had to keep
the truth from you

00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:56.376
because you kept it
from yourself.

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:58.245
<i>You leapt to conclusions,</i>

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:00.681
<i>so you never saw
that I was the threat.</i>

00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:03.217
<i>You have only
yourself to blame.</i>

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.886
So Lightning
has been behind everything,

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.055
secretly, since day one.

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:11.091
Day one?
More like Day zero!

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.394
By delaying your father,
I bought time

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.296
so that I could prepare
for this war,

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:20.501
Allowing me to muster my army,
such as creating Bohman.

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.405
So then, all this time
I've been angry at SOL Tech,

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.740
<i>I should've
been angry at you!</i>

00:13:26.874 --> 00:13:30.910
Our entire crusade against
Sol Tech was based on a lie?

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:35.048
Against SOL Tech maybe,
but not against the Ignis!

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:39.220
(Lightning)
Your anger directed at
SOL Technologies is warranted.

00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:40.654
I wouldn't have
gotten involved

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:42.555
if they hadn't gotten
involved first,

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.292
but let's be honest,
nothing I say to you right now

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.727
will change your mind,
will it?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.563
So, let's just end this.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.567
MAGNUS DUX! Attack BORRELOAD
EXCHARGE DRAGON!

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:58.538
I activate BORRELOAD DRAGON's
special ability!

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:02.009
Enemy Negation lowers
MAGNUS DUX's attack

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:04.010
and defense points by 500,

00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:06.947
lowering its attack
points to 2500!

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.957
But Lightning already knew
you were gonna do that.

00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:18.959
So he's now going to use
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:21.862
to double MAGNUS DUX's
attack points and win!

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.365
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.035
I activate the trap card
BORREL RING!

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.170
By tributing BORRELOAD DRAGON,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.874
BORREL RING gains a counter
for every one of its links.

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.547
My BORRELOAD DRAGON
is a Link 4 monster.

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.516
So BORREL RING
gets four counters.

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:48.622
Furthermore, if I use one
of BORREL RINGS counters

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:52.392
during this battle
my monster can't be destroyed.

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:55.863
And your monster loses
100 attack points

00:14:55.963 --> 00:14:58.531
for each remaining counter
on BORREL RING.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.506
MAGNUS DUX's attack points have
been knocked down to 2200.

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.075
Hmm...

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:12.712
This feels like a last ditch
effort on your part, my friend.

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:16.683
I use JUDGMENT ARROWS to double
my monster's attack points.

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:20.388
Even if I can't
destroy your monster,

00:15:20.388 --> 00:15:22.355
you still take damage.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:28.862
That ends my turn.

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:32.866
Looks like you failed
to defeat me, Ignis.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:36.770
True. But you only have
600 life points left.

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:39.272
That's an amount that
I will easily eliminate

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.574
on my next turn.

00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:43.443
That's if you get another turn.

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:46.080
And I can assure you,
that's one thing

00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:48.582
that I won't allow you to get.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.083
(grunts)

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:51.885
Varis sounds pretty confident,

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:53.620
why would he sound confident?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.523
This doesn't seem to qualify
as a confident-esque situation.

00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.759
So you think
he's behaving irrationally?

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:01.428
Because past history wouldn't
prove that assessment

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:02.262
to be accurate.

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:06.833
True. Irrational self-confidence
is my bag, not his.

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:09.135
It's my turn.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.804
I draw!

00:16:11.404 --> 00:16:15.075
I activate BORRELOAD
EXCHARGE DRAGON's ability!

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.579
I use one of its Overlay Units

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:21.982
to lower your monster's attack
points by 600!

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:28.755
And then, I get to resurrect
BORRELOAD DRAGON

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:29.856
from my graveyard!

00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:31.658
Rise!

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:38.365
Time to battle!

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:41.168
BORRELOAD EXCHARGE DRAGON,

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:43.436
attack MAGNUS DUX!

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.577
Fire!

00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:55.915
I also now activate
BORRELOAD DRAGON's ability

00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:59.586
to lower your monster's attack
points even further!

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:02.989
Fourteen hundred?

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:05.359
Now even if Lightning uses
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.327
to double his monster's
attack points,

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:09.329
Varis's is still stronger!

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.101
This attack will deal Lightning
200 points worth of damage.

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.870
And next, if Varis's
BORRELOAD DRAGON

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.306
attacks and destroys
EQUES FLAMMA,

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:21.809
Lightning will run
out of life points.

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:24.878
No! I refuse to let you win!

00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:28.315
I activate MAGNUS
DUX's special ability!

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:30.851
For every monster
that it's co-linked with,

00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:34.721
I can return a card on the field
or in the graveyard to my hand.

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:37.991
Such as my ARMATOS GLORIA!

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:42.062
And by doing so,
its effect activates!

00:17:42.196 --> 00:17:45.766
When ARMATOS GLORIA is the
target of a special ability

00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:48.535
while it's on my field,
all my monsters in play

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:49.636
are destroyed.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:54.007
And when EQUES FLAMMA
is destroyed

00:17:54.007 --> 00:17:55.976
while it's co-linked
with another monster,

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:58.879
we both take damage equal to
that other monster's

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:00.214
original attack points.

00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:04.251
Meaning we both take
3000 points of damage,

00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:06.820
which is more than enough
to wipe out your life points

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.088
and mine.

00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:09.723
No way!

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:14.394
I refuse to lose to you, human!
I refuse to lose to any human!

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:18.231
And if that means
sacrificing myself, so be it!

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:25.872
I refuse to lose to you, human!
I refuse to lose to any human!

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:29.743
And if that means
sacrificing myself, so be it!

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.879
(whooshing)

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:35.282
(blasting)

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:38.919
(groans)

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.455
(groans)

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:44.491
No way, Roken!

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:48.128
I can't...
I can't believe it.

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:50.130
(grunts)

00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:53.133
The Light Ignis was willing
to destroy itself

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.101
if it meant taking Varis
down with it.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.604
Varis! No!

00:18:58.606 --> 00:18:59.739
Varis, wake up!

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:04.611
I didn't expect that the
Light Ignis would destroy itself

00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:07.881
after it tried so hard
to survive for so long.

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:11.118
I should've taken
that into account.

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.621
But if you look
on the bright side,

00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:15.155
you stopped Lightning!

00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:16.623
I guess I did.

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.960
I never thought the day
would come when an Ignis

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:22.629
would actually be attempting
to cheer me up.

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:26.500
This isn't such a bad place
to go down.

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:29.269
Takes me back to
when I was a kid,

00:19:29.536 --> 00:19:31.038
when life was easy.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:33.474
I could just lay
in the grass all day

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:35.108
and stare at the clouds.

00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:42.215
I'm afraid life won't be
as simple for you.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.285
You have one opponent left.

00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:47.187
Good luck, Playmaker.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.690
You too, Ai.

00:19:55.563 --> 00:19:57.530
He called me by my name...

00:20:00.234 --> 00:20:03.136
Roken is gone.
He's gone... forever.

00:20:04.671 --> 00:20:05.605
(gasps)

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:11.144
This means...
only Bohman is left.

00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:12.279
(Lightning)
Wrong.

00:20:18.052 --> 00:20:22.188
I... am still... here.

00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:23.457
But how?

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:26.126
How does he still have
one life point?

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:27.961
(groans)

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:30.197
(Bohman)
Because of Jin.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.399
When I took Jin's
data from you,

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.101
you were able to hold on
to a small portion

00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.203
of his energy.

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:40.106
Which you then converted
into a single life point.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:41.442
Yes.

00:20:41.608 --> 00:20:44.444
But do you know why,
my friend?

00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:48.348
It's because
I'll do anything to succeed.

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:51.551
That's why
I need you now, Bohman.

00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:53.120
(coughs)

00:20:53.454 --> 00:20:54.721
Give me your energy.

00:20:55.222 --> 00:20:56.623
I gave you life...

00:20:57.124 --> 00:21:00.293
now return it to your creator!

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:05.199
After all the treacheries
you have committed, Lightning,

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:07.201
the only decision
that I am left with

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.902
is to deny your request.

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.503
(groans)

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.006
What?

00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:15.910
You claim that you wish
to create a perfect world,

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:18.846
but I know that
you cannot do that.

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:22.282
Only I am capable
of achieving that.

00:21:22.616 --> 00:21:24.418
And it is not a criticism,

00:21:24.685 --> 00:21:27.187
it is as you say, logical.

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.591
It would therefore not be
logical to give you my energy.

00:21:31.024 --> 00:21:35.028
But allow me to fulfill
your goal, by you helping me.

00:21:35.262 --> 00:21:37.197
Instead of energizing you,

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:40.534
energize me to
even greater powers.

00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:46.006
So be it.

00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:07.594
Bohman has absorbed Lightning.

00:22:08.595 --> 00:22:09.697
(groans)

00:22:09.697 --> 00:22:11.932
Now Bohman has five Ignis
inside him,

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:13.767
all of ‘em except me!

00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:17.171
But that will soon change.

00:22:17.505 --> 00:22:18.739
When this is over,

00:22:18.739 --> 00:22:21.007
you will also become
a part of me.

00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:23.510
It is time, Playmaker.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.912
Time for our final duel.

00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:27.147
Right.

00:22:27.815 --> 00:22:30.016
And I've never been more ready.

00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:31.952
Let's duel!
