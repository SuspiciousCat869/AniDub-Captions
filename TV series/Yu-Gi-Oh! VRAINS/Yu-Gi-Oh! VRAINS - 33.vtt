Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains."

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.641
As the tower devours
more and more data,

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.743
it gains the power
to destroy the world

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.646
and consume all of Link Vrains
within six hours.

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.081
Six hours?
(gasps)

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.283
How do we go about stopping it?

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:17.784
By beating Varis.

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.456
I know that you're watching me.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.325
So why don'tcha come on out?!

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.429
You're that crazy creep

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.764
who brainwashed me!

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:32.933
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.236
I Link Summon!

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:40.640
Rise up Link 1 Sunavalon Dryas!

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.179
(sinister laugh)

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:52.819
♪♪♪

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.251
You're awfully
silent, Blue Angel.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:01.922
But it is a natural
reaction when one faces
my Sunavalon Dryas.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:05.292
Many are intimidated
by its glorious majesty.

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:08.629
You think that I'm scared?
Of a tree?

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.131
Oh, if you're not, then
please, prove me wrong.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.133
If you're up for it that is.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.936
That's supposed to be
your form of trash talk?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.804
I am not falling
for your trap.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.806
You wound me, my dear.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.309
Why would you think
I'm trying to trick you?

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.978
Uh, you summoned
a monster with zero
points in attack mode?

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.916
Quite perceptive of you but
that's only half the story.

00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:31.285
Due to Dryas's
special ability,

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:34.488
your monsters are not
allowed to attack it.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.456
That's not fair.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.891
You're right.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.559
It's my turn!

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.434
First, I'll start by summoning
Trickstar Candina!

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:51.104
And when I summon her,
I'm then allowed

00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:54.475
to add one Trickstar that's
in my deck straight to my hand.

00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:59.313
Next, I activate the field
spell Trickstar Light Stage.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.348
Its effect lets me draw
another Trickstar

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:04.852
from my deck
so I get Trickstar Lilybell!

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.721
And instead of letting Lilybell
just chill in my hand,

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:11.058
her special ability lets me
automatically summon her out.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:12.392
Like this!

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.998
And next up, I'm upgrading
my Trickstar Light Stage

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.534
into a Trickstar Light Arena!

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.970
In this venue, I get
to choose one of your facedown
spell or trap cards

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.707
and prevent it from activating
until the end of the turn.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.275
And if you don't activate it,

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:31.445
you have to return
that card to your hand.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.980
Oh dear.

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:34.715
This turn of events
has certainly created

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:37.151
a serious setback
in my strategies.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.886
You are such a creep.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.687
But there's no chance
I'm gonna let you spook me

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.623
from playing my game, Spectre.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.392
I can summon
two Trickstar Lycorises

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.861
by returning Candina to my hand!

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.398
So now have the monsters
I need to build my circuit!

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:54.301
The summoning conditions
require two Trickstars.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:58.438
So I set my two Lycorises
in the Link Arrows!

00:03:58.505 --> 00:03:59.940
I Link Summon!

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.576
Link 2 Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.016
Ah, Holly Angel.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.251
Formidable as she is,
you must realize

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.087
as your number one fan,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.956
I know every countermeasure
against her.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:19.460
But knowing it and pulling it
off are two different things.

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:21.595
Especially when I'm playing
brand-new cards

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:24.965
that no one's ever seen before
like my Light Arena!

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:28.001
It resurrects my Lycoris!

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:33.874
And since I summoned
the Trickstar next to
Holly Angel's link,

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.576
you take 200 points of damage.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:45.119
Was there a breeze or did that
tree just move on its own?

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.586
Whatevs...

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.956
Since my Holly Angel used her
special ability to deal you

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:53.693
200 points of damage, she also
gains 200 attack points.

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.799
And now, Trickstar Lilybell
uses her special ability

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.302
to bypass Dryas
and attack you directly.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.674
(chuckling)
Huh?

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:10.677
Haven't you ever learned that
what one fails to destroy

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.180
can only make one stronger?

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:15.148
It is the true
essence of nature.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.118
What's that?

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:19.186
Whenever I take damage,

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.521
my Dryas can summon
a Sunvine Link Monster

00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:24.358
next to its link.

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:27.094
Blue Angel, bear witness

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.431
to the birth of Link 1
Sunvine Gardna!

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.674
Blue Angel, gaze upon
the fruits of your labor.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:43.677
Sweet for me, but not
so sweet for you.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:46.013
Because I regain
every point of damage

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.148
that I took from your attack.

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:50.651
That's just great.
It is.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.353
And there's another advantage
I have over you as well.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.488
What's that?

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:58.325
Being a fan, I know everything
about you.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:01.661
Where you got you name,
for instance.

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:06.099
It was from a storybook.
I have it right here.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.202
"Blue Angel."

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:12.039
A little on the nose isn't it?
But no matter...

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:16.710
"Once upon a time, there was a
heavenly being named Blue Angel.

00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:20.147
"Among all the angels, Blue
Angel was the most beautiful.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:21.882
"At least on the outside.

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:25.152
"But on the inside,
her heart was made of ice.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.354
"Blue Angel said,
'Who needs friends?

00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:30.090
"'I don't have to share my toys!
Who needs friends?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.226
"'I don't have
to share my snacks!

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:35.262
Who needs friends?
I'm better off without them!'

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.165
"But Blue Angel started to cry
because no one was around

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:42.737
to hear her words because
Blue Angel had no friends."

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:46.139
That sure reminds me
of a certain someone.

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:49.142
"Then one day, Blue Angel was
ambushed by a horde of demons

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.246
"and thought her life was all
but lost until the other angels

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:55.382
"arrived to save her
from this horrible fate.

00:06:55.416 --> 00:06:57.651
"'Why are you helping me?
she asked.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.753
"'Because you might not think
we're your friends,

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:01.922
"'but we think you're our
friend!'

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:03.724
"Blue Angel's heart melted.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.092
"'Who needs friends? I do.'

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:08.929
"And as they defeated the
demons, Blue Angel's next tear

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:12.132
wasn't one of sadness,
but one of joy."

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.167
Well, well,
that is quite an interesting

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.570
role model to name
yourself after.

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:18.138
But not surprising.

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.273
Not with your
overprotective brother.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:21.909
How else can there
be billions of people

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.711
on this planet
but not a single friend?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.780
You must have
shed many a tear.

00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:28.949
But you didn't break.
You came to Link Vrains

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.251
as Blue Angel to find
the fellowship

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.453
you couldn't
in the real world.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:36.590
Great, I'm being personally
psychoanalyzed by a psycho.

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.892
Oh, how you wound me.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:40.560
I'm just a fan.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.296
More like a fanatic.

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:44.264
You're like the demon
in the story

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.633
except ten times ickier.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.868
Oh, am I?

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.469
But just like
in the final chapter,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.305
I'll be the one to close
the book on you.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.574
I'm honored!

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.309
Then let's get on with the duel.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.813
Since my Lilybell
dealt you damage,

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:02.816
I can retrieve Trickstar Lycoris
from my graveyard.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.886
And though I'm not allowed
to attack your Sunavalon Dryas,

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:09.523
I am however allowed to attack
your Sunvine Gardna!

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.625
Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:13.827
Cracking Whip!

00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:19.532
But you triggered
my Gardna's ability.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.402
When it's linked
to Sunavalon Dryas,

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:25.205
I receive 800 less damage
for each of its links.

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:28.141
So instead of taking
1600 points of damage,

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.844
I only take 800.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:33.614
You've failed to harm me
as much as you'd hoped.

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.316
But damage is still damage,
Spectre.

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:40.788
You're right.

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.823
Your positivity must
be such an inspiration

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:44.525
to your True Blue Crew.

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:47.160
I'm sure they'd be cheering you
on to victory if it wasn't

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.464
for the fact that
the Hanoi deleted them all.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.367
I could so swipe left
on you right now.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.502
You're, like, the worst.

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:57.037
You're one of those
people who takes

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.638
a tiny lead and
thinks they have

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:01.075
the whole duel in the bag,
with your mouth

00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.609
flapping away just because

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.412
you were able to garden
up a solid defense.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:08.015
Solid's so pedestrian.

00:09:08.082 --> 00:09:11.752
I believe “perfect ” is a better
word to describe my strategy.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.887
There's no such
thing as perfect.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.223
And I am going
to prove it to you!

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.926
How exciting.
I can't wait.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.761
I summon Trickstar
Lycoris to my field

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.130
by returning Trickstar
Lilybell to my hand.

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:27.601
Then I'll place
this card facedown.

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:32.773
And with that,
I have everything set.

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:35.342
When I end my turn,
Trickstar Light Arena

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.680
will send Spectre's facedown
card back to his hand.

00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:43.017
That means he'll be holding
a total of five cards.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:46.754
But what he doesn't know is that
I have Trickstar Reincarnation.

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:50.591
It'll banish all those cards and
force him to draw five new ones.

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:53.427
That'll kickstart Lycoris's
special ability,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.130
dealing 200 points of damage
for every card he draws.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.433
Five cards equals
a thousand points.

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:02.736
But since I have
two Lycorises in play,

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.938
they'll double
the damage to 2000.

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:07.541
Ha! Specty's gonna
learn that attacking

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.577
isn't the only way
to deal big time damage.

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:14.248
And he's gonna learn it
the hard way.

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:16.617
And now you're up because

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.753
I'm ending my turn.

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.421
But before you do,
I activate my trap!

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:25.525
And I promise you,
you won't like it.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.216
(Frog)
The air's getting mighty grimy.

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.251
Yeah, I can barely
see what's ahead.

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.588
Well, you better keep
your peepin' peepers
peeped for Playmaker!

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:56.189
And quit your whinin'!

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:58.625
You won't hear a peep.
Good!

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.227
And keep your head
on a swivel!

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.630
The Hanoi could
be lurkin' anywhere.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:04.965
Ah, what a mess we're in.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.768
I'm not one to spread the blame,
but this is all your fault.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:10.403
Don't you mean our fault?!
We're a team!

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.140
Hey, you heard
what I said, flyboy.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.976
But you can't expect me
to keep track of everything!

00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:19.312
(Frog)
Ahh! Unh!

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.815
It's a good thing
the ground broke
your fall.

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:23.016
Oh, is it?!

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:25.485
(Boy)
Freeze right there!

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.087
Ahh! A Hanoi!

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.289
Please don't
hurt us!

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.964
Oh, it's just
a little 'ole kid.

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.633
You're right.
Unless Playmaker spent

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.902
too much time
in the dryer cycle.

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:44.105
You, you...
You Knight of Hanoi!

00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:45.172
I'm gonna beat you!

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:46.640
(both groan)

00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:49.810
Link Vrains is my favoritest
place in the whole wide world!

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.481
And... and I won't let you
coat it with all your cooties!

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:56.483
'Cause I'm Playmaker,
and you're going down!

00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:59.653
Did you say you're Playmaker!?
Uh-huh.

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:02.589
(Pigeon crying)
The courage of this kid!

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:06.226
It's good to know
that the future generations
are in good hands.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.728
Unless it turns our this avatar

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:10.497
belongs to a really old man...
Just saying

00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:14.334
Ah, great job completely
spoiling the moment!

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.712
Sweet mother o' mayhem!
Yo, kid! You okay!?

00:12:24.812 --> 00:12:27.314
What're we gonna
do boss?

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:30.050
It's hopeless!
The poor kid
got pancaked!

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.051
(both gasp)

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.488
You're safe now.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:36.223
Playmaker.

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:38.425
(both)
Yeah! Way to go!

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:39.860
You should log out.

00:12:39.894 --> 00:12:41.695
(AI)
<i>Like yesterday!</i>

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:42.729
But I wanna help.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.031
Believe me,
you already have.

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.333
Don't you see?

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.535
You've reminded me
what I'm fighting for.

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:50.203
Leave this to me.

00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.174
Okay.

00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:55.175
Good luck, Playmaker!

00:12:57.378 --> 00:13:01.148
<i>Aw, you made a friend with the
same emotional maturity as you!</i>

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.983
Not now.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:04.418
Great stuff!

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.920
Ya catch that all on film?

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:07.288
Ahh!

00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:10.291
You're the only cameraman
who never turns on his camera!

00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:11.992
Come on!
Right, boss!

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:14.294
Ah, looks like
he flew the coop.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:17.230
(Frog)
And flew the scoop,
you nincompoop!

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:22.135
I usually wouldn't activate
this trap card of mine

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.805
except I see a mischievous
little twinkle in your eye

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.940
telling me that
you are up to no good.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.543
If your facedown card is a trap,
Sunvine Burial

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.880
will banish that card,
along with all other copies.

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:43.957
Why, what a truly delightful
surprise, it is a trap card.

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.460
Your Trickstar Reincarnation
would have put

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.962
a serious damper
on my remaining life points.

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.465
How lucky for me.

00:13:51.499 --> 00:13:54.367
Yes, so very, very lucky.

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:07.514
How'd you know what I had?

00:14:07.547 --> 00:14:08.949
How you ask?

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.385
Because I saw you utilize
this exact same strategy

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:13.987
in your duel against Playmaker.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.890
Remember... I know
everything about you,

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.993
Blue Angel... everything.

00:14:20.027 --> 00:14:23.030
I know how you lost those
you cared about as a child.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.998
I know how you wept.

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:27.401
I know how it was just
you and your brother

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:30.504
struggling to survive
against the entire world.

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:32.873
Yes! I know there was
a hole in your heart

00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:35.508
that could not be filled.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.944
Until your brother
read you a story

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.145
about a certain Blue Angel.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.314
An angel that felt
as alone as you.

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:43.850
An angel that could understand
what you're going through

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:46.853
and show you that you do
not have to struggle alone.

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:50.857
Why, you might even say
she was your guardian angel.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.192
Isn't that so?

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.694
(groans)

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.962
And now here you
stand before my very eyes

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:57.965
so vibrant and strong.

00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:01.736
Fighting to save this world,
and you're no longer alone.

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.905
You're here with your
two closest friends.

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:07.741
It's wonderful.
This is precisely how a perfect

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:11.245
fairy tale would be told
from generation to generation.

00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:14.881
Only if the ending
wasn't so tragic!

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.285
I draw.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.453
Hold up!

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:22.089
Since you drew a card,
Trickstar Lycoris's

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:26.460
special abilities get to deal
you 200 points of damage each!

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.562
So that's 400!

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:36.737
400? That's much less than
what Trickstar Reincarnation

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.606
would have done to me,
isn't it, Blue Angel?

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:42.877
But since I did take damage
no matter how miniscule,

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.846
Sunavalon Dryas's special
ability activates,

00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:50.417
allowing me to summon a Sunvine
monster next to Dryas's link.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.453
Bloom, Sunvine Healer!

00:15:59.093 --> 00:16:01.362
Sunavalon Dryas's special
ability also heals

00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:04.464
the damage that I took
from one of your Lycorises.

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.633
But the restoration
of my life points

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:09.069
does not stop here, I'm afraid.

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.738
Since Sunvine Healer
is linked to my Dryas,

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:15.742
she gives me 300 life points
for every one of Dryas's links.

00:16:20.014 --> 00:16:23.317
Huh, well, you're not the only
one getting a bonus.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.185
Since you took damage,

00:16:25.285 --> 00:16:28.355
Holly Angel gains
400 attack points!

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.359
Look, Boss!
That's Blue Angel!

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:35.695
(Frog)
You remember where the "on"
switch is on your camera?

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.334
Only five and a half hours
'til the tower's complete.

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:43.269
Even one second over
and it's game over.

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:46.840
I sure hope the team hasn't
run into any distractions.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.444
And I jinxed it.

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:52.913
Ah! Mr. Zaizen, sir!

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.149
The feed's back online.
You really have to see this!

00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:57.351
I do?

00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:59.620
Blue Angel's dueling
the Knights of Hanoi.

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:01.121
You sure?

00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:05.058
Unless you know some
other blue-haired pigtailed
superstar duelist?

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.893
I don't.

00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:09.829
Come on, Blue Angel.
I believe in ya.

00:17:11.399 --> 00:17:13.100
Ready, Blue Angel?!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.802
(laughing)

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.637
Link Arrows authorized!

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.706
The summoning conditions
are two Plant monsters.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.209
Therefore,
I set Sunvine Healer

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:25.045
and Sunavalon Dryas
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.746
Link the circuit!

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.051
I Link Summon!

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:35.422
My Link 2...
Sunavalon Dryades!

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:51.872
Who would've suspected
he had a green thumb?

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.574
Oh, how I do enjoy your attempt

00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:57.311
to conceal your terror
with a flighty response.

00:17:58.212 --> 00:18:00.380
You know, I could say
the same about you.

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:02.149
Really now?

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:04.452
Yeah, you're
totally compensating.

00:18:04.485 --> 00:18:07.287
Oh? Compensating for what?

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:08.755
I'd say a little
bit of loneliness,

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:12.292
definitely mixed with
a fair amount of sadness.

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:14.962
You know everything that
you said about me this duel.

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:17.430
I now realize you weren't
talking about me.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.999
You were talking about yourself.

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.469
You totally related to that
Blue Angel fairy tale

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:23.737
you read just as much as I did.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.440
Why else would you carry
a copy of it around with you
all the time?

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.443
(chuckling)
A fascinating theory.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:34.815
So you're saying that we're
mirror images of one another?

00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:37.284
I'm way more awesome, but yeah.

00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:40.387
Fine, let's suppose
you're correct.

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:43.958
That my childhood
was difficult like yours was.

00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:47.794
In the story Blue Angel
was saved by her friends.

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:51.132
But how would she have
turned out if she had
no friends to save her?

00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:53.767
Or no brother to care for her?

00:18:53.801 --> 00:18:56.203
Tell me!
You can't.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.739
I summon Sunseed Genius Loci!

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:07.648
And I'll use this seed
to Link Summon once again!

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.516
Oh, man, another one?

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:13.687
The summoning conditions require
me to use one Plant monster.

00:19:13.787 --> 00:19:18.358
So I shall set Sunseed Genius
Loci in the Link Arrow!

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:21.028
I Link Summon!

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:24.064
Link 1 Sunvine Thrasher!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.938
By linking Sunvine Thrasher
to Sunavalon Dryades,

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:36.677
my swordsman gains 800 attack
points from each of its links.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.512
Since Dryades has two links,

00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:42.782
Sunvine Thrasher gains
1600 attack points!

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.522
But I thought that
you were only focusing

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.458
on your defense
instead of your offense.

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:53.961
You thought wrong.
Go!

00:19:54.028 --> 00:19:56.563
Attack Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:06.340
That attack took
them both out.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.509
Only temporarily.

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:11.312
When Sunvine Thrasher
destroys a monster in battle,

00:20:11.345 --> 00:20:15.015
that monster is re-summoned
next to Sunavalon's link.

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:18.618
In other words,
your monster's mine!

00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:24.858
Ah, This can't be.

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:28.295
Wrong.
It most certainly can be!

00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:30.363
Holly Angel's mine!

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:45.512
I've always wanted to see two
Trickstars engage in battle.

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.180
Now Holly Angel!

00:20:47.214 --> 00:20:50.283
Attack and destroy
Trickstar Lycoris!

00:20:58.525 --> 00:20:59.993
Poor thing!

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:03.230
Now you've learned that
friendship can be so fleeting.

00:21:03.264 --> 00:21:05.766
With that,
I shall conclude my turn.

00:21:05.866 --> 00:21:08.569
Ah, not only can't I attack him,

00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.005
but he's also stealing
my best monsters.

00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.373
Chopping down his tree

00:21:13.407 --> 00:21:16.576
is the key to breaking
his combo, but how?

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:18.612
There has to be a way.

00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:24.184
Hm, it's a slim chance,
but it's my only chance.

00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:27.187
And possibly, my last chance!

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:33.126
