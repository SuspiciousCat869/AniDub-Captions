00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:05.239
<i>My master is gone!</i>

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:08.142
<i>My master is gonnnne!</i>

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:12.012
<i>(cries)
And left Roboppi all alone.</i>

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:16.817
<i>Huh?
Roboppi feels strange.</i>

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.951
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.186
<i>Roboppi's system
is crashing!</i>

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.926
<i>Roboppi doesn't want
to be rebooted.</i>

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:31.365
<i>(moans)</i>

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.700
<i>Is this...</i>

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.367
<i>rebooting?</i>

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.604
<i>Roboppi likes rebooting!</i>

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:40.273
<i>And is that a door of toys
and snacks?</i>

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.177
<i>Roboppi likes door of toys
and snacks!</i>

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.245
<i>Yay!</i>

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.751
<i>Snacks inside!</i>

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.152
<i>Snacks, snacks, snacks!</i>

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.654
<i>Snacks, snacks,
snacks!</i>

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.322
<i>Huh?</i>

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:56.690
<i>Is that soda?</i>

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.024
<i>It's not soda!</i>

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.927
<i>Roboppi doesn't like
not soda!</i>

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.731
<i>(Alec on intercom)
Playmaker
may still be alive,</i>

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.401
<i>but this is an uphill battle.</i>

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.369
<i>(Genome on intercom)
Yeah.
On the side of a cliff.</i>

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.073
It's your turn,
Playmaker,

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.575
so please
try to enjoy it.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:24.478
Because we both know
it's your final one.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:26.980
You might think that,
but I certainly do not.

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:28.916
Because I won't waste
the opportunity

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:31.484
that Ai sacrificed himself
to give me.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.056
<i>(Ai)
Aww,
that's so sweeeet!</i>

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.592
Hey, didn't expect you
back so soon

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.893
or back at all.

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:41.428
<i>Yeah, me too!</i>

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.096
<i>But like sneakers
at the shoe store,</i>

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.899
<i>I came prepared!</i>

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:45.899
<i>(laughs)</i>

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:46.934
<i>I uploaded a backup</i>

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.768
<i>of my entire programming
into Roboppi</i>

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:49.970
<i>just in case!</i>

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.643
A backup
of your entire programming?

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.112
<i>Yup, every bit and byte
and zero and one.</i>

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.648
<i>Not that it didn't come
without any risk,</i>

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.550
<i>cuz if even
a single one of my files</i>

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.185
<i>was corrupted
in the transfer,</i>

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.854
<i>I wouldn'ta been able
to rebuild myself</i>

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.557
<i>and that woulda meant
the end end of me.</i>

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.559
<i>But that's neither here
nor there.</i>

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:13.527
<i>I'm here, ya hear?</i>

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.796
<i>So let's get our duel
in gear!</i>

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.964
Sure,
but here's what you missed.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.500
Even though you destroyed
his Neuron Link,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.936
Bohman can still use
his Skill.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.605
<i>(Ai on intercom)
So I went kablooey
for nothing?</i>

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.043
No. You bought me
the time I needed to regroup.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.644
<i>(Ai)
Well, you're welcome.</i>

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.813
But if we don't defeat Bohman
this turn,

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.816
he will surely defeat us
on his next turn.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.818
<i>Then it's a good thing
that I got back here</i>

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:38.819
<i>in the nick of time!</i>

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.655
<i>Cuz I have what is called
a plan.</i>

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.392
<i>When I busted up
Bohman's Neuron Link,</i>

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.027
<i>I also hacked
into his programming</i>

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.629
<i>to create a backdoor.</i>

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.497
<i>That means
I can enter Bohman's body</i>

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.732
<i>and save the other Ignis.</i>

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:52.833
<i>And with their help,</i>

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.769
<i>I bet we'll have
the extra oomph needed</i>

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:55.769
<i>to defeat Bohman!</i>

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.105
But it Bohman's
internal security systems

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.274
should detect you,
he'll erase you.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.109
And without having
a backup anymore

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.110
it'll be permanent,
Ai.

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.113
<i>Aww,
you really do care,</i>

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.181
<i>but I gotta do
what I gotta do!</i>

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.098
Good,
Bohman hasn't spotted me yet.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.800
And let's keep it that way.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.673
This must be his core.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:35.543
Oh!
There they are!

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.178
Flame! Aqua!

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:39.846
Everybody!

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.848
Aqua,
are you okay?

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:42.850
Ai?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.084
Oh, no!

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.586
Did Bohman absorb you
too?

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.856
Nah, Bohman can never
absorb me.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.591
Though he did delete me.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.692
What?!

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:52.526
Nothing.

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.195
(Flame)
You must be more careful,
Ai.

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:59.900
But being careful
was never your specialty.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.102
Hey! You're one to talk
being all tied up

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:03.236
at the moment!

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.472
I mean, really?

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.840
All of you?

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:09.242
Embarrassing!

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.978
That's why it's up to me
to save the day!

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:15.582
Ah!

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:16.817
Huh?

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.652
Nothing?

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.854
(Lightning)
You can't free us,
my friend.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:24.758
We've already fused together
with Bohman,

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.594
so we can no longer
be separated.

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:29.129
It's like a cake,

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.197
once you bake a cake,

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:34.301
you can't break it back up
into eggs, flour, sugar.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.169
Yeah, right!

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:37.471
(Aqua)
It's true, Ai.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:38.639
Huh?

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.740
I'm happy that you came
to save us,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.976
but you can't.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.576
You can still
get out of here

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:46.280
before Bohman spots you
and traps you in here with us.

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:48.115
So hurry up
and leave!

00:05:48.148 --> 00:05:49.183
Please!

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.185
But there's gotta be
a way.

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:52.486
(Lightning)
There isn't.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.254
In fact,
you should join us

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:55.923
and power Bohman up.

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:57.924
So, I can't allow you
to leave!

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.192
Bohman, listen!

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.095
Ai is still alive!

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:03.196
And here with us!

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.199
Here at your core!

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.068
(Bohman)
Oh, is he?

00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:11.405
I'm glad to see
you're still alive, Ai.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:13.974
It makes it
so much easier for me

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:15.642
to absorb you!

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.210
You're mine!

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.682
You're mine!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.587
Ai, move!

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:28.722
If Bohman absorbs you,

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.758
he'll become too powerful
to be stopped!

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.394
What do you think I'm doing,
Flame?

00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:36.430
And
I can't just leave ya here!

00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:39.733
If Playmaker defeats Bohman
with you all still inside,

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.902
you'll be erased along
with him!

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.070
You're right, Ai.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.905
But that
is what must happen.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.841
No, there has to be
another way!

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.910
There has to be!

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.411
I just found you,

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.413
I can't lose you all again!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.549
But you won't lose us,
Ai.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.418
Everyone,
let's show him why.

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.099
No!

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:13.967
What are you doing?

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.570
We're giving whatever power
we have to Ai.

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:19.473
No,
I order you to stop!

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:20.808
You can't stop us,
Lightning.

00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:22.475
You're no longer
in charge.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.612
And we can
extract your energy as well.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.750
(groans)

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.829
Take our energy,
Ai.

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:44.331
Use it to defeat Bohman!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.935
But if I can't save you,

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.970
then none of this
means anything.

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:52.239
(Flame)
Oh,
will you grow up?

00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:54.574
Hello!
We're both the same age!

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.977
You think you'll lose us
if you defeat Bohman,

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:57.978
but in reality,

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.914
you'll lose us
if you don't.

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:01.481
If you don't
defeat Bohman,

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:02.882
then you'll fall
victim to him

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:03.850
just as we have.

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:07.054
Meaning there will be
no surviving Ignis left.

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:09.056
But as long as
you survive,

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:10.824
the Ignis will survive.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.126
Not just you,
but all of us!

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.896
As long as we live on
in your memories,

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.664
we're not actually gone.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.399
So keep us alive,
Ai.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:23.036
By helping Playmaker
to defeat Bohman.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.372
Why do you always know
the right thing to say!

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.808
I will miss you too,
Ai.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.610
Win and make us proud.

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:32.546
(Lightning)
Don't listen to him.

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:34.314
You may think you're doing
the right thing,

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.383
but you don't know
the whole story.

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:38.885
You're only going to make
things worse.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:41.122
Well, even if I don't know
the whole story,

00:08:41.155 --> 00:08:42.956
I know enough of the tale.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.458
And any tale that ends

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:46.359
with the total destruction
of the world

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.828
is one
that ain't worth tellin'!

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.797
Bye, everyone.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.704
Goodbye, Ai.

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.105
(Bohman)
The time has come for me

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:00.607
to fully absorb you all.

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:06.580
Ai, you're making
a grave mistake.

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:08.015
You don't even know

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.582
that you'll be causing

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.618
what you're seeking
to prevent.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.726
(Playmaker)
How did it go, Ai?

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.030
As good as it could,
meaning not good at all.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.699
All the other Ignis
fused with Bohman,

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.834
so I couldn't free them.

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:28.668
Ai.

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:31.038
But they gave me
a going-away present

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:32.739
to defeat Bohman!

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.577
What is this?

00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:39.913
They gave me
whatever power they had left

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:42.616
to help us
in our fight!

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.451
I promise, Ai,

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.086
their sacrifice

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.921
won't go to waste.

00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.890
(Bohman)
So you escaped, Ai.

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:51.558
Although
you'll be returning

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.926
soon enough,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.127
when I absorb you

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.764
like I did the rest
of the Ignis.

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.966
(Ai)
That's not gonna happen,
Bohman!

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.734
We're gonna win
this duel!

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.037
And we're gonna win it
right here, right now!

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.372
Really?

00:10:05.406 --> 00:10:07.541
You winning is easy
to claim,

00:10:07.575 --> 00:10:10.444
but how do you expect
to actually achieve it?

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:14.048
My PERFECTRON
has 4,000 attack points,

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:15.782
which I can double
to 8,000

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:17.618
by using JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:20.420
And even if you manage
to summon a monster

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:21.888
that's stronger than that,

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:23.590
I can use
its special ability

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.125
to prevent it
from being destroyed

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:26.459
in battle.

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.562
I've analyzed
billions of strategies,

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:31.398
and I see no way
you can get past my monster

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:32.766
and win this duel.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.768
You may have
billions of strategies,

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:35.869
but I have Ai,

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.172
and that's everything I need!

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:39.606
You will find out

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:42.409
that that
will not be enough!

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:43.910
No matter what happens,

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:46.113
this next turn
will be our final one

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:47.547
in this duel, Bohman.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.383
So here goes.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:50.617
I draw!

00:10:54.789 --> 00:10:56.057
If this is our final turn,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.624
let's make it count.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:10:59.126
By discarding my DOTSCAPER,

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:01.294
I can summon THRESHOLD BORG.

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.298
Then DOTSCAPER's ability
activates,

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:08.335
resummoning itself
from my graveyard.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.237
Next, I will activate
my spell card

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.271
CYNET CODEC.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.840
And now,

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:16.109
I will create my circuit!

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.480
I Link Summon!

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:22.248
Link 2, CODE TALKER!

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.950
Whenever I summon
a CODE TALKER

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:24.952
on to my field,

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.621
CYNET CODEC's effect
activates,

00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:30.457
allowing me to draw a Cyberse
from my deck

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.793
with the same Attribute
as my CODE TALKER.

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:34.595
Then I'll use
that CODE TALKER

00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:37.797
and this MICRO CODER I drew
to Link Summon again!

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.333
Go!

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.435
I Link Summon!

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.570
Link 3, ENCODE TALKER!

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.245
2,300 points.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:54.815
That monster
is still no match for mine.

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:57.818
I think ya meant to say
no match for the moment.

00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.687
Because
if you think we're done,

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:01.755
you're gravely mistaken!

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.657
CYNET CODEC activates again

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.560
to add CYBERSE GADGET
to my hand.

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:08.829
And when I use MICRO CODER
to Link Summon,

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.030
its ability

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.332
lets me draw
CYNET OPTIMIZATION

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:14.034
from my deck.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.802
Next,
I will summon this!

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.305
Come out
CYBERSE GADGET!

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.642
When this CYBERSE GADGET
is summoned,

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:24.177
it revives MICRO CODER
from my graveyard!

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:30.317
And I'll set
these two monsters

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.852
in the Link Arrows!

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.588
I Link Summon!

00:12:34.655 --> 00:12:37.324
Link 2
CYBERSE WITCH!

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:39.994
Next, I activate

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:42.563
SIMM TABLIR's
special ability.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.331
By returning
CLOCK WYVERN

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:45.899
from my graveyard
to my hand,

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.601
I can summon SIMM TABLIR

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.004
next to CYBERSE WITCH's link!

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:53.207
Then, I activate
CYBERSE WITCH's ability

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.575
to banish CYNET FUSION

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:57.310
from my graveyard
to add CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.847
and CYNET RITUAL
to my hand.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.482
But that's not all.

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.383
CYBERSE WITCH's
second ability

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:05.418
resurrects WIDGET KID
back to my field.

00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:11.891
And WIDGET KID can bring out
a buddy as well!

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.727
CLOCK WYVERN!

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:18.632
I now activate
the Ritual Spell CYNET RITUAL!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.036
I tribute
my Level 3 WIDGET KID

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:24.805
and Level 5 SIMM TABLIR!

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:27.274
I Ritual Summon!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.942
Break the barriers
of reality,

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.977
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:34.548
A Ritual Summon.

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:37.918
Next I'll overlay
CLOCK WYVERN...

00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:39.887
along with my CYBERSE GADGET!

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:41.821
With these two monsters

00:13:41.888 --> 00:13:43.723
I build
the Overlay Network!

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:50.831
I Xyz Summon!

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.900
Rank 4
FIREWALL EXCEED DRAGON!

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:02.543
And this time
an Xyz Summon.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.377
Next...

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:06.847
I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.284
I Link Summon Link 3
TRANSCODE TALKER!

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:18.125
Ritual, Xyz,
Link Summoning.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:19.960
What's the point
of all these summonings

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.061
when they don't add up

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:24.065
to a monster
that's stronger than mine?

00:14:24.065 --> 00:14:26.400
Because they're adding up
to something

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:28.836
you can't comprehend,

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.438
something which you'll
never comprehend!

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:33.106
Oh, really now?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.509
(Playmaker)
Yes, and it's not just
a flaw in your duel,

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.611
it's a flaw
in your whole plan.

00:14:37.611 --> 00:14:39.813
Though you claim
to be fighting for peace,

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.783
in reality you are fighting
for revenge.

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.451
And I know because peace

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:47.520
requires everyone
to work together in harmony,

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:48.521
and even though

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.723
you've absorbed
countless humans,

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.458
you don't work
with them, Bohman,

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:53.627
so you still duel alone.

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:56.062
But that's not so
for me and Ai,

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:57.797
even though
our friends are gone,

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:59.633
we're still working
with them.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.068
By building upon everything
that Kolter did.

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:03.770
And Soulburner.

00:15:03.837 --> 00:15:06.707
And Flame and Aqua
and the rest of the Ignis.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.176
All of us working
towards a common goal.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:12.012
And that same idea
carries through to our duel.

00:15:12.046 --> 00:15:13.180
Each monster,

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:15.449
each summoning
may not seem like much,

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:18.118
but they're building together
towards a common goal,

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:20.253
which is to win this duel!

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.856
So though my friends
may be gone,

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:24.725
I'm building upon
what they achieved,

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.860
while you want to tear
everything down

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:29.696
to get revenge
for what you lost.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.565
For what I lost?

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:36.570
And everything my friends
and my monsters

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:38.772
have built up
are coming together now!

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:44.411
I activate CYNET CODEC
to draw CODE GENERATOR

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.780
from my deck
and add it to my hand.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:51.452
Then, I activate
CYNET OPTIMIZATION!

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.553
It lets me summon
the Cyberse monster

00:15:53.553 --> 00:15:55.555
I just drew,
CODE GENERATOR!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.695
Now...

00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:04.431
I create
my ultimate circuit!

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.968
I set CYBERSE MAGICIAN,

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:10.738
CODE GENERATOR
and TRANSCODE TALKER

00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:12.606
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.777
Link the circuit!

00:16:16.777 --> 00:16:19.113
What?

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:20.947
From the dawn of creation

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:22.750
comes the fire
that ignites life

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:24.618
throughout the universe!

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.456
I Link Summon!

00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.092
Link 5

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:34.461
FIREWALL DRAGON DARKFLUID!

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:41.535
A Link 5?

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.638
Only I'm supposed
to have a Link 5 monster!

00:16:44.672 --> 00:16:46.440
This is impossible!

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.274
(Ai)
Ha!

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.443
The impossible
is just the possible

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:52.445
that has yet to been done
Boh-boy!

00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:54.948
(Playmaker)
And for every different type

00:16:54.948 --> 00:16:56.851
of Cyberse monster

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.919
that's in my graveyard

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:02.022
Fusion, Ritual, Synchro
and Xyz,

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:04.858
my DARKFLUID gains one Counter
for a total of four.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:07.695
It's time!

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.596
FIREWALL DRAGON DARKFLUID,

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:11.831
attack
PERFECTRON HYDRADRIVE DRAGON!

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.705
But your FIREWLL DRAGON
has fewer attack points

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.041
than my monster.

00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:22.676
You sure about that?

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:23.677
That's right.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:24.745
Because during battle,

00:17:24.812 --> 00:17:27.514
DARKFLUID gains 2,500
attack points

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.416
for every counter
that it has!

00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:30.851
Meaning
its attack points increase

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.187
by 10,000 attack points!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.889
Go, DARKFLUID attack!

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.091
Flame Tempest Terahertz!

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.532
That's still not good enough,
Playmaker!

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.099
I can use JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.169
to double
my PERFECTRON's attack points,

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.669
and I take no damage

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:51.872
as long as it has
a HYDRADRIV Counter on it!

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.708
And then...

00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:57.645
I activate
PERFECTRON's ability!

00:17:57.678 --> 00:18:00.180
By removing
one HYDRADRIVE Counter,

00:18:00.213 --> 00:18:02.483
PERFECTRON
can't be destroyed.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.619
But since
it has one fewer Counter,

00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:08.255
your monster's attack points
drop.

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:10.591
That doesn't matter,
Playmaker.

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:13.794
Because PERFECTRON
has another ability.

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:15.462
Once the battle is over,

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:18.766
PERFECTRON can destroy
all your monsters in play

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.467
meaning that your DARKFLUID

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.971
and its 13,000 attack points
are going to waste--

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.539
Allow me to stop you there.

00:18:25.573 --> 00:18:26.707
Uh?

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:29.443
Because I can use
an ability as well!

00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:32.446
By removing
one of DARKFLUID's Counters,

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:35.215
your PERFECTRON's
special ability is negated!

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:36.383
In addition,

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.418
DARKFLUID is allowed
to attack again!

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:41.588
Attack again?

00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:42.823
That's right!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.992
Go, DARKFLUID!

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:47.394
Aqua Tempest Terahertz!

00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:53.500
By removing
another Counter,

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:56.237
PERFECTRON
will not be destroyed!

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.271
And I take no damage!

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.942
(Ai)
But that just lowered

00:19:01.976 --> 00:19:04.477
PERFECTRON's attack points
even more!

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.648
And then, like earlier,

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.850
I'll use a Counter
to allow DARKFLUID

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.686
to attack again!

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:16.490
No.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.658
Since your eyes got
all big and bulgy,

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:21.295
looks like ya finally figured
our strategy out!

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:22.730
We caught ya
in an attack loop

00:19:22.796 --> 00:19:24.698
that ya can't break out of!

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:25.699
And we couldn't have done it

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:28.936
unless all our monsters
were working together!

00:19:28.969 --> 00:19:30.604
Quite impressive.

00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:32.372
Even though
you only acquired

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:34.508
this monster just now,

00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:37.510
you already figured out
how to maximize its power.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.545
That's correct.

00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:40.381
But I don't deserve
all the credit

00:19:40.448 --> 00:19:42.983
because I didn't do it
all by myself.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.484
For you see, Bohman,

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:46.721
I had the memories
of my friends

00:19:46.787 --> 00:19:50.290
to help push me to duel
as hard as I can.

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.960
So now,
DARKFLUID attack!

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:54.995
Earth Tempest Terahertz!

00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:59.666
PERFECTRON uses
another Counter.

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:05.539
But its attack points
are once again dropping

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:07.507
like a hot potato!

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:09.777
(Playmaker)
I use another one

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.946
of DARKFLUID's Counters

00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:14.948
so that it can attack
your PERFECTRON again!

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.983
Windy Tempest Terahertz!

00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:22.456
(groans)

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.025
I use another one
of my PERFECTRON's Counters!

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:31.465
You mean the last
of its Counters!

00:20:31.499 --> 00:20:34.634
So its attack points
fall all the way to 0!

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:39.006
I use DARKFLUID's
last remaining Counter

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.009
so that I can attack
one final time!

00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:42.842
(Ai)
And since you have

00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:44.377
no Counters left

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:47.014
there's only two things
you can do to stop this,

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:49.517
diddly and squat!

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:50.851
DARKFLUID!

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:53.954
It's time to bring
this duel to an end!

00:20:53.987 --> 00:20:56.656
Neo Tempest Terahertz!

00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:03.730
(moans)

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:12.405
You win, Playmaker.

00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:15.609
The sun has set
on both of us.

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:18.446
(Harlin)
Bohman.

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:20.080
We did it, Playmaker!

00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:21.749
We won!

00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:24.351
(Bohman)
Yes, well done.

00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:25.518
It seems

00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:27.354
you two had
a few more surprises

00:21:27.388 --> 00:21:30.123
than I expected.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.126
Yes, Bohman.

00:21:32.192 --> 00:21:34.761
While you two will carry on
into the future,

00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.564
I will not be joining you.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.632
You now
have the responsibility

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:41.568
to determine what path
the future takes.

00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:43.938
I sincerely hope
you forge a good one.

00:21:44.004 --> 00:21:47.741
And not a future
that either one of you regret.

00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:48.608
Thanks...?

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:50.544
(Bohman)
Now that my time
is at an end,

00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.079
so is this world.

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.080
Farewell, Playmaker.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:56.584
Wow!

00:21:56.617 --> 00:21:59.920
We better bounce
our butts on outta here!

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.156
(Harlin)
Bohman.

00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:04.158
(Bohman)
Harlin.

00:22:04.158 --> 00:22:06.860
You came back for me?

00:22:06.927 --> 00:22:07.994
Of course.

00:22:08.028 --> 00:22:09.830
Are you ready?

00:22:09.863 --> 00:22:11.531
I am.

00:22:11.598 --> 00:22:14.067
And I will never leave
your side again.

00:22:24.144 --> 00:22:27.481
We saved LINK VRAINS,
Playmaker.

00:22:27.481 --> 00:22:28.649
Yes, Ai,

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:31.651
but there's still more
we need to save.

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:34.487
(everyone moans)
