00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:28.342
Let's just say I left her

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.377
in a state
true to her name.

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.845
You know...

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.614
the kind of blue you
feel after having

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.316
been completely
and utterly defeated?

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:39.519
But please,
see for yourself.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:41.021
What's that?

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:42.188
♪♪♪

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.396
(chuckling maniacally)

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.701
She's been
reduced to data!

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:57.037
Does it hurt
to see her like that?

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:58.638
I certainly do hope so

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.608
because the more suffering
that I spread,

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:02.409
the more joy I feel!

00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:03.777
That is sick.

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:05.612
My, my, Playmaker.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.914
Those sound like
fighting words to me.

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:09.549
You're right.

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:10.751
'Cause they are.

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:12.385
Excellent, Playmaker.

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.187
Time to duel!
Time to duel!

00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:17.124
Allow me the honor
of going first.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.225
I summon
Sunseed Genius Loci

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.860
in attack mode.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.631
And this seed...
will germinate into

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:27.067
a full-grown Link Monster!

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:29.869
The summoning conditions

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:32.539
require me to use
one Plant monster.

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:35.609
So I set my Sunseed
in the Link Arrow!

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:37.044
I Link Summon!

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:40.180
Link 1 Sunavalon Dryas!

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.953
It has no attack points.

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:47.687
I'll place
this card facedown

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:49.523
and end my turn.

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:51.725
What a strange strategy.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.461
But with it he was able
to defeat Blue Angel.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.463
I wonder how
he pulled it off?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.099
(Ai)
Well, you better figure
it out quicker than her.

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.235
'Cause you saw how
she ended up.

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:02.502
Yes, I know.

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:04.838
But you know what's really
creepy about this guy?

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.840
He... doesn't... blink!

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:08.541
It's, like,
totally mesmerizing.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.844
Like he's staring
into my soul.

00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:12.913
How can
an AI have a soul?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.381
Now be nice.

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.549
You should be
treating your pet

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:17.217
with a little more respect.

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:18.753
(Ai)
I hate to agree
with a Hanoi,

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:20.254
but he has a point.

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:22.222
Ai, I'm not
going to argue with you.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:23.557
Oh my.

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:26.226
Do I detect a spot
of trouble between you two?

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.229
You really ought to get
on the same page

00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:30.064
if you wish
to defeat me.

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.765
Thanks for the tip.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.734
But I can manage
this duel just fine

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:36.070
without being lectured
by a Knight of Hanoi.

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:38.171
I beg to differ,
Playmaker.

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.875
I think you can
learn a lot from us.

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.443
Take me as an example.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.579
While you and your Ignis
squabble like children...

00:10:45.613 --> 00:10:47.214
I have not
a single qualm

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:48.382
serving Master Varis

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:50.917
to my utmost
capabilities.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.088
How can you think that?

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.123
Don't you know
what Varis has done?

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.791
All the people he's hurt?

00:10:58.592 --> 00:10:59.860
Of course I do.

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:02.696
I was by his side when he
made those decisions.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.698
It's always the ones who
have never suffered

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.768
true tragedy that can
speak of it so callously.

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.069
Ah...

00:11:09.103 --> 00:11:10.570
But that
is where you are

00:11:10.604 --> 00:11:13.273
very much incorrect,
Playmaker.

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:14.941
Because, truth be told,

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.678
I have endured as much
suffering as you.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:20.614
I seriously
doubt that, Spectre.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.916
I know of the Lost Incident.

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:27.087
When six kids were taken
and isolated from society.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.524
These children were locked
in separate rooms,

00:11:30.591 --> 00:11:33.660
ensuring they were
kept apart from each other.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.362
Now had they been able to see

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:38.098
one another's faces,
Playmaker...

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.467
you would know
that this face here

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.603
belonged to one
of those children.

00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:43.937
(Ai)
Aww, glitch!

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:45.672
You were one
of the taken?!

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:48.008
That's correct,
just like you.

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:49.643
Although my take away
from that event

00:11:49.677 --> 00:11:51.311
differs from yours.

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.346
Clearly, Spectre.

00:11:57.351 --> 00:11:58.919
♪♪♪

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:01.188
Why would you ever join
the Knights of Hanoi?

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:02.990
(Ai)
And why did the chicken
cross the road?

00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:05.425
It doesn't matter!

00:12:05.492 --> 00:12:07.861
It matters, Ai, because
they put us through agony!

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.663
Agony?

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:11.164
I felt no agony.

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:12.400
(gasping)

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:15.635
See, it really all
just depends, Playmaker,

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:18.572
on your point of view
of the experience.

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.041
And my point of view
was as someone who grew up

00:12:21.075 --> 00:12:22.509
in an orphanage.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.477
Even though there
were other children,

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.680
none of them wanted
to play with me.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.849
It was
as if I was a ghost.

00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:30.317
A specter.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.752
Day after day,
this was my reality.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.522
This was my agony.

00:12:35.555 --> 00:12:38.658
Until the Lost Incident,
that is.

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:42.663
Someone finally
took an interest in me.

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:45.533
Locked in a room with
nothing but a VR set

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:47.334
was... nice.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.069
It was nice?

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:50.670
It was horrible!

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:51.738
Really?

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:52.973
Was it?

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:55.843
It seems this is where
our opinions diverge.

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:58.011
For the first time ever

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.147
someone was
focusing on me,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.716
wanting to learn how
skilled I was.

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:05.819
Sure, their training
methods were a bit harsh...

00:13:06.754 --> 00:13:07.888
(yelling)

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.223
... but at the end
of the day

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.925
it did make me
a better duelist.

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.161
I no longer felt alone.

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:17.431
I learned not to fear pain
but to embrace it.

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.600
As a sort
of joyful comfort.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.335
Yes, yes, I know.

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:23.370
This must all sound
a bit out there

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.073
to someone such as
yourself, Playmaker.

00:13:26.107 --> 00:13:29.243
Someone who's devoted
his whole life...

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:31.611
to getting revenge
for the exact same thing

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.881
that I'm currently
celebrating!

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:36.150
(Ai)
Nah, it doesn't
sound out there.

00:13:36.217 --> 00:13:38.251
It sounds insane!

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:40.987
But alas, all good times
had to come to an end

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:43.390
when they "rescued"
me against my will

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.559
and returned me
to the orphanage.

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:47.595
How they thought that
would better my life

00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:50.097
I still
do not understand.

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.732
If I didn't feel
alone before

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:54.467
it was now
a hundred times worse.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.069
They were scared
to talk to me,

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.205
wary of saying
the wrong thing.

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.240
Everyone treated me
with kiddie gloves

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:02.509
as if I was
made of porcelain.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.478
As if I would shatter
into pieces

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.279
at the slightest touch.

00:14:07.815 --> 00:14:10.451
So I chose to run away
from the orphanage.

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:13.721
To go back to the only
home I've ever known.

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:16.957
Only to find
it locked away.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.226
So I just sat there
and waited.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:20.894
You waited?

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:24.498
For my wishes
to come true.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:25.666
For them to come back

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.467
so that I could once
again re-live

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.669
the best
time of my life.

00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:32.772
But they
didn't come back.

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.846
Only he did.

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:42.349
(gasping)

00:14:42.383 --> 00:14:46.153
When I saw him I knew
without a doubt...

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:49.155
he was the one
I was born to serve.

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:50.624
It was Varis.

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.025
(Ai)
His helmet's been
runnin' the chaos

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.127
and crazy since
day one!

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.329
It seems so.

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.797
And Spectre's just another one
of his puppets.

00:14:57.831 --> 00:14:58.833
No, no.

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.534
You're not listening.

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:03.103
I serve him
because I want to.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.940
Not because I have to.

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.774
I owe him all.

00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:09.376
He taught me...

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.378
that for some people
such as myself

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:14.214
happiness doesn't come
from rainbows and lollipops,

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:16.583
rather, it comes from
grit and grime!

00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:17.751
(Ai)
Hey, there's no point

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:19.253
in trying to reason
with this guy.

00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:21.421
He doesn't have any
reason in the first place!

00:15:21.455 --> 00:15:23.390
Besides, if you waste
any more time,

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.126
that tower will
be completed!

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:26.593
Am I right
or am I right?

00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:27.761
Say I'm right!

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:28.962
Say it,
say it...

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.030
You are, um...

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:31.031
Let's duel!

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:32.065
Yes, let's.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:35.035
Let us have our cards
settle our differences.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.570
My turn!

00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:37.738
I draw!

00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.840
By sending
a Level-2-or-lower monster

00:15:39.874 --> 00:15:41.775
from my hand to
the graveyard,

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:44.211
I'm allowed
to summon Bitrooper!

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.448
And with it...

00:15:47.515 --> 00:15:50.016
I can create
my circuit!

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.188
The summoning condition

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:56.123
requires
one Cyberse monster,

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.026
so I set my
Bitrooper...

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.594
in the Link Arrow!

00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:04.698
I Link Summon
Link 1 Link Disciple!

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:13.340
(Playmaker)
I Link Summon
Link 1 Link Disciple!

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:19.312
Next I'll be bringing out
my Link Infra-Flier!

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:21.782
I can automatically
summon it next to my

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:23.583
Link Monster's link!

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:28.021
And...

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:30.490
I can use it to
Link Summon again!

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.292
Like before,
the summoning condition

00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.694
is one Cyberse monster.

00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:37.330
But I'm summoning
a different Link Monster!

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:39.500
I Link Summon...

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:41.401
Link 1 Link Devotee!

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.508
Then I tribute
it to activate

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:51.011
Link Disciple's
special ability!

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.314
I get to draw
a card...

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:55.683
to my hand!

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.318
And I return a different
one to my deck.

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:02.522
Now Link Devotee's
special ability activates!

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:04.057
By tributing it,

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.059
I can summon two
Link Tokens

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:08.428
to my field
in defense mode.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.500
I follow that up by
summoning Cyberse Gadget!

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:15.969
And by doing so,

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.038
its special ability
resurrects a monster

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:21.375
from my graveyard by negating
its special abilities.

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.310
Come on out, Latency!

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.147
(Spectre)
My, my, another one?

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.714
Are you attempting to set
the world record

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:30.684
for the most monsters
played in a single turn?

00:17:30.684 --> 00:17:33.153
No, I'm not, Spectre.

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:35.189
But that
doesn't mean I'll stop.

00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:37.892
Because I'm Link Summoning
for a third time!

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:40.193
I create my circuit!

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:44.865
The summoning conditions
are two non-Token monsters.

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.433
So I set Cyberse Gadget

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.169
and Latency
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:49.203 --> 00:17:50.671
I Link Summon!

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:52.806
Link 2 Binary Sorcercess!

00:17:59.045 --> 00:18:00.814
And since I sent
Cyberse Gadget

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.651
to the graveyard
to bring out my Sorceress,

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:04.651
I'm allowed to summon

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:06.753
a Gadget Token
to my field!

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:12.392
And with it,
I can Link Summon

00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.228
for a fourth time!

00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:15.228
The summoning conditions

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:18.098
require me to set
two Cyberses.

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:22.369
I Link Summon
Link 2 Multi Sledgehammer!

00:18:27.107 --> 00:18:30.377
But why would I stop at
four when I can go five?

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.080
I set my two Link Tokens
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:37.984
I Link Summon
Link 2 Binary Blader!

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:42.123
Now go!

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:46.226
Binary Sorceress,
attack Sunavalon Dryas!

00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:50.097
Due to its special ability,
Dryas cannot be attacked.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.598
So your blast of energy

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:54.134
is redirected
straight to me.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.469
(Ai)
Why's he happy about that?

00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:03.143
Thanks, Playmaker.

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.679
You triggered
Dryas' other ability!

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.516
During each of our
turns...

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.884
when I take damage,

00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:12.820
I can summon my
Sunvine Gardna

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.289
next to my
Sunavalon Dryas's link

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:18.725
and regain all the damage
that you dealt me.

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:24.564
(Ai)
I've heard
of tree huggers before

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:26.733
but not a tree
that hugs you!

00:19:28.635 --> 00:19:30.637
Perhaps it's due
to my special connection

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:32.706
with the green.

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:35.676
One that spans
to my earliest days.

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:38.179
In the most natural
of nurseries.

00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:40.780
There in the hollow
of a tree did I inhale

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:43.050
my first sweet
breaths of air.

00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:45.151
You might think I would
have been scared

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.988
but on the contrary
I was comforted.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:50.124
Even when
the skies became violent

00:19:50.157 --> 00:19:51.992
and the rain
began to pour,

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.328
I knew I was safe

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.297
because this tree
kept me safe.

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:00.533
And not just from
the elements.

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.702
When things
looked their most dire,

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:05.605
when my fate appeared
sealed...

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:07.775
the tree was there.

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:09.342
It shielded me
from danger

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.946
while still showing me
the beauty of the world.

00:20:15.483 --> 00:20:17.050
Eventually I was found

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:19.320
and brought
to the orphanage.

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:21.555
But I wish I had never
been discovered

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:25.192
because the greatest
peace that I ever knew...

00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:27.161
was there in that
tree hollow,

00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:28.295
which is why
I would go back

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:29.963
to visit every day.

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:32.699
That was,
until the Lost Incident.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.470
Though I did enjoy
the experience...

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:37.438
the only downside

00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:40.040
was not being able
to visit the hollow.

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:44.211
So, after I was "saved,"
that was my first stop

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:46.447
and my last visit there.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.282
During the six months
I was captured,

00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:50.317
the tree had
been cut down.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.119
My protector was gone.

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:53.520
For what?

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:55.122
To make pencils?

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:57.792
The truth is my dreary life
at the orphanage

00:20:57.825 --> 00:21:01.394
wasn't the only
reason I turned to Varis.

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:05.098
The whole world needs to pay
for their transgressions!

00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:07.868
Varis protects me now,

00:21:07.868 --> 00:21:10.670
and I'll protect him
by destroying you!
