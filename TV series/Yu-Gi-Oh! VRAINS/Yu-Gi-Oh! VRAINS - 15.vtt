So, check this out.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.441
It's a message
from Ghost Gal.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.411
She's challenging you
to a duel.

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.679
And if she wins the duel,

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.447
she gets to take
possession of Ai.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.115
Dream on, sister!

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.084
If I win,
we get backdoor access

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.519
to Sol Tech's mainframe.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.519
(sighing)

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.453
I accept.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.125
She's in.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.293
Ready to duel,
Playmaker?

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.997
I do hope that this is not
another one of your tricks,

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.098
Ghost Gal.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.699
The backdoor program,

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.135
all zipped up
and ready to go.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.137
I bet you can find
all sorts of info,

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.006
even what happened
in your past.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.974
So, why are you risking it?

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.477
Because your AI will fetch
a much higher price.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.346
I already have
buyers lined up.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.650
So, unless you have a problem,
I say we get duelin'.

I thought you were
something special, Playmaker.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.335
I'm disappointed.
Oh, well.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:09.836
I'll just have
to comfort myself

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.874
with the pile of cash
I'll get from selling that AI.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:15.175
(AI)
Come on, Playmaker.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.644
You have one last trick
up your sleeve, right?

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.145

While your side
of the field is empty,

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.782
I have a whole army

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:30.818
But all I need is
one attack to end you.

Not cool!
Not cool!
Not cool!

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.954
I hate it
when she's right!

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.123
So do you got any ideas
to make her wrong?

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:37.792

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:46.266
Yeah, but when we get
this exclusive scoop, boss,

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.401
our bank accounts are
gonna pull a 180

how much longer
I can eat instant noodles.

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:56.210
I feel like
I'm slurping up worms.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.579
You know what would be
super-duper sad and slimy?

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.481

Don't worry, boss,

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:10.457
I'll use my bonus to take you
to the best buffet in town!

There ain't gonna be any bonus

I can't watch...
maybe a little.

This duel isn't even close
to over, Ghost Gal.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.165
When you attack me directly,

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.935
I'm allowed to summon
Lockout Gardna in attack mode!

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.169
Hah!

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.041
And due to
its special ability,

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.743
Lockout can't be destroyed
in battle this turn.

And since we summoned
a monster mid-attack,

Ghost Gal can choose whether
to keep attacking or not.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.387
If she does,
our life points will drop

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.355
below a thousand--
which would let us

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.291
use our Skill Storm Access.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.927
So, getting her to attack
is our best option!

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.261

Well, Ai, it might be

Ghost Gal just hit the brakes

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:06.774
She probably sniffed out some
trap Playmaker has planned,

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:08.175
nothing ever gets by her.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.777

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.448
I mean, think about it,

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:17.083
if me and you get
the only footage ever

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:20.254

we'll cash in big time.

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:21.688
You know what?
You're right!

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.357
Oh, no, what a dilemma!

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:25.459
I don't want
LINK VRAINS's hero to lose!

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:26.693

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.929
my bank account's
the real loser!

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.264
Oh, the mental struggle!

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.575
I draw!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.015
(Ai)
Playmaker, if you wipe out
before we wipe her out,

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.350

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.290
(Ai)
Playmaker,
if you wipe out

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.524
before we wipe her out,

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.125
we're gonna be

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.530
I activate my trap!

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.531
Altergeist Protocol!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.536
Next, I tribute
my Meluseek to activate

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.239
Altergeist Primebanshee's
special ability!

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.208
She summons another Altergeist

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.344
from my deck
next to her link!

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:21.181
So strengthen my defenses,
Altergeist Silquitous!

00:06:23.183 --> 00:06:25.886
And since Meluseek went
to the graveyard,

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.855
her special ability lets me

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:30.324
add another Altergeist
to my hand.

00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:34.528
And Altergeist Kunquery will
be perfect for my plans.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.230
Just as I expected.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.331
Just between you and me,
that card nearly made me

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.367
delete my inbox
all over the place!

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.337
Because she can use Kunquery
to stop our attacks!

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:46.306
Yes, that's true, but there's
no point in whining about it.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.176
Instead, focus on finding
cracks in her strategy.

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:50.678
For example,
when Ghost Gal is

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:54.314
the only one who has a monster
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.982
I can summon this!

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.918
My Backlinker!

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:01.421
What?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.956
And by tributing
Backlinker,

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.925
I can send
Altergeist Primebanshee

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.326
to the graveyard!

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.264
Oh, yeah!
That's the stuff!

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:13.266
Well, you can stuff
those plans.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.235
By sending Marionetter
to the graveyard,

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:19.206
Altergeist Protocol negates
Backlinker's special ability!

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:22.109
My Primebanshee isn't
going anywhere!

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.477
Looks like
you failed again,

00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:25.746
but I'll keep it
our little secret.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:28.482
At least we got that
going for us, Playmaker.

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:31.418
That is precisely the move
I'd hoped she would make, Ai.

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:33.654
When Backlinker's
special ability is negated,

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.556
I can summon this monster!

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.957
My Striping Partner!

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.792
Now come
and join this duel!

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.967
And when I successfully summon
Striping Partner to my field,

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.403
I can then resurrect
a Cyberse monster

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:51.772
that's Level 4 or lower
from my graveyard.

00:07:51.772 --> 00:07:53.407
Rise, Backlinker!

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.243
Oh, I get it,
you want to use Backlinker

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:58.545
to try to destroy
my Primebanshee again.

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:01.314
But what didn't work once
won't work twice,

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.551
not when I return
Altergeist Protocol to my hand

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.288
to activate Silquitous's
special ability!

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:09.723
She sends
Striping Partner
to your hand,

00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:12.325
so Backlinker
isn't coming back!

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.728
That won't be the end
of the tale, Ghost Gal.

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:17.330
Not when I have
Lockout Gardna!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.365
Go!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.542
Lockout Gardna locks out
both Striping Partner

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.812
and Altergeist Silquitous's
special abilities!

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:33.981
So I may not get
Backlinker back,

00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.716
but Striping Partner
remains on my field!

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:41.822
<i>Analysis: Playmaker saved
his second monster</i>

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:44.157
<i>so that he can attempt

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:46.226
Oh, is that right?

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:47.995
But I'm ready for him.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.564
And he's not ready for me.

00:08:50.564 --> 00:08:53.200
As usual.
(chuckling)

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.602
Whoa, their moves are
so high-level

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:58.638
that it's making my eyes
spin out of control!

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.707
Keep those peepers
on point, see?

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.910
And watch the shake
and shimmer, would ya?

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.779
Accomplish all that,
we'll be good to go!

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.881
Looks like Yusaku's
turned the tide,

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.917
but Ghost Gal's
staying cool.

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:12.752
I bet she has a backup plan
for her backup plan.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.633
Come on, I know
you want to Link Summon,

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:29.169
and it's not polite
to keep a lady waiting.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:32.939
Very well then.

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.275
I shall do as you wish,
Ghost Gal!

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:43.350
The summoning conditions
require two Effect Monsters,

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.020
so I set Lockout Gardna
and Striping Partner

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.587
in the Link Arrows!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.393
I Link Summon

00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:54.861
Link Two Underclock Taker!

00:09:57.731 --> 00:10:01.201
And I'll follow that up
by summoning Balancer Lord!

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.941
With these two,
I've set up the perfect combo!

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:12.012
Since Balancer Lord has
1700 attack points,

00:10:12.012 --> 00:10:14.381
Underclock Taker's
special ability lowers

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:15.715
your Primebanshee's
attack points

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:17.518
by 1700 as well!

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:19.920
Ooh, that is
a scary combo.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.255
If it worked,
that is.

00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:24.892
But it won't when I activate
Altergeist Camouflage!

00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:27.227
By equipping it
on Primebanshee,

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:29.363
your Underclock Taker's
special ability

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:30.564
can no longer
affect her!

00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:32.032
But nice try.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:33.567
Nice try?

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:34.835
Are you being sarcastic?

00:10:34.835 --> 00:10:36.703
Is she being sarcastic?
Answer me!

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:40.007
Oh, and when Primebanshee
is camouflaged?

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.109
Your monsters can't
attack her, either.

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:44.744
So there's nothing you can do
to destroy her!

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.247
And if you can't
get past my Primebanshee,

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:48.549
you can't win!

00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:50.517
You're done, Playmaker!

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:56.557
I know it's not over
till it's over, Playmaker,

00:10:56.557 --> 00:10:57.891
but it's over.

00:10:57.891 --> 00:10:59.760
I'll prove you wrong.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.028
Oh, please...

00:11:01.028 --> 00:11:03.097
I pay 1000 life points

00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:05.665
to activate Balancer Lord's
special ability!

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:10.771
<i>Playmaker is below
1,000 life points.</i>

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:12.672
<i>He is now allowed
to activate his Skill.</i>

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.008
Oh, I get it.

00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:16.076
Storm Access is
your last ditch chance

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.510
to turn this duel around.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.146
But I won't
let you activate it

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:20.948
because I'll use
my own Skill!

00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.449
Secret Cure!

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.251
Your Skill?
I know this is bad for us,

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:25.853
but I'm kind of excited!

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:29.423
My Skill Secret Cure allows me
to draw cards from my deck

00:11:29.423 --> 00:11:30.824
until I get a monster card,

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.593
and then we both
gain life points

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.929
equal to that monster's
attack points.

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:38.698
So, let's see what the cards
have in store for us!

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.972
I draw!

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:47.941
Altergeist Camouflage?
Well, that's no monster.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.111
But my second card is!

00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:51.945
Altergeist Meluseek!

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:55.616
Since she has 500 attack points,
we each get 500 life points.

00:11:55.616 --> 00:11:58.919
That brings your life points
up from 900 to 1,400,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:01.821
taking you out of range
from using Storm Access!

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.757
That is so BM!

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:06.059
How dare she give us
life points!

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.728
Actually, that's
kind of a nice thing...

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:09.496
that makes me so angry!

00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:11.498
She stopped us
from using our Skill,

00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:13.200
but since I have
Balancer Lord,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.935
that's only temporary.

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:18.372
With it, I'm allowed to summon
another Cyberse monster!

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:19.973
Which I intend to do!

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:23.810
All right, Scan Doll,
time for you to join the duel!

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.818
And Scan Doll has
an ability,

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:34.388
an ability that costs me
1,000 life points.

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:36.691
<i>Playmaker can once again
use his Skill.</i>

00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:37.925
(chuckles)
Rude.

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.492
Now I'll use Scan Doll

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:42.062
to return a trap card
back from your graveyard,

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.430
Altergeist Camouflage!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.266
Which camouflages
Silquitous.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:50.471
Oh, yeah! You can
now use your Skill

00:12:50.471 --> 00:12:52.740
to pull a new monster
outta the Data Storm!

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.475
And I see a big one
swirlin' over there!

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.811
(wind whooshing)

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.623
(wind booming)

00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:17.431
Uh-- maybe too big?

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:18.331
Hang tight!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.736
(both screaming)

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:24.972
If you had a hat,
I'd tell you to hang on to it!

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.240
The only thing I want
holding anything right now

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.608
is you onto me!

00:13:30.076 --> 00:13:32.913
(Ai)
Ghost Gal's heading straight
for the Data Storm, too.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.414
You think
she's gonna be okay?

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:37.918
Well, do ya?
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:51.331
(Pigeon)
Boss, no one said nothin'
about no Data Storm.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.634
Maybe we should turn around
and live to fly another day!

00:13:53.634 --> 00:13:55.269
(Frog)
Nah, flap those flappers!

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:56.970
Please, boss,
this is crazy!
I'm not afraid
of a little breeze!

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.407
I'll punch our way into that
storm with a left and a right!

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:02.943
Here goes!
Charge!

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:06.480
I'm so scared!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.548
Nonsense!
Flap to it!

00:14:08.548 --> 00:14:11.151
I'm flapping
as fast as I can!

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:13.320
Aah!
That's it!

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.556
We're downloading a chopper app
once we make our money back!

00:14:20.828 --> 00:14:22.829
Aah!

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.197
(Ai)
Come on, Playmaker!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.799
Seize the wind!

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.834
(battle-cry)

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.003
I did everything I could
and still couldn't stop him

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.771
from activating his Skill.

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:38.211
(straining)

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.646
Go, Storm Access!

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:50.324
(gasping)

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:52.025
Aah!

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:58.298
(Ai)
You won't make it,
Playmaker!

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:00.600
She's fallen too deep
into the eye!

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.615
Playmaker!
Don't let go!

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:21.888
You seem unhurt.

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:25.959
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:29.062
Good, then we can
continue our duel.

00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:33.066
(gasping)

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.704
Aaah!

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.918
So, did you think
for a second

00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:52.719
you were putting me
in danger too?

00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:55.188
Look, they made it out, boss!

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:57.391
Yeah, and them
being out...

00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:00.060
Means that you and me are
back in business!

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.929
Hate to say this,

00:16:01.929 --> 00:16:04.097
but I owe you one
for saving my life.

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:05.966
So, I'll cut you in
on the profits

00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:07.501
when I sell your AI.

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.336
That won't be necessary.

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:10.938
Because now...

00:16:10.938 --> 00:16:12.906
I create
the ultimate circuit!

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.311
Link Arrows authorized!

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.347
The summoning conditions
require at least

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:21.948
two Cyberse monsters.

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.818
Therefore, I set
Link Two Underclock Taker

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.621
and Balancer Lord
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.496
I Link Summon!

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:41.268
Link Three Excode Talker!

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:57.017
You can summon all
the powerful monsters you want,

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.752
but it won't help.

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.153
Because when you attack,

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:02.389
I'm allowed to summon
Altergeist Kunquery

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.024
and stop your attack.

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:06.994
I activate
Excode Talker's ability!

00:17:06.994 --> 00:17:09.930
For every monster
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.866
you can no longer use
one of your Main Monster Zones!

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:15.903
Excode Talker,
block her field!

00:17:15.903 --> 00:17:17.171
What?

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:19.172
Grasp Zone!

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:27.047
Your two remaining
Main Monster Zones

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.882
are completely useless!

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.418
If there's no zone
to summon Kunquery,

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.988
I can't use her effect
to negate his attack!

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:36.256
And since my other monsters
are camouflaged,

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.392
Playmaker can
attack me directly!

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.261
That's right,
and by tributing Scan Doll,

00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:45.232
Excode Talker can attack
not once but twice!

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.140
That's enough to wipe out
all my life points!

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.309
Excode Talker,
attack Ghost Gal!

00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:03.583
(gasping)

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.320
Looks like this ghost's
gettin' get rid of!

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.956
Attack again,
Excode Talker!

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:12.092
Closing Chaos!

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:16.797
(gasping)

00:18:16.797 --> 00:18:19.500
Aah!

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.201
You win, Playmaker.

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:26.406
Oh, yeah!

00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:27.908
Playmaker's still number one,

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:29.910
and you can take that
all the way to the bank!

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.079
I'd rather take a paycheck
to the bank.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.481
Oh, well, at least
we still got some footage.

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:36.316
The check will be
missing a few digits,

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:38.552
but I won't have
to skip breakfast this week.

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:41.054
Well, Playmaker,
you sure know

00:18:41.054 --> 00:18:42.990
how to show a girl
a good time.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.157
If you call that good,

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:45.659
I don't know
what you'd call bad.

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:47.261
But, hey, I'm not judging you.

00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:48.963
Okay, I'm judging you.

00:18:48.963 --> 00:18:50.930
You're feisty.
I like that.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.834
You sure you wanna hang out
with that bore instead of me?

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:57.404
Oh, absolutely not,
but moving's such a hassle,

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.805
and I don't feel
like packing.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:00.307
That's too bad.

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:02.976
I was going to introduce you
to some cute little widgets.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.278
What'd you say?
Enough.

00:19:04.278 --> 00:19:06.713
You remember our deal,
don't you, Ghost Gal?

00:19:06.713 --> 00:19:08.882
How could I forget?

00:19:10.684 --> 00:19:12.052
One backdoor access

00:19:12.052 --> 00:19:14.120
into SOL Technologies' databank.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.558
At your service.

00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:21.528
Try not to get caught.

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:23.664
I'd hate
to see you digitized.

00:19:23.664 --> 00:19:26.066
Later, hon.

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:28.134
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:33.306
(thinking)
<i>But I hope you can do
what I couldn't do.</i>

00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.480
You sure we're gonna find
the answers you're looking for

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.983
inside SOL Technologies'
databank?

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:45.852
There's no guarantee
that I will.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:48.321
But still...

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:49.824
if there's even
the slightest chance

00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:52.225
to learn about my past...

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:53.860
I must take it.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.697
Yes, of that,
I'm absolutely sure of.

00:19:56.697 --> 00:19:59.566
And there are probably
other secrets in there, too!

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.368
UFOs, Bigfoot,

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.103
maybe even
your sense of humor!

00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:06.373
(Frog)
You filmed
the whole duel, right?

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:07.708
Every second!

00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.143
Every pixel
in extra hi-def!

00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:11.044
Good! Now,
this might not be

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:13.280
the Playmaker video special
we were intending,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.649
but this isn't
a bad audible!

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.217
And it may even be
even better because

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.320
we have Ghost Gal
dueling too!

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.155
Our bosses
and our bosses' bosses

00:20:21.155 --> 00:20:23.157
will give us bonuses
for sure, right, boss?

00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:24.725
Yeah!
Big ones!

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.293
Now, show me
what you filmed.

00:20:26.293 --> 00:20:27.694
Ba-kawk!

00:20:34.168 --> 00:20:35.870
Uh-oh!

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.137
You mess up?

00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:39.473
No! I double-checked
and everything,

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:41.008
I thought it--
<i>Tsk tsk.</i>

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:43.210
<i>My duel wasn't
for you prying eyes,</i>

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.679
<i>so I erased
your memory card.</i>

00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.813
<i>Toodles.</i>

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:49.516
(both screaming)

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:51.652
Tell me you backed it up
to the cloud!

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:53.654
No, I was too busy
flying through the clouds!

00:20:53.654 --> 00:20:56.156
Well, what are the odds
of recovering the footage?

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:57.491
Uh, outlook cloudy.

00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:01.028
Aww, they're so cute
when they squabble!

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:02.395
Get over here!
Not the flight feathers!

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.674
Here you go, Kolter.
Thanks, buddy.

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:15.276
So, do you really
think we can hack

00:21:15.276 --> 00:21:17.545
into SOL Tech's databank
with this program?

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:18.879
We'll see.

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:19.880
Well, let me know

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.181
the instant
you know for sure.

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:22.583
This may be the key...

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.184
(yawning)

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:26.087
...we've been
looking for.

00:21:26.087 --> 00:21:27.420
Huh?

00:21:30.257 --> 00:21:32.192
(soft snoring)

00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:37.397
(thinking)
<i>Time to get cracking.</i>

00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:50.544
