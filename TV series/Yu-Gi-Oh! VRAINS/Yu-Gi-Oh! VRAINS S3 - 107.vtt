WEBVTT

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.116
(Roboppi)
I'm in trouble.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.116
Gore Gal and Shepherd

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.485
have the three strongest
monsters in play!

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.987
And by the look in their eyes,
they're not done!

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:24.758
Get ready!

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.859
I activate

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.495
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's
special ability!

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:31.598
It lets me revive SCUD DRONE
from the graveyard!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.002
And doing so triggers
SCUD DRONE's ability as well!

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.006
When a DRONE resummons it
from the graveyard,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.508
I'm allowed to draw
one card from my deck.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:45.145
Next, I place one card
facedown on my field.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.147
Then I activate

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.516
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's
second ability,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.985
allowing SCUD DRONE
to attack you directly.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.489
And that... is exactly
what it's going to do!

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.193
(grunts)

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.362
Next up,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.932
I can use BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's
third ability

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.266
to tribute SCUD DRONE

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.202
and deal you damage equal
to its attack points!

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:11.505
Aah!

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.340
(explosion)

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:24.651
♪♪♪

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.943
Just great, now those two have
more life points than me!

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.579
I really gotta start
to work harder!

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.250
(Pandoll)
Hmm.
Most impressive, Ghost Gal.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.654
It seems you've skillfully
used your partner's cards

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.322
to maximum efficiency.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.790
Thanks, hon.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.625
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:40.928
cuz there's still
plenty of duel to go.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.629
As for my next move...

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:44.598
Hmmm.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:45.466
Kay...

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.902
ALTERGEIST HEXSTIA,
attack VACCULEPHANT!

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.905
My CELTOPUS's special ability

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:54.107
gives VACCULEPHANT
2000 attack points

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.243
to raise it to 3000!

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.445
I see.

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:01.982
But my HEXSTIA still has more
attack points than your monster.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.885
Yeahhhh it does.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:05.886
For now.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:09.023
But I can still use
my PROPELION!

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.326
Its special ability cuts
your attack points in half,

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.394
making it weaker than mine!

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.333
Suck up her attack

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.836
and blow it back!

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:28.375
(grunts)

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.780
(laughs)

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:36.483
I did it!
I destroyed your monster!

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:39.887
(grunts)

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:41.555
Not bad, Roboppi.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.657
(The Shepherd)
Don't praise that program.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.027
Are you going to let that thing
make a mockery out of us?

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:51.131
Chill out, Kenneth.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.567
When HEXSTIA is destroyed&amp;

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:57.338
I can add ALTERGEIST KUNQUERY
to my hand.

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.173
And I'm going to use
your monster again.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.608
Humph.

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.877
I tribute my brother's GENERAL

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.413
to activate
MEMORYGANT's ability!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.349
She gains all of GENERAL's
attack points.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.054
Say whaaaaa?
5200?

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.190
Attack APPLIANCER VACCULEPHANT!

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.227
CELTOPUS, let's go!

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.062
Charge up its attack points!

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.199
3000 attack points
are pretty high,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.036
but it's still less
than my MEMORYGANT's 5200.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.404
Go! Eternal Nightmare!

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.847
They took the life point lead!

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:41.582
Ghost Gal's brought her A-game!

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.117
It's not just her.
It's them.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.521
Since Shepherd and Ghost Gal
trust each other so much,

00:04:47.588 --> 00:04:51.224
their combined skill is greater
than the sum of their parts.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:54.894
Now MEMORYGANT's
special ability activates!

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.863
When it destroys
a monster in battle,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.067
its ability destroys a second
monster on your field.

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.903
So say bye-bye
to your PROPELION!

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:05.639
(grunts)

00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:08.175
And now I can go
and attack your CELTOPUS.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.309
(gasps)

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.645
Hold up, but you don't
have any monsters left

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.446
to attack with,
Ghost Gal.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.949
That's where
you're wrong.

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:16.650
Ah?

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:19.086
(Ghost Gal)
When MEMORYGANT's
special ability

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:20.287
destroys a monster,

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.856
it's allowed to attack
for a second time.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:24.324
Whaat?

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.327
That move should be illegal!

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:28.862
Take it up
with the judges later.

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:32.266
But for now, this duel is over.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.000
Nice playing with you.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.770
(grunts)

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.972
MEMORYGANT! Attack!

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.174
Eternal nightmare!

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:45.479
As long as I still have
a single life point

00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:47.314
I'm not giving up!

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:50.584
I activate APPLIANCER
BREAKERBUNCLE's ability

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.818
from my hand!

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.188
By sending this card
to the graveyard,

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.989
CELTOPUS can't be destroyed,

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:58.825
and I take no damage
from your attack!

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.330
(gasps)
It survived.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.000
Yup. And all I can
do now is end my turn.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.735
(laughs)

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.237
I'm still alive!

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.239
Roboppi is so cool!

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:13.841
Pew, pew, pew!

00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:16.376
Who's the coolest of them all?

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:18.713
Since you only have
200 life points

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.180
and 0 cards in your hand,

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.349
I do not believe this
level of celebration

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.050
matches your status
in this duel.

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:26.253
(sighs)

00:06:26.387 --> 00:06:27.387
You're right.

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:28.889
But ya see...

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.158
the next card I draw
could be the key

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:34.928
to turning this whole
duel around in my favor...

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:40.267
The next card I draw
could be the key

00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.671
to turning this whole
duel around in my favor...

00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:47.041
And that means
all I gotta do is believe!

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.174
Mmm hyah!

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:53.413
Oh yeah!

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.183
I activate the spell
APPLIANCER TEST!

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:01.455
As long as I can co-link them
with the monster

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.057
in my Extra Monster Zone,

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:04.224
I get to resummon

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.660
as many Link 1 APPLIANCERS
from my graveyard

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:07.761
as I want,

00:07:07.828 --> 00:07:09.797
but their attack points
drop to 0

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:12.132
and they're banished
at the end of the turn.

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:15.702
So come on back,
APPLIANCERS VACCULEPHANT

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.304
and PROPELION!

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:19.740
Then I'll I use PROPELION...

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.108
to Plug-In my circuit!

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:23.744
I Link Summon!

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.047
Link 1 APPLIANCER
LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.287
It summoned a new
Link Monster...

00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:36.090
I have a bad feeling
about this.

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:38.759
Then your feelings
are right on the money.

00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:41.227
Cuz my VACCULEPHANT's
ability

00:07:41.428 --> 00:07:42.429
activates!

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:43.463
When it's co-linked,

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.966
it destroys
one of your monsters.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:47.901
Later, MEMORYGANT!

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.611
Sorry, but no!

00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.480
I can protect MEMORYGANT

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:02.515
by banishing BATTLEDRONE GENERAL
from the graveyard!

00:08:03.818 --> 00:08:05.119
Well if that doesn't work,

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.787
I'll just attack
with my LAUNDRY DRAGON instead!

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:13.694
LAUNDRY DRAGON has fewer
attack points than MEMORYGANT.

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:14.628
C'mon now,

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:16.530
you know attack points
aren't everything.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.198
When LAUNDRY DRAGON
is co-linked,

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:20.401
we both don't take
any damage in this battle,

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:21.868
but your monster
will be banished

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.171
and mine stays
safe and sound!

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:25.839
You annoy me.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:28.141
(Roboppi)
Then I must be doing
something right!

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:29.676
No, you're not.

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:32.679
Because I can activate
ALTERGEIST KUNQUERY's ability

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:34.348
to summon her from my hand,

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.383
to negate
LAUNDRY DRAGON's attack

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.018
and special abilities!

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.190
(grunts)

00:08:43.324 --> 00:08:45.559
I'm gonna find a way to get
rid of that MEMORYGANT

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.328
whether you like it or not!

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:50.864
I activate
APPLIANCER... CONVERSION!

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.366
With this spell,

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.734
I can banish
all Link 1 APPLIANCERS

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:58.371
in my Main Monster Zone
and then summon them right back.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.676
Curious.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.778
You can sure say that again.

00:09:04.912 --> 00:09:06.680
Why would ya get rid
of all those monsters

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:08.015
if you're just gonna
bring them back

00:09:08.082 --> 00:09:09.183
the same as before?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.751
(The Shepherd)
Cuz it's not the same.

00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:15.522
Look carefully at its field.
Notice any differences?

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:17.558
Hey, you're right.

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.127
He summoned them
to different zones on his field

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.097
so that they're no longer
co-linked to CELTOPUS.

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:24.431
But why would he do that?

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:29.603
His APPLIANCERS all power up
when they're co-linked.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:30.704
Mm-hmm.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.707
That is totally, totally true.

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.242
But what you didn't know

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.445
is that my APPLIANCERS have
a different set of abilities

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.448
when they're not co-linked!

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:41.248
(gasping)

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:43.784
Check out my VACCULEPHANT.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:45.586
When it's not co-linked,

00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:47.521
it can swap out its attachments

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.923
and attack
your life points directly!

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.195
(grunts)

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:59.899
Next, LAUNDRY DRAGON
attacks your MEMORYGANT!

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:04.338
(Pandoll)
Ghost Gal, since we do not know
what that monster is capable of,

00:10:04.738 --> 00:10:08.074
I recommend using
your Skill just in case.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:11.778
Okay.
Sounds like the right move.

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:14.247
Get set, Roboppi,

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.083
I'm using my Skill, Secret Cure!

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.684
We both gain life points

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:20.187
equal to the attack points
of the monster I draw!

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.255
Okay!
Here I go!

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:27.428
I drew ALTERGEIST MARIONETTER.

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:31.598
So we both get
1600 life points.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.269
I gotta admit
that was a smart move.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:36.903
But I also gotta admit

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.740
that it's not gonna be
good enough to save ya!

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:42.242
LAUNDRY DRAGON's
special ability activates!

00:10:43.077 --> 00:10:44.377
When it's not co-linked,

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.446
I don't take any damage
during battle.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.115
But the monster
it fights against

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:50.050
will automatically be destroyed,

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:53.053
and you take damage equal
to its attack points.

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:56.389
No!

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:57.357
You don't have
enough life points

00:10:57.424 --> 00:10:58.592
to survive this!

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.193
Yup, that's correct!

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:02.529
She's all washed up!

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:06.967
(laughs)

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:09.803
Not only do I finally
get rid of MEMORYGANT,

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:12.305
I finally get rid of you too!

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:14.007
(gasps)

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:15.909
(The Shepherd)
Watch out!

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.281
Kenneth why...

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:25.352
I... just didn't think
it was right

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:27.254
for you to take the hit.

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.493
Oh Kenneth, thank you.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.695
I love you too.

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:38.665
Emma...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.001
Kenneth...

00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:53.781
Aww, that ending was
so beautiful and dramatic!

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:55.849
Well, off to my next duel!

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:02.156
No!

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.823
Emma and The Shepherd lost!

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.058
They're gone.

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:07.060
This can't be.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.263
I have even more bad news.

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:11.531
Ai defeated Faust
and Spectre too!

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.368
The only one left
in their squad is Gore.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.906
Guys, ditch those clones
and go help him out!

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:22.309
We'd love to.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.211
But can't.

00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:25.745
(Ai)
That's right.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.882
You're not allowed to leave
until you defeat us first.

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.518
And every second that ticks away

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.920
is one you won't be
getting back.

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.729
You might've taken out
those tenderloins, pork chop!

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:43.330
But I'm gonna stop you!

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.832
You're just the duelist&amp;

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.634
I hoped to run into.

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:49.870
Out of everyone...

00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:53.040
you're truly the one
I wanted to duel.

00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:56.410
Cuz that means I finally
can get revenge

00:12:56.543 --> 00:12:58.011
for what you
did to Earth.

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.747
If you didn't capture
and delete Earth,

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.749
he'd still be around today.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.819
(Pandoll)
I do not agree
with that conclusion.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.620
Hmm.

00:13:06.954 --> 00:13:08.555
According
to my analysis,

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:10.457
even if Gore did not
defeat Earth,

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:12.425
Bohman would have
absorbed him anyway.

00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:14.628
How do you know?

00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:17.264
Because I am Pandor...

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:20.634
an AI created
to defeat the Ignis.

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.303
Sounds to me like
somebody's core programming

00:13:23.437 --> 00:13:24.605
is glitching out.

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.774
And Gore, one AI chip
in your brain's not good enough?

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:29.743
You need another one
in your Duel Disk?

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:30.878
Hey!

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.279
I had the chip removed.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:33.547
Oh?

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.749
Implantin' that thing
in my brain

00:13:35.816 --> 00:13:39.486
was the dumbest thing...
I ever did.

00:13:40.788 --> 00:13:44.124
I sold everyone out
cuz I only cared about winnin',

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:46.092
and I couldn't even do that.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.963
And when I finally woke up,

00:13:49.497 --> 00:13:51.932
I was sure I had
nothing left in my life,

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:53.600
but I was wrong.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.437
I may have turned
my backs on them,

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.973
but they never turned
their backs on me.

00:13:59.106 --> 00:14:00.207
And that's when I realized

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:03.143
that all the time
I was chasin' after a win,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.679
I already had a bunch
of winners at home.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.349
So I'm no longer
dueling for myself

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:11.552
or stuff that ain't
worth nuthin'!

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:13.788
But what I am duelin' for
is to protect

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:15.455
those that I care about!

00:14:16.056 --> 00:14:19.793
And since you're aimin' to truck
all over them with your schemes,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.462
I'm the roadblock...

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:23.897
that's stopping you
in your tracks!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.302
Even if you say you've had
a change of heart, Gore,

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.871
you can't change the past.

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:33.140
And the past still says

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.976
that it's your fault
that Earth is gone.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:37.677
(Both)
Time to duel!

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.015
I'm goin' first!

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:45.051
I summon GOUKI SUPREX!

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.457
What?

00:14:50.524 --> 00:14:52.226
You're playing your old deck?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.661
Exactly, and you wanna know why?

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:58.031
Cuz those were the times when
the Gore was really the Gore!

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:01.034
Now then,
by summonin' SUPREX

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.738
I also get to summon
GOUKI RISCORPIO!

00:15:05.172 --> 00:15:08.508
And I'll use 'em
to mash up my circuit!

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:11.846
I Link Summon!

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.915
Link 2 GOUKI JET OGRE!

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.452
By sending GOUKI SUPREX

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:21.522
and GOUKI RISCORPIO
to the graveyard,

00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:25.725
their abilities let me draw
two GOUKI cards from my deck.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.897
Next up, I activate
GOUKI RE-MATCH!

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:35.268
It bounces both SUPREX
and RISCORPIO back to the ring!

00:15:39.673 --> 00:15:41.241
Then I'll Link Summon!

00:15:41.876 --> 00:15:45.345
Link 3 GOUKI THUNDER OGRE!

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.953
THUNDER OGRE's ability

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:56.056
lets me summon a monster
next to its link,

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:58.592
so I'm bringing out
another SUPREX!

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.831
And SUPREX's ability
lets me summon

00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:06.700
another GOUKI from my hand!

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.735
GOUKI TWISTCOBRA!

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:12.506
That lets me mash up
my circuit again!

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.575
I set GOUKI TWISTCOBRA

00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:18.011
and GOUKI THUNDER OGRE
in the Link Arrows!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.980
I Link Summon!

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:24.351
Link 4 GOUKI THE MASTER OGRE!

00:16:27.855 --> 00:16:31.992
Then my TWISTCOBRA's ability
activates from my graveyard.

00:16:32.093 --> 00:16:34.661
I get to draw
a GOUKI from my deck.

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.630
And that ends my turn, Ai.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.134
I gotta admit I'm impressed.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.502
The last time you
summoned MASTER OGRE...

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:45.405
it took you
until your third turn,

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:48.642
but this time you nailed it
on your first.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.477
Looks like you've
been training your mind

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:52.012
and not just your biceps!

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:55.782
I'll start by summoning
PIKARI @IGNISTER.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:01.354
When PIKARI is
successfully summoned,

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:04.491
I get to draw IGNISTER A.I.LAND
from my deck.

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.728
Slow your roll there!

00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:10.230
Cuz I'm putting
the brakes on that!

00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:13.066
When my MASTER OGRE
is linked to a GOUKI,

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:15.169
I can return
that GOUKI to my hand

00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:17.872
to negate your monster's
special abilities!

00:17:18.005 --> 00:17:21.374
So I call back SUPREX
to negate your PIKARI!

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:22.576
Ya like that?

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:24.044
(grunts)

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.380
(Pandoll)
It is clear
by his facial expression

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.649
that he did not like that.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.418
You're right.
However...

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.720
I'm sure gonna like this!

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.057
I Link Summon!
Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:43.063
And doing so triggers
HIYARI @IGNISTER's ability!

00:17:43.497 --> 00:17:44.865
When I have a Link Monster

00:17:44.932 --> 00:17:47.067
relaxing in the
Extra Monster Zone,

00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:48.402
I can summon HIYARI

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:51.004
in my Main Monster Zone
next to its link.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:57.578
And since I now have
an @IGNISTER

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:59.513
in my Main Monster Zone,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.450
DOSHIN @IGNISTER's
ability activates,

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.785
summoning itself from my hand!

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:05.552
Like this!

00:18:09.556 --> 00:18:14.261
That gives me the three monsters
I need to create my circuit!

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.732
Finally, it is time
to unleash a monster

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:21.134
forged from the darkest
depths of the shadows,

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.938
striking fear into all who
witness its majestic might!

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.440
I Link Summon!

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:30.076
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:18:37.717 --> 00:18:38.985
I Link Summon!

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.289
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:46.293
Link 3?

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:47.394
I gotta admit,

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.996
that monster ain't too low
on the shabby scale.

00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:54.034
I know.
I place one card facedown.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:57.972
It's time.

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:00.807
DARK TEMPLAR,
attack MASTER OGRE!

00:19:01.175 --> 00:19:02.142
Yeah?

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:03.544
Whatcha up to?

00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:06.013
Cuz your DARK TEMPLAR
has less attack points

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.514
than my MASTER OGRE.

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:09.450
Yes, you're right, Gore.

00:19:09.717 --> 00:19:12.786
That totally means
I'm up to something, but what?

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.355
I don't know what you're
plannin' to do,

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:17.358
so I'll plan for everything!

00:19:17.458 --> 00:19:20.327
Now, I activate
GOUKI IRON CLAW's

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:22.395
special ability from my hand!

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:25.032
By sending this card
to the graveyard,

00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:28.202
MASTER OGRE not only gains
500 attack points,

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.504
it's it can't be affected
by your cards this turn!

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.008
Go! Strike 'em down!

00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:36.310
As if!

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:38.812
I activate my spell card!

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:40.347
Go, TA.I. STRIKE!

00:19:41.182 --> 00:19:43.851
This spell makes
my @IGNISTER's attack points

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.553
become the same
as the monster it's battling!

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:49.323
What?

00:19:49.724 --> 00:19:51.692
And when our monsters
are destroyed,

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:53.027
we each take damage

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.196
equal to our own monster's
original attack points.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.731
That's gotta sting.

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:00.367
You're willin' to get
hurt to hurt me?

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:06.172
(grunts)

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:10.176
(laughs)

00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:14.548
What?

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:16.983
Why isn't your monster
destroyed?

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:18.452
Easy.

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:20.955
It can't be destroyed
by a monster

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.622
with the same attack points.

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:24.458
See?

00:20:24.524 --> 00:20:26.660
I don't need to hurt
myself to hurt you.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.228
I mean, why would I do that?

00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:30.998
That's just all sorts of crazy.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.500
But there's nothing crazy
about my next move.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:37.038
When DARK TEMPLAR destroys
your monster in battle,

00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:39.840
I can revive an @IGNISTER
from my graveyard

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:41.942
and summon it next to its link.

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:44.110
So welcome back, PIKARI!

00:20:46.213 --> 00:20:48.282
But it's looking
a little lonely.

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:51.985
So I'll invite another friend
back to this party.

00:20:52.052 --> 00:20:54.688
When a monster is summoned
next to DARK TEMPLAR's link,

00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:58.291
I can resummon Level 4
@IGNISTERS from my graveyard

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:00.060
by negating
their special abilities.

00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:03.430
So say "hey" to DOSHIN.

00:21:04.131 --> 00:21:08.235
PIKARI's ability lets me draw
IGNISTER A.I.LAND from my deck.

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.237
With that I end my turn.

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:12.906
Feeling salty 'cause
you're losing?

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:14.908
Like that single sweat
on your cheek?

00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.677
You keep yappin' that yap.

00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.847
Just becuz you're ahead o' me
doesn't mean you're winnin'!

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:23.584
(Ai)
Actually, that's exactly
what it means.

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:25.252
(Gore grunts)
Whatever!

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:28.255
Then I'm rewritin'
the dictionary!

00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:29.757
And you'll see
my face

00:21:29.857 --> 00:21:32.392
right next to the
definition of champion!

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.927
Aah!

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:45.438
