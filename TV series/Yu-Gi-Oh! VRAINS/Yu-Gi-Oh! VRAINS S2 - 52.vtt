00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.444

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.882
Well, talk all the trash you

I'm the one who'll be
takin' out the trash!

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.819
Ooh! Now see that was

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.187
excellent trash talking.

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:08.722

which monster you
attack with first!

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.864

My monster's still
stronger than his anyway.

00:08:23.437 --> 00:08:24.805
That is true,

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:25.972
but he's minimized

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.140
(computer chirping)
the damage he'll take.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.776
Due to his Field Spell
WORLD DINO WRESTLING

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:32.880
we can only attack with
one monster per turn.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.114
And if you don't attack,

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:35.949

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.885

That ain't happenin' on my watch

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.230
cuz when my DINOWRESTLER battles

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.399

more attack points,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:56.137
I can discard DINOWRESTLER

from my hand to stop it
from being destroyed!

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.441
So pounce your filthy paws

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.210
back to your side of the ring!

00:09:05.346 --> 00:09:07.548

But after the battle is over,

00:09:13.187 --> 00:09:15.722
well bub, MARTIAL
ANKYLO's ability

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:18.058
cuts your monster's

Well that is so not cool at all.

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:25.532
Especially cuz my HEATLEO's
ability also runs out,

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:26.700
so your KING's back to

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.602

His new DINOWRESTLER deck

pinned down, Flame.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:34.040
(Flame)
That's true.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.909
But looking from an
alternate point of view,

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.845
being behind gives
us an opportunity

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.413
to make a huge comeback

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.882
which is obviously
much more impressive.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.450
Yeah, I remember someone

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.052
who was pretty
good at doing that.

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:46.286
Heh!

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:48.455
But I learned that being
ahead is much, much better.

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:50.724
I know you actually
don't believe that.

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:53.294
Then you don't
know nothing at all.

00:09:53.294 --> 00:09:56.296

and JACK JAGUAR with 900.

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:04.271
Meanwhile, my KING
T WREXTLE's stronger

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.074
than dem both with
3,000 attack points.

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:09.910
If this was back during
the celebrity circuit,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.511
I'd take out his HEATLEO

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:13.947
cuz that's the stronger
monster of the two.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:17.117
That wouldn't get me the W,
but it'd be awesome.
