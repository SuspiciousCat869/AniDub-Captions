Hydradrive Booster
in attack mode!

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:23.924

it when neither of us

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.481
And This monster can attack
your life points directly

00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.450
if you have a Fire
Attribute monster

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:51.818
on your side of the field!

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.488
Hey, isn't this
the same strategy

00:05:54.488 --> 00:05:56.156
he used in our last duel?

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.625
Well.

00:05:57.658 --> 00:06:00.327
(Ai)
By matching his
monsters' Attributes with ours,

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:01.595
he put us in a pickle,

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.864
at least for a bit
'til we kicked his can.

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:06.767
So why's he running back
to a losing strategy?

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.536
Because it's not
exactly the same strategy.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.371
What?

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.304
Yeah it is.

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:13.006
There's one slight difference.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.042
Bohman chose to go first.

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:15.876
Huh?

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:17.545
Oh, I get it!

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:20.481
If he let us go first,
he could see what monster

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.682
we played and scope
out its Attribute.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.052
Then instead a' guessing,
he could summon a monster

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:29.389
on his turn whose Attribute
matches ours with 200% accuracy.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.891
(Playmaker)
Correct.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.394
So why did he choose to go
first instead of second?

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:34.595
(Ai)
Because we're all allowed

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.030
to make mistakes Mr. Perfect.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.233
Well, this was
only the first step.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.637
Next, I summon another
Hydradrive Booster.

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.708
And I'll use this one
to Link Summon again!

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.748
I set Hydradrive Booster
in the Link Arrow!

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.217

witnessed before.

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.295
Huh?

00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:09.963
What card's that?

00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:11.665
It's a new type of spell!

00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:14.401
A Link Spell, Judgement Arrows!

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.603
And I'm sure you'll
be surprised to know

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:17.871
that when the Link Monster

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.706
that's linked to
this card battles

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.441
its attack points double!

00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:24.745
Why is he explaining all this
as if it's brand new to me?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.114
Why's it called marmalade
instead of orange jam?

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.416
It doesn't matter!

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.117
But this ain't sweet!

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.286
It's worse than you think!

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.789
I generate my circuit
for the third time!

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:41.428
The summoning conditions are
two Hydradrive Link Monsters.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:45.232
So I set Burn Hydradrive
and Coolant Hydradrive

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:47.001
in the Link Arrows!

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.768

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.137
I Link Summon!

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:53.773
Link two Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:56.443
(Knight growls)

00:07:57.745 --> 00:08:00.113
It's a new Hydradrive.

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:02.849
Muscles really did
upgrade his deck.

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.818
(Bohman)
When Twin Hydradrive Knight

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:06.720
is successfully Link Summoned,

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:09.523
its Attribute can become
the same as the monsters

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:11.191
that were used to summon it!

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:15.528
So now both Water and
Fire are at its command!

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.367
Well this is quite new.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.870
Hydradrive Knight
has two attributes.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:25.973
Next, I place
two cards facedown!

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:31.645
And you should know these two
cards are the ones, Playmaker

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:34.681
that will seal your
fate in this duel!

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:39.019
You cannot defeat me
because I know everything

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.321
that you're planning to do.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.693
It's your turn, Playmaker

00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:48.028
Go on, do your worst!

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.364
(Ai)
I never got that
saying, "Do your worst."

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:51.865
I mean, if he's so
confident in his cards

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.135
wouldn't he want
you to do your best?

00:08:54.168 --> 00:08:55.936
But he's sure talkin'
the talk for someone

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:59.006
with just one Swordswinger
and two facedown cards.

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.307
What do you think they are?

00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:04.244
Of those two cards one
must be Property Spray.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.180
He used it in our
last duel to change

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:09.717
our monsters' attributes
and gain the advantage.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.251
(Ai)
Okay.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.753
But what's the other one?

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:14.588
That's where he
updated his strategy,

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.923
so I don't have any idea.

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.759
(Ai)
Well, that's
a confidence builder.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.861
I haven't felt this
safe since, well never!

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.698
You're lucky you have me
because here's what I do know:

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:28.068
It's gotta be a card that
works with his overall strategy

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.372
so I bet it's some kind
of Hydradrive card.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.540
(Playmaker) Since when
did you get so brilliant?

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.042
(Ai)
Since forevs!

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:35.876
Huh!

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.244
I draw!

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.746
First, I summon Flame Bufferlo!

00:09:41.448 --> 00:09:45.518
And I follow that up by
activating Catche Eve L2's
ability!

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.590
By lowering the Level of
one of my monsters by two,

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.792
I can summon it to the field!

00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:55.962
So I drop Flame Bufferlo's
Level from three to one!

00:09:58.466 --> 00:09:59.266
Ah!

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:05.005
By doing so I can
create my circuit

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:08.408
because the summoning condition
is one Level one monster!

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.744
I Link Summon!

00:10:10.778 --> 00:10:12.579
Link one Linkuriboh!

00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:14.581
Yeah!

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.183
Fear the sphere!

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.951
(Linkuriboh chirping)

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:20.721
And since Flame
Bufferlo left the field

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:23.924
its special ability lets me
discard a Cyberse monster

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.260
from my hand to draw two
new cards from my deck.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.364
Next I summon Cyberse White Hat!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.337
And with these two monsters,
I'll create my circuit again!

00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:42.609
I set Cyberse White
Hat and Catche Eve L2

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.012
in the Link Arrows
to Link Summon

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:47.347
Link two Update Jammer!

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.252
That monster is
a Wind monster.

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:55.356
(chuckles) I see you
avoided Fire and Water.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:58.125
Yes, because I prefer to
be more safe than sorry.

00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:00.861
Including this, when I
use Cyberse White Hat

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:03.197
to Link Summon all
monsters on your field

00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:04.999
lose a thousand attack points!

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:08.268
That means your Twin Hydradrive
Knight weakens to 800.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:10.837
It's time!

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:12.807
Update Jammer,
attack and destroy

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.675
his Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:16.577
All you've done is
trigger the effect

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.179
of my Judgement Arrows!

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:21.448
It doubles Twin Hydradrive
Knight's attack points!

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.986
Then I'll use Update
Jammer's ability!

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.655
It negates all
other card effects

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:31.491
including your Link
Spell Judgement Arrows

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.161
and our monsters must
battle using their original

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.495
attack and defense points!

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:40.967
Huh?

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.169
But his monster's attack
points would be lower

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:43.804
if you didn't do that.

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:44.804
Now Go!

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.306
Update Jammer!

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:58.419
When Update Jammer destroys
your monster in battle,

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:01.087
it activates the second
part of its ability!

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:04.090
You take an additional
1000 points of damage!

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:07.094
(Ai)
Oh I see!

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.230
Even though you raised
its attack points,

00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:12.566
you were able to deal
more damage overall!

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.234
And I'll deal even more damage

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.303
by attacking with Linkuriboh!

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:18.204
(Linkuriboh yells)

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.874
(Bohman grunts)

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.813
I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:31.518
So, I'm honestly
quite surprised you knew

00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:33.587
how to counter my
Judgement Arrows.

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:37.391
But, I will not let
you surprise me again.

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.759
It's my turn.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:39.759
I draw.

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:44.097
Despite your best
efforts, I still stand.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.334
And that is one thing you should
not have allowed to happen.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.370
My trap Property Spray
not only lets me tribute

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.540
a monster to gain life points
equal to its attack points,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.576
but it also changes your
monsters' Attribute to become

00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.380
the same as the one I tributed
until the end of the turn.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:02.149
He does have Property Spray!

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:03.250
You called it!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.985
You with your big brain!

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:07.288
And I'm prepared
to counter it.

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:11.592
I'm now activating my
trap card Arrow Break!

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.094
When I have a Link
Monster on my field,

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.631
Arrow Break negates and
destroys your trap card!

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.233
So Property Spray
is now no more!

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:25.873
(Harlin Voiceover)
Oh no, what's Bohman gonna do?

00:13:25.906 --> 00:13:27.808
I knew you'd do that.

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:29.443
You did?

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:30.477
No.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:31.879
No!

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:32.947
No?

00:13:32.947 --> 00:13:34.414
No!

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:38.118
Oh yes, so I had a counter
ready for your counter.

00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:41.888
I activate the trap
card Hydradrive Cycle!

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:45.226
Which I can only activate
when one of my other spell

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:47.627
or trap cards is destroyed.

00:13:48.729 --> 00:13:49.830
(Harlin Voiceover)
Whoa!

00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:51.098
While Playmaker's
thinking one move ahead,

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.966
Bohman's thinking two!

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:56.937
And this card will be the
beginning of your end Playmaker!

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:05.178
I've been ahead of you every
step of this duel, Playmaker.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.949
See while you were playing
checkers I was playing chess.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:12.052
(Ai)
Uh, hello, we're
playing Duel Monsters?

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:15.122
By returning a Hydradrive
Link Monster from my graveyard

00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:16.957
to my deck, Hydradrive Cycle

00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.360
lets me draw a card
for each of its links.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.129
So I return Twin Hydradrive
Knight to draw two cards.

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:26.567
I can also resurrect
another Hydradrive

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.503
from my graveyard by lowering
its attack points to zero.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:32.772
Now return to the
field Burn Hydradrive!

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.178
And Hydradrive Cycle
has another effect.

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:40.480
By paying 400 of my life points

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:43.016
I can choose one
of four Attributes.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:43.851
Fire.

00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:44.685
Water.

00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:46.153
Wind.

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:48.322
Or Earth and I get to
summon a Hydradrive Token

00:14:48.356 --> 00:14:49.690
with that Attribute.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:53.026
So I call forth an
Earth Hydradrive Token!

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.865
(Ai)
Aw glitch!

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:02.336
With just one card, he
reinforced his hand and his
field!

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:05.539
And he set up this combo
on his very first turn,

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:08.208
like he totally knew
what we were gonna do!

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.743
Are we that predictable?

00:15:09.777 --> 00:15:11.211
I hate being predictable!

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:13.247
It makes me feel cheeseburger!

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.016
Be that as it may
he had us figured out.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.219
That's the first thing
you've been right about

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.353
this entire duel, Playmaker.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.756
And it likely will be the last!

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:27.227
For it's time to
generate my circuit!

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.698
I set my Hydradrive Token in
the Link Arrow to Link Summon

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.502
Link one Flow Hydradrive!

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:39.206
But it won't stay long

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:42.076
I'm using it to
Link Summon again!

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.911
I set Burn Hydradrive
and Flow Hydradrive

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:46.279
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:53.853
Once again I Link Summon Link
two Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:15:55.722 --> 00:15:58.625
(Knight roars)

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:00.961
But this time, its
Attributes have changed

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.029
to Fire and Wind!

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:10.303
Plus your monsters that
have the same Attribute

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.640
as my Twin Hydradrive Knight
lose their special abilities.

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:15.442
Such as your Update Jammer

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:18.411
because its Attribute
is also Wind!

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:21.147
(wind whooshing)

00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:23.350
(Playmaker growling)

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:25.819
Its ability can no
longer help you.

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:28.622
But it's still best
to get rid of it!

00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:31.992
Twin Hydradrive Knight attack!

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:35.528
Slash Update Jammer and
erase it from the field!

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.666
Ah, with his Judgement Arrows,

00:16:38.666 --> 00:16:41.335
that slash'll have
twice the attack points!

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:43.637
No, Not if I can help it Ai!

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:45.305
By tributing Linkuriboh,

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:48.509
his Knight's attack
points drop to zero!

00:16:48.576 --> 00:16:50.477
(Linkuriboh squeaks)

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:51.978
Pointless.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.282
By sending Break Hydradrive
from my hand to the graveyard

00:16:55.315 --> 00:17:00.153
Linkuriboh's ability is negated
and you take 800 damage!

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:02.389
Oh no! (yells)

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:07.828
Yeah!

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.930
Bohman's ready for
anything and everything!

00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:11.198
Linky!

00:17:11.232 --> 00:17:12.933
I didn't even get a
chance to say goodbye!

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.537
Playmaker.

00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:19.206
Nothing you do can stop me!

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.375
My Link Spell Judgement Arrows

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:25.178
doubles Twin Hydradrive
Knight's attack points!

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.150
3600?

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:30.551
Ah!

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.551
My corneas!

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.886
Ooh, the throbbing.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.588
I overdid the shock.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:35.889
(Playmaker gasps)

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.991
Take this, Playmaker!

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:43.397
(Knight growls)

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.764
(Playmaker yells)

00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:48.135
(Playmaker grunts)

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:51.738
I place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.542
C'mon, get up!

00:17:54.542 --> 00:17:57.144
That pillar broke your fall!

00:17:57.177 --> 00:18:01.115
How did Bohman's dueling get
so much better so quickly?

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:03.584
Haven't you
figured it out yet,

00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:07.421
why it is that I'm able to
predict your every move?

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:10.624
It's because I am
you, Playmaker.

00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:13.460
And, in turn, you are me.

00:18:13.494 --> 00:18:14.761
You're me?

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:17.597
It's true.

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:20.167
And I do actually mean
it quite literally.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.101
No way!

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.105
It all started 10 years ago.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.475
A certain Lost Incident?

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.942
What?

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.645
Bohman was in the Lost Incident,
just like you, Playmaker?

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:34.114
No, not just like him!

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.482
(Ai)
Huh?

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:36.716
(Bohman)
Do not compare me to that phony!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.918
That imposter!

00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:39.486
You don't know what it was like!

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:41.288
You don't know what I had to do!

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:44.591
I had to suffer everything
to survive the Lost Incident!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.293
Yes, and so did I!

00:18:46.327 --> 00:18:47.827
No you didn't.

00:18:47.894 --> 00:18:51.598
You never had to suffer, not
even for a single moment.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.603
You think you were
taken as a child,

00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:57.971
locked in an isolated room.

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:01.475
A guinea pig for experiments
to create the Ignis.

00:19:01.508 --> 00:19:03.477
Of that you're certain.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.980
But here's what you don't
know, that child's feelings,

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:10.517
thoughts and experiences were
constantly being recorded

00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:14.821
and backed up in a myriad
of hi-tech servers.

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:16.957
And that backup had enough data

00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:19.960
to create a digital
version of this child.

00:19:19.994 --> 00:19:22.463
This copy was so much
like the original

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:25.131
he didn't even know
that he was a copy.

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:28.502
And inside the servers
he would've stayed,

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.771
until that day when
everything went wrong.

00:19:32.773 --> 00:19:33.707
(Electronic Voice)
You lose.

00:19:33.774 --> 00:19:35.475
(child groaning)

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:38.178
(Bohman)
Due to a glitch in
the system, the digital copy

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:41.882
of the boy and the actual
boy switched places.

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.358
Where am I?

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.192
Help me!

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.532
This can't be.

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:00.467
Yes, it can.

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:03.203
I was the real boy, Playmaker.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.172
And you're nothing
more than a backup

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.007
made alive by a freak accident.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.110
No, I don't believe you!

00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:10.678
Of course you don't.

00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:13.380
I wouldn't believe me
either if I was you.

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:16.016
But wait, I am.

00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:17.651
I was unjustly trapped

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.020
in those servers for
years, Playmaker.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.189
But now I'm free.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.492
And now I'll tell you what
I want when I win this duel,

00:20:25.525 --> 00:20:27.727
my body back!

00:20:27.794 --> 00:20:28.895
(Harlin chuckles)

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:31.698
VRAINS isn't big enough
for the two of us,

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.769
so only the original
one shall remain!

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.205
