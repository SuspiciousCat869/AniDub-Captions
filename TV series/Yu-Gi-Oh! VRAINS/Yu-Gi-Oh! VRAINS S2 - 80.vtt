WEBVTT

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.519
Psst, Playmaker,
pretend like you don't see 'em

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.455
but Varis and Spectre
are here spying on us.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.523
And you know
whenever they show up,

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.659
they bring ten sacks
of trouble with 'em.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:27.961
But the way things
currently are,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.496
this is one time
where I don't think

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.433
they can bring any more trouble
to this situation.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.235
Well, that's good news...
and bad news.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.637
Frankly...

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:39.172
I'm not surprised they're here
because a duel this critical

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.575
can change the course
of the entire war.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.977
Well, I don't care
who wins or loses.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:47.113
'Cause one of 'em hates me,
and the other one hates me more!

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.416
And I don't know
which one's which!

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:53.487
In fact, I hope they both lose
and they both go poof!

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.756
And no one'll weep
over that result.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.025
My, my, The Shepherd
sure is lucky

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.993
that you warned him
about the Link Spell.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.530
Or else, he'd already
have been defeated.

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.364
But not as lucky
as he hoped.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.833
Because The Shepherd
couldn't use that knowledge

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.002
to completely
turn the duel around.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.504
It's as if the Light Ignis

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.839
knew the Link Spell
would be destroyed.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.009
But any positive
is still a positive.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:18.979
Then let's see
if he can ride the momentum.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:22.415
Because the outcome of this duel
is far from certain.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.524
♪♪♪

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.817
It's my turn. I draw!

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.422
I'll start by summoning
DRONE PAWN in attack mode.

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.090
Next, I activate
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:39.626
special ability
to resurrect a DRONE

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.629
from my graveyard
and summon it next to its link.

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.832
So my SCUD DRONE soars again!

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:50.771
And that move triggers
SCUD DRONE's ability!

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.607
When a DRONE resummons
it from my graveyard,

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:56.776
I get to draw one card
from my deck!

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.580
And now I'll forge my circuit!

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.016
I set my SCUD DRONE
in the Link Arrow!

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.652
I Link Summon!

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.355
Link 1 BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT!

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.493
And due to my GENERAL's
additional ability,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.530
my DRONE PAWN can attack
your life points directly.

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.833
So feel the full force
of its barrage!

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:20.801
(fire blasts)

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:21.835
(grunts)

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:24.805
Jin!

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.273
(sighs)

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.009
My brother's getting blasted,
but I can't do a thing about it.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:31.444
I can't watch this happen!

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.016
I activate BATTLEDRONE GENERAL's
third ability!

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.652
When my DRONE PAWN
deals you direct damage,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.953
I can tribute that DRONE

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.356
to deal you additional damage
equal to its attack points.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.058
(grunts)

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.129
But that's not all.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.965
BATTLEDRONE SERGEANT's ability
also allows it

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.335
to attack your
life points directly.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:57.337
So take another
800 points of damage!

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:58.805
Battle Strike!

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:09.216
Wait, did I say just 800?

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.752
I meant I can tribute it
to deal another 800!

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.187
(grunts)

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.959
Each strike may not
deal much damage,

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.127
but they do add up quickly.

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:24.198
Not just quickly.
Irreparably!

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:28.702
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL,
attack its CENTURION!

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:36.877
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL,
attack its CENTURION!

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:39.780
Shepherd didn't
just turn the tables,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.215
he tossed it in the trash!

00:04:41.382 --> 00:04:43.550
It's true that
if this attack succeeds,

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:45.218
The Shepherd
will extend his lead

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.288
to make it
nearly insurmountable.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:49.256
But knowing Lightning like I do,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.560
he's always prepared
for every contingency.

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:55.395
And I can't imagine this time
will be any different.

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.899
You know me too well, Flame.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.770
When my CENTURION is attacked,
its special ability activates,

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:06.806
allowing me to negate
your attack once per turn.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:13.947
And with that, you now have
no monsters left to attack with.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.817
That may be,
but I'll make sure

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.620
you can't attack me
on your turn either.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:21.788
I activate DRONE UNITY!

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.957
If you attack one of my DRONES,

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:27.461
it gains the attack points
of all other DRONES on my field!

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.330
How interesting.

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:30.797
But I can't fail to notice

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:33.334
that you only have one
DRONE on your field,

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:34.968
so that card is useless.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.305
And I can't fail to notice
how wrong you are.

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:39.940
By ending my turn...

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:43.177
BATTLEDRONE WARRANT's
special ability activates.

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:46.680
When there are no monsters
in my Main Monster Zone,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.250
I'm allowed to resummon it
from my graveyard.

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:53.353
If you take DRONE UNITY's
effect into account,

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:57.024
his monsters have virtually
3600 attack points.

00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:00.527
Wowza! I don't know how
he's gonna get past that!

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.431
That's why you're you...
and I'm me.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.868
I activate my spell ARMATOS LEX.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:11.672
It returns one monster
in my graveyard to my hand,

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.840
but what I think
will interest you more

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:17.477
is that it also returns
one spell to my deck.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:18.679
What?

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.349
I return the Link Spell...
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:28.355
And I return ARMATOS
LEGIO GLADIUS to my hand.

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.357
Lightning now has
a chance to use

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:31.992
JUDGMENT ARROWS again.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.560
And you know
he's gonna snag it

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:35.662
like it's the last cookie
in the jar!

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:40.200
As I expected,
The Light Ignis made sure

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.403
it had a way
to bring back its Link Spell,

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:43.837
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.675
(Lightning)
I activate my Field Spell,
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM.

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.477
By discarding the monster
I just regained...

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:54.148
I can resummon SPECULATA
and SICA from my graveyard

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:56.917
next to my CENTURION's links.

00:06:57.017 --> 00:07:01.254
I now have the monsters
I need to illuminate my circuit.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.292
I set SPECULATA and CENTURION
in the Link Arrows.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:11.432
From the dawn of the universe
until its eventual end,

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:14.768
there is only one
constant: light!

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:18.539
And now I shall coalesce
this brilliance!

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:25.245
I Link Summon... Link 3
ARMATOS LEGIO LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.548
That must be the strongest
monster in Lightning's deck.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.451
What gave it away?
His big long speech?

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:33.420
It's time to battle.

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:36.756
CENTURION, attack
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:39.626
Huh.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.896
Your monster's too weak
to even scratch its paint job.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:46.333
That would be true if attack
points mattered in this battle.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.101
But they don't.

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.637
When my CENTURION
attacks your monster

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.372
while it's linked to SICA,

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.908
your monster is
automatically destroyed!

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.142
(grunts)

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.978
That's crazy!

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:00.081
When Lightning's monsters
are linked together,

00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:02.615
they give each other
extra special abilities!

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:06.319
Yes. So by changing which
monsters are linked together,

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.888
Lightning's Monsters
have a variety of abilities

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.157
that they can use.

00:08:10.291 --> 00:08:12.325
This isn't looking
good for Shepherd.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.330
LEGATUS LEGIONIS,
attack BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.066
(grunting)

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:22.602
(explosion)

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.476
Now my dear friend,
all your monsters are gone.

00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:33.680
And soon you will be too.

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.655
Shepherd, hello?

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.557
It's your turn, my friend.

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:46.826
I know. I draw!

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:50.163
I summon DRONE RECYCLER!

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.234
And I'm activating
its special ability!

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.504
By banishing a DRONE
Link Monster from my graveyard,

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:59.140
I can summon a monster

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.709
whose Level equals
the number of Link Arrows

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.710
my banished monster has.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:06.947
So I banish Link 2
BATTLEDRONE WARRANT

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:10.050
to summon Level 2 DRONE CARRIER.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:13.954
And DRONE CARRIER's
own ability activates,

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.192
allowing me to summon
another DRONE from my graveyard.

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:21.728
Take flight,
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:24.364
And return to this duel!

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:28.702
And similar to my DRONE CARRIER,

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.538
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL
can also bring a DRONE

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.574
back from my graveyard.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.209
Rise up, DRONE PAWN!

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:41.348
And I'm still not done
strengthening my aerial force!

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:45.385
I tune my Level 2 DRONE CARRIER

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.221
with my Level 4 DRONE RECYCLER!

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:52.759
A Synchro Summon?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.399
Yes, a Synchro Summon.

00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.301
Watch as I construct a helo

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:06.072
that rains a shower of fiery
destruction on to any target!

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.276
I Synchro Summon!

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:13.213
Level 6 COMMANDRONE
DOUBLE SNIPER!

00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:16.617
Time to battle!

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:17.952
My GENERAL's ability

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:21.188
allows my DRONE PAWN
to attack you directly!

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:25.526
If it's a battle you seek,
then I must prepare my defenses.

00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:29.263
I activate LEGATUS LEGIONIS'
special ability!

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.232
It lets me exchange
a Level 4 or lower

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.401
ARMATOS LEGIO on my field

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:37.071
with a different one
in my graveyard.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:40.074
So I replace
my ARMATOS LEGIO SICA

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:42.742
with ARMATOS LEGIO SCUTUM.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:47.881
And when my ARMATOS LEGIO
Link Monster

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:49.216
is linked to SCUTUM,

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:53.120
your monsters are only allowed
to attack that Link Monster.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.389
Or to clarify further,
your monsters can only attack

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.292
my CENTURION
from this moment forward.

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:05.365
But that doesn't apply
when my monster

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:07.634
is attacking you directly!

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.069
Go, DRONE PAWN!

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:12.839
Did you think I wouldn't
take that into account?

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:17.944
ARMATOS LEX's effect negates
all direct attacks against me.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:19.813
What?

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.150
Lightning has tightened up
his defenses even more.

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:25.452
How's The Shepherd
gonna break through that?

00:11:25.686 --> 00:11:26.653
He isn't.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:27.854
Yes...

00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:31.324
So if I was him, I'd try to find
a way around it instead.

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.994
You may have stopped
my attack, but you triggered

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.196
DOUBLE SNIPER's
special ability!

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.932
Every time you negate
my attack,

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:41.768
DOUBLE SNIPER
gains a Drone Counter.

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:44.171
And when it has
at least one Counter,

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:48.275
it's not only able to attack you
twice in a single turn,

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:51.278
but it can also attack
your life points directly

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:53.747
by lowering its attack
points to a thousand.

00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:57.784
So that's what I'm going to do!
Attack!

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.554
Hold on, why is
The Shepherd attacking

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:02.923
Lightning directly?

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:06.360
He knows that Lightning can use
ARMATOS LEX to stop that attack.

00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:08.862
'Cause that's exactly
what he wants him to do.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:10.831
(Lightning)
Pointless.

00:12:11.065 --> 00:12:12.499
I use my ARMATOS LEX

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:15.001
to shield myself
from your attack.

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:19.906
(explosion)

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.009
But by doing so,

00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:24.644
DOUBLE SNIPER
gets another Drone Counter.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:27.081
And with its second attack,

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:30.351
it'll launch its missiles
at your CENTURION!

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:32.519
Another pointless effort.

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:37.190
CENTURION's ability activates,
negating that attack as well.

00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:39.092
I was hoping
you'd do that.

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:40.594
And you did.

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:41.661
Huh?

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:44.598
When DOUBLE SNIPER
has two Drone Counters,

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:46.866
if you activate
a special ability,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.970
your monster is
automatically destroyed!

00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:52.139
And the resulting
explosion deals you

00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:54.007
a thousand points of damage!

00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:57.410
Wipe that CENTURION
out of existence!

00:12:58.812 --> 00:13:01.147
The Shepherd is using
Lightning's own abilities

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.415
to his advantage.

00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:04.484
Yeah, by stopping
The Shepherd's attacks,

00:13:04.585 --> 00:13:06.920
Lightning dug himself
a bigger hole.

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:08.789
(Ai)
And fell in head first.

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:11.058
Don't underestimate me!

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:13.127
I activate SCUTUM's ability!

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:15.262
When it's linked
to CENTURION,

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.798
it prevents it from being
destroyed in battle

00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:20.133
or by special abilities!

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:22.469
Well...

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.772
Even after all
those countermoves,

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:28.141
DOUBLE SNIPER still gets
to attack your CENTURION!

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:36.082
Your monster won't be destroyed,
but you still take damage!

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.420
Huh.

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.923
But I only lost
300 life points.

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:44.925
That's within
acceptable parameters.

00:13:45.226 --> 00:13:47.461
Is that what your logic
is telling you?

00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:50.063
Because according to my logic,
you're losing.

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:53.567
Becuase you're a human
and I'm not!

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.304
Then allow this human
to put you in a bigger deficit!

00:13:57.405 --> 00:14:00.507
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL,
attack CENTURION!

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.646
(explosion)

00:14:09.183 --> 00:14:11.685
The Light Ignis has
so few life points left

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:14.454
that the faintest touch
of a feather can knock it out.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.890
So it's quite unfortunate

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.626
that The Shepherd has
no monsters left this turn

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:19.860
to attack it with.

00:14:19.994 --> 00:14:21.629
Very unfortunate.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.498
Because it's never smart
to leave your opponent a chance,

00:14:24.565 --> 00:14:27.168
no matter how small it may be.

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.037
My turn isn't over yet,
Ignis.

00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:32.973
I activate my spell DRONE UNITY!

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.108
By tributing a DRONE
on my field,

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:37.344
I can draw a card
from my deck!

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.215
So I tribute my DRONE PAWN.

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:47.554
Perfect.

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:52.026
I activate the spell
DRONE FORCE FUSION!

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.995
It fuses the DRONES
on my field together

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:56.997
into a whole new monster!

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:59.233
And you're not allowed
to play any cards

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.234
to stop it from happening!

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:04.338
I fuse COMMANDRONE
DOUBLE SNIPER

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:07.741
and BATTLEDRONE GENERAL
together!

00:15:07.942 --> 00:15:10.377
If you're fusing
your best monsters together,

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:13.346
the result must be...
unimaginable.

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:17.885
You don't need to imagine it.
Because I'm showing it to you!

00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:21.054
I forge metal and steel together

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:24.891
to engineer the command post
of my aerial armada!

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:29.396
I Fusion Summon!
FORTRESSDRONE BEEHIVE!

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.705
(The Shepherd)
I Fusion Summon!
FORTRESSDRONE BEEHIVE!

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:44.077
Due to DRONE FORCE FUSION's
additional effect,

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.681
BEEHIVE can't be destroyed
by your effects

00:15:46.747 --> 00:15:48.115
or special abilities.

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:50.918
And it gains a Drone Counter
for every Level

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.888
that the monsters I used
to Fusion Summon it had.

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:55.522
I'll do the math for you...

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:58.525
that's a total of six
Drone Counters.

00:15:58.892 --> 00:16:02.595
Furthermore, BEEHIVE can
use one Drone Counter

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:05.432
to summon a DRONE TOKEN
to my field.

00:16:05.499 --> 00:16:07.968
But it's no fun to just use one,

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:12.439
I'll let it use five and fill up
every space on my field!

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:17.778
And for every DRONE

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:20.314
that's in play,
other than itself,

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:24.117
my BEEHIVE gains
1000 attack points.

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:29.656
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.694
5000 attack points!
This is quite
the solid defense.

00:16:33.794 --> 00:16:36.430
His TOKENS may appear
to be the hole in his armor

00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:38.098
because they have
no attack points,

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:40.167
but he can use his
spell DRONE UNITY

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.235
to raise them to 5000.

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:43.771
Color me impressed.

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:46.239
(sighs)
Let me be honest.

00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:47.841
I have nothing in my hand

00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:50.644
that prevents me
from losing this duel,

00:16:50.778 --> 00:16:53.680
but that's only because
I haven't drawn yet!

00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:56.449
(laughs)

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.452
My oh my oh my.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:03.557
I activate the Link Spell
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:04.858
(grunts)

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:07.761
Aww, glitch!
Not cool, bro!

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:11.565
I activate my trap SNATCH DRONE!

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.034
If you play another
copy of a card

00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:16.336
that it destroyed earlier
in the duel,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.539
then its effects are negated.

00:17:18.672 --> 00:17:20.674
In other words,
since it destroyed

00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:23.310
JUDGMENT ARROWS
on your first turn,

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:26.880
this copy of JUDGMENT ARROWS
is worthless!

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:30.350
Next, I activate the trap
CAPTURE DRONE

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:33.387
and use it on your
LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.022
It chains up your monster

00:17:35.088 --> 00:17:38.592
so that it can't attack
or use its special abilities!

00:17:38.692 --> 00:17:42.829
So now all it can do is
stand there and take up space!

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:46.933
The Shepherd stopped
Lightning's strongest monster

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.635
and his strongest spell!

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:52.206
Somebody better hire a DJ
for this block party.

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:55.509
(Lightning)
I activate my spell card
ARMATOS LEX.

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:58.678
By tributing my SCUTUM,
I get to draw a card.

00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:01.916
Interesting.

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:03.818
For someone in bad shape,

00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:05.419
Lightning doesn't seem worried.

00:18:05.485 --> 00:18:08.422
But I guess you can't
spell confidence without "con".

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:10.758
I summon the card I just drew:

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.927
ARMATOS LEGIO MAGICA ALCUM.

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:19.066
And since I summoned
it next to a Link Monster,

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:21.434
its special ability activates.

00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:24.271
And it's an ability that affects
both my Link Monster

00:18:24.405 --> 00:18:26.740
and my Link Spell.

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:30.577
First, my Link Monster
can't be destroyed by effects

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.279
or special abilities.

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:37.150
And second, I must send
my Link Spell to the graveyard.

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.052
What?

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.087
(gasping)

00:18:40.154 --> 00:18:42.489
(Ai)
He destroyed his own
JUDGMENT ARROWS?

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:43.824
(Lightning)
Yes, I did.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:48.295
Do you find this illogical?
I assure you that it's not.

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:49.796
Because in exchange,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.767
all faceup cards
in your Main Monster Zone

00:18:52.967 --> 00:18:56.236
and in your Spell &amp; Trap Zone
will be destroyed!

00:18:58.405 --> 00:18:59.739
This can't be!

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.142
Yes, it can.

00:19:02.276 --> 00:19:04.311
And usually,
when JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:05.379
leaves the field,

00:19:05.479 --> 00:19:08.348
all monsters next to its links
are destroyed.

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:11.485
But due to MAGICA ALCUM's
special ability,

00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:14.689
my LEGATUS LEGIONIS
remains on my field

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.990
while your cards will not.

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:24.698
(Blue Maiden)
Now that all
the DRONE TOKENS are gone,

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.401
BEEHIVE's
attack points drop to 0!

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:28.969
And The Shepherd
has no traps left

00:19:29.102 --> 00:19:30.704
to stop Lightning's attack!

00:19:30.805 --> 00:19:32.472
This duel is over!

00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:33.807
No.

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:38.813
Good bye, my friend.

00:19:39.313 --> 00:19:43.117
LEGATUS LEGIONIS,
attack FORTRESSDRONE BEEHIVE

00:19:43.184 --> 00:19:44.951
and end this duel!

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:54.828
(The Shepherd grunts)

00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:00.568
Lightning was in control
of this duel

00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:02.536
from beginning
to the very end.

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:04.671
Yeah! No joke!

00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:08.942
(Ghost Gal)
Shepherd!

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:12.513
I'm so pathetic.

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:16.450
I failed to defeat the Ignis,
I failed to end the war,

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:19.186
and most importantly
I failed you.

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.521
You failed me?

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:23.657
It's the older brother's
responsibility

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:26.726
to make sure
his younger sister is safe.

00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:30.330
So that's why you decided
to fight on your own?

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:31.999
To get me to stay out of this?

00:20:32.066 --> 00:20:34.768
Hey, don't look at me like that.

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.104
I never said
it was the best plan.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.705
I wish I had more time.

00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:41.942
Make that I wish I didn't
waste the time I had.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.344
Time I could've used
to get over the hurt.

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:46.814
Time I could've used
to get to know you.

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:49.816
But time's one thing
money can't buy,

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.219
no matter how many
bounties I hunt.

00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:53.653
Shepherd--

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.555
(The Shepherd)
Don't call me Shepherd.

00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:58.525
I'd rather you call me
your big bro.

00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:02.395
(Ai)
Big bro?

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:06.233
The Shepherd didn't make
any mistakes during this duel,

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:10.103
in fact, he played perfectly
but still lost.

00:21:10.404 --> 00:21:12.206
This Light Ignis is
the most powerful enemy

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.673
we've ever faced.

00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:17.345
This... was fun.

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:19.880
But I must get back to my work.

00:21:20.013 --> 00:21:22.015
So until we meet again,

00:21:22.082 --> 00:21:24.551
be safe, my friends.

00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:28.255
Till then, Lightning.

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:40.066
