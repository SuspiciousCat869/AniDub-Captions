00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:04.804
Hey!

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.940
Something sure
smells good over here.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.142
Best dogs in town.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.144
Then you know what?
Make it a double.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:11.979
And don't skimp
on the ketchup.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.147
You got it.

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.317
Hot dogs are like
the perfect sandwich, right?

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.652
Even the worst ones
are still pretty good.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.321
If you meant perfect food,
I feel ya.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.857
But it's not a sandwich.

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.092
Oh, come on now.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.161
Please, don't tell me
you're one of those people.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.363
Any filling between

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.832
a couple slices of bread
equals a sandwich.

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.534
But it's one piece
of bread with a slit.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.970
Don't you debate me
on this.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.239
The customer
is always right.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.175
Yeah, true...

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.909
Except when they're wrong.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.445
But, I hope you come back again
to continue our convo.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.646
Sure thing.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.149
If these sandwiches
are as good as you claim.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.652
It's really too bad.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:55.088
She'd be my type if she knew
what a sandwich was.

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.490
(yawning)

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:57.658
Tired?

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.928
Totally.
Didn't get my winks.

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.430
I was up late
scouring the net.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.732
Folks are constantly
uploading pics

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.035
and video footage
of Playmaker so...

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.004
I have to manually stamp out
what my bots don't catch.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.673
That sounds like a chore.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.708
But, you don't have to
do it alone.

♪♪♪

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.740
You left Ai at home?

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.308
He'd provide more
of a distraction

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:23.076
than be of help
to us.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.245
And, I needed
some alone time.

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.882
So you could think about what
Varis said to you?

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.450
About Ai and the Ignis?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.117
Yeah.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.654
Have you no idea
what you possess?

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.590
Allow me
to educate you.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.493
The Ignis may
be an Ai...

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.128
But it's unlike
any type

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:42.896
you've ever
come across before.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.765
While AI
are supposed to do

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.967
what we program them
to do...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.303
The Ignis do whatever
they want to do,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.105
because the Ignis,
they have free will.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.608
And what the Ignis want
to do is bring an end

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.943
to the entire
human race.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.714
My analysis doesn't confirm
Varis's claims.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.217
But it doesn't
deny 'em, either.

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:06.187
So I have no clue
if Ai has free will or not.

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:07.688
What if he does?

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.491
What if a program
can make his own choices?

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:11.692
And how could free will

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:13.627
possibly be
a threat to mankind

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.396
and lead the world
to destruction?

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:16.797
Don't ask me, buddy.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.365
I just run
a hot dog stand.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.634
Well, that's true.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.338
So Ai's home alone, heh?
Poor fella's probably

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.541
bored out of his mind,
sitting around doing nothing.

Swole-mates?
Yes!

you have to help me

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.135
finish our special project.
And when it's done,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:58.138
I'll enhance your processing
power like I promised.

but are you sure
about this?

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.757
No, but this is
where we were told to meet.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:19.026
But nothing ever good
happens in an alley!

It's Playmaker versus
one of the Knights of Hanoi!

Not just any Hanoi,
but their leader Varis.

this duel before.

Oh, that was
super primo video!

where that came from...

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.569
upon final payment.

Here's the rest
of the data.

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.279
Oh, and I included
a special interview

00:05:12.313 --> 00:05:14.581
where I answered
your burning questions.

The only one of its kind
in the world!

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.103
I negotiated with the higher-ups
to advance our paychecks

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.338
so that I could build this
state-of-the-art editing room

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.140
right inside LINK VRAINS.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.609
That's great!
This place is amazing!

Wait, did you say
"our" paychecks?

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.512
Yup.

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:46.813

we can create our special
exclusive on Playmaker!

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:51.919
So Ghost Gal's fee,
huh?

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:54.088
I'm guessing
that was expensive too?

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:55.823
Oh, yeah, I didn't have
enough in the budget,

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:57.658
so I cashed in
all my stock.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.326
Yours too.
And your savings.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.361
And I took out a second
mortgage on your house.

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:02.863
W-What?
I'm broke?!?

00:06:02.897 --> 00:06:04.565
But when we sell

And what a special
it's gonna be!

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.393
I mean, there were
whispers of duellists

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:34.261
seeing Playmaker before,
but we didn't get

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.730
a true look until
that Knight of Hanoi

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.898
attacked LINK VRAINS.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.165

Run for it!

You dare interfere,

My name is Playmaker!

00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:57.251
Playmaker, you got this!
Hack up that hacker!

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.887
Hey, I've been looking through
your deck and woof!

00:06:59.987 --> 00:07:02.656
You won't beat his dragon
with these cards.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.424
Oh, is that so?

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.661
Then you had better hope that
your analysis is incorrect.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.130
Or else you'll be
going home with him.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:13.167
Glitch! That'd be worse
than hanging out with you.

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:16.469
Okay then,
I'll even up the odds.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.944

data material!

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:40.060

Now arise!

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.311
How do you like that,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.021
How could you be so dumb
to switch to the wave

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:10.191
directly in front

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.362
Ahh!

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:19.366
There are special monsters that
only live inside the Data Storm.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.502
What do you mean,
special monsters?

00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:23.204
(AI)
Monsters that you and only you

00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:26.373
can summon
with your unique Skill.

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:30.143
And the more intense the Storm,
the stronger the monster!

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.479
Which you'll need if you wanna
beat that hoodlum.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:38.118
Your Skill lets you draw one
random card in the Data Storm

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:40.487
when you have a thousand
or fewer life points.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.192
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:51.798

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.609
Link 3, Decode Talker!

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:16.290
Decode Talker, attack!

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.625
Decode Destruction!

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:28.568
Aah!

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.576
A thug like you has no place
in LINK VRAINS.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.950
(Frog)
I'm pulling up Ghost Gal's
interview files, let's see.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.586
I mailed her a bunch
of pre-recorded
questions in advance.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.790
<i>Do you know Playmaker's
true identity?</i>

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.125
Who's Playmaker in real life?

00:09:52.226 --> 00:09:56.062
Sorry, hon, that's one answer
even I haven't figured out.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.932
But that doesn't mean
I don't have a lead.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.801
I've recently learned that
something happened to him

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.370
ten years ago that
set him on this path.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.272
And if I can just
follow that trail back,

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.241
it might lead to his identity.

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:10.544
<i>Why are both the Hanoi and
SOL Tech after Playmaker?</i>

00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.613
Because he has
an AI that they both want.

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:16.450
A very special AI that can
affect the fate of LINK VRAINS.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.252
I have what you're
looking for right here.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.355
So if you don't
call off your attack,

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:22.689
you will regret it.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:25.759
Because I'll delete
this AI right now.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.094
W-w-what?!

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.396
I've decided I don't
like you very much.

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:32.800
(Ghost Gal)
While the Knights of Hanoi
tried to take it by force,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.069
SOL Technologies
took a quieter route,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.773
hiring Gore to duel
Playmaker for it.

00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:42.342
(laughing)

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.578
Your hate for
the Hanoi's legendary.

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:46.913
So I knew you couldn't
resist the temptation.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:51.118
You're not dealing
with the Hanoi.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:54.421
You're dealing with someone
much more dangerous.

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.123
The Gore's gonna
pound ya to a pulp

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:58.425
in front of the whole world.

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.594
I Link Summon!

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:03.630
Link 3, Gouki
The Great Ogre!

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.300
Attack The Great Ogre!

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.472
Ogre! Smash 'em!

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:36.430
(Ghost Gal)
When Gore failed, Blue Angel
wasn't far behind.

00:11:36.497 --> 00:11:38.131
Now I Link Summon!

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:41.935
Link 2 Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:44.638
(Ghost Gal)
But she wasn't
her usual peppy self.

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.441
In fact, she was downright evil.

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:49.442
Go!

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:55.415
The Hanoi infected Blue Angel
with a virus,

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:57.951
making her rage out of control.

00:11:57.984 --> 00:11:59.853
Angel!

00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:02.489
Annihilate Defect Compiler!

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.591
And Playmaker!

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.427
Go!

00:12:06.527 --> 00:12:08.929
(Ghost Gal)
Playmaker was able
to stop Blue Angel,

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:11.498
but unfortunately,
a bit too late.

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.900
And she fell into a deep sleep.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:23.077
Blue Angel's brother, Zaizen,
mistakenly blamed Playmaker

00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:25.212
for her illness
and captured him.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.414
What is this?
I can't move.

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:33.553
(Ghost Gal)
I admit with a bit of my help.

00:12:33.587 --> 00:12:37.424
All this suffering can end now,
or I can make it much worse!

00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:39.659
Aah!

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:42.863
Playmaker couldn't convince
Zaizen that he was innocent.

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:45.166
But in the end,
he didn't need to.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:47.801
Because an even bigger
problem showed up.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:51.371
Varis, the leader
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:12:58.813 --> 00:13:00.214
(Playmaker)
Varis!

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:05.252
I can destroy LINK VRAINS and
everything in it, including you.

00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:08.221
But I only came here
for one reason.

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:11.124
To acquire
Playmaker's Ignis from him.

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:14.094
And you think I'll just
stand by and do nothing?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.796
That's exactly right.

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:17.798
If you want to
save Blue Angel.

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:21.268
After all, it was
our card that infected
her with a virus.

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.270
It was?

00:13:23.304 --> 00:13:26.440
But I am in possession of an
antivirus that can revive her.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.476
If it's not too late, that is.

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:32.112
Playmaker...

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:34.815
I-- I don't know
what to say.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:37.451
You're going to duel
him to save my sister.

00:13:37.485 --> 00:13:40.054
Even after everything
that I put you through.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.224
Refusing to believe
anything that you said.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.059
But you will still
fight to help me

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.294
when you really
should despise me.

00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:50.463
I forgive you.

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:57.638
But I will never forgive

00:13:57.738 --> 00:14:00.274
the Knights of Hanoi.

00:14:00.374 --> 00:14:04.545
Playmaker, this is where
you will crash and burn.

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:07.347
As you already know, I can wield
the incredible power

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.649
of the Data Storm
in the palm of my hand.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:17.023
These winds rage for me
and me alone.

00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:29.169
I activate my Skill.

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:33.874
That's the monster
that I'm looking for!

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:35.942
Storm Access!

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.517
You're mine now.
I Link Summon!

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.520
Behold the power of Link 4
Topologic Bomber Dragon

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.025
Get your act together,
Playmaker!

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.562
If I had sweat glands, I'd be
swamped waist deep in AI juice!

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:58.565
Face the facts,
you're backed into a corner.

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.334
But you still got a way out.

00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:02.737
By using my Skill.

00:15:02.837 --> 00:15:03.837
Exactly!

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:05.839
You may have retrieved
a Link Monster

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:08.242
but it's useless
if you can't summon it.

00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:11.344
I activate
the trap Remote Rebirth.

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:26.393
A Speed Duel isn't enough
to settle our differences.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.262
We need more, much more!

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:30.430
(laughing)

00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:36.069
Aah!

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:40.040
Did you see that?

00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:41.842
The storm sucked them
right off their boards!

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:43.544
Was Playmaker
pulverized to pieces?

00:15:43.577 --> 00:15:45.579
Hey! Say it
don't spray it!

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:48.015
Naturally I was curious
to see what was brewing

00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.749
inside the eye of the storm.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.552
So I made my way in
with a little help that

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:53.854
you don't need to know about.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.589
That'd be an extra fee.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:58.025
But this is where your
investment pays off,

00:15:58.092 --> 00:16:01.928
my froggy friend, since the
world hasn't seen this footage.

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:06.133
Unlike you, the Knights of Hanoi
are on the right side of history

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:09.103
because we are the ones
who will save the world.

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.739
You would be aiding us
instead of trying to fight us

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.141
if you weren't so daft.

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:15.242
Nice try.

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.978
But I don't buy
a single word you said.

00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:22.183
Hmm, then you are an even
bigger fool than I thought.

00:16:22.283 --> 00:16:24.284
But so be it.

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:28.255
You see, my mission is not
to convince you, Playmaker.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:30.491
It's to save humanity.

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:33.827
And since you dare
to stand in my way,

00:16:33.927 --> 00:16:35.963
you must be dismissed.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:38.766
I Link Summon! Rise up!

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:42.168
Link 4 Borreload Dragon!

00:16:53.147 --> 00:16:55.316
I know that dragon.

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.150
It must
be his strongest monster!

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:03.591
Though you technically still
have your Cyberse monsters,

00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.026
they're not around
to help you.

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:08.562
So you can't stop
Borreload Dragon

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:10.564
from attacking you directly.

00:17:12.933 --> 00:17:15.202
Now fire!
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:24.978
Aah!

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:28.349
That's gotta hurt.

00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:31.318
With that, I end my turn.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.353
I draw!

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:36.056
But it'll be my last draw

00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:38.325
if I don't immediately
make a comeback.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.027
But what can I do
without my monsters?

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.199
What's this?

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:53.140
Ah, I sense the presence of a
new Cyberse monster in my deck.

00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:54.975
So if my gut is true,

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:59.145
that means Varis failed
to truly erase the Cyberse.

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:03.083
I'm now activating the Field
Spell, Cynet Universe!

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:07.721
Now all of the Link Monsters on
my field gain 300 attack points.

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:09.923
How does that change anything?

00:18:09.956 --> 00:18:12.659
Your field
is completely empty.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.632
Wrong... very wrong.

00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:21.101
My Cyberses are still here.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:23.871
And they're here to help me!

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:25.572
I'll prove it!

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:28.376
I Link Summon!

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:31.311
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.956
After bringing out
Firewall Dragon,

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.059
Playmaker turned the tide.

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:47.961
But that didn't mean Varis
was going to back down.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.300
(Varis)
You're like a pebble in my shoe,
annoying and uncomfortable, yes.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.536
But ultimately
small and worthless.

00:18:55.603 --> 00:18:58.772
Not giving a second thought
once it's tossed away.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.842
And when you lose,
you'll be lost to history.

00:19:01.876 --> 00:19:03.944
You're wrong.
I must win.

00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:05.679
And there happen to be exactly

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:09.316
three reasons why I will.

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:11.852
For one, I must
avenge the horrors

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:15.289
that the Knights of Hanoi
put me through a decade ago.

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.857
Two: Defeating you is a step

00:19:17.891 --> 00:19:20.861
towards uncovering the truth
about that incident.

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:25.499
And three: I must rescue
the one who rescued me.

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:29.169
Did you say three?
No way.

00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:30.871
Can it be you?

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.973
After all
of these years?

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:34.841
Ten years to be exact.

00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:37.777
But I'm back
to get justice!

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.516
Tempest Terahertz!

00:19:47.388 --> 00:19:49.155
Time for you to go kapow!

00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:59.133
Playmaker actually
pulled it off.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.635
I'm a man of my word.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:05.139
So here.

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:09.142
It's Blue Angel's antivirus,
as promised.

00:20:09.175 --> 00:20:13.213
You may have been victorious
today Playmaker, but...

00:20:13.314 --> 00:20:16.149
As long as you carry
that AI with you,

00:20:16.183 --> 00:20:18.619
we won't stop stalking you down!

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.055
This I swear!

00:20:21.155 --> 00:20:23.123
(Ghost Gal)
Playmaker may have won the duel,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.891
but if Varis was discouraged,

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:27.527
well, he didn't
show any signs of it.

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.362
In fact,
he seemed more determined

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.698
to carry out his master plan.

00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:33.534
But that begs the question:

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:36.136
What is the Hanoi's master plan?

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.706
And who or what are the Ignis?

00:20:38.806 --> 00:20:42.008
And what happened
to Playmaker a decade ago?

00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:43.677
Well, I have to save some things

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.646
for the second special, right?
Later, loves.

00:20:49.116 --> 00:20:50.850
All right, as soon
as we tweak the title,

00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:53.187
the Playmaker special
is in the can!

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.556
Huh! The title is fine,
thank you very much!

00:20:56.656 --> 00:20:59.693
And my bank account'll bounce
from zero to nine digits!

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:02.763
I think that's
the last of it, Kolter.

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:05.099
Oh, wait I missed
one file.
(snoring)

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:07.200
I'm deleting it now.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:10.571
Hooray!
(laughing)

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:11.605
What a day.

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:14.274
Huh?! Boss, someone's
hacking our system!

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:16.410
Huh? No! No!

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:18.546
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:20.080
No!

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.083
Our whole special's
being deleted!

00:21:22.183 --> 00:21:23.750
Like my
entire savings!

00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:26.787
Stop-stop-stop-stop-stop...
No, no, stop, stop, no, stop!

00:21:26.887 --> 00:21:28.021
(Pigeon)
Yup.

00:21:28.088 --> 00:21:31.291
We counted our chickens
before they hatched.

00:21:31.392 --> 00:21:33.894
But I'm a pigeon.

00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:39.733
