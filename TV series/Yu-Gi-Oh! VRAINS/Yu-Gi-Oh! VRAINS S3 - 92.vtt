Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.273
(Announcer)
<i>Attention.</i>

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.342
<i>LINK VRAINS is currently
experiencing</i>

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:09.610
<i>technical difficulties.</i>

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.780
This location houses
SOL Technologies emergency

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.980
central control switch

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.116
which can use
to restart LINK VRAINS

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.451
and log everyone out.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.686
And purge Bohman
out of our system.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.291
Impossible, I'm locked
out of my own system.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.293
Or you mean Bohman
locked you out.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:28.595
(both gasp)

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.299
Win this duel, Skye!

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.768
Or all of LINK VRAINS
will be gone!

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.738
(Blue Maiden)
Don't let anyone say
that Blue Maiden and Aqua

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.606
didn't go down
without a fight!

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.678
(screams)

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:46.646
No! Skye!

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.118
You did not give me
the opportunity to share

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.520
the final moments
with my brother Harlin,

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:56.456
but I shall extend you
that courtesy.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:00:58.658
Skye?

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.761
Skye!

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.230
Akira... I'm here.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.197
Skye...

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.765
(Bohman)
Blue Maiden...

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.266
Aqua...

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.136
join with me!

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.317
Bohman sucked up
all their data like a sponge!

00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:31.652
Does this mean...

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:34.454
we're the only ones
left that can stop Bohman?

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:35.889
Could be.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.926
Hope not.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.561
You and me both.

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.832
Whoa!

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.600
Looks like we're gettin'
teleported!

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.101
Hold on tight!

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.236
That's your job!

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.445
(Ai)
Aqua... and Blue Maiden...
are gone...

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.481
And all I could do
was watch ‘em vanish...

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.951
How many more do we gotta lose
before this war's over?

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:05.619
How much longer
till this is fixed?

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.787
Wonder what's broke?

00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:06.821
Can't they just try
turning it on and off?

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:10.323
Unreal, I still can't
log out!

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.659
C'mon SOL Tech,
fix your tech!

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.294
It's literally
in your name!

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.330
(Zaizen)
Hayami!

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.998
It's Skye, she's gone!

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.301
We must do whatever it takes
to get her back!

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.135
<i>Get her back how, sir?</i>

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:22.969
(grunts)

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.205
Just figure it out and do it!

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.441
(Ghost Gal)
Zaizen, I hate to be
the bad guy, but Skye's gone.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.878
And there's a whole bunch
of otherpeople

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.613
who could use
your help right now.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:35.315
There are thousands
of duelists who can't log out

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.483
of LINK VRAINS,

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.152
and the longer
they're trapped in here,

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:39.653
the more time
you're giving Bohman

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.054
to do something bad to ‘em.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.124
And isn't that what your sister
sacrificed her own life

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:45.492
to stop from happening?

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.795
Yes, you're right, Emma.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.497
Skye would want me
to save them instead of her.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.499
Hayami,

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.768
our sole priority is
to evacuate LINK VRAINS.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.505
Any help or resources
you may need, they're all yours.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.773
Understood?

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.074
(Hayami)
<i>Loud and clear!</i>

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:07.915
(Lightning)
Well done, my friend.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.717
Where Windy failed
to be victorious,

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:11.885
you succeeded.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.187
However,

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.889
since only you
and I are left,

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:20.026
we remain outnumbered
by a significant margin.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.229
But I believe I can tip
the scales in our favor

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.566
by executing a plan
targeted...

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:27.234
at Playmaker.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.235
Oh?

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.071
(Lightning)
You see, my friend...

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:34.208
Though Playmaker's dueling
may have very few weaknesses,

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:38.111
I cannot say the same for him
outside of the game.

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.916
(Ai)
Bohman better not show
his mug around here

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.552
'cause if he does,
I'm gonna shred him to shreds

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.787
like a head of lettuce!

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.021
Or a guitar!

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:56.764
(gasp)

00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:58.098
You got an umbrella?

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:04.472
You!

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.306
Bohman! Just who I was
waitin' to see!

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:07.908
'Cause I've been itchin'
to shred ya like

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.009
the head of a guitar...

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.978
and I messed that up,
but let's duel!

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:11.812
(Bohman)
No.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.114
That won't be happening

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:15.448
because I didn't come here
to duel you.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.918
I came here, Playmaker,

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.953
to say farewell.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:20.921
What?

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.658
Lightning has chosen
a different opponent for you.

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.463
An opponent that you
will not capable of defeating.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.967
Right, we've heard
that broken record before.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:33.834
(Bohman)
Perhaps.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.636
But this time is different.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.739
Lightning studied what
makes you humans function...

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:40.774
and what makes you break.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:44.577
And he found the one weakness
that exists in all humans

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:46.513
and that includes you,
Playmaker.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.782
During the most crucial
decisions,

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:50.851
you humans are driven
by emotions

00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.686
when you should
be driven by logic.

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:56.423
And these feelings cause you
to make the wrong decision.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:58.925
Well, I beg to differ
with your conclusion.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:02.196
You can beg all you like.
It changes nothing.

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.499
Your next opponent
will exploit your weakness,

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:08.902
so that is why I can conclude
that you will lose.

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:10.303
Make no mistake,

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:13.507
I do understand that you may
find this hard to believe,

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.709
but I do wish
this wasn't the case.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.712
I do want you to win,
Playmaker,

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.213
even if you cannot.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:22.416
Because it is I who wants to be
the one to defeat you.

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.084
But as you humans say,

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.020
I can't always get
what I want.

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.590
You were a formidable
opponent, Playmaker.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:33.326
One worthy of much respect.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.830
So even though you
will no longer exist,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.231
I'll keep you alive...

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.701
in my memories forever.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.069
What about me?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.005
You're not gonna keep me alive
in your memories forever

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:46.173
after we lose?

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:47.708
Not saying we're gonna
lose but

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.243
now that possibility
is stuck in my head!

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:53.713
So... who do you think
we're gonna face?

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.987
Aww man, they still
can't log out.

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:03.123
(Man)
<i>Cal... can you hear me?</i>

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.325
<i>I'm scared...</i>

00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.561
Jin!

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:12.633
(Ai)
You know, Playmaker...

00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:15.135
For all that bluster
that Bohman was blabbing,

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:18.238
our super baddy's sure takin'
their sweet time showin' up.

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:21.141
I wish they'd come here already
so we can take ‘em down...

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.147
I said come here,
not go there!

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:31.384
(gasps)

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:33.821
(Ai)
Where are we?

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.890
If I didn't know any better,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.759
I'd say we're back
in the Den City courtyard.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.994
Except there's
somethin' missing...

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:43.597
(Playmaker)
Kolter!

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.033
I was gonna say “squirrels ”"
but close enough.

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:49.603
What took you so long?

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.239
C'mon, Playmaker,

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:53.974
you gotta remember
that this is where

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.609
you and me first met up.

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:57.945
And where we met up
with you too, Ai.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.915
You could say that this
is where everything started,

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:05.619
so this is the perfect place
for everything to end.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.654
Uh... You okay, Kolter?

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.356
'Cause you're kinda
freakin' me out.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.859
You're talkin' like the main
character in a tragedy

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.360
two pages from the end.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.662
We're supposed to fight
our toughest opponent here,

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:18.398
so you better skedaddle
before they show up!

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:20.500
Actually, our opponent's
already here.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:21.701
(Ai)
Huh?

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:22.802
Where?

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.205
Right in front of ya.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.475
(Ai chuckles) No...

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.943
No!

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:31.478
No?

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:33.146
Oh, no...

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.482
Yeah, pal.

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:37.717
Lightning made me an offer
I couldn't refuse,

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.853
and I took it.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.156
(Jin)
<i>Cal... can you hear me?</i>

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.126
<i>I'm scared...</i>

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:45.993
Jin!

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.462
(Lightning)
<i>If you desire
to save your brother,</i>

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:50.964
<i>go to the coordinates
I just sent you.</i>

00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.302
I'm on my way, Jin!

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.742
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.417
(Lightning)
<i>Welcome, Kolter.</i>

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.588
We finally meet face-to-face.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:15.856
You.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.759
Now now,
calm your hostilities.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.628
I've invited you here
as a friend, my friend.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:23.531
I can assure you
that you will like

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:24.965
what I have to say.

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:28.235
I'm not listenin' to a word
‘til you let my brother go!

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:31.605
Ahh, then we're on
the same page

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:34.175
because I've decided
to free Jin

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.110
and return him to you.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.943
Hmm.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:38.579
Wouldn't you like that?

00:09:38.713 --> 00:09:41.015
And what's the catch then,
Lightning?

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.517
“Catch ” is such a
negative word.

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.587
I prefer to call it
a mutual understanding.

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.622
You can call it
whatever you want,

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.724
but what exactly do you want?

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:54.228
Well Kolter, I want
you to make a choice,

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:56.930
a choice about
what will make you happy.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:01.835
That sphere contains
your brother's data

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:04.437
every memory, every emotion.

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.206
Or as you humans call it,

00:10:06.574 --> 00:10:07.708
his soul.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:08.776
His soul?

00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:10.878
(Lightning)
Yes, my friend.

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:14.581
It's everything you need
to restore your brother

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.049
to his old self.

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.552
This data is yours to keep,

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.288
as long as you
do one thing for me.

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:22.756
And what's that?

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:24.758
A minor task.

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.362
I want you to duel
and defeat Playmaker.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:29.796
Playmaker!?

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.465
(Lightning)
Yes, Playmaker.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:34.301
If you do not,
I will have no choice

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.870
but to erase Jin's data
permanently.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:40.841
So I ask you again,
what will make you happy?

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:42.910
To be reunited
with your brother

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.711
after so many years,

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:47.548
to free him from the horrors
of the Lost Incident

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:49.717
and bringing his dark chapter
to an end?

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.553
Or lose your brother so that
you can continue to support

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:55.789
Playmaker in this
fruitless war,

00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:59.193
a war that deep in your heart,
you know you cannot win?

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:02.963
If I win, you really promise
to let my brother go?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.265
You have my word.

00:11:06.634 --> 00:11:07.935
(Kolter)
Well Playmaker,

00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:10.737
I made my choice,
so here I am.

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:13.473
You're the closest to family
I've ever had

00:11:13.574 --> 00:11:16.109
but I do have
another family to save!

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:17.077
(grunts)

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:20.948
We're not really gonna
duel him, are we?

00:11:21.449 --> 00:11:24.452
(Kolter)
You will if you wanna stop
Lightning and Bohman.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.820
Because the only way
to get to them

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.521
is to get through me!

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.358
So get ready to duel!

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:39.933
Whoa.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:40.935
Huh.

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.669
This looks like Den City.

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:45.806
Boss, we logged out
and made it back home!

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:48.409
No, we didn't, if we were
back in the real world,

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:49.776
you wouldn't be a pigeon!

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.111
Or would I?

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.780
(Frog)
Look down there!
It's Playmaker!

00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:56.016
And I don't know who
he's facing,

00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:58.785
but I'm getting
super bad vibes from him!

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:02.022
'Cause only the really
bad guys have goatees!

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.491
(Frog)
Yeah, and he's mean
muggin' him big time!

00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:06.594
He's scaring me,
and I'm all the way up here!

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.530
In all my years,
I've seen my share of baddies,

00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:11.532
but I've never seen one
who hates Playmaker

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:12.867
as much as this guy.

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:14.668
Get your camera crankin'!

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.036
Will do, Boss!

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.206
It's Playmaker!

00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:20.074
(gasps)

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:22.976
And that's... oh, boy.

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:25.379
They're dueling Kolter!

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:28.148
But why would those two go
and duel each other?

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:30.083
I don't know,
but I can only assume

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.384
they have no choice.

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:34.754
Well I don't like this at all
Flame, not one little bit!

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:38.225
If Kolter loses this duel,

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:41.528
are you really going to erase
all of Jin's data?

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:43.330
Of course.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.234
As I told Kolter,
my word is my word, my friend.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.070
I wonder how Playmaker will duel
knowing that defeating

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.205
his friend will also
erase Jin.

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:55.342
Because if I was Playmaker,
the logical choice would be

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:57.677
to defeat Kolter without mercy.

00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:00.013
But as I have learned
about the humans,

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:03.617
the emotional choice often
supersedes the logical one.

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:07.487
Kolter, there must be
another way to save Jin.

00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:10.724
I wish there was bud,
but there isn't!

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:12.927
So let's duel!

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:15.929
And 'cause I've been
watching you duel since Day 1,

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.464
I know all your moves

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.932
but you don't know mine!

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.068
I'll start by summoning
Codebreaker Zero Day!

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.808
Then I'll place this facedown

00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:30.878
and end my turn.

00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:34.314
Now, let's see
what you got, Playmaker!

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:38.452
(Faust)
Unbelievable.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:39.920
What's Kolter thinking?

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:41.956
You answered your
own question,

00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:43.057
he's not.

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.391
(Baira)
Don't be so sure.

00:13:45.426 --> 00:13:47.595
Kolter sent us
this half-finished program

00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:48.729
twenty minutes ago.

00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:52.265
It's designed to hack into
Mirror LINK VRAINS.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:55.202
But why would he send
this program to us?

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:59.206
Because he obviously would like
for us to complete it for him.

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.642
(Baira)
Maybe he's buying us time
with this duel.

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:05.011
So let's not waste any
of it and get started.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:10.350
Well, Playmaker...

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.885
Looks like it's our turn.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:13.486
Yes it is, Ai.

00:14:13.888 --> 00:14:14.821
Get ready.

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:16.489
I draw!

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:20.660
I'll start by summoning
Digitronfrom my hand.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.133
And I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.770
I set Digitron in the Link Arrow
to Link Summon...

00:14:30.137 --> 00:14:32.172
Link 1 LINK SPIDER!

00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:36.676
By activating its ability,

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.179
I can summon a Level 4
or lower monster

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.180
next to its link.

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.782
Come on out, Bitron!

00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:50.825
And when I have
a Cyberse on my field...

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.659
I'm also allowed to summon

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.527
Backup Secretary!

00:14:57.497 --> 00:15:01.102
This gives me the two monsters
I need to Link Summon again!

00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:01.868
Go!

00:15:05.372 --> 00:15:09.042
I Link Summon
Link 2 Protocol Gardna!

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:12.613
But I'm not stopping here!

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.549
I'm Link Summoning
for a third time!

00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:20.120
I Link Summon

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.856
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.060
Uh...

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.196
When Kolter said
to show him what you got,

00:15:29.196 --> 00:15:31.899
I don't know if he meant
the whole buffet table.

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:35.035
You're really using
Decode Talker against Kolter?

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:36.503
Isn't that kinda...

00:15:36.537 --> 00:15:38.205
can't believe I'm saying this,

00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:38.939
rude?

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:41.241
I mean, it's the very first
Link Monster

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:43.043
the two of you
worked together to get!

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.278
You may have snagged it
from the Data Storm,

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.447
but it was Kolter who
found a way to generate it

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:48.382
into a card.

00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:50.617
Were you a salamander
in your past life,

00:15:50.617 --> 00:15:52.752
'cause this is cold-blooded.

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:54.421
(Flame)
Curious.

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.389
If Playmaker had
summoned Decode Talker

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.025
in front of Kolter's monster,

00:15:58.025 --> 00:15:59.794
its special ability
would've increased

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:01.962
its attack points by 500.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:05.031
It's not like Playmaker
to make a mistake like that.

00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.367
I don't think
it was any kind of mistake.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.937
I think Playmaker did it
on purpose because

00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:11.738
he doesn't want to
hurt Kolter.

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:15.609
But if Playmaker keeps
playing like that, he can't win.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:18.311
(Varis)
I don't care if he's
your friend or not,

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:21.081
winning is the only thing
that matters.

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:29.956
Playmaker is clearly
holding back

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.626
and not dueling
to the best of his abilities.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.127
Of course he isn't.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.497
While the logical choice
is to crush

00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:38.265
his opponent mercilessly,

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:41.568
he emotionally cannot
come to that conclusion.

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:42.903
And if he cannot,

00:16:42.903 --> 00:16:44.405
Kolter will defeat him,

00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:47.307
and eliminate
our greatest threat.

00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:49.677
(Kolter)
What's wrong, Playmaker?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.179
Even a preschooler knows
you just messed up

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.513
your move big time!

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:55.583
And believe me,

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:58.618
I don't need a handicap
to take you down!

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.854
Now it's my turn!

00:17:01.088 --> 00:17:01.889
(grunts)

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.659
I summon a second
Codebreaker Zero Day!

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:11.999
Next up, I'm activating
my trap card,

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.867
Codebreak Backfire!

00:17:15.835 --> 00:17:17.370
Now, check this!

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:19.339
(grunts)

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.743
You're not the only one
who can Link Summon, Playmaker!

00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:28.649
I Link Summon!

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:33.019
Link 2 Codebreaker Virus
Swordsman!

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:39.693
What? But why?

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:41.929
Why did you summon
your monster

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:43.664
next to my Decode Talker?

00:17:43.697 --> 00:17:45.866
By doing so,
you triggered its ability

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.468
raising its attack points
by 500.

00:17:51.572 --> 00:17:54.041
And why do caregiver
and caretaker

00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:55.208
mean the same thing?

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:56.577
It doesn't matter!

00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:58.478
I'll tell you why!

00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:02.749
Because it lets me activate
my Swordsman's ability!

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.318
When I summon it
so that it's co-linked

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:08.555
to another monster,
which by the way, it is,

00:18:08.555 --> 00:18:12.058
I can summon another Codebreaker
from my hand or graveyard

00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:15.262
next to any Link Monster,
including yours!

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:18.265
So I'm reviving
Codebreaker Zero Day

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:20.834
and summoning it
to your side of the field!

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.905
He gave us his monster?

00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:26.940
Do we have to send him
a thank you card?

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:30.310
That'd be nice
but it won't be necessary, Ai.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.745
'Cause you see, usually,

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:35.215
Decode Talker gains 500 attack
points for every monster

00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:36.150
it's linked to.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.784
But when Zero Day
is linked to it,

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.887
it flips everything
upside down,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.290
and your Decode Talker loses
those attack points instead.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.093
So instead of powering up,
it powers down!

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:50.096
This means our monster's
is the weakest one in play!

00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:51.999
And when a Codebreaker
is summoned

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:53.500
to your side of the field,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.303
that triggers Codebreak
Backfire's effect,

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:59.039
which deals you
600 points of damage!

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.810
(grunts)

00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:08.315
Oh, byte!

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:09.716
Aww, man!

00:19:12.886 --> 00:19:16.222
That trap may have only dealt
600 points of damage,

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:19.492
but the emotional damage
is incalculable.

00:19:20.828 --> 00:19:23.163
C'mon Kolter,
take it easy!

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.999
You didn't have to
pound us that hard,

00:19:24.999 --> 00:19:27.267
it's not like you're
tenderizing a chicken breast!

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:28.302
Why not?

00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:31.605
It's not my fault you're not
taking this seriously.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:34.608
And trust me when I say
you should

00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:37.177
'cause I'll do anything
to save Jin from Lightning.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.813
Uh, hello! Same here!

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.482
It's like reading
a book together,

00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:43.116
we're on the same page!

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:45.786
But my brother is not gonna
survive the final chapter

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:47.287
unless I do something.

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:48.322
And...

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:51.491
I won't risk anything
happening to Jin.

00:19:51.491 --> 00:19:53.861
So Codebreaker Virus
Swordsman,

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.130
attack their Decode Talker!

00:19:56.163 --> 00:19:58.666
And by doing so,
Codebrak Backfire's

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:00.701
additional
effect activates!

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.770
My Codebreaker can't destroy
your monster in battle,

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.107
but the good thing is,
you'll still take damage!

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:15.816
(screams)

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:15.882
Codebreaker VIRUS SWORDSMAN

00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:21.021
C'mon get up!

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:22.656
You can't duel
if you're lying down!

00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:23.824
I know that.

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.058
Do ya?

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.660
'Cause while you're
having a siesta,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.163
Kolter's having
a fiesta cha-cha-cha-ing

00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:30.831
all over your life points!

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:34.335
And I'm still not done
pilin' on the damage!

00:20:34.335 --> 00:20:37.304
Due to Codebreaker Virus
Swordsman's special ability,

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:40.173
your Decode Talker loses
500 attack points

00:20:40.173 --> 00:20:41.775
for every Codebreaker in play,

00:20:41.775 --> 00:20:44.645
and you lose life points
equal to that same amount!

00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:46.513
That's another thousand!

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:48.648
Not if I can help it, Kolter.

00:20:48.815 --> 00:20:51.652
I activate Decode Talker's
special ability!

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:53.554
By tributing a monster
on my field

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:55.456
that's next to
Decode Talker's link,

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:58.158
I can negate
and destroy your Swordsman.

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.395
So not only do I get rid
of your Zero Day...

00:21:02.629 --> 00:21:06.066
But I also get rid of your
Codebreaker Virus Swordsman!

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:11.772
And now that those two
Codebreakers are gone,

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:15.008
Decode Talker's attack
points return to normal.

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:17.110
Phew.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.379
Kolter almost buzzed through
our life points,

00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:21.182
but now that he doesn't
have any monsters,

00:21:21.182 --> 00:21:22.283
we're outta danger.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.117
(Kolter)
You sure about that?

00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:25.118
Huh?

00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:28.589
My Virus Swordsman
still has another ability!

00:21:28.889 --> 00:21:31.892
When it's destroyed due to your
monster's special ability,

00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:34.261
I can resummon it
from my graveyard!

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:36.130
What? For real?

00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:39.866
And like last time,
I also get to summon

00:21:39.866 --> 00:21:42.435
Codebreaker Zero Day
on to your field!

00:21:45.005 --> 00:21:47.174
So your Decode Talker's
attack points

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:49.109
drop back down to 1300.

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:55.549
Then my trap Codebreak
Backfire activates again!

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:57.551
Whenever a Codebreaker monster
is summoned

00:21:57.551 --> 00:21:58.785
to your side of the field,

00:21:58.785 --> 00:22:01.488
you take 600 points
of damage, bud!

00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:06.293
(grunts)

00:22:08.695 --> 00:22:10.030
Well Playmaker,

00:22:10.865 --> 00:22:12.633
you ain't looking so good.

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:14.969
And you're playing even worse.

00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:17.771
If you don't step your game up
and step it up soon,

00:22:18.271 --> 00:22:19.974
this duel is over!

00:22:20.107 --> 00:22:22.742
Playmaker, I know he's your
one and only friend

00:22:22.742 --> 00:22:24.912
you've ever ever had
ever ever ever--

00:22:24.912 --> 00:22:26.080
Not now.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.816
Yes now! 'Cause if you
don't start fighting back,

00:22:28.816 --> 00:22:30.317
he's gonna wipe us out!

00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:31.852
I know.

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:33.587
But how do I fight

00:22:34.154 --> 00:22:35.121
my friend?
