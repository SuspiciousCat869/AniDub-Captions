WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.271
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS."

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.842
So we finally meet each other
in real life, Varis.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.312
Yes we do... Playmaker.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.248
You're Dr. Kogami's son.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.984
Yes, the name's Roken.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.820
My father is a brilliant man.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.923
But know that he is an even
greater visionary.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.526
He could see the course of the
future better than anyone.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.594
That future was one

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.097
full of strife, of difficulty,
and of challenges

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.499
that mankind
had never faced before.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.770
He felt that humans
alone could not stand up
to these challenges.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.105
That is why he decided to use

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:42.342
all of SOL Technologies'
resources to create the Ignis.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.145
Like I said, my father
was a visionary.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.848
He felt that the Ignis
were evolving too quickly.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.983
So he ran millions
of simulations

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.686
to see where all of this
would lead in the future.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.789
And they all led
to the same outcome.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.858
The extinction of mankind.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.659
You believe that
the Ignis are evil

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.062
because they're going
to destroy us?

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.598
Then if we're willing
to destroy the Ignis,

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.401
what does that make us?

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.736
Let's duel, one final
time, Varis.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.072
So if you win, the network,
along with the Ignis,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.341
will be destroyed,
as you wish.

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:16.076
But if I'm right
and defeat you,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.312
the Tower of Hanoi
will be stopped.

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.980
Very well, Playmaker.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.850
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:26.553
Excode Talker,
attack Varis directly!

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:30.057
I activate my trap
Mirror Force.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.693
Farewell.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.029
By destroying Excode Talker,
you've allowed me to resurrect

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.999
Restoration Point Guard
from my graveyard.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.503
You may have dealt
the opening blow,

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:46.706
but I will deal
the final one!

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:53.713
♪♪♪

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:51.739
♪♪♪

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:53.373
(door opens/closes)

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:59.146
Yusaku and Varis already
started their duel.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:02.682
Come on now, buddy, win this!

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:08.656
(Frog)
Bring us in closer
and dodge the debris!

00:03:08.723 --> 00:03:11.325
Will do!
Oh man, I remember thinking

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.395
it was embarrassing when my mama
forced me to take

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:15.663
ballet lessons last year,

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.632
but now, thank you, Mama!

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.735
Whew! I made it through
safe and sound, Boss!

00:03:21.835 --> 00:03:24.671
Ugh, well, she might wanna
get her money back!

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.374
Oh, oh!
You pirouetted your way through

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.644
that garbage like
you had two left wings!

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.012
(Pigeon screams)

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.813
I need more lessons!

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.949
(Ai)
Not to put any pressure on ya,

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:37.351
but the clock's tickin',

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.519
so you gotta beat Varis pronto.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.623
I mean, I know you just tried
to beat him and failed,

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.559
like badly, but ya know,
tick-tock tick-tock?!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:46.660
Right.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.664
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:53.834
Due to Link Coin's effect
on my previous turn,

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.770
Vorticular Drumgon
returns to my field.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.711
When my Vorticular Drumgon
resurrects,

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.214
I'm allowed to draw
one card from my deck

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.049
and add it to my hand.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:12.719
Then I shall summon
Sniffer Dragon to my field.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:18.592
Sniffer Dragon's ability
activates

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:21.595
allowing me to add another copy
of Sniffer Dragon

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:25.299
from my deck
to replenish my hand.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.002
He has everything
he needs to Link Summon.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.705
Just because he can doesn't
mean he's going to, right?

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.542
No, Ai, that's exactly
what he's going to do.

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:37.777
Now's the time to manifest
my circuit!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.082
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:45.753
The summoning conditions are two
or more Effect Monsters.

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.888
So, I set both my Sniffer Dragon

00:04:47.922 --> 00:04:51.458
and Vorticular Drumgon
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:55.729
I Link Summon!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.272
Link 4, Topologic Bomber Dragon!

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.110
(Ai)
Aw, glitch!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.311
That's his best monster!

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.948
I activate the Equip Spell
Borrel Regenerator!

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.152
I resummon a Rokket monster
from my graveyard

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:21.422
in defense mode
and equip it with this card.

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:22.423
Return to the fight,

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:25.325
Metalrokket Dragon.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.167
And due to the effect of my
Field Spell Boot Sector Launch,

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.936
my Metalrokket Dragon gains

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.506
300 attack
and defense points.

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.942
(Ai)
This is, uh, less than
optimal, Playmaker.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.412
But on the bright side
at least it was only
a teensy weensy bump.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:48.782
Believe me, program, there
is no bright side for you.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:53.087
Since I summoned a monster
next to Topologic Bomber
Dragon's link,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.458
its special ability
destroys all monsters
in our Main Monster Zones.

00:05:57.491 --> 00:06:00.193
Decimation Destruction!

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.870
This now leaves you
absolutely defenseless.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.338
(Playmaker)
I beg to differ.

00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:12.505
Say what?

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:16.009
Whenever a Link Monster
is summoned,

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:20.014
Restoration Point Guard cannot
be destroyed during that turn

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:21.748
so only your monster
was destroyed.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:24.251
I see.

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:26.153
You make that sound...

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.355
like it's a bad thing
but you're wrong!

00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:30.991
By destroying my monster,

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:34.562
Borrel Regenerator allows me
to draw one card from my deck.

00:06:34.662 --> 00:06:37.231
And now, Topologic Bomber Dragon

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.033
attacks Restoration Point Guard!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.370
Go, Malicious Mayhem!

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:51.512
Go, Malicious Mayhem!

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.180
Ah, you gotta do
something, Playmaker!

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.217
If we take this hit, we'll
suffer 2000 points of damage.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.552
That's, like, half
our life points!

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:01.288
Almost 90%!

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.656
That's good math.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.059
But I much prefer to take
no damage whatsoever.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.228
When my Cyberse
monster is attacked,

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:11.765
I can send Rescue Interlacer
from my hand to the graveyard

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:14.701
to take no damage
from this battle!

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.071
Ahh...

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.407
That's not so bad of a move.

00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:23.210
But, not so great of one either

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:26.113
because Topologic Bomber
Dragon's special ability

00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:30.917
deals you damage equal
to Restoration Point Guard's
attack points!

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.792
Well, ya lost a K's
worth of life points,

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:40.227
but that's less than two.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:42.329
I don't wanna jinx it
by sayin' this out loud,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.231
but it coulda been
a whole lot worse.

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:45.933
Good job.
Huh?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.468
That means that you
just went and jinxed it.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.904
I didn't think you were
superstitious.

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.775
But it so happens you are
absolutely correct, Playmaker.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.577
I activate Mirror
Force Launcher to exchange

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.680
a card in my hand
with Mirror Force.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.319
Oh, no!

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.653
I gotta reverse the curse.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.789
"I hate to jinx it
by saying this out loud,

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.825
but I hope Mirror Force
does beat us."

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:12.826
(chuckling)
I did my part, Playmaker.

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:15.529
Now you do yours!

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.899
Next, I place two cards
face down.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.868
And since my Metalrokket Dragon
went to the graveyard,

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:23.637
its special ability
lets me summon

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.507
another Rokket monster
from my deck.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:28.975
Rise, Magnarokket Dragon!

00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.281
With that, I end my turn.

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:35.483
And since you did,

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.218
my Rescue Interlacer's
ability activates.

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.522
Because it used its special
ability earlier this turn,

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:44.357
it can resurrect itself
from my graveyard.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.164
(Kolter)
That's an okay start,
but it's only a start.

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.066
Yusaku's still got
a long ways to go

00:08:53.167 --> 00:08:55.135
if he wants to turn
this duel around.

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:58.639
If that's even possible with
Mirror Force back in play.

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:00.641
Yikes! I'm no expert,

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.209
but even I can tell
Varis is ahead

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.678
by counting the number
of cards on the field.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.080
Ahh! Well, go ahead
and count 'em up

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.618
but one thing I won't do
is count Playmaker out!

00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:12.853
(Ai)
If one of his facedowns
is Mirror Force,

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:14.621
which I'm definitely
sure that it is,

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:16.724
it'll destroy our
monsters if we attack.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.091
I know.

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.360
(Ai)
Well, here's what
you might not know.

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.062
I'm a...
a skosh not sure

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:24.064
you have what it takes
to pull this through.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.232
No offense?

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.700
None taken!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:30.537
Because you're usually
more wrong than right!

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.440
What!? You know Link Monsters

00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:35.442
can only be summoned
in attack mode!

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:37.211
Now that's just spite!

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.380
I'll create the circuit
by setting Rescue Interlacer

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.917
and Restoration Point Guard
in the Link Arrows!

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.888
I Link Summon!

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:51.224
Link 3 Transcode Talker!

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:04.738
Its special ability allows
me to bring Excode Talker

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:06.907
back from my graveyard
and summon it

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:09.743
next to Transcode Talker's link!

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.383
(Ai)
What good does it do ya?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.353
Topologic Bomber Dragon's
special ability will blasticize

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:22.256
Excode Talker anyway.
Perhaps.

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.724
But it still fulfills a purpose.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:29.229
By linking to Transcode Talker,
Excode Talker gives it

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:30.564
protection from card effects

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:32.199
and 500 attack points.

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:35.369
500's nice and all,
but it ain't much.

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.338
Oof.
Oof is right.

00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:39.072
Ahh!
What a waste.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:40.608
Now Bomber Dragon!

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:43.610
Destroy Excode Talker!

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.546
I activate my trap
Shield Handler!

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.448
Instead of destroying
my monster,

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:51.551
your Dragon's
special abilities
are negated instead.

00:10:53.454 --> 00:10:56.857
Well, well, now, aren't you
just so full of surprises?

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.292
More than you know.

00:10:58.392 --> 00:11:00.560
I activate
Shield Handler's
second effect

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:03.630
to equip this card
onto Excode Talker.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:05.465
By doing so, none of your cards'

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.634
effects can destroy it anymore.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:13.107
Then Transcode Talker's
special ability gives

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.311
both my Code Talkers
500 extra attack points.

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.147
Nice!
Both our Code Talkers
are now suped-out!

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:23.283
Since Varis's Mirror Force can't
destroy our monsters anymore,

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:26.086
his face is gonna
do the crying emoji.

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:28.689
Do I actually look
worried to you?

00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:31.958
You should upgrade your
facial recognition software.

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:35.195
And I have no problem
upgrading your face!

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.965
Playmaker, attack
and pummel that punk!

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.833
No.
No?!

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:41.535
No no! Yes!

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:43.604
I have something
different in mind.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:46.607
By returning Rom Cloudia
from my graveyard to my hand,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.575
I can summon Simm Tablir!

00:11:48.609 --> 00:11:51.978
Right next
to Excode Talker's link!

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.984
Next I summon Rom Cloudia!

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.356
Rom Cloudia's special ability

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:06.727
allows me to retrieve a Cyberse
monster from my graveyard.

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:11.331
So Latency returns to my hand.

00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:14.034
But it won't remain
in my hand for long.

00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:16.503
Because Latency's
own special ability

00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:19.172
allows me to automatically
summon it!

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.714
Now I have all that I require
to create my circuit!

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:31.685
The summoning conditions
are three monsters.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:36.990
So I set Simm Tablir,
Rom Cloudia and Latency
in the Link Arrows!

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.362
Link the circuit!
I Link Summon!

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:45.432
Link 3 Powercode Talker!

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.207
Excode Talker now strengthens

00:12:53.307 --> 00:12:54.841
the monsters next to its links,

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.845
so Powercode
gains 500 attack points

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.913
and can't be destroyed
by effects.

00:13:00.014 --> 00:13:02.950
Bet Varis is so scared he's
flappin' around like a chicken!

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.419
'Cause not only do our three
Code Talkers have enough

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.323
attack points to wipe out
Varis's monsters,

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:13.260
but wipe out the rest of Varis's
life points as well!

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:17.631
Defeating Varis is sure gonna
leave him in a "fowl" mood.

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:20.267
Varis! It's over!

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.773
Whoa! Playmaker
has the upper hand.

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:28.041
He's got a W within his reach!

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:32.746
Not to mention a V, an I,
a C and a T and O-R-Y!

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.749
(Kolter)
Come on, Yusaku,
this is your chance.

00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:38.418
Powercode! Attack!

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.629
(Playmaker)
Power Smash!

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.739
You took the shine
off that chrome.

00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:01.308
Now why don'tcha
polish the other off!

00:14:01.342 --> 00:14:03.010
Transcode Talker!

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.613
Take out Topologic
Bomber Dragon!

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:15.488
Oh, I don't think so... ha!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.525
I activate my trap Link Turret.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:26.633
Yikes! That thing's almost

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.135
as big as his ego.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:31.939
Playmaker, I knew you'd
have strategies to counter

00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:34.341
my Topologic Bomber Dragon.

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:36.644
So I have a counter
to your counter.

00:14:36.677 --> 00:14:40.614
By sending two Rokket monsters
from my deck to the graveyard,

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:42.650
Link Turret gains
a Rokket Counter

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:45.118
for every Link Monster
on the field.

00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:47.221
Furthermore, my Link Monster

00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:49.323
can't be destroyed
in battle this turn.

00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:52.359
But that doesn't stop
ya from taking damage!

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:55.029
And every single life
point is crucial.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:56.162
Attack!

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:05.873
However, since there are

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:08.409
four Link Monsters in play,

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:12.212
my trap Link Turret
gains four Rokket Counters.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:17.084
In addition, whenever
I take damage from a battle,

00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:20.287
I can add another
Counter to Link Turret.

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:27.027
I place one card face down
and end my turn.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.864
That lets me activate
Magnarokket Dragon's
special ability.

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:34.568
I can summon another
Rokket monster from my deck.

00:15:34.634 --> 00:15:39.673
This one here.
So now I will call forth
my Autorokket Dragon!

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.580
Playmaker, I think we're doin'
all right in this duel,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.882
but I feel like
there's something hangi''
over our heads.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:51.852
Maybe 'cause there
literally is!

00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:53.887
I got a gut feeling it's bad,

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:55.388
and I don't even have a gut.

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:56.890
What do you think it does?

00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:58.225
I don't know.

00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:00.961
Oh, okay...
Thanks for that.

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:03.364
Hmm, after all your bluster

00:16:03.464 --> 00:16:05.966
chronicling how you
would defeat me,

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:08.735
I'm still standing
here before you.

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.437
Just pathetic.

00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:13.006
But then again being pathetic

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:14.941
is what you two do best.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:17.678
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:21.415
I activate...
My spell Squib Draw!

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:24.284
By destroying one of the
Rokket monsters on my field,

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:26.753
I can draw two cards
from my deck.

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:29.289
Autorokket Dragon, be gone!

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:33.861
And next...
my Boot Sector Launch's

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:35.963
effect will now activate!

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:39.099
For every extra monster
you have in play,

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:42.435
this Field Spell allows me
to resurrect a Rokket monster

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:45.673
from my graveyard
and place it in defense mode.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:48.942
Since you have three monsters
while I have one,

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.445
I bring back two Rokkets:

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:54.281
Shelrokket Dragon
and Metalrokket Dragon!

00:16:57.184 --> 00:17:00.921
And with them,
I manifest my circuit!

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:05.058
The summoning conditions
are two Rokket monsters.

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:09.396
So I set Shelrokket and
Metalrokket in the Link Arrows!

00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:10.831
I Link Summon!

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.767
Link 2 Miniborrel Dragon!

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.406
Next up, I summon
Gateway Dragon!

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.543
Go, Gateway Dragon!

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:27.847
Open a portal to summon a Level
4 or lower monster from my hand.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:29.516
Sniffer Dragon!

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.688
I really hope he's not gonna
use 'em to Link Summon.

00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.056
Like really, really,
really, really,

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:37.991
and I jinxed it again,
didn't I?

00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:41.695
Yes, you did, and there's
nothing you can do to stop it!

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:47.534
The summoning conditions are
three or more Effect Monsters.

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.804
So I set Gateway Dragon,
Sniffer Dragon

00:17:50.838 --> 00:17:54.007
and Miniborrel Dragon
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:57.011
Link the circuit!

00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:59.346
This dragon's been thirsting
for a long time

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.084
to sink its fangs
into you again, Playmaker!

00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:08.221
I Link Summon... Link 4,
Borreload Dragon!

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:25.372
I Link Summon... Link 4,
Borreload Dragon!

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:31.411
Ah! Borreload Dragon tossed
our tail in our last duel!

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:33.914
But last time's last time
and this time's this time!

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.916
Our monster has more attack
points than his!

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.618
(Playmaker)
If not for Borreload's
special ability.

00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.620
Huh? What,
the what now?

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:43.156
You forgot about it,
didn't you, Ai?

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:45.926
No! I got the memories
of a goldfish!

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:47.995
Very well then, Ignis.

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:50.731
It is my pleasure
to give you a reminder.

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:52.600
Go Borreload Dragon!

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:55.069
(laughing)
Once per turn.

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:57.571
It can drain 500 attack
and defense points

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:59.139
from one of your monsters,

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:02.309
and you can do nothing
to stop it!

00:19:06.814 --> 00:19:11.151
Next, Borreload attacks
Transcode Talker!

00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:13.887
But Transcode Talker
has 300 more

00:19:13.988 --> 00:19:16.490
attack points
than Borreload Dragon.

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:18.492
As if I'm not aware of that.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.661
Borreload Dragon
has another ability.

00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:23.731
It lets me gain control
of the monster that it attacks,

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:26.733
meaning your
Transcode Talker is mine!

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:39.379
Oh no! Instead of getting
taken out, we got taken from?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.149
With Transcode Talker
under my control,

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.517
it's no longer co-linked
with Excode Talker,

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:48.221
so your monster loses
500 attack points.

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:51.358
Instead, Transcode Talker
will use that same

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.827
special ability to serve me.

00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:56.830
It co-links with
Topologic Bomber Dragon

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:59.833
to empower each other!

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.802
Now, Topologic Bomber Dragon,

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.638
blast away at Excode Talker!

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:17.684
Without Excode Talker
around to power it up,

00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:21.655
Powercode Talker
loses 500 attack points.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.991
Now then, allow me
to give you the pleasure

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:28.828
of learning how it feels to be
attacked by your own monster!

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:39.106
Oh, no!

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:42.642
Playmaker!
Ohh...

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:49.817
(Varis laughing)

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:53.854
(Varis)
You're out of monsters,
Playmaker.

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:57.557
Actually no, you're not
just out of monsters.

00:20:57.657 --> 00:21:00.928
Playmaker, you're also
out of hope.

00:21:01.028 --> 00:21:03.063
Hope for saving Link VRAINS.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.399
Hope for getting revenge.

00:21:05.466 --> 00:21:08.202
But this should
come as no surprise,

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:12.205
since your hope for victory
was always an illusion.
