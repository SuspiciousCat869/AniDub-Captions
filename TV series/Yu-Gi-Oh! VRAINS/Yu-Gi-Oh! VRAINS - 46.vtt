WEBVTT

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.251
Playmaker's life points
are on life support!

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.621
Any lower
and they'd be flatlinin'!

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.356
Yusaku!

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:25.792
(Varis)
While you only have
one monster on your side,

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.794
I have seven.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.598
Which is far more than enough
to send you into defeat.

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.833
Your Secure Gardna can lower
battle damage to zero,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.968
but only once.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.303
And like I said,

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.006
I have seven monsters
to work with... seven.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.274
We... can... count!

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:44.111
Then you can understand
the trouble you're in.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.779
I admit even I'm intrigued

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.281
how you're planning to
survive, much less win.

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.851
Using the only
strategy that counts.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.620
I promised that I would
win this duel,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.789
so that's precisely
what I'm going to do.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.126
Because I never
go back on my word.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:02.162
♪♪♪

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.789
You talked a good game,
Playmaker,

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.091
but your skills never lived up
to your mouth.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.892
And it's about time

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:09.396
for me to shut them
both permanently!

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:12.566
I draw!

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.235
(thinking)
Playmaker's pinning his hopes

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.737
on that one lone trap card
to stop me,

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:19.472
but my Borreload
and Borrelsword Dragons

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.243
will put an end to his dreams.

00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:25.078
It's time!
Borreload Dragon!

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:32.586
Energy chambers charged!

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.121
Arm plasma cannon!

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.725
Target locked!

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:41.829
Retract safeguards.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.499
Now fire
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.601
I don't think so,
bubblehead!

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.738
'Cause we got a trap card
to stop it in its tracks!

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.373
You don't think so?

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.708
Well, I don't
think so either!

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.311
Borreload Dragon's
special ability activates,

00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:00.981
lowering one monster's attack
and defense points by 500.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.817
And you, Playmaker,
can't activate

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.719
any card effects
to negate it!

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.956
Borreload, use your ability
on Secure Gardna!

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.825
Huh? Varis knows
that special abilities

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:14.728
don't affect Secure Gardna,
so what's the point?

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:16.830
Did he get hit
with the amnesia?

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.966
No, but maybe you did.
What?

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:20.367
Because you see, Ai,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.769
weakening our monster
wasn't his goal.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.639
He did it so we can no longer
activate our trap.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.976
Why does he have
a counter for every
single nitpickin' move!

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:32.613
It's called tactics.

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:36.616
You should look into it
in your next life!

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.653
Secure Gardna's
special ability activates!

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:42.822
Once per turn,
I take no battle damage!

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:46.326
But your monster will still
be destroyed, Playmaker.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.163
Or not,
because I activate

00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:52.299
My Protection Wizard's
special ability!

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.001
You what?

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:55.635
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:03:55.635 --> 00:04:00.440
it protects Secure Gardna
from being destroyed!

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.442
Grr!

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.679
You may have stopped
my first attack,

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:08.282
but I still have
plenty more monsters,

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.517
like my Borrelsword Dragon!

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:14.054
By switching one monster
on the field from attack
to defense mode,

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:16.890
Borrelsword can attack
twice in a single turn.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.626
And you can't use your trap
to negate this either!

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:22.363
I use this ability
on my Magnarokket!

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:26.066
This also triggers
Magnarokket's own
special ability.

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.768
It then self-destructs,

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.938
and a monster on the field
goes to the graveyard!

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:34.508
That monster will be
Anesthrokket!

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:37.510
At this moment
I activate

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.946
Cluster Congester's
special ability!

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.849
Grr!

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.684
By banishing
Secure Gardna
from my field

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.420
and Cluster Gongester
from my graveyard,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.555
I can summon
a Congester Token

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:50.858
for every Link Monster
you have in play,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:54.461
for a total of five!

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.130
This barricade is
temporary however,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.633
because these Tokens will be
automatically destroyed

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.268
at the end of the turn.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.670
Oh?
But when they are,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.473
you take 300 points
of damage from each Token,

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:10.678
dealing a significant
blow to your life points!

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:13.681
Then it's best I get
rid of 'em.

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.751
Borrelsword, attack
and destroy the first Token!

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.653
(roaring)

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.259
And you best not forget

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.961
that Borrelsword can
attack twice this turn!

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:30.764
Go! Destroy
the second Token!

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:32.166
I don't think so!

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:36.437
Because I activate
Transaction Rollback!

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.505
By paying half
my life points,

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.674
I can use the effect
of one of the trap cards

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.676
in your graveyard
as if it was my own.

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:47.480
And, Varis,
the trap I choose...

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.115
is Mirror Force!

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.028
How do ya like the taste
of your own medicine, Doc?

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.163
All your monsters'll
be wiped out!

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.599
Heh!
I hardly think so.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.367
Ohh!
What?!

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.170
You should never underestimate
the power of my Extra Link.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.973
When my Topologic Gumblar
Dragon is Extra Linked,

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.175
its special ability
prevents your trap

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:19.379
from destroying
my monsters!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.248
No!
Ahh!

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:23.250
That's right!
I sensed from the very start

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.353
that you'd try to take
advantage of my Mirror Force.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:29.156
I know what moves
you'll make even
before you do!

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:31.692
And that is why
you'll always be dueling

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:34.261
ten steps
behind me, Playmaker.

00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.831
And why your defenses
will be no more!

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.901
Borrelsword!
Borrelguard!

00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.238
Topologic Bomber and
Topologic Gumblar Dragons!

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:47.007
Attack!

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.981
(Varis)
Borrelsword! Borrelguard!

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.318
Topologic Bomber and
Topologic Gumblar Dragons!

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.986
Attack!

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:05.091
Unh!

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.895
You have nothing left
on your field.

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:09.596
Not a single card.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.299
And with that,
I end my turn.

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:16.770
Then Magnarokket's
special ability activates
from my graveyard.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.607
Allowing me to summon
Autorokket Dragon!

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:22.877
And thanks
to Boot Sector Launch,

00:07:22.877 --> 00:07:25.245
it gains
300 attack points.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.915
Well, we survived
this turn,

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:32.219
but the next one isn't
looking as pretty as me.

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.254
Heh!
Way to be a downer.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:35.723
An honest downer!

00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:37.758
Well, then, Ai, it seems

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.927
that we've got our work
cut out for us.

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:42.162
Umm, I don't ask
for much, but...

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:44.298
What's wrong?

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:46.433
Can you not do
that smiley thing
with your mouth?

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.101
It's freakin' me out!

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:49.769
I've seen Varis
attack my homeworld,

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.738
and even that was
less horrific!

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:54.575
Very well.
I'll try not to.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:58.078
Instead, I'll focus
on this draw.

00:07:58.078 --> 00:08:01.815
This one card will determine
the outcome of this duel,

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:03.651
but more important,
whether my fight

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:06.487
for the past ten years
has been worth the struggle!

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:10.324
Hyah!

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.326
Well?
Get something good?

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:15.896
(Varis)
Allow me to give you
a spoiler... he didn't.

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:18.532
Because there's no way
out of your predicament.

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:21.668
You're hoping for a reality
that doesn't exist,

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.537
but what more
can I expect from someone

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:25.972
who spends his whole time
in Link VRAINS.

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:30.010
Your vision is like
this world itself,
virtual and fake.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.345
But when my Tower
of Hanoi is completed,

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.983
I'll destroy those illusions
along with Link VRAINS!

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.384
Know this, Varis.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:40.320
I'm more aware of myself
than you think I am.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.889
When you fight alone
that's what happens.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.692
Umm, I'm standing
right here!

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:48.862
And I never wanted things
to be this way.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.297
Ahh!

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:54.368
(Playmaker)
I never wanted to
watch life pass me by,

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:58.205
always looking
from the outside in.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:02.709
But it was just a huge chasm
that I couldn't cross.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:06.580
Because the Lost Incident
broke something inside me.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.551
But I don't need to
tell you this, now do I?

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.621
Because you, Varis,
know just how I feel!

00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.890
And why do you think that?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.394
Because when I was at
my lowest point you tried...

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.463
you tried to help me!

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:24.765
(young voice)
You can make it through this.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.601
You just have to always
remember these three things.

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.404
Just three simple reasons can
get you through anything.

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.406
Ahh!

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:35.876
(Playmaker)
You saved me back then.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:40.180
So this time,
I'll save you.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.384
Uhh, save him?
You listenin' to yourself?

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:45.519
You don't save the guy
who's trying

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.622
to delete this guy
when this guy's awesome!

00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:50.891
I know what I said.
Unnnhhh!

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.026
(chuckling)

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.429
(laughing)

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.631
You say that you want
to save me, Playmaker,

00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:01.201
but please do tell me,
what do I need saving from?

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.938
From yourself, Varis.

00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:06.740
Destroying Link VRAINS
will be the biggest mistake

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.375
you make in your life,

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:10.878
and it's one you can
never come back from.

00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:13.213
I won't let you make
that mistake, Varis,

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:15.448
and I have just
the card to do it.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.384
You're bluffing.

00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:20.087
And if you're not,
then you're bluffing yourself.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.756
Look at this army
I have amassed before you

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:24.225
and look what you have.

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:25.726
Nothing,
less than nothing,

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:28.395
except for that one
lone card in your hand.

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:32.533
And you believe
you're going to win?

00:10:32.533 --> 00:10:34.368
I do!

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:35.702
Ha!

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.538
You said
the Lost Incident broke you.

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:40.240
Well, lucky for me
your field is just as broken.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.909
But just because
something's broken

00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:44.044
doesn't mean
it can't be repaired.

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:45.879
And I'm not just
talking about my field.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.581
I'm also
talking about you.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.716
And there are
three reasons why I know

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.887
we can forge a new future
for the both of us.

00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:54.554
Really now.

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:57.591
It's impressive how you've
earned a PhD in psychology

00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.060
during this duel!

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.163
One, if you really agreed
with with your father's plans,

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.133
you wouldn't have tried to
save me ten years ago.

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.468
Two, and knowing that,

00:11:08.468 --> 00:11:11.272
I can no longer justify
my desire for revenge.

00:11:11.272 --> 00:11:14.107
So if I can change,
so can you, Varis.

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:18.111
And three, if we're both
no longer tied down by our past,

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:20.781
then the future is
wide open for us to create.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.783
I have heard enough!

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:24.451
I'll start by activating

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:27.755
the trap Transaction
Rollback in my graveyard!

00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:31.692
I pay half my life points
and banish it!

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:34.461
By doing so, I can now
use the effect

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:37.631
of a different trap card
that's in my graveyard!

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:41.602
Specifically,
Recoded Alive's effect!

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:44.305
By banishing a Cyberse
from my graveyard,

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:47.007
I can summon a Code Talker
from my extra deck

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.976
so I'm letting
my Transcode Talker go

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.745
to summon its brethren.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:55.749
Now rise up,
Encode Talker!

00:11:55.749 --> 00:11:57.318
(roars)

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:58.618
All right!

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:01.355
Things aren't good,
but there less not good.

00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:05.025
By summoning Encode Talker
next to Gumblar Dragon's link,

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:08.828
you activated its ability
that destroys all the cards
in our hands!

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.367
Just another strategical
error on your part.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.802
You're right.

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.005
Well, if it wasn't
for the fact
that I wanted you

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:20.340
to destroy the card
in my hand that is.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.342
Say what?

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:24.645
It's a special card
that activates its effect

00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:26.346
when it gets destroyed.

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:29.516
When Spam Mail
goes from my hand
to the graveyard,

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:32.052
I get to draw a card.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:36.357
And I drew the monster
known as Swap Cleric!

00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:39.026
Then Spam Mail
forces you to return

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:41.562
one of your monsters
back to your hand.

00:12:41.562 --> 00:12:44.198
Flap dem chicken wings
outta here!

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:48.502
I return Autorokket
Dragon to my hand.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:50.837
Next, I summon Swap Cleric!

00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:55.743
Then I activate

00:12:55.743 --> 00:12:58.512
Recoded Alive's effect
from my graveyard.

00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:01.749
By banishing it, I can
re-summon a Code Talker

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:05.486
that's also been banished
back to my field.

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:08.656
And I summon it
where it will co-link

00:13:08.656 --> 00:13:10.957
with Topologic
Bomber Dragon!

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.098
Aww, glitch!

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:20.467
But that'll trigger Bomber
Dragon's special ability!

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.936
No, it won't,
because my trap Shield Handler

00:13:22.936 --> 00:13:25.071
already negated its abilities.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:28.409
So only Transcode Talker's
ability will activate,

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:30.744
raising both
their attack points by 500!

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:36.383
(Varis)
Your move also reactivated
Gumblar Dragon's ability,

00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:38.318
destroying all the cards
in our hands.

00:13:38.318 --> 00:13:42.289
But I'm the only one
that has any.

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:45.392
Transcode Talker has
another special ability!

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:48.094
It can bring back
a Code Talker
from my graveyard

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:50.397
and summon it
next to its link!

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:53.567
I revive
Powercode Talker!

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:56.069
(bellows)

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:59.739
Transcode Talker also gives it
500 attack points!

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:05.846
Now it's time for me to
create the ultimate circuit!

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.814
Link Arrows authorized!

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:11.318
The summoning conditions
require at least two monsters.

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:14.789
So I set Swap Cleric
and Encode Talker

00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:17.490
in the link arrows!

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.226
I Link Summon!

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:22.529
Link 4
Firewall Dragon!

00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:32.939
I Link Summon!

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:36.309
Link 4
Firewall Dragon!

00:14:43.317 --> 00:14:44.651
Impossible!

00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:00.801
You've linked
every monster in play.

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.036
Sure did!

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:05.605
But I don't see how that's
actually going to help you.

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:07.374
Linking eight
monsters together

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:08.909
is pretty cool
and everything,

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:11.211
but I hope it's not
just for show, buddy.

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:14.214
Since I used Swap Cleric
to Link Summon,

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:16.550
its special ability
activates,

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.754
swapping 500 of Firewall
Dragon's attack points

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:22.556
in exchange for
one card from my deck.

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:26.693
Now, Varis, let's see what
the future holds for us!

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:38.406
I activate the spell
Zero Extra Link!

00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:41.742
Transcode Talker gains
800 attack points

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:44.010
for every monster
that's Extra Linked!

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.214
Unreal, boss!

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.416
That's what I call duelin'!

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.051
800 times eight monsters

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.753
equals 6,400
extra attack points!

00:15:57.724 --> 00:16:01.528
Now we have the strongest
monster on the field!

00:16:01.528 --> 00:16:05.999
So what?!
I play Link Short!

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:08.935
All your co-linked monsters
lose their special abilities,

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:10.937
nor can they attack!

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:13.006
And that includes
your Transcode Talker!

00:16:14.942 --> 00:16:17.111
But.. but... but...

00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:19.113
I thought
we were gonna win!

00:16:19.113 --> 00:16:21.315
You obviously thought wrong.

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:23.284
It's not over yet!

00:16:23.284 --> 00:16:26.987
Not when I create
my circuit one last time!

00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:28.622
What!?

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:31.525
The summoning conditions are
two or more Effect Monsters.

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:34.928
So I set Transcode Talker,
Powercode Talker,

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:37.831
and Firewall Dragon
in the link arrows!

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:44.071
I Link Summon!

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:46.606
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:51.845
(growling)

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.615
Decode Talker gains
500 attack points

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.817
for every monster
it's linked to!

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:59.252
And since we summoned
Decode Talker

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:02.356
after you played Link Short,
it's allowed to attack ya!

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:05.358
Go ahead! It's weaker
than my monsters!

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.527
Normally, that would
be the case,

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:08.862
if it wasn't
for my spell card

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.998
Zero Extra Link's
second effect.

00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:13.233
You see, since I used
Transcode Talker

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.168
to summon Decode Talker,

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:18.905
Decode gains the same
attack point boost
that Transcode did!

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.510
(bellowing)

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.914
Oh, no!
Attack, Decode Talker!

00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:29.816
Decode Destruction!

00:17:37.591 --> 00:17:40.061
Attack, Decode Talker!

00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.195
Decode Destruction!

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:48.168
(yelling)

00:17:58.178 --> 00:17:59.713
He won!

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:03.283
Playmaker,
you're so flash!

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:06.086
Way to go, Yusaku!
Yeah-ha-ha!

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:11.258
(moaning)

00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.929
(Varis)
You win, Playmaker...

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.831
But know this.

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:21.635
Our war is... not over.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.471
Not until the Ignis
are extinct.

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:27.607
You haven't seen
the last of me, Playmaker!

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:36.750
(tower rumbling)

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.620
I can't believe it!
The Tower of Hanoi's
been stopped!

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.321
It sure has, and that means

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:43.957
Playmaker's saved Link VRAINS
and our bank accounts!

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.926
Do ya really
think so, boss?

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:49.329
Our footage is worth
millions, billions even!

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:52.132
We can sell our
save files for big bucks

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:53.633
and get out
of our debt hole!

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:57.871
Uh, I was supposed
to save it?
Ugh!

00:19:03.978 --> 00:19:06.613
All the duelists
are now free.

00:19:33.807 --> 00:19:35.775
(Colter panting)

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:37.878
Yusaku!

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.785
Wait, you're
letting him get away?

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:48.388
I'm certain that we'll
see him again.

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:52.459
He won't give up until
every Ignis is extinct.

00:19:55.662 --> 00:20:00.200
(Ai)
Playmaker, I just
wanna say thank you.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.035
Thank you for
letting Varis escape

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.803
so he can hunt me
down again!

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:06.773
What kind of kid
owns a boat anyway!

00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:08.976
Huh? What's that?

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:11.612
I've unlocked
my Duel Disk.

00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:14.147
Huh?
So you're free to go.

00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:16.851
Oh... You're...
really setting me free?

00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:19.019
I finished my mission,

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:21.322
so I don't need
your help anymore.

00:20:21.322 --> 00:20:23.824
So, you actually
found me helpful?

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:26.460
That's not exactly
what I said, Ai.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.028
Right.

00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:30.364
But promise me
that if you ever need
any dueling help,

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:31.899
or any kind
of help at all...

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:34.502
Contact you?
Me? No!

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.971
Promise you'll contact
some other A.I.!

00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:39.206
Hmph!
If you insist.

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:42.809
Well, Yusaku,
It's been real.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:44.111
It's been good.

00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:48.215
And at times,
it's been real good.

00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:49.816
Wait, Ai!
Huh?

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:53.220
Don't leave
with my property.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.156
Huh? Oh yeah,
the Duel Disk.

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:58.525
It's been my home
for so long
that I forgot.

00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:00.894
Wait, did I say "home?"
I meant "jail!"

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:04.731
Ahem. Toodles!

00:21:04.731 --> 00:21:06.633
Ai?

00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:11.905
He's really gone.

00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:23.350
You headin' home?
Yeah.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.385
Where is Ai?
I don't know.

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.054
I let him go.

00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:30.057
Oh yeah?
Are you okay?

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:31.892
I'm good.

00:21:53.614 --> 00:21:56.550
