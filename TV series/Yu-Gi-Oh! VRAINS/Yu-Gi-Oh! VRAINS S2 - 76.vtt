WEBVTT

00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.236
(serene music)

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.109
Mom.

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:13.113
Uh-oh, that look serious.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.682
(Car AI)
Collision ahead,
re-calculating route.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.117
(dramatic music)

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.953
Oh no, something's not right!

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.587
The AI is malfunctioning!

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.124
No, how do you stop this thing?

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:24.457
Brace yourself mom!

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.626
(loud explosion)

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:29.830
That was the worst
day of my life,

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.933
but I'll make it
worse for the ignis.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.102
I will hurt them, as
much as they've hurt you!

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.809
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.834
(dramatic music)

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.404
(Akira)
Sky, is everything okay?

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.474
You sounded disturbed
on the phone.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.477
Akira, I saw what
happened to the Earth ignis.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:51.345
Oh!

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.247
(Sky)
I asked Emma
why SOL Technologies

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:55.916
would do such a thing, but
she told me to ask you,

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:58.418
because she thinks you're
the one who ordered it.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.653
Hmmm.

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:01.055
I don't know what
you were thinking,

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.224
but two words, not cool!

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.326
Why would you do that, Akira?

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.831
Despite what Emma
may have told you,

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:13.801
I didn't order Earth to
be disassembled, Sky,

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:17.404
I know this sounds like a cop
out, but it wasn't my choice,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.140
my boss wanted to know
how the ignis worked,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.476
and I couldn't stop her, no
matter how much I wanted to.

00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:29.583
But Akira, it's just
not right, it just isn't!

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.952
I know Sky, I know!

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.154
(Emma)
Well, at least that
clears one thing up,

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.490
now I know why you wanted
me to find the ignis

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.892
before SOL Tech's
bounty hunters did.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:41.661
Playmaker more than convinced
me that our two groups,

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:46.266
human and ignis, can
live together in peace,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.635
but after what happened
to the Earth ignis,

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.605
I don't know if that's possible.

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:53.874
We may have crossed a line

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.376
from where there's
no coming back.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.380
Uh, I hope that doesn't
mean you're giving up,

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:01.515
the Akira I know would
never stop trying,

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.618
so neither will I and
neither will Playmaker,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.786
but I wonder how
Ai is taking it.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.325
(dramatic music)

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.627
SOL Technologies has
decompiled the Earth ignis.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.564
Oh no, decompiled?

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:18.665
Wait, what does
decompiled mean?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.235
(Varis)
It means that the
Earth ignis was broken apart

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.103
into its source code.

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:24.304
Oh, that's it?

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.040
Sheesh, you had me
worried there for a sec,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.044
it's no biggy, you can
just take his source code

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.812
and build him right back up!

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:35.049
Like how I was just an
eyeball at the beginning,

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:36.549
no thanks to you,

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.454
but look at this fine specimen
you see before you now!

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.889
(Varis)
That's not possible.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:42.789
Huh?

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.024
(Varis)
Since SOL
Tech's technicians

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.525
don't know your algorithms,

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.827
they couldn't decompile
the Earth ignis properly,

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.497
introducing mistakes and bugs.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.832
Think of it like an egg,

00:03:51.865 --> 00:03:53.734
once you decide to
crack open the shell

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.535
and make scrambled eggs,

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:58.372
you can't un-scramble it and
put it back in its shell.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.540
In other words,

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:02.176
the Earth ignis cannot be
restored to its original state.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.046
N-N-No,
that can't be right!

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.215
You're lying,
you lying liar!

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.384
Why would I ever trust a Hanoi?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:13.420
How would you know what
happens in SOL Tech anyway?

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:16.923
Ai, I'm sure the Knights of
Hanoi have spies everywhere,

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:18.925
even within SOL Technologies.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.964
No, so that's what we sensed?

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:25.632
Earth's gone?

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.767
He's really gone?

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.772
Why, why did this
have to happen?

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.440
He wasn't bothering anybody,

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.845
he was just minding his own
business, until they got him!

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.747
Until the humans got him!

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:45.018
Hmph, well, see you around.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:48.788
(dramatic music)

00:04:55.463 --> 00:04:58.465
(keyboard clacking)

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.003
(serene music)

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.271
(girl laughing)

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:07.775
Sky, you wanna slide
down the slide with me?

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:08.942
Yeah!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.011
(girl laughing)

00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:12.646
I'll go first.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.515
(girl whooping)

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:16.416
Your turn, Sky.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:20.654
(girl laughing)

00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:23.023
Do you wanna go
down again, Miyu?

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:25.792
(dramatic music)

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.031
Miyu, where are you, Miyu?

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:33.367
We're not playing hide and seek.

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:36.069
Come on Miyu, this isn't
funny at all, Miyu!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.176
Hey there, sleeping beauty,

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:44.477
f-y-i, you have
the cutest snore.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.948
It was just a dream.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:49.183
Was it a good one?

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:51.118
Maybe involving a
certain duelist,

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.355
who dresses in black,
who has an ignis,

00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:56.923
who fought against
the Hanoi?

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.359
If I'm not being clear,
I'm talking about Playmaker.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:01.428
Oh, you made it crystal clear.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.099
No, it was about this friend
that I had when I was little,

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:08.335
my one and only friend
that I would play with.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.806
(Emma)
So not Playmaker,
never mind.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.674
So, what are you
doing over there anyway?

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.878
Well, one of us had to work
while the other was snoozing,

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:21.415
I think I found a way to
track down the final ignis.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.851
You found out where
Aqua is hiding out?

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:25.919
(Emma) No.
(dramatic music)

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.655
But if this actually
ends up working,

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.723
like I hope it does,
we will.

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:31.826
But she doesn't need
to know that this plan

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.861
comes with a lot of risk,

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:37.097
if it fails, there might
not be any ignis to find.

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:41.836
(dramatic music)

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.203
Just when we were disusing

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:46.306
whether the humans can
co-exist with the ignis,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.908
they erased Earth.

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:49.910
(Earth)
Hi!

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:50.844
Hey!

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:53.547
You wanted to see me?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.748
Yeah, I did.

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:57.084
Alone?

00:06:57.084 --> 00:06:57.918
Uh-huh.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.320
Why?

00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:01.922
Because there's something
I want to tell you,

00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.223
and only you.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.827
Are you going to say
what I think you are?

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.632
The Cyberse is
splitting in two,

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:12.900
there are those who believe

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:15.902
that we can co-exist
with the humans,

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.606
and there are others who don't.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.874
Yes.

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:22.609
And I don't know if
we can remain neutral,

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:25.979
the time is coming when we
must decide which side to join,

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:29.816
the humans or the ignis,
and that time is soon,

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.753
go to their world and see what
the humans are really like

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.655
before you make your decision,

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.392
because what you choose
won't only affect you,

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.260
but the future of us all.

00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:45.332
I can't believe I'll
never see you again,

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:48.435
but you're not
truly gone forever,

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.472
because you'll always
live on in my heart.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.140
(tear dropping)

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.910
(earth rumbling)

00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:02.016
The humans deleted
Earth without mercy,

00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:06.120
that means I should hate
the humans, but I can't,

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.555
because I know how
wonderful they can be too.

00:08:09.823 --> 00:08:12.492
(girl laughing)

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:17.798
(lasers firing)

00:08:17.832 --> 00:08:19.799
I found you ignis!

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.967
(dramatic music)

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.369
(lasers firing)

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:26.173
If you wanted to hide, you
should've picked a better place

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:27.942
than an empty waste land!

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:29.777
I wasn't planning
on hiding!

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.211
Oh really?

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.214
How brave of you.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.782
In order to capture me,

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:36.884
you have to defeat
me in a duel first,

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:39.820
and it's a duel
I intend to win!

00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:41.722
(The Shepherd)
You've got the wrong idea!

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.956
Huh?

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:44.858
I didn't come
here to capture you,

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.861
I came here to destroy you!

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.896
(dramatic music)

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:53.867
(intense music)

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:54.969
(Shepherd)
Bye.

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:55.969
Yeah, bye.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.841
Phew.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.675
(gasps)

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.843
(explosions)

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.077
(shooting)

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.514
(Shepherd)
I said you're
not getting away.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.916
And I always keep my word.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:12.019
I've locked on to your
unique digital signature.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.520
So no matter where you go,

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.022
I can always find you.

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:18.459
(engine roaring)

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:19.626
(gasps)

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:20.860
Be gone.

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:23.264
No!

00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:24.798
(laser powering up)

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:25.566
(shooting)

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:28.435
(intense music)
Leave her alone.

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:29.269
Huh?

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:30.104
(intense music)

00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:31.104
Let's go.

00:09:31.104 --> 00:09:31.938
Grab my hand.

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:35.776
Stay out of my business.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.177
(shooting)

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:38.178
Come on.

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.012
(grunts)

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:39.947
That'll do.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.615
You made a big mistake.

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:43.884
(shooting)

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.222
No one's ever
escaped The Shepherd.

00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:51.892
(intense music)

00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:56.130
Hey there, Shepherd.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.564
Ghost Gal.

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.232
Get out of my way.

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:02.502
Sure, I mean,
I would love to.

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:05.105
But my partner
wouldn't, so, you know.

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.874
(grunts)

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.109
But, we can take a trip.

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.345
(groans)

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:17.117
Huh?

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.218
(dark music)

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:19.853
Where am I?

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:21.354
(Electronic Voice)
I regret to inform
you that

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:23.090
I've lost trace of the Ignis.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.725
This location is
blocking all signals.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:27.294
(groans)

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.194
Ghost Gal.

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.732
You dare trap me?

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.434
(shooting)

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.103
(intense music)

00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:41.241
That worked perfectly.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.843
How are you
going to find Aqua

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:45.379
if you don't
know where she is.

00:10:45.412 --> 00:10:47.915
Because even if I
can't track the Ignis,

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:49.216
I can track the Shepherd.

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.517
So if we follow him,

00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:52.386
he'll lead us straight to Aqua.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:54.554
(beeping)

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.257
But the timing will be critical.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.791
Once Shepherd finds Aqua,

00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:00.360
we have to save her
before he erases her.

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:03.129
(intense music)

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:05.533
(Aqua groans)

00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:06.800
Hey, Aqua.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.969
The Shepherd won't be
bothering you anymore.

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.471
(sighs)

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.006
Thank you.

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:13.340
Don't mention it.

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:15.175
I'm just glad you're
safe and sound.

00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:17.845
By the way,
I'm Blue Gal.

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.180
I owe you my life, Blue Gal.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.683
Or should I say, Sky.

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:23.851
(gasps)

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.186
I have a unique ability
to see the truth.

00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:28.655
So I can see
who you really are.

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.923
And I'm glad to see that your

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.792
heart is still as pure as ever.

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:36.029
Because this is the second
time you've helped me.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:36.964
Wait,

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:37.864
did you say the second time?

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:39.199
But we just met.

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:41.034
I heard Ai say
that all us humans

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.436
look the same but I
never believed it.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.805
That's not true.

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:47.775
You actually helped
me 10 years ago.

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:49.810
Or to be more accurate,

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:52.646
you helped me by helping
a girl named Miyu.

00:11:53.347 --> 00:11:54.281
Miyu?

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.249
Yes.

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:56.750
Do you remember her?

00:11:56.784 --> 00:11:59.687
Yeah, how could I forget.

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:01.187
It was right when
my brother and I

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.257
lost our house and
started travelling

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:06.593
from city to city searching
for a place to live.

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:09.597
Anyone want to go on the slide?

00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:12.198
Let's go, before
we catch the cooties.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.202
(sad music)

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.803
While Akira was at work,

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.739
so that we'd have
something to eat,

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.574
I was left at the playground.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:22.843
Not that I did a lot of playing.

00:12:22.877 --> 00:12:24.078
Since I was moving all the time,

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:27.014
I never had a chance
to make any friends.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.483
That is, until one day..

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:31.485
You know, you're supposed
to swing on a swing.

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:32.853
Not sit on a swing.

00:12:32.887 --> 00:12:34.321
That's why it's called a swing.

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:36.590
Here, let me show you what

00:12:36.656 --> 00:12:37.758
you're supposed to do.

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:40.760
You have to pump your
legs back and forth,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.930
and back and forth, like this.

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:47.334
But pump too much and
your mom's gonna be like,

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:48.235
Miyu! Be careful!

00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:49.703
You'll fly into the slide!

00:12:49.737 --> 00:12:51.805
(laughs)

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.741
Come on, it's super easy.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:56.911
It just takes
a little practise.

00:12:56.911 --> 00:12:59.045
Just copy me,
and do what I do.

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:02.315
'Kay.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:03.284
Let's go!

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:05.319
(bright music)
(both laughing)

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:06.786
I knew you could do it!

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.989
(both laughing)

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.324
Yeah, thanks.

00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:11.625
My name's Sky.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:13.093
Oh, I'm--

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.161
Miyu!

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.630
Uh, how'd you know that?

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:18.398
Because you said
that your mom

00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:19.833
calls you Miyu.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.268
Wow, you're smart.

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:22.536
(laughs)

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:24.938
(soft music)

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.374
From that day on,
we were inseparable.

00:13:27.408 --> 00:13:30.143
We'd play together at
the park every day.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.478
Rain or shine.

00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:34.982
(Sky)
Uh, Miyu?

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.550
Yeah, Sky?

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.318
Don't you have
any other friends?

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:40.754
That are like, from
school and stuff?

00:13:40.788 --> 00:13:41.988
Huh?

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.324
Why'd you wanna know if
I have other friends?

00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:46.660
Well because when
you come to the park,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.895
you only play with me.

00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:50.664
(soft music)

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:52.333
I have a lot of friends.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:54.235
(gasps)

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.470
And out of all my friends,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.439
I like playing with
my best-est friend

00:13:58.472 --> 00:13:59.907
in the whole wide world.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.808
Wait, do you
mean me?

00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:03.443
Of course!

00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:05.545
Who else do you
think I mean, silly.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:07.348
(bright music)

00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:10.050
For the first time in
what felt like forever,

00:14:10.117 --> 00:14:13.053
I was happy, like really happy.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.788
Because although times
were tough for me

00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:17.024
and Akira, Miyu
made me feel like

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:19.126
things would be okay.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.027
But those days
couldn't last forever.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.062
(Miyu)
Sky!

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:22.963
Miyu!

00:14:24.632 --> 00:14:26.700
What do you wanna
do today?

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.837
Well, Sky, how
about show and tell?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.472
Ta-da!

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:32.372
(gasps)

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.174
It's my mom's
favourite ring.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.543
It's my favourite too.

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.546
Isn't it pretty?

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:42.116
(gasps)

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:42.949
Very.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.184
Come on, your turn.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:46.119
Try it on Sky.

00:14:46.153 --> 00:14:48.389
Um, no, I really
shouldn't put it on.

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:50.057
Hey, don't worry.

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:51.858
It'll look pretty
on you, too.

00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:56.029
(ring clanking)

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.831
(gasps)

00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.166
Oh, no!

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:01.034
I gotta get it back.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.436
(struggling)

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:06.439
(sad music)

00:15:06.439 --> 00:15:07.541
Oh, no!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:08.408
It's gone!

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.344
(crying)

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:15.081
My mom's gonna be so mad.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.383
(crying)

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.951
(Miyu's Mom)
Mad about what, Miyu?

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:21.221
Honey, what's wrong?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.856
Are you okay sweetie?

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.791
You know you can always
tell me anything,

00:15:24.791 --> 00:15:26.927
no matter what it might be.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.761
I,

00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:30.964
I lost your ring.

00:15:30.964 --> 00:15:32.299
(crying)

00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.734
You mean, my grandmother's
engagement ring?

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.538
Oh, honey,
I know love that ring

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:40.907
but you know how much
that ring means to me.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:43.110
You're not supposed
to play with it.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.711
Why did you take it?

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:46.180
(Sky)
Because I forced her to.

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:47.514
Huh?

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:48.682
Miyu didn't lose your ring,

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.017
I lost your ring.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.218
I'm sorry.

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.719
(gasps)

00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:55.088
So, it was you
who lost it?

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.289
Uh-huh.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.125
I told Miyu that
I wanted to try on

00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:59.593
your ring and Miyu
said what ring?

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.262
And I said your
mom's favourite ring.

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:02.929
And Miyu said
no you can't.

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:03.797
But I said I wouldn't be your

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.432
friend anymore if
she didn't let me.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.834
And then my finger
slipped and

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:08.669
I dropped it in the drain.

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:09.603
I'm really sorry.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.505
And please don't be
mad at Miyu.

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:13.274
This is all my fault.

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:14.508
Not hers.

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:15.743
(Miyu's Mom)
And how did you know

00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:17.644
I had this ring in
the first place?

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:21.649
Um, because, um I
know a lot about rings.

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:23.950
So, I know who
has every ring.

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:26.420
I see.

00:16:26.454 --> 00:16:28.355
I understand what
you're trying to do,

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:30.357
but friends shouldn't
have to cover up

00:16:30.357 --> 00:16:32.193
for their friends.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:33.327
Hold on, mom.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.161
Sky--

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:35.963
Come along, honey.

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:36.963
(gasps)

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:37.831
No! Mom!

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:41.201
Please let me stay.

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.636
I don't wanna leave!

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:43.504
(Ghost Gal)
So.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:44.604
Yeah.

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:45.806
That same day,

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:47.842
my brother finished
up with his job,

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:50.411
and we had to leave the
city to find a new one.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:53.280
So I had to leave
without saying goodbye.

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.815
And I never saw Miyu again.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.617
I'm sorry Sky.

00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:00.020
I know it's hard to
move all the time

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.255
and leave your friends but

00:17:01.322 --> 00:17:02.756
I know you'll make new friends

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:03.924
wherever we land.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.526
And come to think of it,

00:17:05.559 --> 00:17:07.761
since we've lived
in so many cities,

00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:10.330
you must have friends
all around the world.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.566
(soft music)

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.668
My brother tried as
best to cheer me up,

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.903
but let's just say he tried.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.005
I think you'd like to know

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.540
that Miyu told her mom that

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:21.508
she was the one
who took the ring.

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:22.743
And she never forgot that you

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.978
were willing to take
the fall for her.

00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:27.681
That she never had a
friend quite like you.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.249
How do you know all this?

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:31.652
I mean, it's a nice
story and everything,

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:32.853
but it's not one of
those stories that's

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:34.555
in every textbook.

00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:35.422
(gasps)

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:36.924
Unless.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.825
Unless I'm her Ignis.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.098
I'm her Ignis,

00:17:44.098 --> 00:17:47.100
and Miyu was a victim
of the Lost incident.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.702
So you're saying
Miyu was also

00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:50.571
caught up in the
Lost incident?

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:51.839
Is she okay?

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:54.908
She is, well, she was.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:57.077
Lightening infected
her with a virus.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.146
Putting her into a deep sleep.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.113
Poor Miyu.

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:02.749
I tried to remove
her virus

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:06.219
but Lightening's programme
was just too powerful.

00:18:06.253 --> 00:18:08.622
But still, I didn't stop trying.

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.123
And trying.

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:11.325
And trying.

00:18:11.391 --> 00:18:12.159
And trying.

00:18:12.226 --> 00:18:13.294
But,

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:14.394
but then,

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.330
though I couldn't wake her up,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.831
I reached a part of her.

00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:19.633
Something inside her

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.135
that was too precious for

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:23.637
Lightning's programme
to suppress.

00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:26.140
It was a tiny fragment
of her memories,

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.641
her memories of you, Sky.

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.609
(Emma)
Aw, you're making
me feel like

00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:31.144
a third wheel.

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.380
You two share such
a special bond.

00:18:33.414 --> 00:18:35.716
I mean, you're
practically like family.

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:37.151
Speaking of family,

00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:39.887
there's something I
gotta take care of.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.255
(shooting)

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:43.657
(groans)

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:45.960
(intense music)

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.129
You know that no
trap can hold me

00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:49.663
forever, Ghost Gal.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.131
It's only a matter of time

00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:52.299
until I escape.

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:53.300
Oh, really?

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:55.969
Why are you helping the Ignis?

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:58.405
You have no stakes
in this fight.

00:18:58.439 --> 00:19:00.607
So if this isn't your battle,

00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:02.877
you should stay
out of my business.

00:19:02.877 --> 00:19:04.277
Yeah I know.

00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:05.479
But listen up.

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:06.480
That doesn't make
what you're

00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:08.449
doing right
in any way.

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:10.150
'Cause if you're
on the wrong track,

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:12.319
I kinda think it's
my responsibility

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.488
to put you back on
the right track.

00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:15.322
Right?

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.190
You are my big bro.

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:19.059
Don't call me that.

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:20.193
Fine, okay.

00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:21.394
Shepherd, it is.

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:23.897
Since you won't stop
getting in my way,

00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:25.232
I'll force you to.

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:27.000
With a deletion duel.

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:28.669
What's a deletion duel.

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:32.606
Whoever loses will not only
have their account deleted,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.008
but will also lose
the right to log into

00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:36.877
Link VRAINS forever!

00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:38.178
So tell me,

00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:40.514
is saving an Ignis
worth this risk?

00:19:40.547 --> 00:19:42.149
When you put it that way,

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.383
maybe not.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.851
But I still accept
your challenge.

00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:46.019
(intense music)

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:47.521
Because it's worth
it to save you.

00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:49.056
And at the very least,

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:52.526
it'll buy time for Blue
Gal to escape with Aqua.

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.194
Let's do this, Shepherd.

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.897
(intense music)

00:20:03.304 --> 00:20:04.871
(Both)
Speed duel.

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:11.611
(intense music)
