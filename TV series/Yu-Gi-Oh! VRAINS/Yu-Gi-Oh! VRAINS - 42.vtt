WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.104
(Ai)
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.911
Varis, the time
for our rematch has come.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:15.015
Yes, and only one of us
will be left standing.

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:16.650
And it won't be you!

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:23.857
I knew you were evil...

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.260
but I never thought
you were insane.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:28.495
You'd rather destroy
the network

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.665
than allow one single Ignis
to survive?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.301
The Ignis will do far worse
than this!

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.336
Which do you
think is worse?

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.407
The end of Link VRAINS
or the end of all humanity?

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:41.908
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.579
I activate the trap
that has vanquished

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.515
every foe I've faced--

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:49.082
Mirror Force!

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.519
All your monsters
in defense mode

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.087
get switched
to attack mode!

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.157
No!

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.159
Your lack of vigilance
will cost you

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.096
as Mirror Force destroys every
single one of your monsters!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.202
(screaming, grunting)

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:12.205
Flash Charge Dragon,
attack Playmaker directly!

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.407
(grunts)

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.876
Go, blasting cannon
bombardment!

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.048
(groaning)

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.983
(Ai)
Umm, you okay?

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.986
With this final attack,
you're finished!

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.398
♪♪♪

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.722
♪♪♪

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.441
I will not disappoint you,
Father.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.610
I will eradicate the Ignis.

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:01.548
(grunting)

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:05.886
Blast Powder Dragon, attack
Playmaker and end this duel!

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.691
That blast lands,

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:13.660
and Playmaker's life points'll
be burnt to a crisp!

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.297
If he goes down in flames,
so will Link VRAINS,

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.465
and me and you are goi''
along right with it!

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:20.901
No!
I'm too young to roast!

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.369
Yusaku, no!

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.605
You can't let it end
like this, man.

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:26.840
You willing to let
bygones be bygones

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.342
before we both be gone?

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.610
No.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:32.879
I'm activating my spell card
Spool Code!

00:03:37.017 --> 00:03:40.521
When I have three Cyberse-Type
monsters in my graveyard,

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.057
my spell card not only
stops your attack,

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:47.060
but I also get to summon three
Spool Tokens in defense mode!

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.531
Phew.
I wet my wares.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.699
You may have escaped defeat,

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:56.203
but I... will
bring you one step closer!

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.839
Flash Charge Dragon's
special ability

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:01.775
destroys any monster
summoned next to its link,

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.612
and deals you 500 points
of damage!

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:07.581
So say good-bye to your tiny
little token!

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.590
And with that, I end my turn.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.860
Which means Blast Powder
Dragon's special ability ends,

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:24.565
so Flash Charge Dragon's attack
points drop back down to 2300.

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.467
This duel is not over.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:27.901
It's my turn!

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.737
I draw!

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:32.439
And now I'll Link Summon!

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:39.246
To do so, I need to use one
Level 4 or lower Cyberse.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.048
I set a Spool Token
in the Link Arrow!

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:47.954
I Link Summon!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.225
Link 1, Link Disciple!

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.698
I follow that up by summoning
Swap Cleric!

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.136
And that allows me
to Link Summon again!

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.475
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff!

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.746
The summoning conditions
require two monsters,

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.448
so I set Swap Cleric
and the Spool Token

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.982
in the Link Arrows!

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.186
I Link Summon!

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.755
Link 2, Security Dragon!

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:25.992
(roaring)

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.634
If I use Swap Cleric
to Link Summon,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.137
my Dragon loses
500 attack points,

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.305
but I get to draw a card.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.940
Like this!

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.575
And my Dragon has
an ability of its own!

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.911
Since Security Dragon
is co-linked

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.580
with another Link Monster,

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:49.649
I can return any of your
monsters back to your hand.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:53.920
So your Flash Charge Dragon
leaves the field!

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.089
(growling)

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.626
Laterz.
Don't forget to write.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.929
Hm. You go and make
one or two decent moves

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.432
and you think you've turned
this duel around?

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.234
Don't kid yourself,
Playmaker.

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:08.702
(gasps)

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:11.839
My Flash Charge Dragon lets me
offer up a different monster

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.541
to negate Security Dragon's
special ability.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.978
So my weaker Blast Powder Dragon
takes the fall

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:22.249
instead of my more powerful
Flash Charge Dragon!

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.419
(sighs)
Well, that shishes our kebobs.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.054
He's got the stronger monster

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:30.424
while our life points don't even
crack a thousand.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.893
Huh, you can use your Skill!

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.728
But that means
you gotta fly

00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:37.765
straight into that trash tornado
which is way too dangerous.

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.267
Oh, I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:44.037
Please, Playmaker, cut it out
before we get cut up!

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.073
Do you have
a better option?

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:47.975
Um, just give me a second.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:49.176
And don't you sense it?

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:50.911
The more intense
the storm,

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:53.681
the stronger the monster
that lives inside.

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.317
What crazy told you that?

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:59.520
It doesn't matter
if the monster has
a quadrillion attack points

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.755
if you can't get to it!

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.256
(grunts)

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.759
Then it's a good thing that
I don't share your opinion.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:06.826
(whimpers)

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:13.267
I would have preferred to defeat
you with my own hands.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.435
But alas, farewell.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.139
This is it!

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.741
Go, Storm Access!

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.710
(painful grunting)

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.778
Ahh...

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:27.647
Playmaker!
Oh-ho, no!

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:29.049
No!

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:33.587
(painful screaming)

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.795
(painful screaming)

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.133
(grunting)

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:47.467
Gotcha, Playmaker!

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:49.870
Wha...? Ai...?

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.572
Allow me
to give you a hand!

00:07:51.605 --> 00:07:53.273
Heh-heh-heh.
Get it?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.775
I know what
you wanna say--

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:58.445
Thank you, <i>danke, obrigado,
grazie, merci, arigato,</i>

00:07:58.545 --> 00:07:59.880
less than three.

00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:03.851
But in whatever language,
you are welcome!

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.019
Alley-oop!

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:11.792
You said that you couldn't
leave the Duel Disk.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.560
I never said that.
You did.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.730
Or did I?
Eh, I say a lot of things.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.699
And I'm saying now that I can
boost your board!

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.675
I can also form a shield,

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.310
but a limited one,
so try not bumping into stuff.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:32.145
It stings when rocks bam my bod.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.514
I can't make
any promises, Ai.

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:37.017
(groans)
Can't or won't?

00:08:37.117 --> 00:08:39.452
Fine, I'm ready
so step on the gas!

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.356
(Ai)
Ow! Ow ow!

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.324
Ow ow ow owowowowow!

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.692
Step off the gas!

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:48.028
Step off the gas!
Please!

00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:50.231
You're fine.
I activate my Skill.

00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:51.898
Storm Access!

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:57.337
(painful grunting)

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:05.245
(Ai)
Seize the wind, Playmaker.

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:13.887
Oh, I didn't tell ya,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.756
this shield uses up
all my energy.

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:16.957
See ya later, meatbag.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.425
Wait, what?

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.896
The Ignis saved me the trouble
of destroying it.

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:26.099
But not from me
destroying you.

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:30.837
I create the ultimate circuit!

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:35.175
Get ready, Varis!

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.712
The summoning conditions require
at least two Effect Monsters,

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:42.950
so now I set my Link Disciple
and my Security Dragon

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.584
in the Link Arrows!

00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:49.356
I Link Summon...

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.230
...Link 3, Transcode Talker!

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.133
(roaring)

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.608
So... that's the new monster
you drew from the storm.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.910
And the one that'll end you!

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.746
I activate
Transcode Talker's ability,

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.582
allowing me to now resurrect
another Code Talker

00:10:15.616 --> 00:10:17.384
from my graveyard!

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:20.587
Specifically,
Decode Talker!

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:27.194
And Decode Talker gains
500 additional attack points

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.563
for every monster it happens
to be linked to!

00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:32.533
Power Integration!

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.935
And this is only the beginning
of my combo.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:38.338
When my two Talkers are
co-linked to each other,

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:42.909
Transcode infuses both of them
with 500 extra attack points!

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:45.579
But their strength still
hasn't been maxed out!

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.881
I activate Cynet Storm!

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:50.250
Thanks to this Field Spell,

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:54.788
all linked monsters gain
500 attack and defense points!

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.758
Now, both my Decode
and Transcode Talker

00:10:57.858 --> 00:10:59.960
are more powerful than yours!

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.162
And now Decode Talker,

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.965
attack and destroy
Flash Charge Dragon!

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.668
Decode Destruction!

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.248
You have nothing left
to protect you!

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:24.652
With this final attack,
you're finished!

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:28.688
And I've been waiting to do this
for over a decade of my life!

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.333
(roaring)

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:41.936
Game over, Varis.

00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:44.638
Your reign of tyranny
is coming to a close!

00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:55.282
Transcode Talker, attack
and finish off this duel!

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:00.321
You'll finish nothing!

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:03.056
I summon Chobham Armor Dragon!

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:06.726
But how?!

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:08.395
Because your
Transcode Talker

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.230
attacked my life points
directly,

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.667
I am now allowed to summon
this monster in attack mode.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.835
So what?

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.304
Your monster has a total
of zero attack points.

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:19.573
I can't believe
you said that!

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:22.543
Has the loss of your Ignis
affected your mind?

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:24.210
Because you of all people know

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:25.913
that attack points
aren't everything!

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:29.050
My Chobham Armor Dragon
not only can't be destroyed

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:30.550
in battle this turn,

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.253
but it also cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.228
You actually survived.

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:44.231
You aren't the only one
who wants to win this duel.

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:47.401
All I can do is
end my turn.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.502
Aww, you sound so sad.

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.004
It's my turn.

00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:52.372
I draw!

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:55.742
(groans)
My aching gigabytes!

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:58.078
Boy, I really thought
I bit the big one.

00:12:58.178 --> 00:13:00.047
(gasps)

00:13:00.147 --> 00:13:02.415
So you didn't go
and destroy yourself?

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.784
W-What?
Why'd you think that?

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:07.120
Ohh, 'cause I said,
"See you later"?

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.089
Well, now is later.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.757
I just needed time
to regenerate.

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:15.129
But I'm back like a vertebrate
to see us get a victory!

00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:18.499
Hm, don't you mean to see you
get vanquished?

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:21.101
Because you set me up
to activate my Skill.

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.936
True.
But I can't win

00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:25.271
unless I am willing
to take a few risks.

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:28.709
Speaking of risks, if you want
to dive into the Data Storm

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:31.245
to retrieve a monster
like Playmaker, go for it!

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.113
You're only gonna
fail, fail, fail

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.282
'cause you don't have me
to protect you.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.784
You'll crack your cranium
like crunchy crackers!

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:39.719
We shall see.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.831
Storm Access.

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:54.568
The Data Storm's much denser
than I expected.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:58.773
But there isn't anything that
Playmaker can do that I cannot!

00:13:58.873 --> 00:14:00.540
(groaning)

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.349
He couldn't break through.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:10.517
Hate to say
I told ya so,

00:14:10.617 --> 00:14:12.552
but told ya, told ya,
told ya, told ya!

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.188
That was just a fluke.

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:17.524
I know I can break through
those winds!

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.394
He's going to try it again?

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:22.896
If at first
you don't succeed,

00:14:22.997 --> 00:14:24.031
just keep failin'!

00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:25.699
Ahh...

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:29.936
No way.

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:31.838
Why is everything frozen?

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.809
(Ai)
Um, did the server crash?

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:39.279
It's still windy over here,
but it's paused over there.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.014
It's called
the Doppler effect.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:42.716
Um, if you say so, boss.

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:44.451
Aww, man, what's happening?

00:14:46.387 --> 00:14:47.454
(Kogami)
Roken...

00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.356
Father, is that you?

00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:04.571
It's him!

00:15:04.604 --> 00:15:08.041
That's Dr. Kogami!
How is that even possible?

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:12.046
Father, you shouldn't
have come.

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:14.581
You know how much
it takes out of you.

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:16.116
Come on, now.

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:18.084
It's not the child's
responsibility

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:20.253
to worry about
their parents, Roken.

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:21.788
No.

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:25.359
It's the duty of the parent
to worry about their child.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.861
So how could I rest
on the sidelines

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.897
when you are here risking
your very existence

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.198
in this duel?

00:15:31.265 --> 00:15:32.933
How could I do nothing

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.436
when you're here
to fix my mistakes,

00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:37.604
my error of creating
the Ignis?

00:15:37.704 --> 00:15:40.741
So, to win this duel
and fulfill our mission,

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:43.243
whatever energy
I have is yours

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.078
to wield as you see fit.

00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:47.581
I don't need your strength.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.550
Says the boy
with a missing arm.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.586
Your avatar has clearly seen
better days.

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.522
Don't let your ego
get in the way, Roken.

00:15:55.589 --> 00:15:57.291
But if you go
through with this,

00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.460
you may fade from existence.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.128
Maybe so.

00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:04.765
But if the Ignis win, no one
in the world will survive.

00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:07.901
And I simply cannot allow
that to happen.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.478
Dear, Father.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:21.081
(gasps)

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:23.583
The Stardust Road.

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.255
The Stardust Road
is such a rare event

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:30.790
that I've only seen it
once before...

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.126
with my father.

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:35.095
He said those lucky enough
to witness it

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.832
would find that destiny would
light their path to prosperity.

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:40.834
Guess they found
the unpause button!

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.002
Whoa!

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:49.409
Thank you, Father.

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.812
For opening the path
to victory!

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.149
Storm Access!

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:56.583
Ahh...

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.891
(Varis)
Storm Access!

00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:05.158
Ahh...

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.737
Let's get back
to the duel.

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.644
That's a pretty
big watch.

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.012
Too bad we're gonna be
the one's

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.179
doin' all the clockin'!

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.515
So quick to quip,

00:17:27.548 --> 00:17:29.683
but there's nothing
you can do to win this duel.

00:17:29.717 --> 00:17:31.718
You're not the first
to say that.

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:33.654
Then I'll be the first one...

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.155
to make it stick!

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:38.225
I activate my spell
Link Recovery

00:17:38.258 --> 00:17:41.028
to revive a Link Monster
back from my graveyard!

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.029
Flash Charge Dragon!

00:17:47.101 --> 00:17:49.536
Then if Flash Charge Dragon
has more links

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.806
than the number
of monsters on your field,

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:55.008
you get to draw a card equal
to the difference.

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:57.878
Flash Charge Dragon is Link 3

00:17:57.978 --> 00:18:00.213
and you have two monsters
on your field.

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:04.417
Therefore, you get to draw
one card to your hand.

00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:06.253
You're welcome.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:08.055
But while you got a card,

00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:11.258
I got the monster I need
to manifest my circuit!

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:13.393
Like this!
Ahh!

00:18:15.963 --> 00:18:17.831
You ready, Playmaker?

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:21.568
The summoning conditions require
at least two Effect Monsters.

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:23.704
So I set Chobham Armor Dragon

00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:26.940
and Flash Charge Dragon
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:26.974 --> 00:18:28.742
Link the circuit!

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:32.779
Aww, glitch!

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:34.048
It's gonna be
the new monster

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.949
he drew out
of the Data Storm!

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:39.386
(Varis)
I Link Summon!

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:40.621
Link 4!

00:18:40.654 --> 00:18:43.123
Topologic Gumblar Dragon!

00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:49.129
(roaring)

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:00.440
Ah, that's what
I call not good.

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:04.711
(beeping)

00:19:06.213 --> 00:19:09.116
Since I used Chobham Armor
Dragon to Link Summon,

00:19:09.183 --> 00:19:11.685
we each can select
one monster in our graveyards

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:13.353
and return them to our hands.

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:17.291
I add Spin-Headed Behemoth
to my hand.

00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:18.625
And you?

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:22.062
I retrieve my Backup Secretary
from my graveyard.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.897
(beeping, chirping)

00:19:25.532 --> 00:19:28.102
Eh, I never thought I'd have
more important matters

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.004
to attend to than this duel.

00:19:30.037 --> 00:19:31.037
Say what?

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.206
So I must end this duel now!

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:37.611
I summon Drop Draco next to
Topologic Gumblar Dragon's link,

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:40.447
triggering its special ability
to activate!

00:19:42.482 --> 00:19:45.352
All cards in both our hands
are destroyed!

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.223
Infinite Destruction!

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:56.530
For every card that was sent
to the graveyard,

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.367
Drop Draco's special ability
deals 300 points of damage

00:20:00.401 --> 00:20:01.702
to both of us!

00:20:01.802 --> 00:20:03.838
Since I lost one
and you lost two,

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:08.109
that's a total of 900 points of
damage to both our life points!

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:09.810
But we don't have 900!

00:20:09.844 --> 00:20:12.712
And Varis doesn't have
900 life points either!

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:16.950
(screaming)

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:20.153
(painful groaning)

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:26.226
This duel ends in a tie?

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:29.195
That means the Tower's gonna
keep sucking up everything!

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:31.565
Including Yusaku!

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:38.305
♪♪♪
