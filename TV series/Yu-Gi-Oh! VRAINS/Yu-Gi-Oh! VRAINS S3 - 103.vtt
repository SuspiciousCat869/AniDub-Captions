WEBVTT

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.638
We're back in LINK VRAINS.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:05.672
The real one.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:07.274
Yes Ai,

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.577
but there's still
much work to do.

00:00:09.677 --> 00:00:11.344
(Ai)
Yeah, a lot of work...

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:15.282
And it's gonna be harder now
that all our friends are gone...

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.318
Kolter, Soulburner,
Blue Maiden...

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.355
Flame, Aqua, Earth,

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.523
Windy, even Lightning...

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:24.858
They're all gone.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.661
Why doesn't it feel
like we won?

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.297
What happened to the happily
ever after part?

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.031
(gasps)

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:37.938
(moaning)

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.406
Ai!

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:49.683
♪♪♪

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:41.669
Ai!

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:42.903
(Ai)
Look, Playmaker!

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:44.404
They're waking up!

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:45.806
(moaning)

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:46.907
What happened?

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:48.909
How long was I out?

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.510
My head is killing me.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.879
How can this be?

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.081
Bohman must've
restored their data.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:58.753
(moans)

00:01:58.886 --> 00:01:59.853
Soulburner!

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.055
Playmaker?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.625
I really really hope
that's really really you.

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:07.795
Cuz if so,

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:09.596
that means we won
the war!

00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:19.573
Well, Playmaker,
you succeeded.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:24.979
Hey, Boss!
Check it out!

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.280
It sure does look
like LINK VRAINS

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.149
is all back to normal!

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:31.251
That means Playmaker
must've won.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:32.886
Course he did...

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:34.954
you saw it!

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.591
But if ya didn't that means
we might not have any footage!

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.160
Yeah. And no paycheck.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:41.562
Right,

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:42.796
and no paycheck

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.498
which I shoulda seen coming
since your eyes were shut!

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:48.635
(gasps)

00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:51.972
(sighs)

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.483
Skye! You're okay!

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.719
Yeah and it looks
like you are too.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.022
Bohman decided to let
all of you go free.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.458
But why would
he do that?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.727
I'm sure he had his reasons,

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.996
and I'm kinda worried
we're gonna find out why.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.873
(Blue Maiden)
The other LINK VRAINS
is vanishing.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.209
That means the war
really is over.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.612
Yeah...

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.648
I wish all of us could've
celebrated it together.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.515
(grunts)

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.886
Yeah... Me too.

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:55.936
Two hot dog sandwiches
and a coffee please.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.371
That's quite the combo.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:01.108
So, you're still working
the grill here, Yusaku?

00:04:01.675 --> 00:04:03.244
Yea I'm just filling
in for a bit

00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:05.946
while the owner's visiting
his brother at the hospital.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.414
I was just there.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:08.448
I was visiting
a friend

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.951
who's been asleep
for a very long time.

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.020
But thankfully,
she's all better now.

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:18.525
(Man)
SOL Technologies
brings you the future

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:19.626
with SOLtiS:

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.262
the world's first android
made just for you!

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.632
For the office, at play,

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:25.933
or even at home,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.068
SOLtiS will take care
of your every need!

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.103
Hey,

00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.104
maybe it can grill
your dogs for ya.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.907
But you might be
out of a job then.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.943
At least you wouldn't
have to sweat away

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:37.377
at the grill all day!

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.545
But I like
grilling.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.281
Thank you!
See ya around!

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.458
She still doesn't know
you're the Playmaker

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:53.127
who's saved her
life a buncha times?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.428
Does she really
need to, Theodore?

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.230
Hey, I get it.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:59.467
You're just playing it cool.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.435
I do like your style, Yusaku.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.136
And speakin' of style,

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:05.973
I left my wallet
in my other hoodie so...

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.976
This cup's for free.
Kolter's got it.

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:10.010
Ah?

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:12.012
He said it's the least
he could do...

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:14.481
for helping save his
and his brother's life.

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:15.783
You're right.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.585
It is the least he could do.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:19.185
But I'll take it with a smile!

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.789
Where is he?
Hangin' out with Jin?

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:24.357
Yeah.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.492
And Ai?

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:28.161
He isn't around here either.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.298
And Roboppi hasn't
been functioning at all.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.001
Oh man that stinks,
Yusaku.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.671
Without having Ai
and Roboppi around

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.141
it must be really
quiet at home.

00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.175
I never would've
thought

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.943
that I'd actually miss
all of their noise.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.845
But Ai told me he needed
some time alone to think.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.349
And after losing his friends,

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:49.950
I don't blame him one bit.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.186
I know how he feels.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.489
I still can't believe
Flame's gone.

00:05:57.091 --> 00:05:58.091
I'm sorry.

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.195
Hey man, I didn't mean
to bum you out.

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:02.830
I mean, I'm sad
and everything

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.331
but you wanna
know something?

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.200
I'd rather be sad

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:08.735
then never have gotten
a chance to know him.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.706
And who woulda thought
we'd be best buds.

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.576
After the way things
started between us.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.345
I don't know
if I was more shocked

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:19.512
or more scared that day.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:20.914
(gasps)

00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:21.749
(Flame)
It's about time you dug

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.717
your Duel Disk
out of your closet.

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.053
I was starting to worry
you never would.

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:27.088
(gasps)

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.323
We can finally talk face to fa

00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:30.757
(screams)

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.426
This is no way to treat a guest!

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:33.693
(screams)

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.829
I knew it!

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:37.564
I totally knew I wasn't
hearing or seeing things!

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.033
You sir are a ghost!

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.268
(Flame)
Ghosts are not real, Theodore.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.870
Now, if we can
discuss this calmly--

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.339
Ahhhhhh!

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:47.975
If you crush me

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:50.410
you'll never know why you
were in the Lost Incident!

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:51.911
(gasps)

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:55.082
Now if you would please
put down that trunk,

00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:56.816
I would feel safer.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:00.788
All right!
I won!

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:01.988
I did it!

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.323
(Flame)
I knew you would.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.926
Because I saw
a fire in your eyes

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.828
that could never
be extinguished.

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:09.463
Oh you did, huh?

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:10.430
Uh...

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.098
What was your name again?

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:13.300
(Flame)
Oh how rude.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.036
I never introduced
myself.

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:17.538
I'm Flame.
F-L-A-M-E.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:19.640
The F stands for Formidable.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.775
The L is for Lively.
The A is--

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.277
Whoa, c'mon
slow down there, Flame!

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.578
You don't have to go

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.214
and tell me
what your name means.

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:28.415
Wha-?

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.116
You don't like it?

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.618
Fine, go on.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:33.553
The A is for Awesome...

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.323
When we first met,

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.292
I couldn't wait
to get rid of him.

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:40.227
But now, what I wouldn't
give for just

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:41.895
one more moment
with him.

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:42.997
Sure.

00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:44.898
Thinking back
on the whole thing,

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:46.333
so much has changed.

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:47.968
I mean, who woulda ever thought

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.203
that we'd would work together

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:51.771
with the Knights of Hanoi
after everything they did?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.140
Varis,

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:56.309
why did you reach out
and call us here?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.579
I called you here
for a simple reason:

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.115
I request your assistance.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:03.717
(Ghost Gal)
Hold on a sec.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.186
The Varis is asking us for help?

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:07.955
(Varis)
Why would that surprise you?

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.823
Though we are on opposite sides,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.392
we do have the same goal,

00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:13.694
which is to defeat
the Light Ignis.

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:17.063
Therefore our interests
are quite aligned.

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:18.999
So if you help me,

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.901
you're helping
yourselves as well.

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:23.203
So long story short,

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.140
the big bad Varis is scared
of the teeny tiny Lightning!

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:28.975
You can believe
whatever you want

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:32.145
because what an Ignis thinks
is no concern of mine.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.714
(Soulburner)
I'll never team up
with you, Varis!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.519
After everything
you did to ruin my life?

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.355
If it wasn't
for your Lost Incident,

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:43.790
my parents would still be
a part of my life!

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.160
Soulburner.

00:08:46.227 --> 00:08:47.461
(Soulburner)
Sorry everyone

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.798
but this is one of those times
when I gotta do what I gotta do!

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.300
Or my soul will never
be at rest.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.635
I'm about to take you down!

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.203
Kay.

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:58.638
I'll attack and--

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.440
(grunts)

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.111
(screaming)

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:08.748
(screaming)

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.755
Soulburner, are you ok?

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:17.758
I couldn't do it.

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.859
Even if I won the duel this way,

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:23.597
what.. what would it actually
get me in the end?

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.399
Listen, Soulburner,

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.601
I'm not going to ask
for your forgiveness

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:30.271
because, frankly, I've done
absolutely nothing wrong.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.340
But this isn't the time
to argue that point

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.542
because what we need
to do is work together

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:36.943
to defeat the Light Ignis.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.280
And after that task is done

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.015
we'll make time to settle
our differences.

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:43.016
Fine then.

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:45.786
You know, if it
wasn't for Varis,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.555
we wouldn't have
learned all the secrets

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.356
that Lightning
was hiding from us.

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:52.259
(Playmaker)
Now I understand
why Bohman's deck

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.294
kept getting stronger
with every meeting.

00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:56.430
Because you two were
working together,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.799
and you were supplying
him with new cards.

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.301
Like JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:02.769
What?
JUDGEMENT ARROWS?

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:06.740
You mean the card that was used
to destroy the Cyberse?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.741
That means...

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:09.776
the one who destroyed
the Cyberse was...

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:10.744
Lightning?

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:14.414
(Flame)
What would possess you
to do such a terrible thing?

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:15.949
(Lightning)
You're getting too emotional

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:17.951
so you're not
thinking rationally.

00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:20.454
As the leader of the Ignis,

00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:22.689
I'm the one tasked
with making the tough,

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.392
if not unpopular,
decisions.

00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:28.395
Now, I don't expect you
to fully understand--

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.598
You're right, Lightning.
I don't!

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:33.634
But it was the most logically
sound decision.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.603
I don't think you know
what logically means!

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:39.773
(Lightning)
Then I guess I must
spell it out for you.

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:43.711
The humans were going
to destroy the Cyberse anyway.

00:10:43.944 --> 00:10:46.947
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.615
but it was inevitable.

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:52.018
All I did was
speed up the timeline.

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:53.753
(gasping)

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.790
So what haven't you
told us yet, Varis?

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:58.291
(Ai)
Yes, spill it, Varis!

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.994
As I said earlier,

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:03.797
there were two
key differences...

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:07.300
between the simulations
that my father ran

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.670
and that which
the Light Ignis ran.

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:13.340
After both running millions,
billions of simulations,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.843
paths branching
into other paths,

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.979
the second difference proved
to be the most interesting.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.282
(grunting)

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:22.649
There was a difference

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:25.819
in how they each chose
to run their simulations.

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:27.454
When my father ran his,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.857
he grouped all six Ignis
together as one entity.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.927
Which was a natural thing to do
since he naturally expected

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.430
all the Ignis to work
together as one.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.598
And the result showed

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.267
that humans and the Ignis
could not coexist.

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:43.637
But when the Light Ignis
ran its simulation

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.507
it treated the six Ignis
as separate individuals,

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:49.076
running separate simulations
for each of the six.

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:52.646
And the Light Ignis discovered
something it did not expect.

00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:55.849
That the humans could
coexist with the Ignis.

00:11:56.283 --> 00:11:56.850
What?

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.318
Hold the marmalade.

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:01.021
Lightning's simulations
said we can coexist?

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:03.424
Then why does it also
say we can't coexist?

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:04.892
Huh? Huh?

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:07.895
Well no, not with all
of the Ignis.

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:11.765
Humans could coexist
with 5 of the 6 Ignis.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:14.868
But when the sixth Ignis
is added to the simulation,

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.570
it all falls apart.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.741
This single Ignis is why humans
and Ignis cannot coexist.

00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:24.044
Because it is the very source
of all our conflict.

00:12:24.144 --> 00:12:26.747
And that's the secret
the Light Ignis was hiding.

00:12:27.148 --> 00:12:30.350
Because this sixth Ignis
is the Light Ignis!

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:38.692
When Lightning initiated
his war against humanity,

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:42.596
he decided to create his own
AI army to take us on.

00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:44.731
Yeah, no kidding.

00:12:44.832 --> 00:12:46.767
And he didn't
just create any army.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.838
He built the most powerful
AI duelist anyone's ever faced.

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:52.073
Yes, he did.

00:12:52.707 --> 00:12:55.242
Bohman would evolve
after every duel.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.244
Now, Playmaker...

00:12:57.377 --> 00:12:58.679
I'm going to play a card

00:12:58.746 --> 00:13:01.248
that you have never
witnessed before.

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:02.616
Huh?

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:03.817
What card's that?

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:05.919
It's a new type of spell!

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:07.054
A Link Spell!

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:08.488
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:11.491
Take this, Playmaker!

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:13.994
(growl)

00:13:17.497 --> 00:13:18.331
(grunts)

00:13:21.268 --> 00:13:22.569
C'mon, get up!

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:24.271
That pillar broke
your fall!

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.473
(grunts)

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:28.209
How did Bohman's dueling get
so much better so quickly?

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.443
So Bohman, If I am correct,

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:33.080
Lightning created you
to serve him and do his bidding?

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:34.448
That's right.

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:37.550
But know that I am an AI
that's superior to the Ignis.

00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.888
When all Ignis fall
in line before me,

00:13:40.988 --> 00:13:43.890
then the other inferior
creatures will as well.

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.796
Because I am the vessel

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:52.666
that will once again
unite the Ignis as one.

00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.872
I've said before that
LINK VRAINS and I are one.

00:13:57.972 --> 00:14:01.208
Therefore, so is everyone
within LINK VRAINS.

00:14:01.308 --> 00:14:02.709
My Neuron Link
allows me

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.845
to tap into their
mental energies

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:05.980
like batteries.

00:14:06.714 --> 00:14:10.317
So that's how you were able
to create a Data Storm that big?

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:11.885
Wow, you must've tapped

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:14.187
into a ginormous
number of noggins!

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:15.789
That's correct.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:19.226
,One individual is not capable
of generating much energy,

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:22.196
but when there's a source
with millions of minds

00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:23.730
that I can tap into,

00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:25.866
that Data Storm is
only the beginning

00:14:25.966 --> 00:14:27.300
of what I can achieve.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.539
Now you will experience

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:34.040
the true and terrible extent...

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:36.543
of my power!

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.781
Can you imagine what the
world would be like

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.148
if Bohman won?

00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:43.450
Huh.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.884
You wouldn't have
to imagine it,

00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.987
because you wouldn't
actually exist.

00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:49.389
I guess that's technically true

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:52.392
because Bohman was gonna
go and erase all of us.

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:56.330
He truly believed that humans
and AIs couldn't coexist.

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:58.365
Because our two groups are just

00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:00.700
too distinctly different
from one another.

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.537
And that, Theodore,
is where we and Bohman

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:04.938
disagree with each other.

00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:07.507
At the core we're
not so different.

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:09.943
We both just want
to exist in peace.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.346
Besides, our differences
shouldn't separate us,

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:14.115
they should bring us together.

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:15.749
Hey, who would have thought

00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:17.951
that you were such
a philosophiser.

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.953
I know, you should
probably write a book

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.721
and you can call it
maybe something like

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:24.624
Deep Thoughts with Playmaker,
or Playmaker's Playosophy.

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:26.960
Whatever you call it,
I know

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.630
that in the end humans
and AIs can both coexist.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.399
Because you
and Flame were proof.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:34.568
You two were
perfect partners.

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:36.203
(Theodore)
Heh, thanks.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.939
The war may have highlighted
the struggles we face

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.441
to overcome our differences,

00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.544
but if Flame and I can
work thru them, we all can.

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:45.346
(Roken)
Is that the lesson you learned?

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.614
Because that's the wrong
conclusion to make.

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.615
(gasps)

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.617
Varis!

00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:54.121
Varis!

00:15:54.922 --> 00:15:57.290
I can't believe he rolls up
the sleeves of his sportscoat?

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.692
That's just
the worst.

00:15:59.293 --> 00:16:02.262
Please, it's Roken
out here in the real world.

00:16:02.363 --> 00:16:04.030
Yusaku and Theodore.

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:06.967
You two have fallen
into the same delusion

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.569
as the rest of the fools
you see around you.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.671
They've already
forgotten humanity

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.507
was on the verge
of extinction,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.977
that the peace they see
around them is a momentary one.

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:19.279
The Ignis threat
may be over,

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:21.515
but AIs continue
to exist.

00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:24.117
So as these people
lounge around,

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:25.786
taking their selfies,

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:28.522
AIs continue
to evolve and improve.

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.658
And they will prove
to be a bigger threat

00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:32.359
than the Ignis
ever have.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:35.162
That's why the Hanoi
remain ever vigilant.

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:37.164
Because another war
is coming

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.366
and nothing about our fight
against the Ignis

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.435
has changed my mind one bit.

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:42.903
You're wrong.

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:44.504
And why's that?

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:48.308
Because you two worked together
so well with a handful of Ignis?

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:49.576
And conveniently forget

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.512
the thousands of other
AIs trying to destroy us?

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.482
Can you say
with 100% crtainty

00:16:55.582 --> 00:16:57.984
that your Dark Ignis
will never turn against you?

00:16:58.485 --> 00:16:59.319
I can.

00:16:59.953 --> 00:17:01.721
I trust Ai completely.

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:03.556
Time and time again,

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:05.759
he was willing to risk
his life for me.

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:10.096
(grunts)

00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:11.898
Gotcha, Playmaker!

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:14.201
Wha-? Ai?

00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:15.669
(Ai)
Allow me to give you a hand!

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.504
(laughs)
Get it?

00:17:17.571 --> 00:17:18.805
I know what you wanna say:

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.874
Thank you, danke, obrigado,

00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:24.245
grazie, merci, arigato,
less than three.

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:25.813
But in whatever language,

00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:28.081
you are welcome!

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:30.150
Alley-oop!

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:36.189
You said that you couldn't
leave the Duel Disk.

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:37.257
(Ai)
I never said that.

00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:39.159
You did. Or did I?

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.894
Eh, I say a lot of things.

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:43.563
And I'm saying now
that I can boost your board!

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.033
Oh.

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:52.540
I can also form a shield,
but a limited one,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.074
so try not bumping into stuff.

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.644
It stings when rocks bam my bod.

00:17:56.744 --> 00:17:58.879
I can't make any promises, Ai.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:01.114
(Ai grunts)
Can't or won't?

00:18:01.648 --> 00:18:04.217
Fine, I'm ready,
so step on the gas!

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:06.920
Ow! Ow ow!

00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:09.056
Ow ow ow owowowowow!

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:11.491
Step off the gas!
Step off the gassss!!!

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:12.225
Please.

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:12.893
(Playmaker)
You're fine.

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:16.763
You'd give up your own existence
for these humans?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.233
Ai, you don't need
to do this!

00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:21.401
I know I don't need to.

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:22.703
I want to.

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:25.939
Besides, you gotta win
this duel for everybody,

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:29.075
and that won't happen if Bohman
gets his Neuron Link back.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:30.810
I'll stop you!

00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:32.646
Stay away!

00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:36.416
Remember, Playmaker,

00:18:36.483 --> 00:18:38.619
this isn't
just our duel anymore.

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:40.787
It's Kolter's duel too!

00:18:40.888 --> 00:18:42.556
And Soulburner's!

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:46.326
And Blue Maiden's...
Zaizen's... and Gore Gal's!

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:49.596
Even Varis and Spectre's!

00:18:51.498 --> 00:18:52.399
(grunts)

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:54.000
Come back!

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:56.036
This duel is for everybody

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:57.971
who fell so we could
make it here!

00:18:58.371 --> 00:18:59.540
(grunts)

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:03.376
And I'm not forgetting Flame,
Aqua and Earth too!

00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:05.646
Or Windy and Lightning!

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:06.680
(grunts)

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.482
'Cuz even though it wasn't
what we pictured,

00:19:08.548 --> 00:19:10.050
they wanted peace too.

00:19:10.183 --> 00:19:12.019
So if we're all gonna
win this together,

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:13.387
I gotta do my part,

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:16.056
even if I gotta leave
a few parts o' me behind!

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:18.358
And after all this is over,

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.960
if you wanna build
a statue of me,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.662
I'm not gonna say no.

00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:24.230
So just win this duel.

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:25.532
Later, Playmaker.

00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:31.538
(Playmaker)
Ai!

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.542
Ai may be the last
Ignis remaining,

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.678
but know that I will do
whatever it takes

00:19:37.778 --> 00:19:40.447
to make sure the Ignis
do not go extinct.

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.048
That's right, pal.

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:43.784
(Roken)
What a joke.

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:45.452
But you were always a joke.

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.355
Now that the war
against the Ignis is over,

00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:50.824
there's no longer any need
for us to team up.

00:19:51.224 --> 00:19:54.161
If you get in the way
of my fight against the AIs,

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.329
I'll make sure you regret it.

00:19:58.199 --> 00:19:59.232
Really now?

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.835
You think we'll back down
just cuz you threaten us?

00:20:01.935 --> 00:20:03.204
It's not
a threat.

00:20:03.304 --> 00:20:04.538
It's a promise.

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:06.540
(grunts)
