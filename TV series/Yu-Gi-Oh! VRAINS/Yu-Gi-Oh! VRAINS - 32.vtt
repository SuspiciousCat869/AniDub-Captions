your presence?

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:30.978
I promise
this isn't a trap!

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.315
Not that I'm saying you're not
smart enough to detect a trap.

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.817
You most certainly are to elude
arrest for so long--

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:38.552

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:47.161
You requested to see
the leader of the Hanoi,

00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:48.628
so here I am.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:50.363
(Kitamura)
This is your chance, Kity.

00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:52.166
(clearing throat)

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.668
Your Excellency,
may I start out

00:08:54.735 --> 00:08:56.637
by saying
it's a privilege--
What do you want?

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.439
Or I'll erase you
from existence.

00:08:58.472 --> 00:08:59.639
Right to the point.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:00.774
I respect that.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.842
Let me not waste
your time

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:04.011
because time
is not to be wasting.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.245
I propose a proposal

00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:07.414
that I do think will prove
mutually beneficial

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.417
to both me
and you both.

00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:10.417
Which is?

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:12.553
Before I say,
let's agree to agree

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.254
that this conversation

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:17.191
must be kept strictly
confidential.

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.792
What is it?

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.727
I shall
take that as a "yes."

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.197
I propose the two of us rule
LINK VRAINS together.

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.765
Really?

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:27.267
No doubt you
currently believe

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.502
you would have
little to gain

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.704
from such an arrangement.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.674
After all, you're in complete
control of LINK VRAINS

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:35.543
and seem
to hold all the power.

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.044
Consider this, however.

00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.113
Sol Tech will not
allow you to destroy

00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:41.748
their greatest asset without
putting up a fight.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.784
But you see,
as the Security Chief

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:45.252
I have the ability
to disable

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.021
all of their
countermeasures,

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.723
giving you a clear
path to victory.

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.091
But that piece
of mind only comes

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.694
if you agree to share
the power with me.

00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:55.196
I see.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:56.797
Let's do it.

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:58.732
(Kitamura)
Excellent, Kity.

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.967
But... before I agree,

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:03.537
I need to test if you're
worthy of ruling with me.

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:04.839
Hmm?

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.207
Good luck.

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:07.341
Wait!

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:08.909

Nice to meet you.

00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:18.719
Uh, likewise?

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:19.853
I have been given the honor

00:10:19.886 --> 00:10:22.055
of testing
your abilities...

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:24.057
in a Master Duel!

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:26.192
But I'm no duelist!

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:32.065
This place is as empty
as my bank account.

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.800
Yeah.

00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.603
Why's no one here?

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:37.938
Word on the web
is they got erased.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.540
But I figured you'd panic
if I told ya

00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:41.041
so I kept it mum.

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:43.210
Because panicking would be
the correct reaction!

00:10:43.244 --> 00:10:44.210
Squawk!

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:45.346

flee from trouble;

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:48.949
they swoop into it!

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:51.885
And, swooping's
natural for a bird.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.920
What?!
No it is not!

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.756
I may look like a pigeon
on the outside,

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:58.225
but inside I have
the heart of a chicken.

00:10:58.292 --> 00:10:59.426
If you ask me,
I think we should

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:01.695

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:03.296

If it was really dangerous

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.272

tell us to evac.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.739
just as much as
anyone in the world.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:40.174
More than anyone.

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.042
And so...
I won't stand by

00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:44.911
and watch the Knights of Hanoi
destroy it.

00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.747
That's what I like to hear.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:48.748
We finally have
something in common

00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:50.217
'cause The Gore's
all about pounding

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:51.852
the Hanoi to a pulp.

00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:54.088
(Ai)
Says the guy
on the losing streak.

00:15:54.188 --> 00:15:55.255
Watch it, 8-bit,

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.124
'cause I can duel
way better than you.

00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.860
Listen, fezzie,
I do have a name, you know.

00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:01.361
It's Ai.

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:03.597
But you can call me
Emperor Ai.

00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:04.798
Or Professor Ai.

00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:06.033
Ai the Brainiac.

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.101
Okay.

00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:08.436
Ai the Egomaniac.

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:09.937
(Ai)
Not what I said!

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.073
As much as I enjoy this
scintillating conversation,

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.342
I must be going for
three reasons.

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:17.344
One: I must stop the tower

00:16:17.444 --> 00:16:19.613
from destroying
the worldwide network.

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.916
Two: I must defeat Varis

00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:24.685
to wrest control of LINK VRAINS
from the Hanoi.

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:27.455
And three:
I must save Ghost Gal

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.356
after she gave up everything
to give me

00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:31.491
a sliver
of chance at success.

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.360
What do you mean,
save Ghost Gal?

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.196
When Ghost Gal battled
and lost against Varis,

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:38.966
her data was absorbed into
the Tower of Hanoi.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.301
Oh no.

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:41.802
Wait.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.171
You're telling me
that if I lose a duel,

00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.573
I'm gonna lose my
soul as well?

00:16:46.607 --> 00:16:49.343
That is exactly
what I am saying, Gore.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:51.278
As the tower devours more
and more data,

00:16:51.345 --> 00:16:53.013
it gains the power
to destroy the world

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:56.150
and consume all of LINK VRAINS
within six hours.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.651
(gasping)
Six hours?

00:16:57.751 --> 00:16:59.252
How is that even
possible?

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:02.489
As much it would be
interesting to explain,

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.357
I don't think explaining
the mechanism

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:07.427
is the most practical
use of the remaining time.

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:10.331
Okay, fine, then just
answer me this:

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.366
How do we
go about stopping it?

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:14.034
By beating Varis.

00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:15.635
So the solution's
simple--

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:17.170
as long as we
can pull it off.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:18.305
Not "we."

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.706
This mission
is mine alone.

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:20.707
Hmm?
Hmm?

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:26.013
Varis and his army will fight
harder than ever before.

00:17:26.046 --> 00:17:27.981
I cannot vouch
for your safety.

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:31.418
I don't need
your vouchin'.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:33.053
Yeah, me neither.

00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:35.022
Besides,
I'd miss all the fun.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.189
And three sets of eyes

00:17:36.256 --> 00:17:38.858
means triple the chance
of finding Varis.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.195
You're the one who said
time's a-wastin', Playmaker.

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:43.330
And this sounds mighty
efficient to me.

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:45.266
That settles it then.

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.334
It looks like
you're stuck with us.

00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:48.902
Do what you want.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.171
(Ai)
That's how he says
"thank you."

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.006
If you do find Varis,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.342
make sure to be
extra careful.

00:17:55.376 --> 00:17:58.245
Ghost Gal warned me
of a powerful new card.

00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:01.649
All right, see you all
when this party's over.

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:03.384
You can count on it.

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.085
(Ai)
Okay, now scram!

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.628
We just saw
the ultimate team-up.

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:15.896
And it was all
caught on film

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.431
by the ultimate
journalist.

00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:18.833
Our boss said no bonus

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:19.900
but he'll change
his tune

00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:21.001

this footage.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.770

Calm down!

What's ruffling all
those feathers now?

00:18:26.106 --> 00:18:28.309
I forgot
to turn on the camera.

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:29.410

As real as reality.

I am so over this.

00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:10.811
As a pro, I learned
that the more trash

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.546
a duelist talks, the more
they're covering up

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:14.648
