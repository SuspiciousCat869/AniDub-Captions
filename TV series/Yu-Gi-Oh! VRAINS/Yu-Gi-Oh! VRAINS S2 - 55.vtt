00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.004
<i>Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...</i>

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:05.672
I've been tracking

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:08.008
and trailing
Bohman's digital signature.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.478
And although I haven't been able
to get an exact location...

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.014
I've been able to narrow
it down to this spot.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.684
That's deep in the LINK
VRAINS's restricted area--

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:17.852
what's he doing there?

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:18.919
Don't know.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.454
But when I combed the area
to see

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.122
if there were
any more clues...

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.992
I found some fragmented bits
and bytes of a strange program.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:27.761
It's an Ignis
algorithm!

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:28.929
Whoa, for real?

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.164
Yes--
of a Wind Ignis.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.166
We need t get to
the restricted area

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.434
as soon as possible.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.503
We may not find
an Ignis or Bohman,

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.238
but I'm sure
we'll find something.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.075
This is the quickest
way to the Restricted Area.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.810
We just have
to get past

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.079
a few security bots
along the way.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.080
Shall we?

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.150
The sooner
we're through this area

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.119
the quicker we can
help my brother.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:53.687
Aye, aye, captain.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.983
(Soulburner)
Heads up, Playmaker!

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.519
Soulburner.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.255
(Ai)
So...

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.224
you actually managed
to get past Gore, huh?

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.160
“Managed ”
is one way to put it.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.827
“Dominated ” is another.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:08.962
(Ai chuckles)

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.266
The portal should be
just up ahead.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.534
Then we'll finally see
what lies beyond the borders

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.535
of LINK VRAINS.

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:17.872
(Ai)
Huh...

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.940
I didn't know
what to expect,

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:22.877
but it's a lot more blue
than I thought it would be.

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:25.779
(Flame)
I'm detecting
an anomaly nearby.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.382
Right... there.

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.884
(Ai)
Oh, you mean the only
non-blue thing

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.053
in this whole place?

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:34.721
Great job.
Whatcha think it is, Playmaker?

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:35.822
Let's find out.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.203
(Blue Gal)
They went in there.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.206
And we're going in too.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.808
But what's beyond that
that portal could be dangerous.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:56.443
(Blue Gal)
You want to turn back?

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:57.744
(Ghost Gal)
I didn't say that.

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.120
Be careful.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.023
Sol Tech already lost one team
and I can't stand to lose you.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:15.395
(Ai)
The good thing about corridors
is you can't get lost.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.964
Except for that one time...

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.832
(Playmaker)
And how did you
manage that?

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:20.300
(Ai)
Like a boss!

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:22.035
(Playmaker gasps)

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:23.770
Are you seeing something?

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:25.872
(Playmaker)
Yes. The exit.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.542
(Ai)
Well it's about ti--

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.709
(Ai shouts)

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.144
(wind whooshing)

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.047
(Soulburner groans)

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.517
(Ai)
I knew this trip
would be a whirlwind!

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.385
(Ai groans loudly)

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.456
I think it would be best
for both of us

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:44.524
if we don't crash
into these walls.

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:45.792
Thanks, bud.

00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:49.563
Blue Gal!

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.897
(groans)

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.133
(screams)

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:54.701
(groans)

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.575
(groans)

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.176
(groans)

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.179
(wind whooshing)

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.584
(Blue Gal screams)

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.118
I'm cutting you loose!

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.053
Go for it!

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.691
(whimpers)

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.199
(both panting)

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.668
You okay?

00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:30.170
Yeah, but let's not
try that again.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.274
Maybe this is why
SOL Tech lost contact

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.675
with their research team.

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.777
It's going to be hard
to track down

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.211
Playmaker in that mess.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.681
Looks like we'll have
to ride out the storm

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:42.950
in this cave
until the winds die down...

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.020
That's assuming of course
they die down at all.

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:47.087
(both gasp)

00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:49.356
(electronic beeping)

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.024
(Blue Gal)
It's a distress beacon

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.592
from Sol Tech's team.

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.962
Well,
good luck to them.

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:55.963
They need our help!

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.730
Wait!

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.298
(sighs) Blue Gal,

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.500
this is why
I hate babysitting!

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.234
Hold on!

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:05.773
I wish I knew
what was going on

00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:07.508
on the other side
of the portal.

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.644
But it's blocking any
signals from getting in or out,

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.079
so I'm as blind
as a bat with a blindfold.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.415
So unless I crack
its algorithm,

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.751
I can't do a thing
to help Playmaker.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.420
But I do love a challenge.

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.589
Time to get crackin'.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.258
Beats sitting around
talking to myself.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:29.930
You meatbags are gonna
get us smashed!

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.199
Leave this to the Ignis!

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.667
Ready, Flame?

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:34.968
Of course.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.404
(both)
Data Storm!

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:41.141
I bet I can keep this up
longer than you.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.276
I agree.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:44.411
You always were
full of hot air.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.914
Using a Data Storm
to keep the winds at bay.

00:05:46.947 --> 00:05:48.348
not such a bad idea.

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:50.818
(Ai)
Is that a...
compliment?

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:53.687
Ooh, my tingles
are tingling!

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:19.746
We're close.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.847
They're around here
somewhere.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.185
So do you see anything?

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:26.887
(Blue Gal)
No, but I know
they're here.

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.988
They've got to be.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.690
Or...
what's left of them.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.027
Look there!

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:39.666
A cave!

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.001
Let's check it out!

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:50.377
(gasps)

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.413
It's gonna be okay--
they're still breathing.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.015
But the portal's
preventing them

00:06:55.015 --> 00:06:57.017
from being able
to log out of here.

00:06:57.017 --> 00:07:00.154
And it's also blocking
their distress beacons.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.988
So no one's coming
for them...

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.257
But I can get them out.

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:06.894
Wait, what are you doing?

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:09.896
That log out program
is meant only for emergencies!

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.597
I know.

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.967
And I would say this fits
the definition to a T.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.402
Ugh, fine.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.571
But you know
there's two of them...

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.640
And you only have
one program.

00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:21.408
Two, including yours.

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.610
And it's mine.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.711
You may be fine

00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.145
getting stuck in
this world

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:25.979
but I'm not.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:27.415
When we're done
with our mission,

00:07:27.415 --> 00:07:29.316
we can tell Akira
to send another team

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:30.717
to rescue these guys.

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:32.486
No, that won't work.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:33.987
By the time
we ‘re able to get back,

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:35.889
it may already be
too late for them.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:38.492
(sighs)

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:41.094
You Zaizens are nothing
but trouble.

00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:51.037
You're the best!

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:51.872
(Ghost Gal)
I know.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.192
(Hayami)
Mr. Zaizen!

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.560
Do you know
the research team

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.728
we sent into the portal?

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.396
They just came back!

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.132
That's great news.

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:21.168
Skye and Emma must have
found them and logged them out.

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:23.003
But that means
they can't log out

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:24.605
if they get into trouble...

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:26.774
Still... Skye--

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.876
It was the correct decision.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.678
I just hope I get
to tell you that in person.

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.781
(Ghost Gal)
Now that we did
our good deed for the day,

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:36.883
can we get back
to our real mission?

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:42.055
If our heroics prevent us
from finding the Ignis

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:43.156
it's all your fault.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.625
I know that.

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.294
But we will.
I just know it!

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.701
(Ai)
I'm... so... drained...

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.837
Flame... You?

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.105
(Flame)
I'm... perfectly... fine.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.040
(Ai)
Liar!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.342
(Playmaker)
This isn't good.

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.243
Just hang in there
for a little longer, bud.

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:04.111
(Flame)
Caaan't...

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.612
(Ai)
I'm... out...

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:13.853
(Ai)
Phew...

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:16.223
The wind's died down.

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:17.858
(Soulburner)
Actually it feels
more like

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.459
someone hit
the off switch.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.261
Stay alert.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:24.197
We don't know what surprises
may be coming up next.

00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:27.200
(Ai)
Speaking of up,
look up there!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.603
(Soulburner)
Someone or something
went through a lot of trouble

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:31.038
to keep us
from getting there.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:32.839
(Ai)
Welp, they failed!

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:47.021
(Ai)
Heh, that looks
like a cardio workout.

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:50.457
Good thing I'm not the one
who has to do all the climbing.

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:56.430
(Soulburner)
Think anyone's here?

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.298
(Playmaker)
Only one way to find out.

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:08.509
Hear that?

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:09.342
(Ai)
Hear what?

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.246
Oh, that!

00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:14.014
(Playmaker shouts)

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:14.848
(Flame whimpers)

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.217
(Monster growls)

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.521
Oh no!
Not that monster!

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:30.263
That monster destroyed
the Cyberse!

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:31.799
The Cyberse!?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:32.699
(Ai)
No!

00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:37.837
(shouting)

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:40.774
(Wind Ignis laughs)

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.075
I gotcha!
Gotcha good!

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.176
You shoulda seen
your faces--

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:45.512
like zero dollars
it was priiiiceless!

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.847
(laughs)

00:10:47.014 --> 00:10:49.183
No way!
You're alive?

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:50.784
Of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.686
Well, we finally
found the Ignis!

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:56.090
(Ai)
So you were the one
whipping up all the storms!

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.691
(Wind Ignis)
With all the trespassers
and hackers

00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:58.859
and blowin' up
of the Cyberse,

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:00.861
you can never be
tooo careful these days.

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.128
Echo, lose the mirage!

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.169
Echo's my servant--

00:11:09.469 --> 00:11:11.071
well not really a servant,
more like a sidekick

00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.406
but yeah,
he does things for me.

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:14.241
Yeah,
like scaring me-

00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:16.176
I-I mean,
scaring Flame.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.145
You even made him cry.

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:19.846
I most certainly did not!

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:21.448
(Wind Ignis)
You most certainly did,

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:23.817
but so did you because I heard
those “Ahhh ” noises in stereo

00:11:23.817 --> 00:11:25.819
meaning that the screams were
coming from two sets of lips,

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:27.354
not one
but two sets of lips.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:30.157
(Flame)
Then you're clearly mistaken
because I don't have lips.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.291
(Wind Ignis)
That's neither here
nor there.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.826
But since you're here,
welcome, welcome.

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:33.994
I see you brought guests.

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:35.462
And no need for introductions,
I know who you are.

00:11:35.462 --> 00:11:36.830
The world-famous Playmaker

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.999
and the not-as-famous-
but-I-think-you're-still-cool

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:39.966
Soulburner.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.268
And you must be
the one known

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:42.469
as the Wind Ignis.

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.837
And you must be correct!

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:46.006
The name's Windy!
Windy, not Windy.

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:47.908
Windy like the air,
not windy like the road.

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.111
And that's Windy with a “Y ”
not an “I ” or a double “E ”

00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:51.478
like a squeegee, but a Y.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:54.915
Why, you may ask? Why not?
Why ask why when Y is fine?

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.617
Not that I've given it
a whole lot of thought,

00:11:56.617 --> 00:11:58.919
can't say there was
a whole lot of pondering.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:00.687
I think we get it, Windy.

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.990
And since I haven't found
my human counterpart like you,

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.758
I created Echo. Say “hey ”.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.159
I am Echo.

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.763
Human counterpart not found.

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:09.997
So Windy...

00:12:10.197 --> 00:12:12.165
Why are you here
in this world?

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:13.433
Why wouldn't I be?

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:15.903
I created this world.
Every rock, pebble, tree, grass,

00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:18.872
that little petunia over there--
what you see is all by me.

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:21.308
For a new world,
it looks... damaged?

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:22.977
A design critic, eh?

00:12:22.977 --> 00:12:25.579
No worries, it's cuz I haven't
given you the grand tour yet!

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.713
It's gonna
change your mind!

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.416
After all, this is going to be
your new home too!

00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:32.552
(Windy)
Ready for a tour?

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.154
Follow us right this way!

00:12:34.488 --> 00:12:35.155
No touching!

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.328
(Windy)
Nice place, right?

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:42.829
Those lilypads?
My idea.

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:44.231
And the pond?
My idea too!

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.666
And the bridge-- all mine.

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:48.869
(Flame)
Windy, you said this
would be our new home too?

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:50.738
(Windy)
Yeah-- well, not
for the two humans with ya

00:12:50.738 --> 00:12:51.839
but for you and Ai.

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.740
Cuz this world's strictly
Ignis-only.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.375
Like a special club
with a dress code

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.910
except your code
has to be digital.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.579
This place has got
everything you need--

00:12:58.579 --> 00:13:01.982
peace, quiet, a gym,
and the main thing-- security!

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.118
Ya see, I got to thinking
when the Cyberse was destroyed.

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:06.654
I couldn't mope around, drifting
in the network like a jellyfish.

00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.722
I had to get crankin'
and create a new Cyberse

00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:09.823
just as great
as the last one

00:13:09.823 --> 00:13:11.157
but with one major difference...

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:13.728
make it super safe
so it won't be destroyed again!

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:15.329
So I've been building
this new Cyberse

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:17.564
for 7,776,000 seconds

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:18.732
give or take
a few hundred nanos

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:20.567
and then opened
the portal and voila!

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:21.602
You two showed up!

00:13:21.702 --> 00:13:24.138
Yeah, straight into
a tornado.

00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:25.973
Which almost
destroyed us.

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.240
Almost.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.109
Key word: Almost.
Because it didn't, did it?

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:30.911
That storm's my new
security system

00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:33.214
that blows away all intruders
unless they're an Ignis--

00:13:33.214 --> 00:13:35.582
or like you two biggies,
Ignis-affiliated.

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:36.884
(Ai)
Well, work on
its sensors

00:13:36.884 --> 00:13:38.719
so they trigger
quicker next time!

00:13:38.719 --> 00:13:40.053
(Windy)
I know, I know,
I know, I know,

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.389
I know, it wasn't the best
first impression, I get it,

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.791
but there's always
room for updates.

00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:45.292
Well then, if you want
to put your bags down

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.893
and make yourselves
comfortable--

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:47.894
Oh wait, oh wait,
oh wait, oh wait,

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:49.896
I see you don't have
any bags so you're all set--

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:53.233
so without further ado,
welcome to your new home!

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.567
As much as we'd like

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.470
to accept your invitation,
we cannot.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.272
Yes you can.
Yes you can.

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.207
No, no, no, no,
we can't.

00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:02.442
At least not until
we finish our mission.

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:03.544
Your mission?

00:14:03.544 --> 00:14:04.945
Since when did you
become so responsible?

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:05.812
Wow!

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:07.014
Uh... thanks?

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.448
Anyway,
here's the thing:

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.217
We're trying to find
this guy named Bohman

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:11.285
because he, uh...

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.053
he stole our friend's soul
through the TV,

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:14.822
it's a long story
even for me.

00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:17.892
But by tracking his signal,
it led us straight to a portal.

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:18.792
Your portal.

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.127
And we can't hit
the off switch

00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:21.962
and relax
until we save our buddy.

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:24.398
Windy, we need to know
if you've seen Bohman.

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:25.899
What's Bohman look like?

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:27.468
(Windy)
I assume he's a man
who carries a bow?

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.935
No, no bow.

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:31.505
But he does have
an impressive number of abs.

00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:34.041
I'd totally remember someone
like that even without a bow.

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:36.310
Hmm... Nope. Didn't see him.
Rings no bells.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.278
Aww...

00:14:37.478 --> 00:14:39.813
I was sure
he came through the portal.

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:42.849
Windy, are you 100%
positively positive

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:44.451
that we're
the only ones here?

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:45.486
(Windy)
1,000%.

00:14:45.486 --> 00:14:46.787
100,000%.

00:14:46.787 --> 00:14:48.955
Because no one
can get past my storms.

00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:50.458
And I mean no one.

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:53.660
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope-- unlesss...

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.295
(Ai)
Unless?

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.864
(Windy)
Unless he flew to
the fringes of this world

00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:58.398
instead of coming here.

00:14:58.632 --> 00:14:59.967
Eureka!

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:02.235
I did sense a weird tinglin'
comin' from over there,

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.405
but it was so tiny
that I ignored it.

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:06.941
Well, maybe you shouldn't
ignore it anymore.

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.209
And maybe you're right.

00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:10.043
Cuz if you don't treat
that teeny-tiny virus

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.546
it can erupt into
a whole systems crash.

00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.248
Can you point us
in the right direction, Windy?

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.117
I can.

00:15:17.184 --> 00:15:18.452
(Ai)
Then that settles it.

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:20.788
If it's Bohman that's over
there, we're gonna end this,

00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:22.423
and we're gonna
end it together!

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:24.057
So lead the way, Windy!

00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:25.592
I'll pass.

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:27.127
Wh-wh-what?

00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:29.129
I said I can point you
in the right direction,

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:30.864
not leeead you
in the right direction.

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:32.032
I still have
too many things to do

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:33.400
to get this world
in tip-top shape

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.701
that I can't go on
a wild goose hunt

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:36.170
to hunt a goose
that might not be loose.

00:15:36.337 --> 00:15:38.939
Besides, I'm the one who
offered ya rest and relaxation

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.607
but you're the one
who turned me down

00:15:40.607 --> 00:15:42.175
like a thermostat
in an igloo.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.178
Stop fighting me
with logic!

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.046
Hey, hey, hey,
chill, chill, chill.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.447
I didn't say
I wasn't gonna help.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.616
Don't bust a brain cell
when you only got like two--

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.850
here's what I'll do.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.619
I'll keep the winds down
in the direction you gotta go,

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:55.122
so it'll at least be smooth
sailing from here to there.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.090
Hmm? Niiice, right?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.525
I guess...

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.094
Yes, it's more
than acceptable.

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:02.596
Thank you, Windy.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.197
Yeah. Thanks.

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:05.032
My pleasure.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.168
Well then,
if we're ready,

00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:09.236
let's travel to the outskirts
of this realm

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.238
and find this Bohman.

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:11.938
(Soulburner chuckles)

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.476
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was about to say!

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.779
(Windy)
One sec, one sec, one sec,
one sec, one sec, one sec!

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.415
While you're on your mission,
if you can do your Windy

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:23.150
a favor,
I'd appreciate it.

00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:24.518
What favor?

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:26.353
This favor.

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:28.688
(Playmaker)
It's Ghost Gal...

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:30.791
and is that Blue Angel?

00:16:30.924 --> 00:16:32.459
(Soulburner)
It sure looks like it.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.628
(Windy)
Now, you know what they say
when you visit a new place.

00:16:34.628 --> 00:16:35.762
Number one:
Have a good time.

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:37.498
Number two: Don't leave
a mess and number three:

00:16:37.498 --> 00:16:39.700
Don't bring anything
you can't take home with you.

00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:41.601
It looks like you dragged
in some stragglers with you

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:43.237
so if you can get them
to bounce on outta here

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:45.005
that'd be a big
thumbs up from me.

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.807
See, I can't
let outsiders find me

00:16:46.807 --> 00:16:48.308
and these two
just aren't giving up.

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:50.344
I'd usually just smear them
on the canyon walls

00:16:50.344 --> 00:16:51.579
like cream cheese

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:52.980
but I know you teamed up
with ‘em in the past

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.248
so I'm willing to forego that if
you can get them to skedaddle.

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:56.583
Ya know,
defeat ‘em in a duel?

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:57.918
Besides, they're on the way
to the fringes

00:16:57.918 --> 00:16:59.586
so you won't be
slowing down at all.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.820
I agree that

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.090
a peaceful resolution
is best.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.658
Now c'mon,
let's get going.

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:07.093
All right, go break a leg,
metaphorically not literally!

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:18.672
The storm's done.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.340
Look there.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.575
(Ai)
Incoming!

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:22.375
(Ghost Gal)
Hey!

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.251
(Blue Gal)
Playmaker!
It's good to see you!

00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:31.217
Oh, really?

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.853
Uh-huh, we're searching
for a new Ignis.

00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:35.722
Have you seen any around?

00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:38.492
I can neither confirm
nor deny.

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.894
(Soulburner)
Yeah, We're not really
in any position to help

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:42.262
Blue Angel.
Sorry.

00:17:42.696 --> 00:17:45.332
Oh, by the way,
I'm Soulburner. Big fan.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.334
You think she'll
give me an autograph?

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:51.138
You're supposed to ask for one
before you decline to help.

00:17:51.172 --> 00:17:51.805
(Soulburner gasps)

00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:53.974
So who's
your little buddy there?

00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:55.976
(Soulburner)
This here's the
fire Ignis.

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:57.144
His name's Flame.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.812
(Flame)
F-L-A-M-E.

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.714
The F stands
for fortitude.

00:18:00.814 --> 00:18:03.383
And what do the other letters
stand for?

00:18:03.617 --> 00:18:04.819
Don't encourage him.

00:18:05.386 --> 00:18:08.388
(Ghost Gal)
So what brings you foursome
to this neck of the woods?

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:11.625
A little far from your usual
paper route isn't it?

00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:13.894
Someone stole something
from us,

00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:15.662
and we think
that he's hiding here.

00:18:16.163 --> 00:18:17.564
Ooh, a thief, huh?

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:19.666
We'll help you guys find him.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.937
Actually, I think it would be
better if you didn't help.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.207
(Ai)
In fact, it'd be better if you
leave this world altogether!

00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:27.608
Oh, really?

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:29.877
That sounds
incredibly suspicious.

00:18:29.877 --> 00:18:32.713
As if you all are hiding
something from me.

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:33.981
It's not like that.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.549
Oh, it's not?

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:37.151
Without going into
details,

00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:38.385
we'd just prefer it

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:40.053
if we can carry out
our mission on our own.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.222
That so?

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.223
I'm not buying it, hon.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.225
(Ghost Gal)
See, Blue Gal and I
have a mission too.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:45.993
Blue Gal?

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.895
You see, the two of us
are here to capture an Ignis.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:49.763
Yup.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.133
We'd preferred if we
didn't have to take yours

00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:53.933
but you're leaving us
with no choice.

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.936
Ooh, I'm so scared.

00:18:56.036 --> 00:18:56.937
(Blue Gal gasps)

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.739
(Soulburner)
Look I know
I'm the new one

00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:00.607
in this bunch so there's no
reason to believe me...

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:03.444
But we're asking you two
to leave for your own good.

00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:06.113
Cuz if you don't
it's gonna stink for you.

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.781
Like sweaty
sneakers stink!

00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:09.817
For your own well-being
we need the two of you

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:12.019
to trust us
just this one time.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.855
Trust is a two-way street,
Playmaker.

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:17.458
Why can't you trust us with
whatever you're not telling us?

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:18.792
That's hardly fair.

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:21.462
I think we're
going in circles.

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:22.629
Me too.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.965
(Blue Gal)
Okay then, wrap
your heads around this..

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.868
I'm not planning on leaving
this place without an Ignis...

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.138
And I see one right there
before my eyes.

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:34.041
Well I think
you should look elsewhere.

00:19:34.308 --> 00:19:35.109
I don't.

00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:36.376
(annoyed sigh)

00:19:36.643 --> 00:19:38.712
Playmaker!
You go on ahead.

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.214
I have a duel
I need to take care of.

00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:44.117
My inner fanboy's
screaming--

00:19:44.117 --> 00:19:45.386
I never thought
I'd ever get to duel

00:19:45.386 --> 00:19:47.121
Blue Ang--
I mean Blue Gal.

00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:48.622
(Flame)
I never thought so
either.

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.725
Because I never cared to think
about it in the first place.

00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:54.628
C'mon then, Ai.
Let's get going.

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:57.464
Oh, you're not
gettin' away!

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.832
Yes, we are!

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:06.940
I really hope we find

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.709
Bohman because we're makin'
all our buddies upset.

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.113
Listen closely, Blue Gal.

00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:14.447
I can promise you
one thing

00:20:14.447 --> 00:20:16.383
before this duel
even starts:

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.451
You're not getting my
Ignis.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.455
And I can promise you this:

00:20:22.155 --> 00:20:26.059
When it comes to dueling,
Blue Gal is no longer an angel!
