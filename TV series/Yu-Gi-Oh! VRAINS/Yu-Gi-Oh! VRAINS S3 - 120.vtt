WEBVTT

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:04.471
(panting)

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.747
So the story of your life

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:15.615
just entered the final chapter,
Playmaker.

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:16.850
(groans)

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:17.817
Ai...

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.154
But...

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.122
your story doesn't
have to come to an end.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:27.160
Instead, we can build a perfect
virtual world together,

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:29.763
a world where you
and I can live in peace.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.364
Just like
you wanted.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.033
Ai...

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:36.903
So what do you say?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.775
My answer's no.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.113
I'm sorry, Ai,
but I can't join you,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.915
because then
I would have to abandon

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.150
everyone else here.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.153
You see, there are
two different kinds of peace.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.690
Your idea is to leave this world
and its problems,

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:57.658
and make a new one...

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:01.395
a perfect world that's
free of war and conflict.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:03.897
But that doesn't achieve
the second kind of peace,

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.066
which is peace
of mind.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.201
Even if our new world
seemed perfect,

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.537
I could never forget
the friends I left behind

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.374
or that I had let the real world
to fall into ruin.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.075
And as long
as my memories exist,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.377
I'll never be at peace.

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:19.880
And I think you'd feel the same,
even if you wouldn't admit it.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.050
If we want to achieve true,
lasting peace,

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:25.218
then instead of running away
from our problems

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.354
we have to try
and solve them.

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.090
That's why I won't turn my back
on the real world to join you.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:31.191
I see,

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:32.392
so, in other words,

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.895
you're ditching the best friend
you could ever have.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.030
No, you're wrong.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.332
I haven't dumped you, Ai.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.901
I want you to remain
in the real world with me,

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.203
to try and save it.

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:45.038
Because the real world
is worth saving.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:48.675
It's a world where
even someone broken like me

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:49.877
could find friends.

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:51.512
After the Lost Incident

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.247
all I cared about
was revenge,

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.582
but luckily there were
people and programs

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:56.850
who cared about me

00:01:56.917 --> 00:01:58.752
and who I learned
to care for, too.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:00.721
I guess we're
all broken in some way,

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.891
but it's going to take all of us
to solve the world's problems.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.492
And that includes you.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.596
If only everything
was that simple.

00:02:09.663 --> 00:02:10.831
(Playmaker)
But it can be.

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:12.332
No, it cannot.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.467
(Playmaker)
Yes, it can!

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:14.902
Playmaker,

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.871
your solution is just not
going to work, alrite?

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.574
I won't give up that easily.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.610
Because I know
there has to be a solution.

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:28.282
A solution that leads
to true peace for all of us.

00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:30.150
But I need
your help,

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:33.220
so let's finish
the journey we started!

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.388
Sorry.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.723
You took your best shot

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.124
and it sounds nice and all,

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:39.125
but it's too late, Playmaker.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:40.594
Ai...

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.661
All I'm sayin'

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.464
is that I've passed
the point of no return, pal.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:45.432
So,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:48.201
let's finish this duel.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.604
And see who survives.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.481
♪♪♪

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:56.536
You're up,
Playmaker.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:00.907
The fate of mankind rests
in the palm of your hands.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.344
(Playmaker)
Ai's right.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.280
This next card
will determine everything.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:09.916
It's my turn!

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:11.952
I draw!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.887
Before you do a thing,

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.724
I activate my trap card A.I.Q!

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.260
This trap should slow you down

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:21.428
because when
this card is in play,

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.764
we're both only allowed
to Link Summon once per turn!

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.569
I'm only able to summon
one Link Monster?

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.238
I mean, I'd prefer
it if it was zero

00:04:31.372 --> 00:04:32.572
but I'm a nice guy.

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.041
Just thank me later.

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:36.410
If you're going
to limit my options,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.346
then I have no choice
but to find new ones.

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:41.582
When I have no monsters
on my field,

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.585
I can banish my spell card
CYNET RITUAL

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.021
and a Ritual Monster
from my graveyard

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:49.289
to summon two CYNET TOKENS!

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:52.926
So I exchange CYBERSE MAGICIAN
for two new monsters!

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:59.299
Next, I'm activating
a spell card from my hand!

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.634
DRASTIC DRAW!

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.138
This spell card's effect
allows me to banish

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.639
all monsters on my field

00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.242
to draw three cards
from my deck.

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.847
And when there are no monsters
on my side of the field,

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.784
I can automatically summon
LINKSLAYER from my hand.

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:22.022
I'll follow that by summoning
CYBERSE WIZARD!

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.026
And now, since I have a Cyberse
type monster on my field,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.595
I can summon BACKUP SECRETARY
to join them.

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:32.466
Our first monsters?

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.201
I see what you're up to.

00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:36.169
You're hittin' me in the feels,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.306
but that's not gonna
stop me from dueling you.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.474
I can't stop you from dueling,

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.411
but I can stop you
from winning.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.979
By banishing BORRELOAD
FURIOUS DRAGON

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.147
from my graveyard,

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.251
I can revive
a Dark Attribute Link Monster!

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:54.187
Rise up,
FIREWALL DRAGON DARKFLUID!

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:55.956
Here I go!

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.759
If I'm only allowed
to Link Summon once...

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.395
then I'll make sure
to make the most of it

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.397
by creating
the ultimate circuit!

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:07.133
The summoning conditions require
at least two Effect Monsters!

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.006
Link the circuit!

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:16.076
Forge the bond that connects
the real with the virtual!

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.178
I Link Summon!

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:21.214
Link 4 ACCESSCODE TALKER!

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.221
This is quite the surprise.

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:30.223
No cards in your hand

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.059
and you summon
a new CODE TALKER?

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.361
Impressive.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.032
But if you think
that is impressive watch this.

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:40.000
If I summon ACCESS TALKER

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.337
using a Link Monster
it gains 1000 attack points

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.306
for every link that it had.

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.041
My DARKFLUID had 5 links,

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.878
so ACCESSCODE TALKER
gains 5000 attack points!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.383
I got all tingly and scared

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.418
when you said that
with so much passion,

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:00.187
'til I realized THE ARRIVAL has

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.955
more attack points
than that fella!

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.623
That is true.

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.293
But ACCESSCODE TALKER
has another ability!

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:10.397
By banishing a Link Monster
from my graveyard,

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:12.466
I can destroy one card
on your field.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.435
And it can use this ability
over and over,

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:17.438
as long as the next monster
I banish

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.772
has a different Attribute.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.140
What!

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.108
By my count,

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.610
there are six Link Monsters

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:25.111
with different Attributes
in your graveyard!

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:26.813
That's right

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.882
and that means ACCESSCODE TALKER

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.284
can now use its ability
six times!

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.754
I'll start
with my Earth Attribute

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.255
TRANSCODE TALKER!

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.792
I banish it to destroy
IGNISTER A.I.LAND!

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.760
Access Integration!

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.663
(gasps)

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.800
When IGNISTER A.I.LAND is gone,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.070
I have to destroy
all my monsters.

00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:52.439
Which is what I would
scientifically call

00:07:52.573 --> 00:07:53.773
a very bad thing.

00:07:55.776 --> 00:07:56.743
So it's a good thing

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.879
that I have GATCHIRI @IGNISTER

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.348
because its ability
prevents my monsters

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.683
from being destroyed
once per turn!

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:06.987
But since you have
one less card in play,

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:09.890
THE ARRIVAL loses
1000 attack points.

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:14.128
Next, I'll activate ACCESSCODE
TALKER's ability again!

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:17.030
This time,
I banish my Water Attribute

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.001
SPLASH MAGE to destroy
your GATCHIRI @IGNISTER!

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.037
Go Access Integration!

00:08:28.876 --> 00:08:31.545
(Playmaker)
Go Access Integration!

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:36.216
THE ARRIVAL loses
another 1000 attack points!

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:39.353
(groans)

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:42.823
When GATCHIRI is destroyed,
its ability activates!

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:46.360
It prevents you from using
your special abilities

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.362
to destroy one of my monsters.

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:50.030
And no surprise surprise,

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:52.733
the monster I'm protecting
is THE ARRIVAL!

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.869
That means ACCESSCODE TALKER
can't blow it up.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.105
How 'bout your other monsters?

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:01.909
I banish my Fire Attribute
PROXY F MAGICIAN!

00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.911
And destroy GUSSARI @IGNISTER!

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.279
Go!

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.786
That's another 1000
attack points gone!

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.357
I banish my Wind Attribute
EXSLAYER

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.593
to destroy your DARKWIGHT!

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:22.395
(grunts)

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:27.100
Then I banish my Light Attribute
LINKROSS to destroy A.I.Q!

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:30.904
Finally, I banish
my Dark Attribute

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:34.040
DECODE TALKER to destroy
COMPROMA.I.SE!

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:38.078
By removing all the other
cards on my field,

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:42.515
you dropped THE ARRIVAL's
attack points down to 7000.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:43.784
Huh!

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:47.621
And that makes your monster
stronger than my monster.

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:50.090
Yes.
Here goes!

00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:51.625
ACCESSCODE TALKER

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.528
attacks THE ARRIVAL
to end this duel!

00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:57.731
Don't count your chickens,
Playmaker!

00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:01.301
By banishing GUSSARI
@IGNISTER from my graveyard,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.571
both our monsters'
attack points drop to 3000!

00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:26.927
It's a double KO!

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.063
How's that, meatbag!

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.032
You thought you had
some tools under your belt,

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.434
but your pants are droppin'

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.736
cuz you weren't wearin'
a belt to begin with!

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:36.437
Meanwhile,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.205
I can use GUSSARI's ability

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:41.408
to revive DARK TEMPLAR
@IGNISTER from my graveyard!

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:47.614
It appears that
I'm the only one

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:50.016
who has a monster in play,
Playmaker.

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:51.885
Yes, maybe for now.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:53.921
But I'll change that
with my combo!

00:10:54.422 --> 00:10:56.590
When my Cyberse
Link Monster destroys

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:58.125
your Link Monster in battle,

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:00.227
my spell card
CYNET CLOSURE returns

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:02.829
the card it banished
back to my graveyard!

00:11:04.098 --> 00:11:05.366
And that card is...

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.634
the trap RECODED ALIVE!

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:08.468
(gasps)

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.805
(Ai)
He banished that card
forever ago,

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:13.974
so he knew I'd forget about it.

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:17.077
Playmaker was
setting me up from the start!

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.747
I activate
RECODED ALIVE's effect!

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:24.652
When I have no monsters
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.754
I can banish
RECODED ALIVE

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:30.624
to resummon the DECODE TALKER
that's already been banished.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.628
DECODE TALKER?

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.164
But DARK TEMPLAR
can't be destroyed

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:40.133
by a monster with the same
number of attack points.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.936
So even if DECODE TALKER
attacks,

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:45.438
only your monster
will be wiped out!

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.009
If that's the case,
I'll end my turn.

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.479
Yeah and any hope of winning!

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:54.014
It's my turn!

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.315
I draw!

00:11:59.754 --> 00:12:01.355
Welp, it's been fun.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.224
But this will be my final turn,
Playmaker.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.228
Then it's been
a memorable journey, Ai.

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:09.162
From beginning...
to end.

00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:14.534
♪♪♪

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.706
Question, Playmaker...

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.843
Do you think I was a good
teammate for you?

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.077
Be honest.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:25.212
No.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.848
You were the worst
strategist I have ever met.

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:31.084
Oh well. I guess
I asked for it.

00:12:31.485 --> 00:12:32.319
Hmmm.

00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:36.656
DARK TEMPLAR!
Attack DECODE TALKER!

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:43.430
Now's the moment
I activate TA.I. STRIKE!

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.934
When a monster is destroyed,

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.368
the owner takes damage

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:50.404
equal to its attack points.

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:51.905
So you lose.

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.043
Bye, Playmaker.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.545
It was nice knowing you.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.713
I'm not going anywhere!

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.116
I activate CODE HACK!

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.285
Now whenever you
activate a spell card,

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:08.122
I can banish this trap card
from my graveyard

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:09.890
to negate your spell's effect

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:13.660
and increase DECODE TALKER's
attack points by 700!

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:16.663
(gasps)

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.467
Decode Destruction!

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:31.278
(screams)

00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:39.619
Ai!

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:45.959
Ai...

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:49.296
I guess I lost...

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.632
If you hadn't played
that spell card, Ai,

00:13:52.732 --> 00:13:54.134
you would have won the duel.

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:55.870
Maybe.

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:58.772
But what use is second
or third guessin' myself?

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.275
If I had a penny
for every move I regretted,

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.111
I'd have... zero cents!

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.879
But I don't
regret a thing.

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:07.114
As a matter o' fact,

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.816
this is exactly
the outcome I wanted.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.186
I can tell ya now.

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:14.121
It's about the simulation.

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:17.291
See, I didn't really give you
the whole picture.

00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:20.728
It's not that I lied
to you exactly,

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.029
but I did fib a little.

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:25.966
Well, okay, I fibbed a lot.

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:30.937
Truth is, I never went
extinct in any simulation.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.379
Instead, I survived
every single time,

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:41.881
'cuz no matter what I tried,

00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:46.519
you would always sacrifice
yourself to save me.

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:50.124
(screams)

00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:55.028
But I finally came up with a way
to best you at your own game.

00:14:55.863 --> 00:14:57.030
Ai...

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:59.065
You sacrificed
yourself for me?

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:03.404
I guess this means
I passed my hero test.

00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:05.705
But, Playmaker, one last thing.

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:06.741
Seriously.

00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.842
I wasn't a good teammate?

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:09.910
No, you weren't.

00:15:10.044 --> 00:15:11.111
For three reasons.

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:11.912
One:

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.580
Your strategies rarely paid off.

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.082
And if they did,
they paid off for our opponent.

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:17.051
Two:

00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:18.251
You would go
out of your way

00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:20.921
to distract me
from focusing on the duel.

00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.755
And three:

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:24.258
You would reveal
our secrets to our opponent,

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.794
making it easy
for them to counter us.

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:27.761
So for these reasons,

00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.930
you were never a good
dueling teammate.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:31.798
But you were a great friend.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.168
A friend that
I will never forget.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:36.770
I won't forget you either.

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.552
Guess it's time to go.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.288
But before I do

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.256
there's one more thing
I wanna say.

00:15:56.923 --> 00:16:01.261
It's that I know I could be
overly entertaining, Playmaker.

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:03.497
Sometimes even
too much fun.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.467
And that during our duels,
my jokes too hysterical.

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.970
(Playmaker)
That isn't important now, Ai.

00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:12.973
No.

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:16.476
It's important that I get this
off my chest, Playmaker.

00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:19.780
Those times I cheered
till my voice hurt

00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:22.683
and rah-rah-rah'd you
when the chips were down,

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.786
and hurt my back
from carrying you to victory,

00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:27.354
all of those times...

00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:29.690
are definitely
the times

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:32.425
that I'm gonna miss
most of all, Playmaker.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.328
Not me.

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:37.764
Because I'll miss
all our time together.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.866
Thank you, Playmaker.

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:45.071
You were a good friend
for a meatbag, I mean.

00:16:46.507 --> 00:16:48.809
It's time... for me...

00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:51.912
to say bye... Yusaku.

00:16:58.152 --> 00:16:59.352
Huh?

00:17:06.994 --> 00:17:07.894
Ai!

00:17:19.507 --> 00:17:20.507
(sobbing)

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.209
Ai!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.896
Absolutely!
Coming right up!

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:43.730
Hey, Cal!

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:47.033
Two hotdog sandwiches
with the works!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:48.201
Huh...

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.236
Hard to find
good help

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.705
with your sandwich shop
these days, huh?

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:52.872
Right?

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.475
It's almost like
he wants to get fired.

00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:58.211
But it's great
havin' him around.

00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:00.747
We can finally make up
for lost time.

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:04.118
Y' know...

00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:06.454
none of this could've
happened without your help.

00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:08.722
That's sweet of you
to say and everything,

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:11.958
but you know Yusaku's
the one you should be thanking.

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:13.627
Speaking of,

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:15.929
have you heard anything
from him at all?

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.464
Not a peep.

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:20.634
He's gone AWOL
since his duel with Ai.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:22.369
Huh, I see.

00:18:23.304 --> 00:18:24.771
After all the times
he helped me,

00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:27.374
I never had a chance
to really thank him.

00:18:27.608 --> 00:18:28.942
You might yet.

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.478
Because he's still
somewhere out there.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:35.115
(Skye)
I thought you said he's gone?

00:18:35.216 --> 00:18:36.283
(Kolter)
Yeah,

00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:38.785
but that doesn't mean
he won't come home someday.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.253
And when he does,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.290
I'll have a couple hot dog tacos
waiting for him.

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:44.925
(giggles)

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:46.960
Kolter, hot dogs aren't tacos,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.062
who'd be silly
enough to think that?

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:53.267
(Hayami)
Okay, try this,

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:56.237
if you reroute the traffic
from Node 6 to Node 9,

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:59.039
that switch should enable you
to free up bandwidth.

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:00.507
(Zaizen)
How's it going, Hayami?

00:19:01.675 --> 00:19:03.110
(Hayami)
Busy, Mr. CEO!

00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:05.779
(Zaizen)
Busy good or busy bad?

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:08.048
Everything's going super smooth.

00:19:10.517 --> 00:19:13.520
We've finished LINK VRAINS'
global network expansion

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.389
that goes far beyond
Den City,

00:19:15.523 --> 00:19:16.656
so we've linked
duelists

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:18.391
around the world
with each other.

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:23.864
And they're making friends
from Antarctica to Zimbabwe!

00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:25.532
Keep up the good work,
Hayami,

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:28.969
because it's our mission
to keep LINK VRAINS operational.

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:32.439
So that our friend always
has a home to return to.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:43.384
Faster!

00:19:43.517 --> 00:19:46.186
Too late, we're gonna
be bug chow!

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:49.356
Well, at least you two're
finally making some headlines!

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:51.191
Save us!!!!

00:19:55.396 --> 00:19:56.964
(panting)

00:19:57.397 --> 00:20:00.033
So you want me to take
the left or the right?

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:00.901
Your call.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.335
Lead the way.

00:20:02.969 --> 00:20:04.838
(Announcer)
That was Gore-tastic!

00:20:04.939 --> 00:20:07.040
The LINK VRAINS
Invitational Tournament

00:20:07.174 --> 00:20:09.042
has a new champion!

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:10.277
(growls)

00:20:10.344 --> 00:20:11.444
(laughs)

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:14.181
Awesome!
Gore is our hero!

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:15.816
I wanna duel,
too!

00:20:15.883 --> 00:20:17.217
Just like Gore!

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:19.786
You wanna challenge the champ?

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:22.489
I'll take on all o' you,
porkchops!

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.531
LINK VRAINS is growing
at an exponential rate.

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.866
And so will the threats
from all the hackers out there.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.202
That's true,
but I pity any hacker

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.604
who has to contend
with the Knights of Hanoi.

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:40.340
To think that the three of us
are now the ones responsible

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.642
for providing security
for LINK VRAINS!

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:44.811
How 'bout a field trip
into LINK VRAINS

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:48.348
to purge those unwelcome guests
from our systems?

00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.286
(Kiku)
I'm not sure about this.

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:54.988
You know how scared
I am of heights.

00:20:55.055 --> 00:20:56.023
(Theodore)
Don't worry,

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:57.524
I'll be by your side, Kiku!

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:01.595
(Both)
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:21:03.464 --> 00:21:04.564
(yells)

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.500
(sighs)

00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:13.741
Oh wow!

00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:15.409
Welcome to LINK VRAINS!

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:17.911
This is version
three-point-somethin'.

00:21:18.045 --> 00:21:19.212
I can't keep track!

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:20.114
Oh!

00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:22.216
Hey! Hold up a sec!

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:25.218
That's Soulburner!
And he has a girlfriend?

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:26.920
(groans)

00:21:27.021 --> 00:21:27.921
Don't get jealous.

00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:30.757
Cuz you have Blue Angel
waiting for you!

00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:34.094
(Kiku)
He saved this whole world?

00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:36.930
Theodore, you're a hero!

00:21:37.264 --> 00:21:39.933
C'mon... not really.

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:42.269
If ya wanna meet
a real hero,

00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:45.405
then someday I'm gonna
introduce you to Playmaker.

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:47.607
Really?
Where is he?

00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:49.109
I dunno.

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:51.578
But he's somewhere
out there searching.

00:21:51.678 --> 00:21:52.746
(Kiku)
Searching?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.248
Yeah... for a friend.

00:22:00.287 --> 00:22:02.656
Do you think Playmaker
will ever return?

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.591
Of course I do.

00:22:04.658 --> 00:22:07.427
Because his greatest rival
is standing right here.

00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:11.431
And he never backs down
from a challenge.

00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:22.242
(Playmaker)
Wherever you are, my friend,
I'll find you!

00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:31.752
Huh?

00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:34.254
Awww glitch!

00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:45.532
