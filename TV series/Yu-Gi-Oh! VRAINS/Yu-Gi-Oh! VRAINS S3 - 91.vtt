WEBVTT

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:08.942
Here goes!

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.145
I now build my circuit!

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.249
I set my Marincess Sea Horse
in the Link Arrow...

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:16.917
to Link Summon!

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.485
Link 1

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.087
Marincess Blue Slug!

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.158
But since it's a Water
Attribute monster,

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.928
Hydradrive Lord prevents it from
using any of its abilities.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.431
So she's useless.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.767
Actually,

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:37.571
since I summoned Blue Slug next
to my Crystal Heart's link,

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:40.240
Marincess Bubble Blast's
effect activates!

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.311
It deals you 500 points
of damage for every Link Arrow

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.080
that those two monsters have!

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.615
Since they have a total
of three links...

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.785
You take 1500
points of damage!

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:54.455
Then I'll use my
Interference Canceler...

00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.456
to drop the damage to 0!

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.092
He can only do
that one more time.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.561
And after he does, he's mine!

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.425
When I have two
Marincess Link Monsters in play,

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.962
I get to revive Marincess
Mandarin from my graveyard!

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.035
But like your other
Water monsters,

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.404
she loses her abilities.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:21.275
Yeah, but summoning her triggers
Bubble Blast's effect!

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.411
An effect that I render
useless by using...

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.113
Interference Canceler.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.881
(chuckles) Perfect.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.918
That's the third time he used
Interference Canceler,

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:32.586
so he can't use it anymore.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:35.255
That means if I use
my Marincess Mandarin

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.890
to Link Summon a new monster,

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.559
he can't stop me
from activating

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:41.562
my Bubble Blast
to deal 2000 points of damage

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:42.896
to his life points.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.999
And if I Link Summon again,
I'll get a Link 2 monster

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.203
that activates Bubble Blast's
effect for a second time.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.872
That'll deal 2000
more points of damage,

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.941
which is enough to defeat
Bohman and end this duel!

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:59.313
I can see in your eyes
that you think this duel is over

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:00.714
but you're wrong.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.984
By returning Interference
Canceler to my hand,

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.787
I can summon
Hydradrive Mutation.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.956
Then I'm allowed
to once again place

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:10.791
that trap card on my field

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.962
and immediately activate
that trap during this turn.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:17.998
In other words,
Canceler's count resets!

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:19.466
Oh no,

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.368
this is really bad,
Blue Maiden!

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.937
This means Bohman
can avoid taking damage

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.338
three more times!

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.141
So predictable.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.943
Did you actually think
it was possible

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.478
for you to outplay me?

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.447
Uh yeah, of course I did!

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.316
And in fact I still do!

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.017
You made one good move,

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:39.119
but that doesn't
make you special!

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:42.355
I set two of my Marincesses
in the Link Arrows

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.291
to Link Summon

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.794
Link 2 Marincess
Coral Anemone!

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.398
(Bohman)
Pointless.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.770
Since my Crystal Heart
and Coral Anemone

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.638
have four links
between them,

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:02.342
my Bubble Blast deals a total
of 2000 points of damage

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.844
straight to your
life points.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.780
But since I can now use
Interference Canceler again,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.682
that damage drops to 0.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.019
(sighs)

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:14.688
I'll place
this card facedown...

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.357
and end my turn.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:19.926
Since my turn's over,
Bubble Blast is now destroyed.

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.265
Bohman, I know it'll sound like
I'm saying this because

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.632
of the situation we're in,

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.001
but it's not too late
to stop this duel.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.338
You're right... That is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:33.207
If we keep fighting,

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:36.843
we're both going to lose so much
more than we already have,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.880
and we've both lost
so much already.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.616
You don't need to remind me.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.252
How could I ever forget

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.021
that you deleted
my very own brother.

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.357
But in a way,
I should thank you.

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:51.892
Thank us?

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.261
Before you defeated
my brother,

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:57.197
I dueled using computations
and calculations

00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:00.200
and I wondered why humans
were able to defeat me

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.737
when I was logically superior
to them in every way.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.841
But when you defeated him,
I learned about emotions.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.076
About anger...

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.444
and sadness.

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:14.582
And how humans channel these
emotions to elevate their game.

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.117
So I combined these emotions
with my intellect

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:20.254
to evolve my AI
and elevate my game.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.423
And the end result
is what you see before you,

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:27.161
the perfect duelist fueled
with the desire for victory!

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.330
If you wanted to say that you're
a better duelist than before,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.433
you coulda just said that
with like 98 fewer words.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.469
I'll take that
to heart for next time,

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.737
except there won't be
a next time.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.410
It's my turn. I draw!

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:47.147
I activate Hydradrive Mutation's
special ability!

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:51.285
I can change its Attribute
to a monster of my choice,

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.920
and the one I choose
is Crystal Heart.

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.925
Therefore, my Mutation
changes from an Earth

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.426
to a Water monster.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:03.330
Next, I activate the spell
Property Flood from my hand!

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.099
By tributing
one of my monsters...

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:10.004
I can resummon a Link Monster
from my graveyard for every link

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:12.372
that my Cubed
Hydradrive Lord has,

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.307
as long as it shares
an Attribute

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.977
with my Hydradrive Mutation,
so that means

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:19.146
three Water Monsters
are coming back.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.816
Specifically, these three
Coolant HydradriveS!

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:27.387
I shall now use these monsters
to generate my circuit!

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.691
The summoning conditions
require four Hydradrive

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.759
Link Monsters
with the same Attribute!

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.997
He's summoning a monster
stronger than Hydradrive Lord?

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.833
I Link Summon!

00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:42.969
Link 4 Tesseract
Hydradrive Monarch!

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:47.974
Not good.

00:06:47.974 --> 00:06:50.144
No at all Ai,
far from it.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.512

(Ghost Gal)
What are we doing here
in Central Station's basement?

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.767
This location houses

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.637
Sol Technologies emergency
central control switch

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.872
which can use it to restart
LINK VRAINS

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:20.140
and log everyone out.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.542
And purge Bohman
out of our system.

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:25.078
Ah.

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.547
Akira Zaizen...

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.885
Impossible. I'm locked out
of my own system.

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:34.088
Or you mean
Bohman locked you out.

00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:36.223
No, Bohman wouldn't know
about this switch.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.425
(both gasp)

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.129
Or I could be wrong
about that...

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.267
It appears...

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.804
this all rests
on your shoulders now, Skye.

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.773
Win this duel, Skye!

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:55.208
Or all of LINK VRAINS
will be gone!

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.747
My Tesseract Hydradrive
Monarch is stronger

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.548
than anything
that's come before!

00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:03.817
It's not only an
Earth Monster,

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:07.520
but it's also a Water,
Fire and Wind monster.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:12.793
And since I used my Cubed
Hydradrive Lord to summon it,

00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:15.563
I'm allowed to draw one card!

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:18.399
Next, if your monster
has the same Attribute

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.901
as my Monarch,
it loses its abilities!

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:24.171
Aww man, this is just great,
not that again.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.172
(Aqua)
Without its abilities,

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.442
Coral Anemone isn't at
full strength.

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:30.611
But on the positive side,
at least our

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.280
Marincess Crystal Heart
can keep its abilities when

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.048
it's in the Extra Monster Zone.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:36.783
Yes...

00:08:36.783 --> 00:08:39.987
but not after my Hydradrive
Monarch destroys it!

00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:41.489
Don't think so!

00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:43.791
Whenever my Crystal
Heart is attacked,

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.326
I can discard
a Marincess from my hand.

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:47.528
And if I do,

00:08:47.628 --> 00:08:49.863
my Crystal Heart isn't destroyed

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:52.399
and I take no damage
from this battle!

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.603
So even with its four swords,
it's cutting nothing!

00:08:56.704 --> 00:09:00.607
On the contrary, I've succeeded
in cutting your options.

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:03.677
Because when my Hydradrive
Monarch attacks

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:06.079
you're required to send
one of your monsters

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.414
to the graveyard.

00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:09.350
So which of your
two monsters

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.518
are you willing
to give up, Blue Maiden?

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.887
Whichever you select,

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.190
when your monster
is sent to the graveyard,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.393
my Hydradrive Monarch
is allowed to attack again.

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.929
You gotta choose wisely,
Blue Maiden.

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:23.530
And the right choice is...

00:09:24.198 --> 00:09:25.199
(mumbles) I don't know.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:27.535
(Aqua)
Which one should we pick,
Blue Maiden?

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.870
If we send Crystal Heart
to the graveyard,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.905
Bohman can use Judgement
Arrows to double

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.274
his monster's attack
points and win the duel.

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.577
But if we choose to give up
Coral Anemone instead,

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.213
we'll be left with
Crystal Heart,

00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:41.047
which has 0 attack points.

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:45.585
So if he attacks that,
he'll win the duel that way too.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.021
Neither option will allow
Blue Maiden

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.456
to survive this duel.

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:53.527
(Bohman)
Now choose... and lose.

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:55.128
C'mon, Skye, think!

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:56.196
There must be...

00:09:56.296 --> 00:09:58.265
There has to be another way!

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.237
What do I do?

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.607
What do I do?

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:09.342
Is there nothing I can do?

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:11.077
Except lose?

00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:14.114
And fail my friends?

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.520
If I choose Crystal Heart,
I lose.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.022
If I choose
Coral Anemone, I lose.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.759
You can do this, Skye!
I believe in you!

00:10:26.093 --> 00:10:26.893
(gasps)

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:30.397
You know what?

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:33.733
If both choices
make me lose...

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:34.901
(chuckles)

00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:37.071
I'll choose neither.

00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:40.940
Instead I activate
Marincess Cascade!

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.578
It banishes all Marincess
Link Monsters on the field!

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:47.547
In exchange,
one monster gains

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:50.184
300 attack points for every
Link that they had,

00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:52.620
and since your monster's
the only one in play,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.456
it's the one that
gets those attack points.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.525
Lastly, the monsters
I banished return

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.260
to my field next turn.

00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:02.596
(Ai)
Why would she help
Bohman by raising

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.265
his monster's attack points?

00:11:04.532 --> 00:11:06.433
Because it doesn't
actually help him.

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:07.601
Huh?

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:11.071
When a monster is banished,
it doesn't go to the graveyard.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:14.107
And if it doesn't,
Hydradrive Monarch's ability

00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:16.443
can't activate,
so it can't attack.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.744
Well done!

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.282
I have no choice
but to end my turn.

00:11:21.282 --> 00:11:22.582
You're up.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.251
When your turn ends,

00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.454
so does Marincess
Cascade's effect,

00:11:26.454 --> 00:11:30.257
meaning your Monarch's attack
points drop back down to 3000.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.960
That was close.
Too close.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:37.431
Truth is, my mind was in
complete and total shambles.

00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:40.601
But then I remembered that there
are people who believe in me

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:42.469
and I won't let them down!

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:44.905
So looks like
you're still stuck with me!

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:47.073
It's my turn! I draw!

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:50.410
First off, my monsters
that Marincess Cascade

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.479
banished return to my field!

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:56.650
But without their abilities.

00:11:57.485 --> 00:11:58.853
Yeah, okay, I know,

00:11:58.853 --> 00:12:02.255
you already said that
like 14 times this duel.

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:04.592
I activate
Marincess Battle Ocean

00:12:04.592 --> 00:12:07.594
to raise my monsters'
attack points by 200!

00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:10.197
And next up,
I build my circuit!

00:12:10.698 --> 00:12:14.067
The summoning conditions require
at least two Water Monsters,

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.637
one of which has to be
Crystal Heart!

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:18.072
I Link Summon!

00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:21.241
Link 4 Marincess Wonder Heart!

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:25.745
And for the fifteenth time
now, is it,

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.349
your monster
loses its abilities!

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:29.516
Not quite!

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:33.087
Due to Marincess
Battle Ocean's effect,

00:12:33.087 --> 00:12:35.422
when I use Crystal Heart
to Link Summon,

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:39.159
my Wonder Heart is protected
from your special abilities!

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.229
And Battle Ocean
also raises

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:44.564
Wonder Heart's
attack points by 200!

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:48.368
But wait,
there's still more!

00:12:48.635 --> 00:12:51.906
Now when I go and Link Summon
a Marincess Wonder Heart

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:53.707
to my Extra Monster Zone,

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.210
Battle Ocean's third effect
lets me equip

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.847
up to three Marincesses in my
graveyard on to Wonder Heart,

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:02.115
as long as they each have
a different number

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:03.416
of Link Arrows.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.820
So Link 1 Blue Slug,
Link 2 Coral Anemone,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.755
and Link 3 Marbled Rock,

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.558
join up with Wonder Heart
to power her up!

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:15.963
For every Link Arrow
that those three monsters have,

00:13:16.397 --> 00:13:18.732
my Marincess Wonder Heart
will gain

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:21.068
300 additional attack points!

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.904
Since they have a total
of six Link Arrows,

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:26.640
Wonder Heart gains 1800
attack points.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:29.610
Nice!

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.712
She's now stronger
than Bohman's monster!

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:34.548
Since I sent Coral Anemone
to the graveyard

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.216
earlier during this turn,

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.285
its special ability activates,

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:40.754
letting me add one
Marincess in my graveyard

00:13:40.754 --> 00:13:41.888
to my hand.

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.824
Here I go!

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:47.561
Wonder Heart, attack and destroy
Tesseract Hydradrive Monarch!

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:49.063
You fool!

00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:51.064
I can use Judgement Arrows

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.099
to double my monster's
attack points!

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.302
Oh, I'm not the fool,
Bohman!

00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:58.372
Wonder Heart's special ability
prevents you from using

00:13:58.372 --> 00:13:59.539
Judgement Arrows,

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.042
so its attack points
stay lower than mine!

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:03.543
(grunts)

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:06.947
Argh!

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:11.484
This attack might be done,
but I'm not done yet!

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.286
By negating its
special abilities,

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:15.789
I can summon one of my
Marincesses that's equipped

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.191
on to my Wonder Heart.

00:14:17.525 --> 00:14:20.660
So join the battle,
Marincess Marbled Rock!

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.532
And due to Battle
Ocean's effect,

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.134
Marbled Rock gains
200 attack points!

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:31.605
Good! Now go!

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:36.109
Marbled Rock, attack Bohman
directly and end this duel!

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:37.143
(grunts)

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:40.447
Bye bye.

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:43.316
What?

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:45.619
You survived?

00:14:46.453 --> 00:14:48.054
Of course I did.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.693
What?

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.029
You survived?

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:58.465
Of course I did.

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:02.102
By activating my trap
Hydradrive Tolerance,

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.705
the damage I took
was reduced by 300

00:15:04.705 --> 00:15:07.841
for every Link Arrow
that my Hydradrive Monarch had.

00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:09.343
Since it had four links,

00:15:09.343 --> 00:15:13.046
I took 1200 fewer points
of damage and survived.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:17.417
Additionally,
Hydradrive Tolerance

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.753
protects me from taking
any more damage

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.454
for the rest of this turn.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.191
Yeah, well, whatever!

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.359
Even if I can't win
this turn,

00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:29.096
I can make sure
you can't win on your turn!

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:30.931
I reequip Marbled Rock

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.732
on to my Wonder Heart
to power her

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:35.535
back up to 4400
attack points!

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.906
You're up, Bohman.

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.344
Just gotta stay calm.
This duel's still in the bag.

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.847
Well done, Blue Maiden.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:49.116
Every move you made
has led you here,

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.052
the moment of your defeat.

00:15:51.185 --> 00:15:53.120
And it's all your own fault.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.888
Because by making it
your mission

00:15:54.888 --> 00:15:57.458
to destroy my Tesseract
Hydradrive Monarch,

00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:59.860
you set up your own demise!

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.162
And if you do not
believe me...

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:04.164
Then just watch.

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.466
It's my turn!

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.101
By paying 1000 life points,

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:10.905
I can resummon
Hydradrive Monarch

00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:12.806
from my graveyard...

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.475
with its attack points doubled!

00:16:17.745 --> 00:16:19.746
6000 attack points?

00:16:19.913 --> 00:16:21.247
(Bohman)
And once again,

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.750
my Monarch wields
four Attributes:

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.918
not just Earth,

00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:28.755
but also Water,
Fire, and Wind.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.457
(grunts)

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.993
And your Water Monsters...

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.762
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
they lose their abilities.

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.432
But not this time because Battle
Ocean's effect negates it!

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:42.602
However, it can't negate
my attack!

00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:45.405
I don't wanna lose heart,

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:48.408
but I think Blue
Maiden's gonna lose hers!

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:50.911
By activating
Wonder Heart's ability,

00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:52.846
it avoids being
destroyed in battle,

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:54.849
and I don't take any damage!

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.251
And then, after the battle,
I can unequip

00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:01.154
Marincess Blue Slug
and summon her to my field!

00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:07.994
But for how long will
she be able to stick around?

00:17:08.595 --> 00:17:12.333
Because by activating Hydradrive
Monarch's additional ability,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.168
you must choose
one of your Water monsters

00:17:15.168 --> 00:17:17.804
and send it directly
to the graveyard.

00:17:18.806 --> 00:17:19.573
Again?

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:21.909
(Bohman)
Yes. Again. Now choose.

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:23.577
I hate to do this but...

00:17:24.412 --> 00:17:25.979
I choose Blue Slug.

00:17:27.814 --> 00:17:31.351
When my Hydradrive Monarch's
ability successfully forces you

00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:33.320
to send a monster
to the graveyard,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.255
it is allowed to
attack again.

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:37.191
Take out her Wonder Heart!

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.927
I ‘ll use Wonder Heart's
ability again

00:17:40.194 --> 00:17:41.361
to protect her!

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:45.599
And then unequip Coral Anemone
and summon her to the field!

00:17:49.637 --> 00:17:53.140
But I can use my Hydradrive
Monarch's ability again

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:56.710
to make you choose one monster
to send to the graveyard.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.644
(grunts)

00:17:58.045 --> 00:18:00.380
She's stuck in
a lousy loop de loop!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.215
Coral Anemone...

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:03.617
Sorry about this.

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:07.754
But when I send my Coral Anemone
to the graveyard,

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.757
I can add Marincess
Sea Horse to my hand.

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:14.395
Hydradrive Monarch, attack
Wonder Heart again!

00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:16.563
(Blue Maiden)
And get bounced again!

00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:19.266
This time, I unequip
Marbled Rock

00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:20.901
and summon her to the field.

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.940
You know the drill,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.375
choose which monster
to destroy.

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.877
Not that you actually
have a choice.

00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:34.047
I send Marbled Rock
to the graveyard.

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:37.251
With that, Wonder Heart
no longer has

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:38.885
any monsters equipped.

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:39.987
(gasps)

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.723
Wonder Heart cannot use
its ability anymore

00:18:42.723 --> 00:18:44.158
to stop my attack.

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:47.728
Hydradrive Monarch,
destroy Wonder Heart!

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.930
Wonder Heart
can't use its ability,

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:51.832
but my Crown Tail can!

00:18:51.832 --> 00:18:52.599
What?

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:55.635
(Blue Maiden)
By sending a Marincess
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.704
the damage I take
is cut in half!

00:18:58.371 --> 00:18:59.206
(grunts)

00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:03.677
Then I get to summon Crown
Tail to the field!

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.815
Also, when Wonder Heart
is destroyed,

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:11.685
I get to revive Crystal Heart
from my graveyard.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.790
So which of those two monsters
will you destroy this time?

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:19.626
I'm sending Crown
Tail to the graveyard.

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:24.731
And yes, I know that means
you get to attack again.

00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:26.533
So c'mon.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.268
Just get it over with.

00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:33.140
My Hydradrive Monarch will
attack your Crystal Heart,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.441
just as you wish!

00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:37.878
And you just triggered
my Crown Tail's special ability!

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.514
By banishing her
from my graveyard...

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:43.317
For every Link Arrow
that the Marincesses

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:44.618
in my graveyard have,

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:46.854
I can reduce the battle
damage that I take

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:48.555
by a thousand points.

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:51.392
(Aqua)
The Marincesses currently
in our graveyard are

00:19:51.392 --> 00:19:53.561
Wonder Heart,
Marbled Rock,

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:56.163
Coral Anemone,
and Blue Slug.

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.333
And together, they have
ten links between them.

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:03.771
So we're not taking any damage
that's below 10,000 points.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.706
Which is a ton of points...

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.108
But we know
that's not enough.

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.276
Right, Aqua?

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.445
Yeah, because
Judgement Arrows

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:15.148
will double his monster's
attack points to 12,000.

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:18.052
(Blue Maiden)
But don't let anyone say
that Blue Maiden and Aqua

00:20:18.052 --> 00:20:20.020
didn't go down
without a fight!

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.622
That's right, Blue Maiden.

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:24.125
You never gave up
and that's why I'm proud

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:25.626
to be your partner.

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:26.527
Ditto.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:27.861
Thanks, Aqua.

00:20:37.037 --> 00:20:39.039
(screams)

00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:39.973
No!

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:40.941
Skye!

00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:42.509
(grunts)

00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:47.114
Even knowing that you
faced certain defeat,

00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:48.682
you did not surrender.

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.952
There is a certain nobility
to that that I appreciate.

00:20:53.887 --> 00:20:56.223
So allow me to show
you my nobility

00:20:56.223 --> 00:20:59.659
by affording you a compassion
that you did not afford me.

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.129
You did not give me
the opportunity to share

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:04.698
the final moments with
my brother Harlin,

00:21:04.965 --> 00:21:07.667
but I shall extend you
that courtesy.

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:09.703
Skye?

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:12.105
Akira?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:13.907
Skye!

00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:15.375
Skyeee!

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.451
Skye!

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:35.228
Akira... I'm here.

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.529
Skye...

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.431
(whimpers)
