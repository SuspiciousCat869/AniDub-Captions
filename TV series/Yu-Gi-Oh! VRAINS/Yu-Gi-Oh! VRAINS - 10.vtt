WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.504
(Ai)
Previously
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:07.108
Do you think Playmaker
can defeat Varis?

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:09.009
You better hope so
if you ever want to see

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.778
your sister up
and about again.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:14.581
So Playmaker,
remember that if I win

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.349
I gain control of your A.I.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.619
<i>Playmaker,
glitch this guy.</i>

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.420
(Varis)
You programs...

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.322
In fact,
this whole network world...

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.292
is an illusion that will lead
to the end of humanity.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.794
And my mission is to stop that!

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.530
People have to wake up
before it's too late!

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.467
I will destroy the Ignis
to save the world.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.170
And if that means
destroying you as well...

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.571
so be it.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.407
Let's Speed Duel!
Let's Speed Duel!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.276
I'm going in
for a closer look.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.578
Please keep me
apprised.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:52.085
It's Ghost Gal's camera!
Why's she tailing 'em?

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.921
Take out his Decode Talker!

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.823
Malicious Mayhem!

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:02.195
(grunting)

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.031
<i>Phew!
We're still alive.</i>

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.900
Be gone and never return!

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:20.547
♪♪♪

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.436
No!
It can't end like this!

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.638
Playmaker's done for!

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.244
It's not over, Varis!
I activate my trap!

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:29.750
Link Restart stops your Bomber
Dragon's special ability!

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.985
So your blast fizzles out!

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:35.789
Then I can banish
this trap card

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.291
to summon a Link Monster
from my graveyard!

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.261
Return to the battlefield,
Decode Talker!

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:45.499
Well now...

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.668
I theoretically should be
impressed that you found a way

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.370
to survive this turn,
Playmaker,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.071
but if you were
truly any good,

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.740
you shouldn't be losing
to begin with.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:55.776
All you've done
is delay your demise,

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.745
and Dragonoid Generator
will guarantee it!

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:02.148
This spell summons
another Dragonoid Token

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.383
onto your field.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.120
Which you will then use
against me to deal damage.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.558
It's my turn!

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.460
I draw!

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.396
<i>Get your act together,
Playmaker!</i>

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:19.633
<i>If I had sweat glands, I'd be
swamped waist-deep in AI juice!</i>

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:20.868
That's gross.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.337
<i>Not as gross
as your moves!</i>

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:24.872
<i>Face the facts,</i>

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:28.875
<i>you're backed into a corner,
but you still got a way out!</i>

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:31.212
By using my Skill?

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:32.779
<i>Exactly!</i>

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.149
<i>But even that might not be
enough unless I can muster</i>

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:37.384
<i>the strength to create
the biggest Data Storm</i>

00:03:37.484 --> 00:03:40.488
<i>to blow through Link Vrains
in generations!</i>

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.356
So I need to hope
that <i>you'll</i> come through?

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:43.657
Not good.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.159
<i>Ugh.
Well, I do better than hope.</i>

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:47.661
<i>I calculate!</i>

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:56.002
<i>Cyberse, generate
new data material!</i>

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:14.888
Please, you must win this duel
and save my sister.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.194
This is so perfect.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:22.563
The fool is playing
right into my hands.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.899
He thinks he's helping himself,
but he's actually helping me.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.102
(Kogami)
Good. Very good, Varis.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.572
It's time to execute the next
phase of our plan.

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:34.708
Take this duel
to a whole new level.

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.419
There's the signal.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.527
<i>Let's do this, Playmaker!</i>

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:57.965
<i>Drown him in data before
the data drowns you!</i>

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:59.466
I use my Skill!

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:04.572
When I have less than
a thousand life points,

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:08.809
I can draw a new Link Monster
out of the Data Storm!

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.979
<i>And I've created
a whopper of wind!</i>

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:16.350
<i>If you don't get a powerful
monster, that's on you, not me!</i>

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.951
(growling)

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.665
<i>Seize the wind, Playmaker!</i>

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:33.466
Go, Storm Access!

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.741
I'm surprised
you didn't wipe out.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:43.177
<i>Nope!
But we'll wipe you out!</i>

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:44.644
Here I go!

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:47.113
Create the ultimate circuit!

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:50.684
You may have retrieved
a Link Monster,

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.120
but it's useless
if you can't summon it.

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:55.655
I activate the trap
Remote Rebirth!

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:58.792
What?

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:01.127
<i>Aww, glitchety, glitch,
glitch, glitch!</i>

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.397
(Varis)
This card allows me to resurrect
a monster from your graveyard

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:07.834
and summon it next to Topologic
Bomber Dragon's link arrow!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:08.836
No way!

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:12.873
I resurrect Capacitor Stalker!

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.075
But why?
You know what this means?

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:17.478
Of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.347
I'm the one who actually made
the move, Playmaker.

00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.182
By bringing back your monster,

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.851
I've triggered Topologic Bomber
Dragon's special ability

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:27.520
allowing me to destroy
all three of your monsters!

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:29.756
(roaring)

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.832
And by destroying your Capacitor
Stalker again, Playmaker,

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.168
we both take 800 points of
damage to our life points.

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.810
<i>This duel ends in a tie?</i>

00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:51.679
Oh, it's far from the end.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:55.081
In fact, this duel is
only getting started!

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.425
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.060
I've intensified the strength
of the Data Storm.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.496
So you're using
the Data Storm against me?

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.298
Yes, precisely.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.868
A Speed Duel isn't enough
to settle our differences.

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:16.970
We need more.
Much more!

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.972
(laughs menacingly)

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.743
(Kolter)
Yusaku!

00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:29.650
Ahh...

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.386
(laughs menacingly)

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.455
What's the status,
Ghost Gal?

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:36.790
<i>The storm
swallowed 'em up!</i>

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.159
(Zaizen)
<i>You have to Get in there
and save Playmaker!</i>

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.427
<i>You crazy?</i>

00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:42.396
<i>I don't know
if I can save myself!</i>

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:43.763
Ugh...

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.767
Sorry, Skye.

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:50.137
I failed you.

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:52.539
(Bishop)
This cannot be happening!

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.442
Since when did
the Knights of Hanoi

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:57.244
learn to control the Data Storm?

00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:59.946
Only one man
could've done this.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.716
But that would be
impossible.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.784
(screaming)

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.892
(Playmaker)
We're in the eye of the storm.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.360
It's quiet here.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.996
(Ai)
Yeah, too quiet,
as the expression goes,

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:18.198
<i>according to my dictionary
of colloquialisms!</i>

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:19.800
<i>That's a mouthful.</i>

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.835
<i>And the definition says that
something bad's gonna happen</i>

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.970
<i>because something bad
always happens!</i>

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.306
You're right.

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:30.210
Found you, Varis!

00:08:33.447 --> 00:08:35.716
Well, I wasn't hiding.

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:39.019
Now we can continue our fight
away from prying eyes.

00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:49.063
Speed Dueling is done.

00:08:49.163 --> 00:08:50.898
It's time to Master Duel.

00:08:50.998 --> 00:08:52.832
Really?
A Master Duel?

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:57.338
As you know, the Monster,
Spell and Trap Zones

00:08:57.438 --> 00:08:59.807
expand from three to five.

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.876
So Link Monsters will now
have more opportunities

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:04.545
to connect
with other monsters,

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.047
allowing them to strengthen
their abilities,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.449
so you'll find out what
they're truly capable of.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:12.886
Well, then...

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.921
are we going to talk or duel?

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:23.364
<i>Huh?
What's that card?</i>

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.734
One that I am sure must be
useful in a Master Duel.

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.368
<i>He's stacking the deck!</i>

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:31.404
<i>It's like he's been planning
to duel like this all along!</i>

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:32.606
Are you ready?

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:35.342
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:45.719
The winds are too strong!

00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:47.088
I can't get in!

00:09:47.188 --> 00:09:50.056
Well, bud, hope you're
doin' okay in there.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.759
I will make the first move.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.596
Ah, good.
I activate Fire Prison.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:04.838
Now I have you trapped in here
with me and there's no escape.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:07.041
Furthermore,
the spell card Fire Prison

00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:09.042
raises the defense points
of all dragons

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.045
that are on the field by 300.

00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:13.880
Plus, only our Link Monsters
are allowed

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.883
to attack inside these bars.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.385
But you won't even be able
to summon a Link Monster

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.087
unless it's at least
tied for the most Link Arrows

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:22.889
out of every monster
on the field.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.525
<i>Big deal! If we destroy that
spell, it's smooth sailin'!</i>

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.061
That's where you're wrong.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.596
Fire Prison can't be destroyed
by any of your cards!

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:31.098
So it's invincible?

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:34.267
<i>That means we gotta summon our
Link Monster before he does.</i>

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.869
<i>We shouldn't have
let him go first!</i>

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:38.038
<i>Stupid 20/20 hindsight!</i>

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:41.541
Somehow I sense this is
the least of the problems
we will face.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.079
I summon Sniffer Dragon
from my hand.

00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:49.383
(roars)

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.085
And with Sniffer Dragon's
special ability,

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.589
I'm allowed to draw a second
Sniffer Dragon from my deck

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:57.124
and add it to my hand.

00:10:57.224 --> 00:10:59.693
And believe me,
it'll come in handy.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:03.430
But for now, I activate
the spell Quick Launch!

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:07.134
It summons a Rokket monster
from my deck.

00:11:07.168 --> 00:11:10.971
So I bring my Magnarokket
Dragon to the field!

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:16.176
<i>This looks like bad news,
Playmaker!</i>

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:19.079
Knowing Varis,
it's bound to get even worse.

00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:22.449
Now watch as I manifest
my circuit!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.293
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:37.364
I require two Level 4 or lower
Dragons in order to Link Summon.

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:41.268
So I shall use my Sniffer Dragon
and my Magnarokket Dragon!

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:42.469
(growls)

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:47.240
Link the circuit!

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:57.951
I Link Summon Link 2 Twin
Triangle Dragon!

00:12:05.026 --> 00:12:06.560
And that's not all.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.863
I summon Linkbelt Wall Dragon
in defense!

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.536
But how so?

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:18.405
By taking advantage
of every single move I make.

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.240
When I Link Summon a Dragon,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.510
I can also automatically summon
Linkbelt Wall Dragon.

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:26.514
And I shall make it even harder
for you to Link Summon

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.517
by putting two Wall Counters
on Linkbelt.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.018
Now neither of us
can summon a Link Monster

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.888
if its Link is greater than
the number of Wall Counters.

00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:38.025
So you can forget
about summoning
your most powerful ones!

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.393
And that's not all!

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.762
My Field Spell Fire Prison
gives Linkbelt

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:44.030
300 extra defense points!

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.167
He gave it more
defense points.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.903
<i>Uh, care to share
with your partner?</i>

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:51.838
I didn't expect Varis
to be focusing

00:12:51.872 --> 00:12:53.674
more on defense than offense.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.877
<i>I'd be scared to attack too if
I was getting your stink eye.</i>

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:00.947
(Playmaker, thinking)
What's he planning?

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:03.717
You're up, Playmaker.
Show me what you got!

00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:06.821
Oh, I will!
I draw!

00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:10.824
Before you make your move,
Linkbelt Wall Dragon gains

00:13:10.925 --> 00:13:13.627
a Wall Counter
during each of our turns!

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:17.130
<i>Ugh, he already has
his Link Monster,</i>

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.734
<i>but he capped us so that we can
only summon a Link 2 or 3!</i>

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.269
<i>Think you can thread
this needle?</i>

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.804
<i>Because if you don't,
he's gonna sew up a victory</i>

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.707
<i>and I find that simply
unacceptable</i>

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.075
<i>to my high standards.</i>

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.744
Fine then. Will summoning
this card meet your standards?

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:34.214
<i>Ooh, Linkslayer!</i>

00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:36.584
<i>This is more than acceptable,
Playmaker!</i>

00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:38.085
<i>I knew you could do it!</i>

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:40.553
<i>And it's all thanks
to my pep talk!</i>

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:44.658
<i>Linkslayer! Attack and destroy
Twin Triangle Dragon!</i>

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:46.226
It can't.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:48.762
Due to Linkbelt Wall Dragon's
special ability,

00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:50.464
only Link Monsters can attack.

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.600
<i>Wh-- What?
I mean, I knew that.</i>

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:56.403
<i>T-T-Then instead use
Linkslayer's special ability!</i>

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:58.772
Can't.
Fire Prison blocks that, too

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.541
<i>Wh-- What?
I mean, I knew that, too.</i>

00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:04.644
But here comes something that
I'm actually allowed to do.

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:08.849
I can automatically summon
Backup Secretary

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:11.886
when I have a Cyberse
monster on my field.

00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.721
And then,
I summon Stack Reviver!

00:14:17.825 --> 00:14:20.160
I can now create my circuit!

00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:25.832
Link Arrows authorized!

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:29.636
The summoning conditions are
at least two Cyberse monsters.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:32.673
And now, I'm going to set
my Backup Secretary,

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:35.876
Linkslayer and Stack Reviver
in the Link Arrows!

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.314
Link the circuit!

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:44.819
I Link Summon!

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:47.153
Link 3, Encode Talker!

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.063
My, my,
how impressive.

00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:59.233
My Stack Reviver's ability
now activates!

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.068
Since I used it
to Link Summon,

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:05.372
it lets me resurrect a Cyberse
monster from my graveyard!

00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.709
Coming back is
my Backup Secretary!

00:15:13.413 --> 00:15:14.882
Encode Talker!

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:18.886
Attack and destroy Varis's
Twin Triangle Dragon!

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.387
That's not going
to happen.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.588
Why?

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:24.024
Because Linkbelt Wall Dragon
won't let it!

00:15:24.058 --> 00:15:26.393
When it's on the field,
it's the only monster

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:28.728
your Link Monsters
are allowed to attack!

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:35.569
Very well then.

00:15:35.669 --> 00:15:37.004
Since I took damage,

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:39.539
I'm now allowed to summon
Interrupt Resistor.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:44.712
This Cyberse monster
gains attack points

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:47.348
equal to the damage
that I just took.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:49.249
You mean
a mere 100 points?

00:15:49.349 --> 00:15:51.618
You're not foolish enough
to actually attack me

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:52.920
with that, are you?

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.554
<i>Uh, no!</i>

00:15:54.588 --> 00:15:57.624
<i>That's why it's in defense
mode for 2,100 points!</i>

00:15:57.724 --> 00:16:00.694
<i>See, Playmaker may not be
the brightest bulb in the lamp,</i>

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:02.429
<i>but he has me to shed
the light!</i>

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:05.432
<i>So listen up, partner!
Play that card on your left!</i>

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.800
I was going to anyway.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:09.637
I activate the spell
Cyberse Cache!

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:11.838
Since my Cyberse
attack points changed,

00:16:11.938 --> 00:16:13.607
I get to draw two cards
from my deck!

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:20.747
<i>And two extra cards
means an infinite
number of new options!</i>

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:22.949
Hmph.
Good for you.

00:16:23.016 --> 00:16:25.452
I place one card facedown...

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:27.655
and end my turn.

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:30.924
(Varis)
Even with your so-called
limitless options,

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.128
you still couldn't get past
my Linkbelt Wall Dragon.

00:16:34.194 --> 00:16:36.630
That's true,
at least for now.

00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:40.134
But you do not know what
the future holds, Varis.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.970
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.672
My Linkbelt will now gain
another counter!

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.945
And I summon another Dragon!
Come out!

00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:52.646
Autorokket Dragon!

00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:57.317
Now, I manifest
my circuit again!

00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:01.054
<i>Aww, glitch!</i>

00:17:01.154 --> 00:17:02.556
<i>He's Link Summoning again!</i>

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:05.693
<i>But this time,
he can summon a Link 4 monster!</i>

00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:07.561
A Link 4.

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:09.196
That can only mean one thing!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.865
<i>Yeah, the ace monster
in his deck,</i>

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:14.167
<i>Topologic Bomber Dragon!</i>

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:20.174
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:21.809
The summoning conditions
required

00:17:21.842 --> 00:17:23.644
are at least two monsters.

00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:27.848
I will now set my Twin Triangle
Dragon and my Autorokket Dragon

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:29.516
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.888
Link the circuit!

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:35.189
I Link Summon!

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:37.924
Link 3 Triple Burst Dragon!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:52.005
Now Linkbelt Wall Dragon's
special ability activates.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:55.509
Since I summoned a monster
whose Link is less than 4,

00:17:55.543 --> 00:17:57.811
I'm required to remove
two Wall Counters

00:17:57.845 --> 00:17:59.179
from Linkbelt Wall Dragon.

00:18:01.815 --> 00:18:04.385
<i>I don't know why he summoned
his weaker Triple Burst</i>

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:06.586
<i>instead of
Topologic Bomber Dragon,</i>

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:09.757
<i>but either way,
Encode Talker's toast!</i>

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.560
Triple Burst Dragon, unleash
your wave of destruction

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.228
on Playmaker's monster!

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:18.131
Take aim and fire
at Backup Secretary!

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.467
<i>He's not attacking
Encode Talker?</i>

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.905
You've just made
an unwise choice, Varis.

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:28.108
Since Encode Talker is linked
to Backup Secretary,

00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:30.076
not only does
she avoid destruction,

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:32.279
but I also don't take
any damage.

00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:33.947
This mistake will cost you.

00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:35.382
You're wrong.

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:38.085
I don't even know
the concept of making mistakes.

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:41.088
When my Triple Burst Dragon
battles your monster,

00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:45.259
it completely shuts down your
Encode Talker's special ability.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:48.095
<i>Well we have tricks
up our sleeve, too!</i>

00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:51.665
I activate Interrupt Resistor's
special ability instead!

00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:54.001
Backup Secretary's
defense points

00:18:54.101 --> 00:18:55.903
become the same as Resistor's,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.704
and she can't be destroyed
in battle!

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.543
So? Even if your Backup
Secretary is in defense mode,

00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:05.880
Triple Burst Dragon's
ability allows it

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.048
to still deal you damage!

00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:19.160
And with that, I end my turn.

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:21.495
So your Backup Secretary's
defense points

00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:22.896
drop down to 800.

00:19:24.665 --> 00:19:26.733
<i>He dealt you a wee bit
of damage,</i>

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.302
<i>but it would have been worse
if he made better moves.</i>

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:31.805
I'm not so sure
about that, Ai.

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:34.608
My gut says
we're overlooking something.

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:37.144
Maybe he actually is
executing a strategy,

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.479
just not one we expected.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.951
Well, did you forget that
it's your turn, Playmaker?

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:46.654
No, I didn't!
I draw!

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.390
That triggers Linkbelt
Wall Dragon's ability!

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:51.658
It gains another Wall Counter!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.661
<i>You know, it'd be nice
if you get rid of that dragon.</i>

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.663
<i>Just a pro tip.</i>
I know.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.499
Trust me,
I'm working on it.

00:19:58.566 --> 00:20:00.834
First, I summon Balancer Lord!

00:20:04.137 --> 00:20:06.806
And with it, I can Link Summon!

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:14.482
Link Arrows authorized!

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:17.718
I set Balancer Lord,
Interrupt Resistor,

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:20.387
and Backup Secretary
in the Link Arrows!

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:26.359
Link the circuit!

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:32.332
And now, I Link Summon again!

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:35.835
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:38.805
Decode Talker gains
500 attack points

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.807
for every monster
that it's linked to!

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.145
Power Integration!

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:50.551
<i>See that, Varis?</i>

00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:53.520
<i>Decode Talker's gonna
decimate your dragon!</i>

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.555
Are you sure?

00:20:55.655 --> 00:20:58.559
I'm always two steps
ahead of you.

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:02.262
I activate the effect of
my Field Spell, Fire Prison!

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:09.703
What is this?

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.671
All Cyberses on your field,

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:13.674
and in your graveyard
and hand

00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:16.610
lose their special abilities
and can no longer attack!

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.213
In addition,
they can't be attacked

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:22.082
nor targeted by effects.

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:25.051
It's as if they don't
exist at all.

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.027
They're all disintegrating!

00:21:35.262 --> 00:21:37.398
<i>Not... just them.</i>

00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:39.733
<i>I-I don't feel so good.</i>

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:42.903
<i>I'm-- I'm feeling
all glitchy...</i>

00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:44.571
<i>g-g-glitchy...</i>

00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:46.907
<i>(distorted slurring)</i>

00:21:47.007 --> 00:21:48.375
Ai!

00:21:48.442 --> 00:21:50.210
Cyberse, be gone!

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.715
Ai...
