WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.170
(Ai)
Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.575
Jin is your partner?

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.643
(Lightning)
That would imply
some form of kinship

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.578
that does not exist.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.614
After Bohman brought him to me,

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:14.981
I imprisoned him deep

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.451
within his own consciousness,

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.487
so he's not going anywhere.

00:00:19.487 --> 00:00:21.255
I, along with Bohman

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.624
will have to put
an end to humanity.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.926
(Playmaker)
Now I understand
why Bohman's deck

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.961
kept getting stronger
with every meeting.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.096
Because you two
were working together

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.433
and you were supplying him
with new cards.

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:34.034
Like JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.602
(Lightning)You mean
the card that was used

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.804
to destroy the Cyberse?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:38.939
That means...

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.274
the one who destroyed
the Cyberse was...

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:41.675
Lightning?

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.309
This was all

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.977
for the greater good.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.981
Windy and I were planning
to rebuild the Cyberse anyway!

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.849
And not just any Cyberse,

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.185
a better Cyberse than before.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.488
A Cyberse without
the threat from humanity.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.856
But there can never be peace

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.125
when it's built upon lies
and aggression.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.460
(Lightning)
This is war.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.329
And I will end anyone
who stands in my way,

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.398
human or Ignis.

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.198
Let's go.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.140
The Bohman you defeated
in the past

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.708
no longer exists.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.211
allow me to demonstrate
my superiority in a duel.

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.313
And when I win,

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:21.882
I will take your Ignis.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.884
It's time to Speed Duel!

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.196
(electronic whirring)

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.878
(electronic whirring)

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.284
(Kolter)
Playmaker and Soulburner
got split apart...

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:33.053
And neither duel is gonna be
an easy one.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.624
Time to begin our duel,
Playmaker.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.493
And as a gesture of good will,

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.328
I'll let you go first.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.629
Aww, thanks.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.830
But no, thanks!

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.466
We know your whole duel strategy

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:46.800
is based on going second

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.468
so you can't trick us!

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.436
Well, well, Ai...

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:50.104
You've been paying attention

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.472
to our previous duels.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:55.476
Then let's determine
the order another way.

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:58.812
Now follow me, Playmaker.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.881
Hey! I give the orders
around here!

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.682
Playmaker! Follow him!

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.150
Let's do this.

00:03:12.326 --> 00:03:13.728
Look, Ai.

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:16.363
We've gone back
into the fake Cyberse.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.031
The one that Windy created.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:19.900
(Ai)
Yeah...

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.202
But it looks real to me.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:22.135
Too real.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.137
And everything's breaking apart!

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.439
Keep it together.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.642
Don't let your eyes deceive you.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:29.777
I know!

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.812
I mean my brain knows...

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:34.815
But my heart knows that
this is exactly what happened

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:37.317
to the real Cyberse.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.818
(Ai whimpering)

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.688
(Bohman)
No, it wasn't.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:42.890
What?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.158
(Bohman)
What happened
to your homeworld...

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.293
was far worse.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.527
The spectacle you are seeing

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.464
before you, is nothing more
than a little taste.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.132
Because...

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.534
the reality...

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.835
was even more bleak...

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.770
More devastating.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.371
Stop smiling!

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.674
I can still see it in my head,

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:01.408
the ashes,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.276
the smoke.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.711
Everything burning.

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.913
It was magnificent.

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.914
(Ai)
Ya, know what would
be magnificent?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.585
Me giving you
a Cyber Smackdown!

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.287
Don't let him get to you, Ai.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:16.423
He's trying to make us angry
to throw us off our game.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.591
But we can't let him,

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.759
we have to be sure
to stay in control.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.095
I know, I know,

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.863
it's just that
he knows exactly

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:25.432
what buttons to press
to boil my bytes!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:26.967
Since when did Bohman learn

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.403
to bust out the mind games?

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.905
Lightning did say that
his intellect evolves

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.775
and improves every time
he's reborn.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.076
Hey, Playmaker...

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.511
the first one to fly past
that pillar of wind

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.614
chooses who goes
first in the duel.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.682
Agreed?

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:42.749
Yes, Bohman.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.884
Then game on!

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.797
Whoa!

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.700
Bohman's hangin' ten
like a boss!

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.535
(rumbling)
Whoa.

00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:03.670
While you're barely hanging on!

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.405
If you let the winds rip ya,

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.341
we won't just lose this race!

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.942
We'll lose our lives!

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.844
Yes, I know that, Ai.

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.247
But don't forget we've had
practice riding

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:15.148
a Data Storm before.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.251
Ooh, yeah, the good ol' days.

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.020
When we knew
who the enemies were

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.421
because they looked enemy-ish

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.691
and had names
that rhymed with embarrass.

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.826
Who'd of thought that
after everything we did,

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.661
it would all end up
in an all-out war

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.263
between the Ignises!

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:31.798
Like all that hard work
for nothing.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.466
I disagree.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.835
Instead, Ai...

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.838
Look at it as another challenge
that we must overcome.

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.139
Yeah...

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.340
You're right.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.975
Nothing's stopped us before,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:44.311
and nothing's stoppin' us now!

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.816
(rumbling)

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:51.952
Huh!
Ah!

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.920
(Ai)
Playmaker! Watch out!

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:57.958
Yusaku!

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.597
(Kolter)
Yusaku, no!

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.601
That sure was a close one.

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.703
But Bohman's still in the lead.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:17.478
It looks like I won
our little race.

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:20.247
So I'm choosing to go second
in our duel.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.915
Shocker!

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.218
It is time, Playmaker!

00:06:24.218 --> 00:06:25.552
Let's go!

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:26.720
Speed Duel!
Speed Duel!

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:29.990
It's my turn.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.992
(Ai)
We gotta knuckle up, Playmaker.

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:33.493
Bohman chose to go second

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.829
because you're not allowed
to attack on the first turn.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.664
If he busts out
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:40.601
to double his monster's attack
points like last time,

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.903
he can cream us like corn.

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:43.704
You're right, Ai.

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:44.405
But only if I don't

00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:46.373
shore up my defenses,

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:48.542
which I won't fail to do.

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:49.877
Starting with this,

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:52.213
The spell CYNET MINING!

00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:53.213
I can get a Level 4

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:55.415
or lower Cyberse
monster from my deck

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:58.752
by sending one card
in my hand to the graveyard.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.988
So I exchange DOTSCAPER...

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.255
for this!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.259
My Level 4 monster,
CYBERSE GADGET!

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.061
Which I will now summon
out to my field!

00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:11.832
(computer chirping)

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:15.236
And CYBERSE GADGET's
special ability activates!

00:07:15.236 --> 00:07:18.138
It allows me to revive a Level 2
or lower monster

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:21.208
from my graveyard
in defense mode.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.910
Come on back, DOTSCAPER!

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.412
(computer chirping)

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.315
But this monster won't be
staying on my field for long!

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:31.151
Because I'm setting DOTSCAPER
in the Link Arrow

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:33.153
to Link Summon!

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.988
Link 1 LINKURIBOH!

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:36.590
(computer chirping)
(indistinct language)

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.957
And then...

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.091
DOTSCAPE

00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:41.094
R's special
ability activates!

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:42.495
When it's sent to the graveyard,

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.965
it resummons itself to my field!

00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:48.736
(computer chirping)

00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:49.937
Next up...

00:07:49.937 --> 00:07:52.105
I'll Link Summon again!

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.742
The summoning conditions require

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.577
two Cyberse monsters

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.211
so I set CYBERSE GADGET

00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.380
and LINKURIBOH

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.615
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:02.950
I now Link Summon!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.219
Link 2 CYBERSE WITCH!

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:06.353
(computer chirping)

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:09.223
Since I sent my CYBERSE
GADGET to the graveyard,

00:08:09.223 --> 00:08:11.692
I can activate its
special ability to summon

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:14.362
a GADGET TOKEN to my field!

00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:15.896
(computer chirping)

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:19.033
And doing so triggers my
CYBERSE WITCH's ability!

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:20.200
When a monster is summoned

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.269
next to
CYBERSE WITCH's link,

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.671
I can banish a spell card
from my graveyard

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.006
to add a Ritual Spell

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.708
and a Cyberse Ritual Monster

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.643
from my deck to my hand.

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:33.314
So I banish CYNET MINING
from my graveyard...

00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:34.882
to add CYNET RITUAL

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.350
and CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.551
to my hand!

00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.453
CYBERSE WITCH can also resummon

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:41.722
a Level 4
or lower Cyberse monster

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.156
from my graveyard,

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:46.026
so I resurrect
CYBERSE GADGET!

00:08:46.894 --> 00:08:48.629
(computer chirping)

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.030
That lets me activate,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.867
my Ritual Spell CYNET RITUAL!

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.336
I tribute
my Level 2 GADGET TOKEN,

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.205
Level 4 CYBERSE GADGET

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.740
and Level 1 DOTSCAPER!

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.443
I, Ritual Summon!

00:09:03.443 --> 00:09:05.679
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:07.915
(clanks)
Ooh!

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.082
(computer chirping)

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:11.018
And I'll equip it with this!

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:14.554
My Equip Spell, GRID ROD!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.423
It not only protects my MAGICIAN

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:17.891
from your effects and abilities,

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.392
but it also stops
my MAGICIAN

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.396
from being destroyed
in battle once per turn!

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:23.564
And it gives my MAGICIAN

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:26.133
300 extra attack points!
(timer beeping)

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.301
Oh, yeah!

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.269
Bohman's not
bustin' thru this!

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.838
And with that
I'm ending my turn.

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:33.407
You're up, Bohman.

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:34.542
Wow...

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:36.209
I can't believe he summoned
a monster

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.911
as powerful
as CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.413
on his very first turn.

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:42.283
Bohman's sure got his work
cut out for him.

00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:42.950
Playmaker,

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.018
a bit earlier you had

00:09:44.018 --> 00:09:45.452
talked about your plan...

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:48.255
To shore up your defenses
to make it impenetrable

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.924
against my attacks.

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:51.291
Maybe a plan such as that

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.593
would've worked
against the old Bohman.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.896
But as you'll soon see,
it won't work against me now!

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:57.965
It's my turn!

00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.532
I draw!

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.269
I summon HYDRADRIVE
BOOSTER! (computer chirping)

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.204
And...

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:07.774
I'll use it to generate
my circuit!

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.276
I Link Summon!

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:11.612
Link 1 FLOW HYDRADRIVE!

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:12.879
(roars)

00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:14.915
(computer chirping)

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.716
And next I activate...

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.120
the spell HYDRADRIVE REBUILD!

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.055
It destroys one HYDRADRIVE
on my field.

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.426
So FLOW HYDRADRIVE, be gone!

00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:28.596
Huh? Why would he wanna
destroy his own card?

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:29.630
Because that triggers

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.032
FLOW HYDRADRIVE's
special ability.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:34.301
(Bohman)
Correct you are, Playmaker.

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.370
When FLOW HYDRADRDIVE
is destroyed,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.107
I can summon a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN
in defense mode.

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:41.208
Uhh, yeah...

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:43.210
But I'd rather have
FLOW HYDRADRIVE

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.245
than a tiny TOKEN...

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:44.912
No one has ever said

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:47.581
that I can't have both.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.617
HYDRADRIVE REBUILD's
additional effect activates,

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.552
letting me resummon
a HYDRADRIVE

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:53.587
from my graveyard

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:55.422
by negating
its special abilities.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:56.757
That allows me to bring back

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.260
FLOW HYDRADRIVE
to my Main Monster Zone!

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.994
(computer chirping)

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.429
I see!

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:05.499
By destroying and resurrecting
FLOW HYDRADRIVE,

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.968
you were able to move it
from your Extra Monster Zone

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:09.603
to your Main Monster Zone.

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:10.237
And if it's in my

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:12.306
Main Monster Zone...

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.474
I'm allowed to activate...

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:16.644
the Link Spell JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:11:16.644 --> 00:11:17.311
Which will double my

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.346
monster's attack points

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.814
when I attack!

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.951
That sure don't tickle my toes,

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.352
but on the bright side

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.788
even if he doubles
his monster's attack points,

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:30.257
our CYBERSE MAGICIAN
is still stronger.

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.624
You're right.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.962
But I intend to change that
by activating this spell!

00:11:34.962 --> 00:11:36.496
HYDRADRIVE DEFRAGMENT

00:11:36.496 --> 00:11:39.432
allows me to destroy
your Equip Spell, GRID ROD!

00:11:39.432 --> 00:11:41.802
You see, GRID ROD may protect
your monster

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.069
from destruction...

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.505
but it cannot protect itself!

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:49.075
(timer beeping)

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.410
Uh...

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.745
that changed nothing, dude.

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:53.613
Even with double
the attack points,

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:56.317
CYBERSE MAGICIAN is still
stronger than your monster!

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:59.153
Now, now, patience little one,
patience.

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:02.056
Did you really think
I was done with all my moves?

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:04.024
I'm just getting started!

00:12:04.024 --> 00:12:04.725
I set my HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:08.094
in the Link Arrow!

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:11.398
I Link Summon!

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.302
Link 1 BURN HYDRADRIVE!

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:18.205
Next I activate HYDRADRIVE
DEFRAGMENT's effect

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:19.873
from my graveyard!

00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.241
By banishing this card,

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.644
I can retrieve
a HYDRADRIVE spell card

00:12:23.644 --> 00:12:24.578
from my graveyard.

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.212
So HYDRADRIVE REBUILD

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:29.350
returns to my hand!

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.719
Is that the card he used
to create a loopy loop

00:12:31.719 --> 00:12:33.053
to get more monsters?

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.721
Ah, it is!

00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.392
I activate HYDRADRIVE REBUILD
once again!

00:12:38.392 --> 00:12:42.029
And destroy BURN HYDRADRIVE!

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.263
By doing so,

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.066
BURN HYDRADRIVE's
special ability activates,

00:12:46.066 --> 00:12:49.069
allowing me to summon
a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN!

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:51.639
And like with my
FLOW HYDRADRIVE,

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:54.207
BURN HYDRADRIVE
resurrects too!

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.078
(computer chirping)

00:12:57.078 --> 00:13:00.948
And now,
I'll generate my circuit again!

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:02.716
I set my HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:04.985
in the Link Arrow
to Link Summon!

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.588
Link 1 COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.623
(computer chirping)

00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:10.924
These are the same
three monsters

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:12.493
he had in our last duel.

00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:14.127
And if history
is to repeat itself,

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.931
he'll use them to summon
his most powerful monster!

00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:19.666
Here I go Playmaker!

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:21.802
The summoning conditions

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:25.272
require three HYDRADRIVE
Link Monsters.

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:26.640
I Link Summon!

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.641
Link 3

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.077
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD!

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.315
(computer chirping)

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:36.817
That monster almost
beat us last time,

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:40.120
and we got less to work
with this time!

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:48.062
Your chances of victory
are dimming, Playmaker.

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:50.130
Because my TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE LORD

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.133
gains the abilities
of the three monsters

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:53.467
I used to summon it.

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:56.070
And if any of your monsters
share those Attributes,

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.372
their special abilities
are negated!

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:01.108
That means his TRIDENT
has three Attributes:

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:01.542
Wind,

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:02.176
Water,

00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:03.343
and Fire.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:04.879
Then it's a good thing
CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.213
is a Dark Attribute

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:09.216
cuz that means we can
still use its abilities!

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:10.350
What you say is true

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.619
but you are focusing
on the wrong thing.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:13.887
Which is that my TRIDENT

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:16.524
is now strong enough
to destroy your MAGICIAN!

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:17.724
Aww, glitch!

00:14:17.724 --> 00:14:20.861
I will now place
one card facedown!

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.162
(computer chirping)

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:22.896
And then...

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.898
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:28.168
attack CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:30.670
And due to JUDGMENT
ARROWS's effect,

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.207
it will be an attack
that's twice as strong!

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.175
(timer beeping)

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:38.679
Not so fast Bohman!

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:41.181
When CYBERSE MAGICIAN
battles a Link Monster,

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:44.517
it gains 1000 attack
points. (timer beeping)

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.019
It matters not.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:48.689
My TRIDENT is still stronger!

00:14:48.689 --> 00:14:50.290
I'm also going to activate

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.859
GRID ROD's effect
from my graveyard!

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:54.661
It prevents my CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:57.831
from being destroyed
in battle this turn.

00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:00.567
And CYBERSE MAGICIAN
has its own ability.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.236
All the damage I take
is cut in half!

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.338
(whirring)

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:06.173
(grunts)

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:07.575
(shooting)

00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:08.875
(blasting)

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:10.543
(Playmaker grunts)

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:12.713
(timer beeping)

00:15:12.713 --> 00:15:14.848
I have a question for you,
Playmaker.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:16.917
You had to use every card
in your arsenal

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.351
to survive this turn,

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.955
so how do you expect
to survive the next one?

00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:23.290
With one thing we have
that you don't!

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:23.857
And once we figure out

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.926
what that is,

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.928
you better watch out!

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.630
Now that it's our turn,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.964
I draw!

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:32.966
Huh?

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:33.800
Oh! Ha!

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:35.702
I'll start my turn...

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:36.737
by playing...

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:38.105
RESUME MACE!

00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:39.272
Ha!

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.042
I equip this spell on
my CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.780
RESUME MACE lowers my MAGICIAN's

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.584
attack points by 800.
(timer beeping)

00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:53.220
What? Did Playmaker just weaken
his own monster?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.789
If I send RESUME MACE
to the graveyard,

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.591
then the original attack points

00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.461
of my CYBERSE MAGICIAN
are doubled!

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.194
Ah, I see.

00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:01.996
That would allow you to destroy

00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:04.498
my TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:05.799
at least in theory.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:06.467
That's right!

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:07.200
I attack--

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.469
(Ai)
Waaaaaait!

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:09.469
Huh?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:10.604
Before you attack,

00:16:10.604 --> 00:16:13.073
I think you should play
the card you just drew.

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:14.408
Seriously!

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:15.842
The one I just drew?

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.413
But we don't need to use it yet.

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:22.082
I know we don't need to,
but I think we want to.

00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:22.849
If Bohman is evolvin' and

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:25.585
getting stronger by the moment,

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:26.954
then we gotta take our chances

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:28.422
while we still can...

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:30.324
instead of savin'
that card for later.

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:31.325
I don't know, Ai--

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:34.495
But I do! I do! I do!
I really do!

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.263
Like a thousand percent do!

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:38.198
A thousand percent?

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:40.034
Okay, not a thousand...

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.403
Maybe not even a hundred
or a ten

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:44.438
but my gut's tellin' me
to play it,

00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:46.773
which is crazy cuz
I don't have any guts.

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:48.008
I don't know why

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.177
but you just gotta
trust me on this one.

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:50.944
Very well.

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.814
Now, I'm going to activate

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:57.017
the Equip Spell SUSPEND WAND
from my hand!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.986
And equip it on
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:05.492
You're playing another
Equip Spell?

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:08.162
Go! CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:17:08.162 --> 00:17:09.229
Attack!

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:13.433
Go!

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:14.801
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:16.203
Attack!

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:19.073
I activate...

00:17:19.073 --> 00:17:21.675
my SUSPEND WAND's effect!

00:17:21.675 --> 00:17:23.510
What?
Why are you activating that?

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.211
That card will not help you

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.647
destroy my monster.

00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:27.814
Yes,

00:17:27.814 --> 00:17:29.416
this card won't help
do that at all.

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:32.052
In fact you can say
it's a detriment to me.

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.754
Because any damage I now take,

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:35.322
is doubled!

00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:36.590
What?

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.725
And it gets even worse for you!

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.661
Because JUDGMENT ARROWS doubles

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.330
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD's
attack points.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.499
But CYBERSE MAGICIAN's
own ability

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.368
raises its attack points
by 1000!

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:49.903
(Bohman)
That's not enough!

00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:51.705
(shooting)

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.574
(blasting)

00:17:56.143 --> 00:17:57.210
(Playmaker grunts)

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.378
I don't get it...

00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:01.114
Why would Playmaker
want to take more damage?

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.117
The thing about SUSPEND WAND
is that--

00:18:03.117 --> 00:18:05.919
Sure, we take double the damage,
but in exchange,

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.454
it prevents CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:09.123
from being destroyed in battle.

00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:11.458
Plus, CYBERSE MAGICIAN's
additional ability

00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.293
cuts the damage we take in half.

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:16.130
So double the damage,
then half the damage, is a wash!

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.065
Well, a rough wash
with a grout scrubber,

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:19.599
but we're still
alive and clean!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.768
And SUSPEND WAND
has an additional effect!

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:22.603
It lets CYBERSE

00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:25.939
MAGICIAN attack again!

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.975
Attacking me twice in a row?!

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:30.577
Now go, CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:33.881
Attack TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD!

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:35.115
And for this attack,

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.784
I activate RESUME MACE's effect!

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.786
I can double CYBERSE MAGICIAN's

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.121
original attack points
(computer chirping)

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.657
by sending my MACE
to the graveyard!

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:47.093
Raising it to 5000
attack points!

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:48.662
(timer beeping)

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.931
But JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:53.566
doubles my monster's
attack points as well!

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:54.768
(timer beeping)

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:57.104
And with my MAGICIAN's ability,

00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:59.105
It gains 1000
attack points!

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.341
(timer beeping)

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.678
But I can raise its
attack points even higher!

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:07.047
By sending SUSPEND WAND
to the graveyard,

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:08.348
CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:10.384
gains attack points
equal to the battle damage

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.218
I took this turn!

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:14.221
(timer beeping)

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.057
7900 attack points?!

00:19:17.057 --> 00:19:20.026
This is not characteristic
of Playmaker's dueling style.

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:20.794
He could've used his RESUME MACE

00:19:20.794 --> 00:19:23.230
to destroy my monster,

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.698
but he used SUSPEND WAND

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:26.033
also so that he could deal me

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:27.934
as much damage as possible,

00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:29.870
even going so far as to damage

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.806
his own life points.

00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:34.375
Why such a risky strategy?

00:19:34.375 --> 00:19:35.041
Huh?

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:39.279
Cuz it's the right one!

00:19:40.181 --> 00:19:41.648
I see now.

00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:43.951
It was your idea.

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.520
Go, CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:46.887
(Playmaker)

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:47.888
Attack!

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.691
(shooting)

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.195
(groans)

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:55.795
(computer chirping)

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:56.696
(timer beeping)

00:19:57.998 --> 00:19:59.232
Not good!

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:01.168
Playmaker still has
another monster on his field

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:02.703
that he's able to attack with.

00:20:02.703 --> 00:20:03.303
If he does, Bohman

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:05.439
's beat!

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:08.209
Remember how he said we
wouldn't survive our next turn?

00:20:08.209 --> 00:20:10.510
Looks like he was talking
to the mirror!

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.480
(Ai laughing)

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.781
Did you really think

00:20:13.781 --> 00:20:16.183
that you could defeat me
that easily?

00:20:16.183 --> 00:20:17.784
I activate my trap,

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.820
PROPERTY FLASH!

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.990
For every 1000 points
of damage that I took,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.625
I place a Property Counter
on this card.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:27.294
And for the rest of this turn,

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:29.963
you're no longer
allowed to attack.

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:31.031
I can't?

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:32.666
Aw, we were so close to winning!

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:33.333
(Bohman)

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:34.535
No, you weren't.

00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:35.869
In fact...

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:38.806
you became so impatient

00:20:38.806 --> 00:20:41.108
that you wasted
your cards carelessly.

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:43.978
But it wasn't your strategy,
was it?

00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:44.778
No.

00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:46.213
It was Ai's.

00:20:46.213 --> 00:20:48.648
And I'd do the same
strategy again!

00:20:48.648 --> 00:20:50.517
Cuz when I see a chance
to win the duel

00:20:50.517 --> 00:20:52.519
instead of dragging it
on and on,

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.520
I'm taking it!

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.856
I didn't mean it as an insult.

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.724
Quite the opposite.

00:20:57.724 --> 00:21:00.861
Because it would take a special
AI to choose

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:03.230
not to make
the most logical plays.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.366
Lightning once told me
that you have one key attribute

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:08.535
that I do not possess.

00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:09.903
Movie star looks?

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:13.273
No, you have something that
shouldn't be programmable.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.409
You, Ai, have what is called...

00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:16.343
Instinct.

00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:17.577
Instinct?

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.246
I stink?

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:21.414
But I shower every day!

00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:22.783
Okay, I don't.

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:26.920
You may truly be an Ignis
unlike any other.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.023
The key to everything!
