WEBVTT

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.342
(New Guard sighs)

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.110
I don't know
why she's in jail,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.979
but she sure
stole my heart...

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.781
(Veteran Guard)
You don't know
who she is?

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:15.115
Rookies...

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.951
You're swooning over one
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.987
You might not
wanna do that.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.921
What?

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.123
She's really
a Knight of Hanoi?

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:23.957
Yeah.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.794
In fact she's one of
the ringleaders of that group.

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:28.662
You remember
The Deleted,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.331
the computer virus
that infected people's minds

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:32.499
and knocked ‘em out?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.134
That was all her.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.770
Baira's as dangerous
as they come.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.671
Whoa...

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.506
I guess looks
can be deceiving

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.975
because she doesn't seem
scary to me at all.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.577
Give her
a computer terminal

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.980
and you'll see the damage
she can cause.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.581
There's a reason
she's locked up

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.183
in this super-max
prison--

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.652
because you don't want
hackers like her roamin' free.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.990
Just be thankful
that the Knights of Hanoi

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.290
are gone forever.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.561
(Spectre)
There's a new Ignis
on the scene.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:11.398
(Genome)
Along with a new
duelist.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.501
(Faust)
Yes, Soulburner
and Flame.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:18.205
I've also learned that
the Cyberse has been destroyed,

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.907
and it wasn't by us.

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.379
(Spectre)
We may have an
unexpected ally

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.214
who wants to
eradicate the Ignis

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.149
just as badly
as we do.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.953
Perhaps humanity's
coming to their senses.

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.287
(Faust)
I doubt that.

00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.891
If that was truly the case,
we wouldn't have to keep

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.327
continuing our work
in secret, Spectre.

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:43.397
They still lay blame
on the Knights of Hanoi

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.766
for attempting to destroy
all of LINK VRAINS

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.901
and the entire
digital network.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.770
(Genome)
Of course
they blame us.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.139
Because that is precisely
what we tried to do after all.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.942
To save mankind

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.743
from the threat
of the Ignis...

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:58.912
That was a small price
we had to pay.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:00.213
(Varis)
We know that,

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.815
but they don't.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.383
People are like sheep--

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.486
we need to herd them
before they run off a cliff.

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.622
I've done some digging

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.490
and was able to
successfully

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.026
uncover Soulburner's
true identity.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.028
His name is
Theodore Hamilton.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.463
Then our next move

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.497
is quite clear.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.334
We must pay this
Theodore a visit.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:21.801
(Genome)
Just a visit?

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.437
I think it's

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.139
the perfect opportunity
to capture him.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.875
Why bother to hunt for him
throughout LINK VRAINS

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.945
when he's statistically
less than three bus stops away.

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.348
That does
sound easier.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.284
(Faust)
Then what are we
standing around here for?

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.053
Once we have Theodore,

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.987
we can terminate his Ignis.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.457
And then Playmaker's Ignis
will be next.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.792
We should've done this
from the start.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:46.894
(Varis)
No.

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.196
You fail to see
the bigger picture.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:52.232
Our mission's not to destroy
one or two Ignis.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.634
Our mission is
to destroy them all!

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.370
Do I make myself clear?

00:03:57.972 --> 00:03:59.640
Most certainly, sir.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.707
You see,

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.110
I only learned of
Soulburner's true identity

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.279
by secretly following
Playmaker.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.248
So wasn't it right
not to end him?

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.116
Yes.

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.018
You're wise as always.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.587
Let's just keep
our eyes on them for now

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.790
and see if they lead us
to the other Ignis.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:19.926
Even though I'd like
nothing more than to wipe

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.629
those disgusting smirks
off their faces.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.034
Now then...

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.604
Let's rehash
everything we know.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.874
In case we overlooked something
that can help us.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:35.376
(Faust)
There is this newcomer.

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.877
His name's Bohman.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.345
And he certainly knows

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.847
how to make a shocking
first impression.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.083
(Jin screams)

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:45.018
Hey!

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.786
Get off him!

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:50.857
Jin!

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:52.459
Jin!

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:57.798
Bohman was able to steal

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.600
Jin Kolter's concioussness
straight out of his body.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.437
That's similar to how
Baira's virus worked to create

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:04.338
The Deleted.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.307
Except with
greater efficiency.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:09.009
You should feel
extremely lucky

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.645
that Baira's not around
to hear you say that.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.246
I don't think it
wise to comment

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:15.082
on someone who can
amputate your data

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:16.449
with the strike
of a key.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:19.520
(Varis)
What else do we know
about this man?

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:22.122
(Faust)
Not as much
as we would like.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.925
(Genome)
Well, he did emerge
from a television set

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.460
into the real world.

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:29.597
That means his avatar must be
of the highest quality

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:33.266
if it can survive in both
the real and virtual worlds.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.070
(Faust)
So we're dealing with
a highly skilled hacker--

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.071
someone comparable
to our level.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.574
And since he specifically
targeted Jin,

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:43.844
he might have some connection
to the Lost Incident as well.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.813
There can't be too many
who fit this criteria.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:49.950
I'm sure Playmaker cared
about none of that

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.185
when he went after him.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.654
All he cared about
was retrieving Jin's soul.

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:55.656
Yes.

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:58.859
But Bohman had
a new weapon at his disposal.

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:03.030
(Bohman)
My Skill allows me
to activate a Link Spell.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.531
A Link Spell?

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.999
I never heard of that!

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.468
I activate the Link Spell

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.136
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.674
(Faust)
Similar to
a Link Monster,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.010
this Link Spell has
Link Arrows of its own.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.979
(Spectre)
This opens up
dueling strategies

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.681
that never existed before.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:23.717
It seems like something
SOL Technologies would invent--

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.686
do you think
Bohman works for them?

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.753
I doubt it.

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:29.589
(Faust)
If Bohman worked for
SOL Technologies.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.024
he and his associate

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:33.527
wouldn't need to breach
their security perimeter.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:35.763
I'm sure SOL Tech was
none too happy to learn

00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:38.865
that their defenses had more
holes than a golf course.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.834
I don't know if he's
friend or foe,

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:44.071
but I can't hate anyone
who gives Sol Tech a hard time.

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:47.741
(Faust)
SOL Tech has taken steps
to control the situation.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.743
They formed a team
of bounty hunters

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.311
to take care of trouble,

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.513
including tracking
down Playmaker--

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.915
they even managed
to recruit Gore.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.352
(Spectre)
That must've been
an impressive pitch--

00:06:58.352 --> 00:07:00.955
did they offer him
six new fezzes?

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.590
Whatever they offered...

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.326
They were able to convince
Gore to fight for them.

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:08.596
However, Playmaker wasn't
fighting alone either.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:09.963
(Soulburner)
Hey, Gore!

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:10.731
(Gore gasps)

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.332
I'm a big fan!

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:16.470
Hey, watch your speedin',
ya crazy schlub!

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.438
(Soulburner)
“Schlub? ”

00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:19.639
Isn't that some
kind of bush or something?

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.242
If you don't mind,

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:24.544
I'd prefer it if
you called me Soulburner.

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.079
I don't care
what you want!

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.948
All I care is that
you're interfering

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.116
with my business
of capturing an Ignis!

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.252
But I have
an Ignis too, Gore.

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:34.421
And a superior one
at that.

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:35.622
What?

00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:37.257
You have an Ignis?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.927
Let's Speed Duel!

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.731
I use my Skill!

00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.899
Dinowrestle Revolution!

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:48.302
I get to activate
the Field Spell

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.805
WORLD DINO WRESTLING
from my deck!

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:53.440
With it, every time
my DINOWRESTLERS

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.877
attack your monster,
they gain 200 attack points!

00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.546
Gore already used
his Skill.

00:07:59.546 --> 00:08:02.682
Uh-huh. And it's one that
he's never ever used before.

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:06.853
Next, I summon
DINOWRESTLER CAPAPTERA!

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:13.660
And with that,
I can mash up my circuit!

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:16.129
I Link Summon!

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.664
Link 3

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:21.468
DINOWRESTLER
KING T WREXTLE!

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:27.307
You better watch out!
Cuz here I come!

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.442
I use my Skill!

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.715
By lowering my life
points to 100,

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:37.284
I can draw a card for
every 1,000 life points

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:38.652
that I sacrificed!

00:08:38.652 --> 00:08:41.221
Bring the heat,
Soulburner!

00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:42.556
You know it!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.892
Go Burning Draw!

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:48.828
I Ritual Summon!

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.997
Ignite!

00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:58.538
SALAMANGREAT
EMERALD EAGLE!

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:03.744
Now go,

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:05.880
Emerald Overload!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.047
Oh no!

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.686
(Gore groans)

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.692
If Soulburner has
the skills to defeat Gore...

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:21.094
That makes him
a formidable duelist.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.296
Are you sure
we shouldn't delete him?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.232
(Faust)
We may not need to.

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:28.702
Because they went
to the restricted area.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:33.073
The most dangerous
location in all of LINK VRAINS.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.947
(Genome)
Why would Playmaker go
to the restricted area?

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.749
(Faust)
He found a portal there,

00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:44.385
which theoretically may lead
beyond the borders

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:47.554
of LINK VRAINS--
and eventually to Bohman.

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.889
Seriously?

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:50.357
What a fool.

00:09:50.357 --> 00:09:52.225
Once you take
the teensiest step

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:53.894
into the
restricted area...

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.896
your avatar
and account are

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:58.032
immediately targeted
and deleted--

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.800
every sane duelist
knows that

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.369
there's nothing beyond
the edge of LINK VRAINS.

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:05.872
(Varis)
But what if you and every
sane duelist are wrong?

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.708
Think, Spectre.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:10.510
Wouldn't that make it
the perfect place to hide?

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.880
I've analyzed the portal's
digital signature.

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:14.948
And...

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:18.385
it has all the markings
of an Ignis algorithm.

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:20.221
So you think
the Ignis

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:21.755
created that portal?

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.057
I don't think it.
I know it.

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.959
So this Bohman...

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.462
must have some
connection to the Ignis.

00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:29.563
(Faust)
Yes...

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.900
(Genome)
Ah, but it seems that
everyone and their grandmother

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.901
does these days,
doesn't it?

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.704
That's why I'm curious
to learn

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:39.373
what The Shepherd's role
is in all of this.

00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.341
The world's most successful
bounty hunter

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.542
rarely takes a job,

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:45.545
but he did agree
to hunt Playmaker.

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:52.185
(Shepherd)
I found you, Playmaker.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.723
And this time,
you won't escape

00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:59.726
‘til I cash in
my bounty.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.364
I Link Summon!

00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:06.466
Link 3
BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:14.774
(Genome)
His motivations aren't
very mysterious.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:18.779
<i>Greetings.</i>

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:19.913
Uh, dear--

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.482
this car's missing
something pretty important--

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:23.784
like a driver.

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:24.818
(Kenneth chuckles)

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:25.920
Who needs a driver
when you can have

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.121
the most advanced AI

00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:28.522
do the driving
for you.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:32.326
Take us to 132 Clairmont
Street please.

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.294
<i>Destination acknowledged.</i>

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:41.569
Uh-oh.

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.170
That looks serious.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.639
<i>Collision ahead.
Re-calculating route...</i>

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.109
Oh no!
Something's not right.

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.611
The AI's malfunctioning.

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.445
No!

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.080
How do you stop
this thing?!

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.447
Brace yourself, Mom!

00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:03.190
(Doctor)
There's no easy way
to put this.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.526
Your mother is
in very bad shape.

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:08.662
We've done everything
we possibly can for her...

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:11.831
but I'm afraid
she may never fully recover.

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.166
I'm sorry.

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:16.336
(Kenneth growls)

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:24.478
(Superior Officer A)
Doesn't this guy ever sleep?

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.680
(Superior Officer B)
No, he's been working 25-8

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.248
ever since
he joined the squad.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.417
He's tracked and deleted
more rogue AIs

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.152
than all the rest of us
put together!

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:33.687
You see...

00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:35.656
AIs ruined
The Shepherd's life

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:38.826
so he'll now do everything
possible to ruin theirs.

00:12:38.926 --> 00:12:40.160
(Varis)
Interesting.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.830
It seems our interests
are aligned.

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:44.832
If I didn't know
any better,

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:48.235
He sounds... like a member
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:50.571
Yes... but he's not one
to be trusted.

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:53.173
Maybe.
Maybe not.

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:55.009
Be that as it may,

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.509
The Shepherd
failed to stop

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:58.578
Playmaker from entering
the portal.

00:13:00.514 --> 00:13:02.583
The portal should be
just up ahead.

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:03.650
Then we'll finally see

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.818
what lies beyond
the borders

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:05.886
of LINK VRAINS.

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:08.421
(Ai)
Huh...

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.390
I didn't know
what to expect,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.826
but it's a lot more blue

00:13:11.826 --> 00:13:13.260
than I thought
it would be.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.229
(Flame)
I'm detecting
an anomaly nearby.

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:18.632
Right... there.

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:20.934
(Ai)
Oh, you mean the only
non-blue thing

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.068
in this whole place?

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:23.137
Good job.

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:24.905
Whatcha think it is,
Playmaker?

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:26.239
Let's find out.

00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:32.413
And that was the last time
we heard from them.

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:35.082
See, once they entered
the portal

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.284
their signals vanished.

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:38.985
(Spectre)
Of course they did.

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:42.223
Because they were
disintegrated the very moment

00:13:42.223 --> 00:13:44.157
they entered
the restricted area.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.993
(Varis)
And I'm not as optimistic.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.730
With the destruction
of the original Cyberse,

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.600
what if the Ignis
are creating a new Cyberse

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.068
hidden beyond
the borders of LINK VRAINS?

00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:57.304
(Faust)
You mean a secret homeworld

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:59.707
that no one
will be able to reach?

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:03.177
If the Ignis are
capable of doing that,

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:06.813
their abilities are evolving
must faster than I expected.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.716
Making them more dangerous
than ever.

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:12.018
And it's not
just the Ignis--

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:14.788
Playmaker's skills
are evolving as well.

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:18.525
He's mastering new
dueling techniques as we speak.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.560
(Playmaker)
Now to try something new...

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.662
I activate

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:24.864
my Ritual Spell Card,
CYNET RITUAL!

00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:27.300
He has
a Ritual Spell?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.171
I must tribute
monsters from my hand

00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:34.608
or my field whose total Level
equals or exceeds the monster

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:35.609
I intend to summon,

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.145
so I tribute
my Level 4 CYBERSE WIZARD

00:14:38.145 --> 00:14:40.313
and my Level 3
DEFCON BIRD!

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.985
Together, their Levels
add up to 7!

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.394
These two souls
offer their essence

00:14:53.394 --> 00:14:55.496
to break the barriers
of reality

00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:58.332
and conjure the ultimate
sorcerer to this realm!

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:00.300
I Ritual Summon!

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.669
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:15:05.873 --> 00:15:06.940
(groans)

00:15:07.507 --> 00:15:09.542
I now activate
the spell card

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.744
CYNET FUSION!

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:13.714
It allows me to fuse
my three monsters together

00:15:13.714 --> 00:15:15.582
into one so that
I may summon a new

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.684
Cyberse Fusion
Monster!

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.453
I fuse CLOCK WYVERN,

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:21.888
SHOOTINGCODE TALKER

00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:23.857
and CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:25.892
(Shepherd grunts)

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.762
You're so done for!

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.867
(Playmaker)
By fusing my monsters,
I merge them into a new,

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:34.734
even more powerful creation!

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:37.737
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:43.878 --> 00:15:46.513
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:04.131
No one has managed
to combine Link Summoning

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:07.301
with other summoning
methods until now.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:10.737
Then let us work
together to stop Playmaker.

00:16:11.004 --> 00:16:14.441
But we are missing one
crucial member of our team.

00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:17.811
Then let's go remedy
that situation, shall we?

00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.299
(Spectre)
Master Roken.

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:42.435
We're good to go.

00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:47.140
They say that no one
has ever escaped

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.576
from this state-of-the-art
penitentiary.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:50.744
(Faust)
Yes.

00:16:50.744 --> 00:16:52.812
But they never met anyone
who enjoys escape rooms

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:53.980
as much as I do.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.616
According to
the security logs,

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:58.318
Baira is locked in this cell
on the second floor.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:01.688
I've already hacked into
all of their security cameras.

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:03.557
I've put them
on an infinite loop

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:06.593
so that they won't see anyone
who comes in or out.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.729
I also shut down
their motion detectors--

00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:11.098
we can run around
willy-nilly as we like.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.367
So that takes care
of the inside,

00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:15.835
but can't they see our boat
coming to the island?

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.571
Yes, they can.

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:20.341
If it wasn't for the fact
that I spoofed their radar

00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:22.676
to make us
100% invisible.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.512
A minnow will make
a bigger blip than us.

00:17:26.914 --> 00:17:28.982
(Alec)
I've rerouted
the guards' patrol routes

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:31.518
so that we won't have
any unexpected run-ins.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:34.654
Plus all the gates leading
to Baira's cell are unlocked.

00:17:41.362 --> 00:17:43.163
You think a girl
as smart as her

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.065
could fall for
a guy like me?

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:47.400
They do say
opposites attract.

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:50.670
(Alec)
Our hacks will only last
for twenty more minutes.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:51.705
(Roken)
That's alright.

00:17:52.173 --> 00:17:54.507
That's twenty more minutes
than we need.

00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:02.716
(New Guard sighs)
She's even great
at staring contests.

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:04.718
I mean she hasn't even
blinked once

00:18:04.718 --> 00:18:06.086
in the past
two minutes.

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:12.993
Well, what took you so long?

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.761
I was getting bored.

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:17.163
Charming as ever...

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:18.398
good to see you too.

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:20.167
So what did I miss?

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.270
I'm assuming the Ignis
are up to no good?

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.571
That's right.

00:18:24.638 --> 00:18:26.407
And we most
definitely can use

00:18:26.407 --> 00:18:28.041
your assistance,
Klarissa.

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:32.546
(sighs)

00:18:32.746 --> 00:18:33.547
What?

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:38.285
She's gone!

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:41.087
(gasps)

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:44.491
Sound the alarm!

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:48.762
(alarm blaring)

00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.564
(Roken)
It's time to remind

00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:52.600
the world that
the Knights of Hanoi

00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.968
are not ever
to be forgotten.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.675
(explosion roars)

00:19:03.944 --> 00:19:05.445
<i>(Ai)
Well Playmaker,</i>

00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:07.314
<i>all our leads
have gone poof.</i>

00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:08.682
<i>Whatta we do now?</i>

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.217
The only thing we can do.

00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:13.654
Which is for the two of us
to remain patient.

00:19:13.887 --> 00:19:17.190
Which I understand is
a difficult concept for you, Ai.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.525
<i>Oh, please.</i>

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:19.893
<i>I can use the R&amp;R</i>

00:19:19.893 --> 00:19:22.329
<i>after saving Flame
and you and...</i>

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:24.331
<i>Flame and
Soulburner and...</i>

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:25.799
<i>did I mention Flame?</i>

00:19:26.232 --> 00:19:27.667
More than once.

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:30.104
<i>Oh. And I also
saved Flame.</i>

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.941
<i>You can call me a coupon cuz
I'm all about the savings, bab!</i>

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:35.142
(electronic beeping)

00:19:35.376 --> 00:19:36.810
<i>Kolter's pinging us.</i>

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:38.144
Something must be up.

00:19:38.478 --> 00:19:39.280
Let's go.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.014
<i>What about the R&amp;R?</i>

00:19:45.286 --> 00:19:46.487
What's up, Kolter?

00:19:46.553 --> 00:19:48.722
Check this.
You won't like it.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.292
Baira escaped
from prison.

00:19:51.292 --> 00:19:52.826
That isn't good news.

00:19:52.826 --> 00:19:55.362
Understatement
of the century!

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:57.331
You think Varis
broke her out?

00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:59.299
Yes. Who else
could it be?

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:04.838
(Varis)
You win, Playmaker...

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:06.306
But know this...

00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:10.344
Our war is...
not over...

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.480
Not until the Ignis
are extinct.

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.850
You haven't seen
the last of me, Playmaker!

00:20:18.619 --> 00:20:19.686
This means...

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.155
the Knights
of Hanoi are back.

00:20:22.522 --> 00:20:26.326
Great, as if we didn't have
enough problems already. Sheesh.

00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:27.695
First Bohman,

00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:29.663
then SOL Tech's
bounty hunters,

00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:32.199
and now we're adding
the Knights of Hanoi to the mix?

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:35.101
Man, this really
mucks up the stew.

00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:36.269
Yes.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.305
Our mission
just got tougher.
