WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.504
(Ai)
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.308
(Spectre)
Just like it was
when I was a child.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.143
So long as this tree
protects me,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.447
There is no possible way
that I can be defeated, and...

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:14.415
And?

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.117
You can't stop Varis
from destroying Link VRAINS,

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.152
along with the Ignis!

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:23.824
(Playmaker)
I Link Summon
Link 3 Excode Talker!

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.326
Ohh!

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.930
My absolutely perfect
defensive formation
is falling apart!

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.934
You leave me no choice but
to play my ace in the hole.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.670
What is... Zaizen?!

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.307
If Zaizen touches his cage,
one tiny prick from its thorns

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:43.844
will digitize him
out of existence.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.146
I've linked my life points
to Zaizen's cage,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.416
so any damage I take
will grow those thorns!

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.151
Ah!

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.620
You can attack me
and put Zaizen's
well-being in jeopardy,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.924
Or you can choose
not to attack me

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.660
and put all of LINK VRAINS
on the brink of destruction.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.695
I end my turn.
Oh!

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.499
Playmaker...
Sunavalon force's
effect activates!

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.969
Unh!

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.705
This bridge is
looking pretty beat up!

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:16.477
And I gotta bad feeling
the same might be true
for us too!

00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:19.379
(theme music playing)

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.141
How unfortunate!

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.278
It was my desire to
facilitate your downfall,

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.714
but I believe the bridge will
take care of that for me.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:30.150
(chuckling)

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.619
Playmaker, is there
nothing you can do?

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.888
Come on, pal.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.624
Heh!

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:39.593
What exactly
is so amusing?

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.061
You, obviously.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.329
You've conceded

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.297
that you cannot
defeat me in a duel.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.799
Grr!

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.068
That you cannot win
even after

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:49.470
you resort to cheating.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.572
So you must believe
that I'm inherently

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:55.309
superior to you
in every possible way.

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.912
Can anyone spare a chute!?
Aah!

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.618
Unh!
Very well, Playmaker.

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.687
If you so desire
a personal touch

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.121
to your impending downfall,

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.123
I'm happy to oblige.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.530
(Pigeon)
Oh man, Playmaker's hangin'
on by the skin of his teeth!

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.365
And LINK VRAINS's survival

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.701
is hanging on
the outcome of this duel.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.003
And mine's hangin' on
by the tips of your talons!

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.771
So hold tight!

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.507
You're no fool, Playmaker.

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.809
You know who has
the advantage in this duel,

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.778
and I'm not just talking
about the cards on the field.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.182
I'm also talking about
the suit trapped
inside my cage.

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:38.686
If you should attack me,
any damage I will take

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.622
will bring those thorns
closer to Zaizen.

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:44.124
And you've already proven
that your misguided
sense of decency

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:48.562
will not allow you to
put him in further danger.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.465
Forget me!
Defeat Spectre!

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:55.168
For it you don't, the whole
world will be doomed!

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:02.076
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.911
You're up, Playmaker.

00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.613
I'm giving you a second
chance to attack me.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.750
Or will you let opportunity
pass you by again?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.885
Hey, no trash talking
when you're cheating!

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.221
You gotta earn
that smack talk, bub!

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:16.590
Oh my.
You're right.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.760
Please do pardon
my poor etiquette.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.796
I did get carried away,
didn't I?

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.597
I forgot that I was
in the presence

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:27.735
of such a majestic
and bloviating AI.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:30.904
A truly addlepated blinkard.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.840
You eat a dictionary?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.608
If you're done, I draw!

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.910
So will you attack?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.881
I'm wide open!
(laughing)

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.750
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.254
Oh!
I said I was wide open.

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:49.256
How deeply disappointing.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.692
But you have made
your decision!

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:53.927
Ya sure it was
the right one?

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.029
Aww man!

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.300
(thinking)
Yusaku won't attack as long
as Zaizen's locked up.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.803
But if I can reconfigure
the LVSS's abort system
to target Zaizen,

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.806
maybe I can log him
outta there.

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.775
I've never tried it before,
but it's as good a time as any.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:12.079
You kept your aggression
in check, but I will not.

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.847
I draw!

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:17.317
And now, Sunvine Thrasher!

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:20.321
Attack Excode Talker!
(roars)

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.688
(thinking)
This attack will eliminate
his remaining life points!

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:25.760
(roaring)

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.461
And thus brings an end

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.862
to the tragic tale
of Playmaker.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:31.999
Well, any last words?

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.501
I activate the trap
Overload Anchor!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.970
It shields Excode Talker
from destruction

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.172
and cuts the damage
I take in half.

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:45.746
And this trap also
ends this battle.

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:50.117
My, my, my!
You never cease to impress.

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:53.087
But this changes nothing.

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:58.158
If you don't attack me,
you'll never eliminate
my life points.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:01.228
I hate to say he's
right, so I won't,

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:04.497
but... you gotta
cut your losses.

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.067
Zaizen's nice for a meatbag,
but he isn't that nice.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:10.638
It's true that prioritizing
the well being of one
over billions

00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:14.241
is not a logical decision
as it sacrifices
the welfare of the world.

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.311
Exactly! That's
exactly what I said!

00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.879
Except I said it
better, of course.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.382
Now do what's right and
bring Spectre the fight!
You with me?

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.185
Hello!
You with me?

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:27.221
It seems you two aren't
on the same page again.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.690
In fact,
it's quite apparent

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.025
you two aren't even
in the same library!

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.395
Wow, nice joke.

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:38.699
C'mon, Playmaker!
This is a duel,
not a staring contest!

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.567
If we don't
get past Spectre,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.904
the Tower's takin' down
the network
in the blink of an eye!

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.908
You do not need to remind me
of what I already know, Ai.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.310
Now, now, don't fight.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.647
Is that truly
how you two want to
spend your final moments?

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:57.685
Who said it's over?
It's my turn!

00:06:57.685 --> 00:06:59.753
I activate the spell card

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.923
I just drew,
Link Processing Failure!

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.792
My Link Monster will be
destroyed in two turns.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.395
But until then, if your
Link Monster has equal

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.298
or fewer Link Arrows
than mine, they can't attack!

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.766
What!?

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.136
My Excode Talker is Link 3,

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:17.904
meaning none of
your monsters can attack me!

00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:22.710
(thinking)
That's a smart defensive play,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.945
but it won't help him
win this duel.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.914
Not if Playmaker
refuses to attack.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.783
I guess you want more time

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.986
to rehash all he errors
you have made.

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:34.789
Why else would you
drag out this duel?

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.891
Believe whatever you want.

00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.760
Well, I believe
you're making a mistake!

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.463
And following that up
by making more mistakes!

00:07:42.463 --> 00:07:44.898
You can't win
if you don't attack!

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:47.134
Says you.
Yeah! Says me!

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.903
Hello, I just said it!
Sheesh!

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:51.538
Facts are facts!

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:54.040
If you don't fight,
it's over for all of us!

00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:01.515
Just hang in there.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:04.017
If I can log Zaizen
out of LINK VRAINS,

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:06.820
Yusaku can duel Spectre
for real.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.990
Your compassion
makes you weak.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.193
And now it will
cost you everything!

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:16.363
I manifest my circuit!

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:20.501
The summoning conditions
require at least
two Plant monsters.

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.802
So I set Sunvine Thrasher

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:25.172
along with Sunavalon Dryanome

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:28.308
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:29.343
I Link Summon!

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:33.813
Link 4 Sunavalon
Dryatrentiay!

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.853
Link 4?

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.187
That means Link
Processing Failure

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.357
can't stop it
from attacking us!

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.893
But it doesn't have
any attack points.

00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:48.795
Trust that its
special ability
more than compensates.

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.799
By tributing a Plant monster
next to its link,

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.668
I get to destroy
a face-up spell
or trap card on your field

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:58.172
for every one of its links!

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:02.008
Sunavalon Daphne is Link 2!

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:04.445
So I destroy
two of your cards,

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:08.515
Overload Anchor
and Link Processing Failure!

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:10.417
Wha-- wha-- what?!
Aww glitch!

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.720
You ripped up
our defenses!

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.087
That's not all I did.

00:09:14.087 --> 00:09:16.690
I activate Sunvine Shrine!

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.926
This spell once again
lets me resurrect

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:23.130
a Plant from my graveyard!

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.900
Sprout forth,
Sunseed Genius Loci!

00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:32.606
And watch
my seed take root!

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.708
By setting
my Sunseed Genius Loci

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:39.213
in the Link Arrow
I can Link Summon!

00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:42.716
Link 1 Sunvine Thrasher!

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.856
But this nightmare
isn't over.

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:50.624
Sunvine Thrasher gains
800 attack points

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:54.127
for every one
of Dryatrentiay's links.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.596
Since Dryatrentiay is Link 4,

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.433
Thrasher's attack points
increases by 3,200!

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:01.602
That'll wipe out
our life points!

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:04.537
This is your bad!
Not mine, yours!

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:07.241
Actually,
since my Dryatrentiay

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:09.543
used its special ability
just now...

00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:13.513
Monsters in my Main Monster
Zone cannot attack this turn.

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:14.948
Really?

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.385
Phew! So no bad.

00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:19.887
That's good.
My bad.

00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:21.755
I don't think we're out
of the woods yet, Ai.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.391
I highly doubt Spectre
would summon a Monster

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:27.261
and then increase its attack
points without a good reason.

00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:30.297
Nothing ever gets
past you, Playmaker.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:31.732
You're right.

00:10:31.732 --> 00:10:34.368
I have a very,
very good reason.

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.269
And a very good trap!

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:39.373
Sunavalon Bloom!

00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:42.209
It negates Excode Talker's
special abilities,

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:46.046
freeing my Monster Zones!

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:48.048
Wha-- That means
he can go back

00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:50.917
to using his combo
to regain life points!

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.720
Oh I don't think I'll
need to go and do that.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.792
Not when I can attack
with Dryatrentiay
and end you now!

00:10:57.792 --> 00:10:59.693
How?
Pollen allergies?

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.662
That thing's got
zero attack points!

00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:03.096
You'll see!

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:08.502
Sunavalon Dryatrentiay,
attack Excode Talker!

00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:11.238
When Dryatrentiay battles,

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:12.806
she gains the attack points

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.842
of the monster
she's linked to.

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:18.011
And Sunvine Thrasher
has 4,000 attack points

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.446
to donate!

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.681
This duel is over!

00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:29.590
(Spectre)
Farewell, Playmaker!

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.793
(laughing)
Farewell forever!

00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.695
Why aren't ya
freakin' out?

00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:37.931
Because there's no need to.
Say what?

00:11:37.931 --> 00:11:42.069
I activate the trap
Link Surge Counter!

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:43.337
Since your Dryatrentiay

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:46.239
has more links
than my Excode Talker,

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:48.475
I can banish two spell
or trap cards

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.977
on my field
or from my graveyard.

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:53.146
And by doing so,
I can then increase

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:54.982
Excode Talker's
attack points

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:57.684
to equal those
of Dryatrentiay's!
Ahh!

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:01.222
I banish Overload Anchor
and Link Processing Failure

00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:03.390
from my graveyard...

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.559
to fortify Excode Talker!

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:09.029
Well done.
You avoided
my finishing blow!

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.898
However,
it still doesn't mean

00:12:10.898 --> 00:12:14.234
I can't chip away at you
because I activate my trap

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.738
Sunavalon Force to deal you
400 points of damage!

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:20.707
(grunting)

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:29.349
We're still
in this, baby!

00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:31.886
That's nothing worth
boasting about.

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:35.722
Even babies have more
than 50 life points.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:44.231
Oh!

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.434
Ahh!

00:12:46.434 --> 00:12:48.536
Grr!

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:50.971
Now that
Sunavalon Dryatrentiay

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:53.040
no longer exists
on your field,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.709
it cannot protect your other
cards from being destroyed!

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:01.081
(Playmaker)
Your defenses were perfect,

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:04.084
so I knew none of my attacks
could get past them.

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:07.121
But if I could get you
to attack me instead,

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.890
I was certain an opening
would present itself.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.059
Spectre, your lack of patience

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:14.561
will prove to be
your greatest mistake.

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.131
No, his biggest mistake
was challenging

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:20.300
the best duelist
in the world...
and Playmaker!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.635
That's why your big ol' oak

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.937
got taken to the woodshed
and chopped to lumber!

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:25.773
I hope you don't
"arbor" any ill will

00:13:25.773 --> 00:13:28.108
about its tree-tment--

00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:30.143
Quiet!
That-- That tree

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.212
meant everything to me,
and you butchered it!

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:35.448
Ahh!
I knew I went
one pun too far!

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.785
I will now activate the spell

00:13:37.785 --> 00:13:40.720
Sunavalon Cursed Rebirth!

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.791
It resurrects a Sunavalon
Link Monster from my graveyard

00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:47.061
by negating
its special abilities!

00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:52.766
Regrow,
Sunavalon Dryatrentiay!

00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:55.902
Aah! It's back
for treevenge!

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:04.612
In addition,
Cursed Rebirth's
second effect

00:14:04.612 --> 00:14:07.013
infuses my
Sunavalon Dryatrentiay

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.217
with 1,000 attack points
for each of its links!

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:15.822
Since she's Link 4,
her strength rises to 4,000!

00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:18.725
(screeching)

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:23.030
Ugh! And rises to 4,000

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.698
on the "ughs" meter, too!

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:28.034
Cursed Rebirth has
a third and final effect.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:31.706
An effect that will
prove to be the nail
in your coffin.

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:33.340
If you deal me damage,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.176
this card deals
the same damage back to you.

00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:40.547
And, Playmaker,
since you only have
50 life points left,

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.651
any prick to me will
lead to your demise.

00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:46.186
Ain't that OP?
Just a skosh?

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:50.490
(Kolter)
Okay, realigning target
module... and done!

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.693
Now... let's get Zaizen
out of there!

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.996
Oh!

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.165
He's able to log out.

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.500
About time he found
the escape button!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.504
Now now! I didn't give you
permission to leave.

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:07.007
Aah!

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.576
(Spectre laughing)

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.048
Aah!

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:17.851
My cage is unhackable
so you can't escape.

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.886
Besides why would you
ever want to leave

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:21.621
when it's getting
to the best part?

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:25.025
Grr!
No way!

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:28.562
As long as I have Zaizen,
you can't attack.

00:15:28.562 --> 00:15:31.365
And if you can't attack,
you can't win.

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.434
Zaizen:
You're right, Spectre!
Huh?

00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:35.936
Playmaker cannot
win this duel

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:38.238
If he chooses to save me.

00:15:38.238 --> 00:15:40.541
Therefore, I'll...

00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.377
I'll take that option
off the table.

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:45.112
Huh?

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.347
<i>I still don't know if I
fully trust you, Playmaker.</i>

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.717
But you must do
one thing for me...

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:54.354
Do not let my sister's
sacrifice go to waste.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:56.790
Zaizen.

00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:02.963
(screaming)

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.699
He's digitizing
himself!

00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:07.734
This can't be!

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.306
Well, Skye...

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:17.344
I hope I'm the hero
you always wanted me to be.

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:19.746
The hero you are to me.

00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:32.926
No!
(grunting)

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:35.663
Zaizen.

00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:38.365
(Spectre laughing)

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.301
What an absolutely
useless gesture!

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.637
He sacrificed himself
for nothing

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:46.173
because you still have
no chance of winning!

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.909
Is that so?
Huh?

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:51.845
I happen to have
a differing opinion.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.814
I didn't ask Zaizen
to do what he did,

00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:56.650
but he did it anyway
in order to save me.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.819
And I do not know
what is so humorous

00:16:58.819 --> 00:17:01.721
about one making
the ultimate sacrifice!

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:03.757
I don't know what I've
done to earn his trust,

00:17:03.757 --> 00:17:05.392
but I will not betray it!

00:17:05.392 --> 00:17:09.229
I will not forsake
the opportunity
that he gave me!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.832
Hyah!

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:15.336
I start off by
summoning Rom Cloudia!

00:17:15.336 --> 00:17:17.638
(bellowing)

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:19.539
Rom Cloudia's ability
lets me retrieve

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.475
a Cyberse monster
from my graveyard

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.977
and add it to my hand.

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:25.879
So I get back my Latency!

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.752
And then I'm
automatically allowed

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:34.821
to summon Latency to my field
in Attack Mode!

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:42.996
And it's just what I need
to build my circuit!

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:44.431
The summoning condition

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:47.601
is one Cyberse that
is Level 2 or lower.

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.737
So I set Latency
in the Link Arrow!!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.906
I Link Summon!

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:56.710
Link 1 Talkback Lancer!

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.212
Hyah!

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:02.283
Now, Latency's
ability activates!

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:04.051
Since I used it
to Link Summon,

00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.986
I get to draw one card!

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:07.788
And I follow that up
by also using

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:10.891
Talkback Lancer's
special ability!

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.226
By tributing
a Cyberse monster,

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:15.463
I can resurrect
a Code Talker
from my graveyard

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:18.265
and summon it next
to my Lancer's link!

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:20.467
I tribute Rom Cloudia

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:23.904
to bring back
Excode Talker!

00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:27.607
(bellowing)

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.543
Excode Talker gives
500 attack points

00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:32.779
to the monster
next to its link!

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:35.716
Talkback Lancer
rises from 1,200

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:38.552
to 1,700 attack points!

00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:41.621
Then I activate
the spell card Link Atrocity

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.990
from my hand!

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.225
By tributing a Link Monster

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.960
and sending it
to the graveyard,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.629
it will give
all its attack points

00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:51.431
to another Link Monster
on my field!

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:54.935
I tribute...
Talkback Lancer!

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:56.570
Excode talker inherits

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.539
Talkback Lancer's
1,700 attack points,

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:03.510
raising its
strength to 4,000!

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.314
So what?
This is all for nothing.

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:11.018
Your Excode is strong enough
to destroy my Dryatrentiay,

00:19:11.018 --> 00:19:12.619
but it's not strong
enough to defeat--

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:16.123
Attack! Excode Talker!

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:18.859
Strike down his
Sunavalon Dryatrentiay!

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:22.696
(roaring)

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:24.164
Go ahead!

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.700
You will be left
with absolutely nothing

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.435
on your field, Playmaker!

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.638
And that will leave me
with the final victory!

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:33.607
You're wrong.

00:19:33.607 --> 00:19:35.375
You've been wrong
about everything.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.844
Oh!

00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:39.847
About me, about the Zaizens,

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:42.349
even about yourself.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.953
Link Atrocity's additional
effect activates!

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.821
When my Link Monster
battles yours,

00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:50.824
your Link Monster loses
400 attack points

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:53.026
for every Link Monster
in our graveyards!

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.028
For every Link Monster?!

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.397
But there are
so many of them!

00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:59.700
14 to be exact!

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.170
But who's counting?
Wait I am!

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.307
14 times 400
equals... wowza!

00:20:06.307 --> 00:20:09.176
It's sappin' your tree
of all of its attack points!

00:20:09.176 --> 00:20:11.678
Get it?
Tree? Sap?

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.280
Hello? You mad?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.383
Excode Talker!
Attack!

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.852
Go Closing Chaos!

00:20:20.621 --> 00:20:23.324
(screaming)

00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:26.827
(moaning)

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:30.531
(laughing)

00:20:30.531 --> 00:20:32.666
Well done, Playmaker.

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:36.003
I had this duel won...
until I didn't.

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:38.505
Even though you tricked me
into defeating myself,

00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:42.776
Master Varis will not fall
for such deceptions!

00:20:42.776 --> 00:20:45.846
That is why he is the leader
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:20:45.846 --> 00:20:48.615
The one who will be
your downfall!

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:50.483
My one true master.

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.453
I don't care.

00:20:52.453 --> 00:20:55.622
(chuckles)
So you say.

00:20:55.622 --> 00:20:56.957
But know this.

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:59.726
Your tale will end
in tragedy!

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.763
(laughing manically)

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:05.399
It is already written!

00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:07.768
TL;DR for real!
Ahh!

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:12.573
What are you standing
around for-- Run!

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:15.609
Really?
Walking?

00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:21.415
Ahh!
Hurry!

00:21:21.415 --> 00:21:22.783
Faster, Playmaker!

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:26.720
Because if that bridge
goes down, so do you!

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.623
(both shouting)

00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:38.565
(theme music playing)
