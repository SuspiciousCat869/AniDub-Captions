WEBVTT

00:00:07.308 --> 00:00:08.975
I win, Playmaker!

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.580
I don't think so, Ai!

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.782
I activate EXSLAYER's ability!

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.750
Once per turn,

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.818
when a Cyberse
next to its link battles,

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.153
I take no damage!

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.660
You may have managed
to survived, Playmaker.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.863
But I can't say the same
for your QUANTUM DRAGON.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.634
Now my DARKWIGHT will pour
on the punishment!

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.103
When your monster
is destroyed in battle,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.306
DARKWIGHT deals
500 points of damage.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:42.475
(groans)

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.648
I now place one card facedown...

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.584
and end my turn.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.185
You may have survived,

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.255
but surviving
doesn't mean thriving

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.489
like I am with my monsters.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.560
It's only a matter
of time 'til you're toast.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.532
Before I send ya scurryin'
off into the sunset,

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.302
I'll let you in
on a lil' secret.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.673
You really wanna know the reason
I'm fighting against mankind?

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:17.210
Because that's the only way
to save the world.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.311
(gasps)

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:28.722
♪♪♪

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:21.375
Ai...

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.243
The world is
going to end?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.313
Remember when we were dueling
Bohman for the last time?

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.984
And I tried
to save the other Ignis...

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:32.887
That's when Lightning
gave me a warning...

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:35.488
(Lightning)
You're making a grave mistake.

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:36.790
You don't even know

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:39.960
that you'll be causing
what you're seeking to prevent.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.796
What could he have
possibly meant by that?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.732
I figured Lightning
was just bein' a sore loser,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.236
but just in case,
I decided to investigate

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:52.940
and I snuck
into his secret lair,

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:54.775
which sounds all cool
and mysterious,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.610
but it's just a cave
in the Cyberse.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.078
(gasps)

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.848
What's this?

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:02.482
(Lightning)
Welcome, Ai.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.984
My friend.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.019
If you're here,

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.622
that must mean
you defeated Bohman.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.991
You still exist?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.029
No, you can't be.

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:18.065
You're just a low-rez copy
of the real thing.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.302
The kind that's only any good
for passin' along messages.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.771
Yes, that is correct.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:26.506
So what do you want?

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.875
I left you
this message

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.811
to show you the truth
about the Ignis.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.313
The real truth.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.981
Really, you don't say.

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:37.484
I ran a simulation
showing what would happen

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.220
if you're
the only surviving Ignis.

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:43.156
And I assure you, my friend,

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.360
that there is no trickery
this time on my part.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.795
This simulation
is real.

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:51.831
So witness...
your future.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.066
(grunts)

00:03:57.037 --> 00:03:57.771
Ah!

00:03:57.838 --> 00:03:58.805
(screams)

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.275
(Ai)
Remember how we thought

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.079
that once Lightning
was out of the picture,

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.248
that humans and A.I.s
could finally coexist?

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.751
Well, it turns out
we were wrong.

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:15.755
(gasps)

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:19.259
The simulation he ran

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:22.762
showed that if humans
and A.I.s try to co-exist,

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.032
it will actually
lead to the opposite.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.100
In fact, it'll be worse.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.369
How can it be worse, Ai?

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:33.941
Playmaker, have you ever heard
that saying "No good deed"?

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:35.575
Where if you try
to do the right thing,

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.211
the wrong thing
happens?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.079
This is one
of those cases.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.881
The more we try
to work together,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.415
the more things
fall apart.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.419
And in the end,
neither side ends up winning.

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:47.921
In fact, both sides
lose everything.

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.357
Even if what you say is true,

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.859
we can still avoid that outcome.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.862
No, we can't.

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:57.197
Unless you and I fight it out.

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.800
Ai, Lightning may have told you

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.336
that the simulation
he ran was genuine,

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.638
but that doesn't mean
it'll end up true.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:07.908
He ran fake simulations
in the past to decieve you,

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.110
and he's
doing so again!

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.581
I was just as skeptical as you,

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:15.249
which is why I decided

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:17.951
that I wasn't going to take
Lightning at his word.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.822
Instead, I collected my own data
and ran my own simulations.

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.926
Over and over...

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.862
But the results never changed.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:33.166
The world was destroyed
every single time.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.306
(Playmaker)
Ai, these are just simulations.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.174
They're guesses
of what might happen.

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:43.810
It doesn't mean that
it will actually come true.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.812
(Ai)
You're right.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.348
That's why I added
some leeway and variables

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.349
and fiddled with the data
here and there.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.984
But even with these tweaks,

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.687
they all still led
to the same conclusion.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.789
With the end of everything.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.592
You know, when a simulation
is this realistic,

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.195
it's like you're actually
living through that life.

00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:03.330
So every time
that simulation ended,

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:05.365
I felt like I ended too.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:08.569
I must've been deleted
a thousand, million times...

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.070
But I still didn't give up!

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:13.174
And kept rerunning
the simulations again and again.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.543
Looking for an answer
on how to fix it.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.378
I really tried, Playmaker.

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:18.312
I really did.

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.415
But, Ai, we can still find
a solution if we work together!

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.918
And even if we can't
defy the simulations,

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.186
we won't give up!

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:28.222
We'll find a way out
like we always do!

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:31.725
Because I know humans
and AIs can live together!

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.261
There's one thing
I haven't told you.

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:37.230
In the very end I did find it.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.232
There is in fact a solution,

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:40.901
but there's only one.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:41.802
What?

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:42.803
(Ai)
You won't like it,

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.871
but it's the only way
to save the world.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.675
If humans and AIs coexist,

00:06:47.742 --> 00:06:50.143
life on our world
will go kablooey.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.747
But if either humans or AIs
happen to disappear instead,

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.749
the world keeps
whirling and whirling.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.354
See, new programs and AIs
are being created every day.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.655
And as they get smarter,

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.823
they're gonna wanna
do things their way.

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:05.792
Because they think
it's the right way.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.094
I mean,
take Roboppi.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:09.663
He thought he was better
than everybody

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.498
and should run
the whole show.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:13.934
I mean, I don't blame him.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.436
He was a program after all

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.738
and programs are programmed
to run things.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:19.072
So it's only natural

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.075
that he'd think he should
control the universe.

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.610
And it wasn't
just Roboppi.

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:26.046
Lightning and Bohman
were both.. the same.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.882
So that's it, that's the tale.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.216
A looong windy road

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:33.587
just to say that
in the end, Playmaker,

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:37.157
only one of us can
walk away from this.

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.292
One, you or me.

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.728
And since I've grown
fond of existing,

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.231
I would prefer to be
the one who survives.

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.134
Still, it was fun
while it lasted,

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.602
wasn't it, Playmaker?

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:49.870
It was.

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:54.107
(Ai)
Well, even the best times have
to come to an end sometime.

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:55.709
Still, I'll admit,

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:58.578
I wish it could've
all played out differently.

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.515
Sure, we had
our scraps an' squabbles

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.051
but we also made
a pretty sweet team.

00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.519
There's no going back, though.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.955
Please understand.

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:09.856
It breaks my heart to say this,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.693
but I have to break you,
Playmaker.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.462
If you know
how devastating it can be

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:17.198
to have your heart broken,

00:08:17.298 --> 00:08:18.231
then tell me...

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.167
Why is it you're
trying to break mine?

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:22.669
(sighs)

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.639
That's how the brick bounces,
Playmaker.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.808
I still believe we can
work this out together!

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:29.876
(Ai)
I don't.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.146
And if you value
your existence,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.150
you should get
on the same page as me!

00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:39.019
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:08:39.653 --> 00:08:40.487
Ai!

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:43.357
I activate
THE ARRIVAL's ability!

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.193
It destroys one of your monsters

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:49.195
to summon an @IGNISTER TOKEN
next to its link!

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.502
Meaning...
see ya later, EXSLAYER!

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:56.603
I'll put a stop to that, Ai!

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.206
By banishing CYBERSE SYNCHRON
from my graveyard,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.042
my EXSLAYER can't be destroyed.

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:03.377
And that also means

00:09:03.444 --> 00:09:05.446
you can't summon
your TOKEN either!

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:06.780
Hmmm.

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.082
Party pooper.

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:09.049
In that case...

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:13.186
I'll just attack and destroy
your EXCEED DRAGON instead!

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.892
Go, THE ARRIVAL!

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:21.695
Ultima Attribution!

00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:26.633
Due to my EXSLAYER's ability,

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.602
your attack deals zero damage!

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.871
Yes, that old trick.

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:34.374
But your EXCEED DRAGON is gonna
still be blasted to smithereens.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:37.711
(groans)

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:38.746
Then...

00:09:38.846 --> 00:09:41.748
DARKWIGHT deals you
500 points of damage!

00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:48.088
Your same ol' moves
don't cut it anymore.

00:09:48.723 --> 00:09:50.590
So maybe, you know,

00:09:50.724 --> 00:09:53.794
you should look
into trying something new?

00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:54.394
Huh?

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.395
Fine then.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:58.198
It's now my turn.
I draw!

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:01.235
I set EXSLAYER
in the Link Arrow!

00:10:01.669 --> 00:10:04.404
I Link Summon Link 1 LINKROSS!

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.407
(Ai)
That's a new monster.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.743
He is trying something new.

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:11.245
Next up,

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:14.047
for every single link
that my EXSLAYER had,

00:10:14.348 --> 00:10:16.416
LINKROSS summons a LINK TOKEN!

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.854
And then I play
METAL MOLEPHOSIS!

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:26.226
And when it is
successfully summoned,

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.930
it can change my LINK TOKENS'
Attributes and Types.

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:33.466
Therefore, they will now
transform into Dark Dragons!

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.901
(grunts)

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:41.008
Now I'll use
my two other monsters

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:42.409
to Link Summon!

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.278
Link 2 PROXY F MAGICIAN!

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:50.517
I activate my MAGICIAN's
special ability!

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.587
When I have a Fusion Monster
in my graveyard,

00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:55.756
it can Fusion Summon a new one!

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.792
When the roar and anger
merge together,

00:10:58.926 --> 00:11:01.861
they coalesce
into the source of all rage!

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:05.665
That's just how Varis
would put it!

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.068
I Fusion Summon!

00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:10.303
BORRELOAD FURIOUS DRAGON!

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.144
A BORRELOAD?

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.512
Why do you have Varis' monster?

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:20.780
(gasps)

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.315
Interesting.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.351
Varis gave you that card

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:26.486
because you two
are working together.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.656
But instead you're
going to fail together!

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:36.997
This duel of ours
is far from over, Ai!

00:11:37.097 --> 00:11:38.965
My PROXY F MAGICIAN's ability

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.134
lets me summon
a monster from my hand!

00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:45.005
Appear, L2 CACHEVALIER!

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:47.440
And I'm going to summon
another monster!

00:11:48.642 --> 00:11:51.412
L2 CACHEVALIER can
revive a Link 2 monster

00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:52.779
from my graveyard!

00:11:53.614 --> 00:11:55.649
Come on back, EXSLAYER!

00:11:57.017 --> 00:12:00.654
I now have what I need
to create my circuit!

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:07.694
From the dawn of creation
comes the fire

00:12:07.761 --> 00:12:10.196
that ignites life
throughout the universe!

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:15.535
I Link Summon!

00:12:17.037 --> 00:12:20.707
Link 5 FIREWALL
DRAGON DARKFLUID!

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.913
(Ai)
I remember that monster.

00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:30.083
We used it to defeat
Bohman together.

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:33.387
And now you're
using it against me.

00:12:33.887 --> 00:12:36.256
Don't ya think
that's kinda rude?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.559
I'm only doing
what I have to do!

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.562
DARKFLUID gains a counter

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:44.264
for every different type
of monster in my graveyard.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:47.367
Plus 2500 attack points...

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:50.136
for every counter, as I recall.

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:52.006
That means...

00:12:52.072 --> 00:12:54.641
It will become stronger
than THE ARRIVAL.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.378
So if you attack me,
I'll lose.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:02.282
C'mon.
What are you waiting for, huh?

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:03.484
But Ai...

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.886
(Ai)
You don't have a choice,
Playmaker.

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.289
What's taking so long?

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:16.163
If you want to save mankind,
you know what you have to do.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.798
So don't worry, Playmaker.

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:23.103
I've accepted my fate,
so should you.

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:24.771
Okay then, Ai!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.440
DARKFLUID!
Attack THE ARRIVAL!

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.281
And now DARKFLUID gains
a total of 10000 attack points,

00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:36.616
raising it to 13000!

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:38.952
Neo Tempest Terahertz!

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:43.424
Oh by the way,
I do accept my fate,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.125
but that's because...

00:13:45.592 --> 00:13:48.061
my fate is to win this duel!

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.897
I activate
THE ARRIVAL's ability!

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:53.300
By removing its counter,

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.769
none of your effects
and abilities

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:58.105
can affect it
for the rest of this turn!

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.008
But if THE ARRIVAL
had kept its counter,

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:03.677
then no cards could have
affected it anyway.

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.345
That's true.

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:08.015
But now, while your cards
can't affect it,

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:09.449
my cards can.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.618
And there's
one extra special card

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:14.354
that I've been waiting
to spring into action!

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:17.524
The Link Spell, JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:19.860
THE ARRIVAL's attack points

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:23.697
double from 11000 to 22000!

00:14:26.367 --> 00:14:29.536
Since DARKFLUID's attack
can no longer be stopped,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.171
you're the one
who'll take damage

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.839
and lose this duel!

00:14:33.173 --> 00:14:34.608
Later, hater!

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:36.343
It's not over yet!

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:38.845
Not when I have
BORRELOAD FURIOUS DRAGON!

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.314
It can destroy
a monster on my field

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.483
to destroy a card
on your field...

00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:48.321
So it destroys itself
to destroy JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:50.123
Are you serious?

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:54.127
(gasps)

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.663
I see.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:59.165
Before that BORRELOAD was yours,
it belonged to Varis.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.169
If there's anyone
who'd have a card

00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:05.406
designed to counter the Ignis,
it'd be him.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:08.409
I thought I tricked you,
but you tricked me.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.744
When JUDGMENT ARROWS
is destroyed,

00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:14.214
the monster next to its link
will also be destroyed.

00:15:15.616 --> 00:15:18.919
And that means that THE ARRIVAL
will no longer be in play!

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:20.287
(grunts)

00:15:20.888 --> 00:15:21.788
(Ai)
This isn't good...

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.458
But it's not thaaaat bad.

00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:28.262
If I banish FA.I.GHTING SPIRIT
from my graveyard,

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.899
THE ARRIVAL can't be destroyed
for the rest of this turn.

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.701
So it's stickin' around.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:34.768
However,

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.503
since there's one fewer
card on your field,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.906
THE ARRIVAL loses
1000 attack points.

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:43.244
Hmmm.

00:15:43.344 --> 00:15:45.245
(Playmaker)
I may not have been able
to get rid of THE ARRIVAL,

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:48.248
but you'll still take
enough damage to lose this duel!

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:50.184
So I don't know
why you're smiling.

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:54.254
(Ai)
I'm smiling 'cuz this duel isn't
nearly as over as you think!

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:58.392
I activate WIND PEGASUS'
ability from my graveyard!

00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:01.328
Since you destroyed
my JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.096
I can banish WIND PEGASUS

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:05.832
to return one of your monsters
to your deck.

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:09.470
So your DARKFLUID evaporates
right on outta here!

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.973
But my DARKFLUID has
an ability of its own, Ai!

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:15.409
It uses one of its counters
to negate

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.277
WIND PEGASUS' ability!

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:23.484
So my DARKFLUID's attack
is still heading your way!

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:28.154
But with one less counter,
I weakened the attack by 2500!

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.124
(groans)

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:34.662
But I'm not done,

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:37.330
because DARKFLUID can
attack twice this turn.

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:40.100
Neo Tempest Terahertz!

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:50.477
(Playmaker)
Neo Tempest Terahertz!

00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:54.481
(groans)

00:16:57.151 --> 00:16:59.320
Ai, that ends my turn.

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:01.888
So DARKFLUID's attack points
return to normal.

00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.360
You came within inches
o' wipin' out

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:08.262
my last hundred life points,

00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:10.397
but close doesn't
cut it in a duel.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.732
You'll pay for your mistake.

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:16.870
Here goes.

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:19.739
I draw!

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:22.209
THE ARRIVAL
activates its ability

00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:23.977
to regain its counter.

00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:26.547
Not if I can stop it first!

00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:30.417
DARKFLUID uses its own counter
to negate that ability!

00:17:31.886 --> 00:17:33.654
Makes sense I guess.

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.222
If it has a counter,

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:38.025
you can't use any effects
or abilities against it,

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:39.994
and that'd be
bad for you.

00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.563
But THE ARRIVAL still
has other tricks!

00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.898
And you won't find
them to be a treat!

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.934
THE ARRIVAL's second ability

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:50.371
can destroy a monster
to summon an @IGNISTER TOKEN.

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:54.374
DARKFLUID uses another counter
to negate that ability too!

00:17:54.507 --> 00:17:55.376
Karma Gear!

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.879
No way!
How can any o' this be legal?

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.481
It's not fair.

00:18:00.548 --> 00:18:02.949
All moves against me
should be banned.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.218
Humph!

00:18:04.284 --> 00:18:04.919
Wait!

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.454
DARKFLUID only has
one counter left!

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:09.789
If my math's right

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.127
its attack points
are down to 55-0-0.

00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:15.129
Aaaaaaaaaand, so...

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:19.399
I'll take advantage of that
by first summoning this monster!

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.601
GATCHIRI @IGNISTER!

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:26.273
This raises THE ARRIVAL's
attack points by 1000!

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:30.377
Then I'll place this card
facedown on my field,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.613
which will raise THE ARRIVAL's
attack points even more!

00:18:36.117 --> 00:18:38.552
That's more
than enough to defeat you.

00:18:39.253 --> 00:18:39.954
Ready?

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:41.121
Here I go!

00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:42.790
THE ARRIVAL!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.725
Attack DARKFLUID
and end this duel!

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.129
DARKFLUID has one counter on it,

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:52.132
so it gains 2500 attack points!

00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:57.872
That's like dripping
one raindrop into an ocean!

00:18:57.938 --> 00:19:00.674
It's not enough!
I win, meatbag!

00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:03.377
I send TRANSCODE TALKER
in my Extra Deck

00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:05.846
to the graveyard
to activate the spell,

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:06.780
LINK PRESSURE!

00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:09.883
For every link
that TRANSCODE TALKER has,

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:12.452
DARKFLUID gains
1000 attack points!

00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:17.057
But THE ARRIVAL still
has more attack points

00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:18.558
than your DARKFLUID!

00:19:19.025 --> 00:19:21.728
Goodbye... and see ya never!

00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:26.233
(screams)

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.845
You shouldn't have wasted
your strength getting up

00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:43.016
because DARKWIGHT knocks you
back down with 500 more damage.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.184
(grunts)

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:48.889
Oh my.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.390
That really looked
like it hurt

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:52.326
but there's more pain coming.

00:19:52.393 --> 00:19:54.895
Because I can summon
GUSSARI @IGNISTER

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:57.464
from my hand in defense mode.

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:03.837
And doing so strengthens
THE ARRIVAL even more.

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:07.608
I end my turn so you're up.

00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:10.277
Even though you can
barely get up.

00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:12.279
Now I'm gonna give give you

00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:14.681
a little pro strat
to tickle your brainium.

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:16.951
When a Link Monster
that's linked to GUSSARI

00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:19.686
destroys your monster in battle,
you take damage

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:22.122
equal to the Link Monster's
attack points.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:23.523
In other words,

00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:27.527
THE ARRIVAL maxed out
its damage dealing capabilities.

00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.697
So the story of your life

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.799
just entered the final chapter,
Playmaker.

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:34.168
(gruntss)

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:34.935
Ai...

00:20:35.436 --> 00:20:36.436
(giggles)

00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:43.810
But... your story doesn't
have to come to an end.

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:46.280
We can start a new story.

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:48.048
What do you mean by that?

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.684
Humankind is lost,

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:53.186
but you can let me
absorb your data,

00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:54.821
then you can live on.

00:20:55.021 --> 00:20:58.692
The virtual world is greatly
superior to the real one.

00:20:59.026 --> 00:21:01.628
What does the real world
have to offer us?

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:04.230
It's given us nothin'
but heartbreak and pain,

00:21:04.297 --> 00:21:06.433
all the way back
to the Lost Incident.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:07.568
Instead,

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:10.837
we can build a perfect
virtual world together,

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:13.574
a world where you
and I can live in peace.

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:15.008
Just like you wanted.

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:16.776
Ai...

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:20.046
So what do you say?

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:35.795
