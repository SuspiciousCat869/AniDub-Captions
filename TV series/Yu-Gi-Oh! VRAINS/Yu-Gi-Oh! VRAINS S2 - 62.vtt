<i>Previously on Yu-Gi-Yo! VRAINS</i>

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.106
Hey, check this out.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.142
The portal's reappeared,
but in a different location,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.578
way up here among
the Sky Islands.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.447
It's a section of LINK VRAINS
that's still being built,

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.517
so not many visitors go there.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.818
Then let's get going.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.753
(alarm faintly buzzes)
Well, well, well.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:20.921
It's the portal.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.923
This is about to
get interesting.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.026
(dramatic orchestral music)

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.763
Wait, the Ignis didn't
create that portal?

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.431
It's a trap!

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.867
(snaps)

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.134
(air blowing)

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:37.304
(grunt)
Woow, wooow!

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.442
Shepherd!
Playmaker!

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.144
(thud)
(grunts)

00:00:44.178 --> 00:00:46.814
(scream)

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:50.417
Soulburner!
(air blowing)

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.921
(snarl)
(scream)

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.356
Soulburner, what's wrong?

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.094
(digital whoosh)

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:01.161
Aw, glitch!
(crackles)

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.163
How are we gonna get to him now?

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.364
I wish that I knew.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.871
(reverberating bass)
(whooshing)

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:14.074
(dramatic synth-pop music)

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.676
(screech)

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.045
(electromechanic beeps)

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.309
(choir singing)

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.325
(logo gleams)

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:07.394
(computer glitches)

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.565
The Shepherd never told me

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:14.000
he was the one responsible
for creating the portal.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.070
To fool your enemies, you
must first fool your friends.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:20.374
That's the saying, right?
Right,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.875
though I sincerely doubt

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.878
the Shepherd would
consider anyone his friend.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.782
(techno music)

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.950
Two on one, that's not fair!

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.719
Wait, I'm here, too,
so it's two on two!

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:36.090
But we share a Deck, so
we're back to two on one!

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:37.825
One or two, they both count

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.927
to a whole lot of
trouble for us!

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.797
Perhaps, but we're not
leaving here without Soulburner.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.802
(sighs) I figured, so
I'll make the math simple.

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.202
If the odds aren't even,

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:51.938
I'll even the odds
with a data storm!

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:55.909
(opening combination lock)

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.245
The forecast calls
for heavy winds

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.281
and a 100% chance
of logging out!

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.284
(strong winds crash)
(yells)

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.153
(screams)

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.454
Nailed him!

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:10.123
(grunts angrily) But
I'm still here, chump,

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:12.726
and I'm gonna take you out.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.361
Really, now?

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:17.330
(engine roars)

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.199
(Together) It's
time to speed dual!

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.105
Hmmm.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.177
I'm gonna go first.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.045
I draw!

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.115
First I'm gonna
summon Gouki Suprex.

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.218
(computer
sounds)

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.154
And Suprex's special ability

00:03:40.187 --> 00:03:42.856
also lets me summon
Gouki Riscorpio!

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.692
(computer sounds)

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.528
Goukis huh?

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.229
Those are Gore's cards.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.866
So if he passed his
deck down to this guy,

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:54.401
he must have also
passed down his tricks.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.271
Next, by sending
one Gouki monster

00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.939
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.441
I can summon Gouki Headbatt.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:02.676
(computer sounds)

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.278
And Headbatt's
special ability

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:07.514
gives Gouki Suprex
800 attack points!

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.849
(computer sounds)

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.953
Now like Gore, I'll
mash my circuit!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.221
(circuit gleaming)

00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:17.725
To Link Summon, I need
at least two Goukis.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:19.759
And I have three!

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.928
(circuit pinging)
(circuit gleaming)

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.764
I Link Summon!

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.867
Link three, Gouki
The Blade Ogre.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.602
(roars)

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.071
(computer sounds)

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.939
Gore never played
that card before.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.044
Since I just sent my three
Goukis to the graveyard,

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.746
I can draw three
new Gouki cards.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.515
Including this,

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.585
Gouki Rematch!

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:48.022
This spell resurrects
Gouki Suprex and Riscorpio

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.456
from my graveyard.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.059
And that triggers my
Blade Ogre's ability!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:55.128
For every monster
next to its links,

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.597
it gains 300
attack points!

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:00.967
(computer
sounds)

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.636
I end my turn.

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:04.505
If this guy suped
up Gore's deck,

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.640
it's going to be
tough saving our hide.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.508
Yes, and Soulburner's.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:19.153
Uh, oh, what is this place?

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:22.256
Ah, I remember, the Shepard.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.625
(mixed, faraway voices)

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:31.431
All these memories, but
not the one I'm looking for.

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:32.432
Useless,

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:33.667
all useless.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.638
(laser firing)
(glass breaking)

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.443
The Shepard has accessed
Soulburner's memories.

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.313
Unless we stop him, he'll
learn all of our secrets!

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.250
Soulburner it's most
urgent that you wake up!

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:50.317
Soulburner!

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.853
(glass breaking)

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:53.987
What's this?

00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:02.263
(monster growling)

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.497
Go away, leave me alone!

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.069
(monster laughing)

00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:12.139
(screaming)

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:13.740
(monster growling)

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.043
(frightened gasp)

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.045
(monster laughing)

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:23.316
Interesting.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.320
This memory is of
your biggest fear.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:29.489
It will come in handy.

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.591
(glass shatters)

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.160
Oh, I implore you Soulburner,

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.396
wake up!

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.731
(grunting) Where are we?

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:40.935
(Flame)
Stuck inside the
Shepard's trap, unfortunately.

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:41.869
What?

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.037
I must give him credit,

00:06:43.037 --> 00:06:44.838
a fake portal was ingenious,

00:06:44.872 --> 00:06:46.707
both technically and creatively.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.375
Of course, I would
prefer it if we

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:50.043
weren't the ones being trapped,

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:52.345
but (chuckles) alas.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.381
So where's Shepard now, Flame?

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:56.550
(earthquake rumbles)

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.085
I believe we have our answer!

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.426
I know you can take
the heat, Soulburner,

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:07.160
but not this much heat.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:11.731
So why don't you and your
Ignis come up here and join me?

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.869
(hands slamming)

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:19.539
Why is it taking so long
to access that portal?

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.775
Sir, we're having
trouble breaking

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.410
through the portal's encryption.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.645
But we're not gonna give up.

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.247
Ugh.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.949
The Shepard may work for me,

00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:31.118
but he's not the sharing type.

00:07:31.118 --> 00:07:33.220
So I won't know what
information he extracts

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:36.423
out of Soulburner,
unless we can see inside.

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:37.457
Keep working!

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:38.658
(Together) Yes sir!

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.662
(tense music)

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.633
Hey Shepard.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:48.936
Flame told me you were
hacking into my memories.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.404
I don't know if
you actually care

00:07:50.438 --> 00:07:51.905
about invasion of privacy,

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.707
but that is so not cool!

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.276
You're right, I don't care.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:59.112
Because if I can learn anything
that gives me the advantage

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:01.682
in our duel, I'll take it.

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:02.983
(Shepard Through Speaker)
Just as easily as I'll take

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:05.152
your Ignis from you.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:08.389
This is going to be
one interesting duel.

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.057
And only I have a VIP ticket.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:14.795
(laser blasts)

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:16.563
Ugh, or maybe not.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.333
(drums booming)

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:24.871
(Together) Time
to dual!

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:28.975
(computer sounds)

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.813
Since this is my
world, I'm going first!

00:08:32.847 --> 00:08:35.515
I'll start by summoning
Duplicate Drone.

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:41.722
Next, I activate my Equip
spell, Mirror Coat Unit,

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:44.157
and equip it on my
Duplicate Drone.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.528
Mirror Coat Unit
provides Duplicate Drone

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.795
with two effects.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.465
Number one, if Duplicate
Drone battles a monster

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:53.133
that is level four or lower,

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.869
the opponent takes the battle
damage, instead of you.

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.672
Number two, if Duplicate
Drone would be destroyed

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.375
in battle, Mirror Coat
Unit is destroyed instead

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.043
and you take no damage.

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.912
If you would like to hear
this explanation again,

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.747
please say "yes,"

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.583
If you would like to hear this
explanation again in Spanish,

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.452
please say "si."

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:14.454
No, I'll place these
two cards face-down,

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.956
and end my turn.

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:17.257
Sure you're done?

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:18.859
Don't wanna have
your AI ramble on

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.527
for another couple of hours?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.429
Maybe share some
more dueling tips?

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:24.531
(Flame) Well I think
it's important to know

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.899
what the cards can do.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:28.068
Yeah, guess you're right.

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:29.670
It's my turn!

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:30.904
I draw!

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:34.575
By discarding Salamangreat
Parro from my hand,

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:37.678
Salamangreat Meer's
ability activates!

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.581
And that means it summons
itself directly onto my field!

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:43.684
(computer sounds)

00:09:43.684 --> 00:09:46.720
Next up, I summon
Salamangreat Wolvie.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:50.590
(Wolvie growls)

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:56.529
And with these two, I
can now blaze my circuit!

00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.401
The summoning conditions

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:03.104
require two fire
effect monsters.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.372
So I set my Salamangreat Meer

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.541
and Wolvie in the Link arrows!

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:10.076
(circuit pings)
(circuit gleams)

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.678
I Link Summon!

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:15.416
Link two, Salamangreat
Sunlight Wolf!

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.019
(Sunlight Wolf growls)

00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:21.255
By link summoning
my Sunlight Wolf,

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.724
I can automatically
summon Salamangreat Mole

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:24.591
from my hand.

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:31.264
And since I summoned my Mole

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.067
next to my Sunlight Wolf's link,

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.468
it's ability triggers,

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:37.737
allowing me to retrieve a
Salamangreat from my graveyard!

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:43.743
I now have what I need,

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:47.881
to blaze the circuit that
scorches the path to the future!

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.452
The summoning conditions require

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:54.120
at least two fire
effect monsters.

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:57.891
So I set Salamangreat Mole
and Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf

00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.893
in the Link arrows.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.629
(circuit pings)
(circuit gleams)

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:04.264
I Link Summon!

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:08.501
Link three,
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.271
(Heatleo growls)

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.476
I Link Summon!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:20.847
Link three,
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:22.817
(Heatleo growls)

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.985
When I Link Summon Heatleo,

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.788
I can return a spell or
trap card on your field,

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:29.289
back to your deck.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:32.826
So I'm getting rid of your
Equip spell, Mirror Coat Unit.

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:35.696
Your spell may have two effects,

00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:38.465
but neither one of them
can help you anymore.

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:40.167
(card explodes)

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.103
Heh, that's fine, because
you've just activated

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:45.739
Mirror Coat Unit's third effect.

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:47.741
That is correct.

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:48.743
Third!?

00:11:48.776 --> 00:11:49.976
Effect number three,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.979
when Mirror Coat Unit
leaves the field,

00:11:52.012 --> 00:11:54.915
the equipped monster
returns to your hand,

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:57.117
and you can draw a second
copy of that monster

00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:58.686
from your deck.

00:11:58.753 --> 00:11:59.953
Wait just a second,

00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:03.423
your AI said that
spell had two effects.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.528
Yes, but it never said
it only had two effects.

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:08.996
What?

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:10.997
(Flame)
As much as it
appears as if he is cheating,

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:13.033
he is technically correct.

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:16.303
And he uses these technicalities
to get the advantage

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:17.504
in his duels.

00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:21.175
You programmed your AI to lie!

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.745
(Shepard) Yeah, and it
wasn't that hard either.

00:12:24.812 --> 00:12:28.548
That's, that's cheating,
you cheating cheater!

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:29.816
(Shepard)
No it's not.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.351
What, yes it is!

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:36.022
There is nothing in the rule
book that forbids deception.

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.525
That's right, and it
works especially well

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.395
when my opponent is
as gullible as you.

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:42.662
(Soulburner) Say what?

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:46.500
It's your fault
for believing an AI.

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:49.170
Following every word it says,

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.541
you fail to realize, it's far
better to treat them as tools.

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:55.976
Ones you control completely,

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:58.345
because when you trust AIs,

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.315
it can only end in pain.

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:03.817
As I know first hand.

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.585
Cool story bro.

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:07.421
But nothing you said
changes the fact

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.655
that your field's empty

00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:10.624
and you're open to attack.

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.127
Caution, Soulburner's
speech pattern indicates

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.896
a 99% chance of attack.

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.732
What? I thought it was 100%.

00:13:18.766 --> 00:13:20.834
Maybe it does think it's 100%,

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.436
but it's lying!

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.071
Easy Flame.

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:28.408
99 or 100, it doesn't matter
when I activate this trap!

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:32.713
As long as I have Drone
Barricade on my field,

00:13:32.746 --> 00:13:35.483
your monsters can't
attack me directly.

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:37.951
Well, that sure is a problem.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.719
Luckily I have a problem solver,

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:42.055
called Salamangreat Sanctuary.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.425
This field spell
lets me offer up

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.895
a Salamangreat Link
Monster on my field,

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.730
to Link Summon another
copy of that monster.

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:54.101
Blaze the circuit!

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.603
(flames roar)

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:01.808
I set Salamangreat Heatleo
in the link arrows!

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.484
(flames roar)

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.786
Go reincarnation,

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.287
Link Summon!

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:19.726
Rise again, from the
valley of flames,

00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:21.294
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:25.699
(flames roar)

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:29.469
What's the point of
resummoning the same monster?

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:33.107
The point is, when Heatleo
is reincarnation Link Summoned,

00:14:33.107 --> 00:14:36.276
I can return return a spell
or trap card to your deck.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:39.646
So I'm tearin down
your Drone Barricade!

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:43.116
And I repeat,
what was the point?

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:47.621
When Drone Barricade is the
target of a special ability,

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:51.625
I can banish it to draw another
Drone Barricade from my deck

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:56.029
and activate it, so everything
you did was pointless.

00:14:57.698 --> 00:14:59.066
(groans)

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.302
The Shepard was prepared
for your strategy.

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.370
I can only surmise that
he must have studied

00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:04.538
your past duels.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:05.872
Or even your memories.

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:08.208
So your past moves
may not work anymore.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.511
Then all I gotta do
is invent a new strategy

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.344
on the fly.

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.080
It's your turn Shepard!

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:16.183
Indeed it is.

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.518
I draw!

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:20.187
(computer sounds)

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.190
I now have what I
need for my victory.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.392
(Soulburner)
Yeah, yeah, keep lyin.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.461
(Shepard)
I assure you I'm not.

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:28.728
Oh yeah?

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.364
Yes, I've looked
into your memories

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:34.201
and can strike you
to your very core.

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:36.003
(Soulburner) What
do you mean by that?

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.537
Instead of telling you,

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:39.339
let me show you.

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:41.008
When I have three copies

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:44.278
of the same machine
type monster in my hand,

00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:46.680
I can activate the trap card,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.548
3D Bioscanner.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.386
It lets me summon a
monster from my deck

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:54.421
that's not a machine.

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:57.458
And the monster I choose is,

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:59.693
Despair from the Dark!

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:07.434
(Despair) (evil laugh)

00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:09.569
(growls)

00:16:13.974 --> 00:16:16.576
(growls)

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.645
(worried cry)

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.648
(evil laugh)

00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:25.018
(panicked) No,
anything but this!

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.922
(screams)

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:31.325
Oh no, Shepard is using
Soulburner's greatest fear

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:32.859
against him!

00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:36.763
Its my turn!

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:38.164
I draw!

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:40.367
When I have no
monsters on my field,

00:16:40.433 --> 00:16:42.469
I'm allowed to
summon Link Slayer!

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:48.308
And next up, I'm going
to summon Storm Cipher.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.514
Two monsters with at
least 2000 attack points

00:16:53.581 --> 00:16:55.248
would be impressive.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.252
If my Blade Ogre didn't have
3000 attack points that is!

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:01.688
I know, that's why I'm
not using them to fight,

00:17:01.722 --> 00:17:04.225
I'm using them
to Link Summon!

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:07.093
The summoning conditions
are two effect monsters.

00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:10.064
(circuit pings)
(circuit gleams)

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:11.999
I now Link Summon!

00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:13.333
Link two, Pentestag!

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:20.207
Huh? It's got
1600 attack points?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.142
Why would you go and Link
Summon a monster that's

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:24.812
weaker than the ones you had?

00:17:24.812 --> 00:17:26.080
Because by doing so,

00:17:26.147 --> 00:17:28.315
I'm allowed to summon
Link Infra-Flier,

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:30.383
next to my Pentastag's link.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:31.751
So soar on in!

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:38.492
Uh, but that monster doesn't
have any attack points.

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.661
(Ai) That's right,
a whole big goose egg.

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:43.663
But what I can do now
is equip my Pentastag

00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:46.032
with my spell
Cyberse Annihilation.

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:50.971
While equipped with this spell,

00:17:51.004 --> 00:17:53.240
if my Pentastag
battles your monster,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.142
Pentastag's attack
points will then

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.677
become the same as yours.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.480
So Pentastag will
double-KO your Blade Ogre!

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:03.951
We'll lose our monster,
but you'll lose yours!

00:18:03.984 --> 00:18:05.085
Now go!

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:08.388
Pentastag attack
Gouki Riscorpio.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.792
Hm?
(Ai) Yeah, I agree, hm?

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:13.494
You're attacking
the wrong monster.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.794
No, I'm not.

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:24.237
With that attack,
this duel is over!

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.574
Because when Pentastag is
Linked to Link Infra-Flier

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:29.376
it can still deal you damage,

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:32.312
even if your monster is
placed into defense mode.

00:18:33.213 --> 00:18:36.216
So not good! (screams)

00:18:36.249 --> 00:18:39.987
And now Cyberse Annihilation's
effect also activates.

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:42.423
So you take damage equal
to the attack points

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:45.159
of the monster that
was just destroyed.

00:18:45.226 --> 00:18:46.993
That's 2300 points.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.397
More than my life points!

00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.166
(screams)

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.469
Hah, he thought
he was a hot tamale,

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.537
but he was just
a cold enchilada.

00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.210
(Playmaker)
Kolter, any progress on your
end?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.878
Still working on it.

00:19:04.945 --> 00:19:06.847
(Ai)
AKA, nope!

00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:08.315
I hate to admit it,

00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:11.551
but the Shepard sure did
create one beast of a trap.

00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.220
He even found a
way to manipulate

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:16.890
your Ignis algorithms to
make it totally hack-proof.

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:20.027
(Ai) Are you saying that
you're no match Kolter?

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.028
No way!

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:23.497
Just a matter of
raising my game.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.233
I'm going to find a
way to break this trap.

00:19:26.233 --> 00:19:28.102
And that's a promise.

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:30.270
Okay, I know you will.

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.840
(gasp)

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:35.209
(Ai)
Hey, I thought
I logged him out.

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.676
Seems he logged back in.

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:41.982
(growls)

00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:45.952
(frightened gasps)

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:50.490
Why, Soulburner, you seem
frightfully out of sorts.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:53.894
And things are only going
to get more terrifying.

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:56.363
I summon Duplicate Drone.

00:19:56.396 --> 00:19:59.399
And when I have one
Duplicate Drone in play,

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:02.135
I'm allowed to summon
my other two Duplicates

00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:03.036
from my hand.

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.773
But this is only the start,

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:09.943
once per turn, Duplicate
Drone's ability allows me

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:13.346
to move one monster from
my main monster zone

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.016
to my spell and trap cards zone.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.285
And that monster will be,

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.387
Despair from the Dark!

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.458
And by doing so,

00:20:24.491 --> 00:20:29.029
my Duplicate Drones
transform into that monster.

00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:32.065
(Duplicate Drone explodes)
(monster growls)

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:35.035
(Duplicate Drone explodes)
(monster growls)

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:36.971
(Duplicate Drone explodes)
(monster growls)

00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:42.008
(Monsters Together)
(evil growl)

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.111
(frightened gasps)

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:50.150
Soulburner you must
get a hold of yourself.

00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:54.688
He can't hear you,
he's too scared.

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:59.393
And now I will collect the
two things I'm here for.

00:20:59.393 --> 00:21:02.429
A victory, and an Ignis.

00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:07.768
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:10.904
(frightened gasps)

00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:17.244
(reverberating bass)
(whooshing)

00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:20.847
(dramatic synth-pop music)

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.786
(choir singing)

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:41.101
(logo gleams)
