Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:05.906
(Akira)
I'm sorry, Skye...

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.008
I'm the one who's supposed
to protect you,

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.676
but now when you need me most

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.346
I have to depend
on someone else to save you.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.480
Playmaker...

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:15.615
Don't let me down.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.286
When you neutralized
all my Cyberse monsters,

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.121
<i>you got rid of Ai as well.</i>

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.824
Have you no idea
what you possess?

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:27.494
The Ignis may be an A.I...

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:30.631
But it's unlike any type
you've ever come across before.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.034
While A.I. are supposed to do
what we program them to do...

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.803
The Ignis do whatever
they want to do

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.939
And what the Ignis want to do

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.640
is bring an end
to the entire human race.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.510
But I don't buy a single
word you said.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:49.182
(Yusaku)
I sense the presence of a new
Cyberse monster in my deck.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:53.620
That means Varis failed to truly
erase the Cyberse or Ai.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:56.156
I Link Summon!

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.658
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.762
Ai!

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.363
(Ai)
Huh? I'm back?

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:06.166
Join the fight!
Encode Talker!

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.135
You thought
this duel was over.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.871
But this fight's only
getting started, Varis!

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:16.343
♪♪♪

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.804
♪♪♪

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.913
I activate Firewall Dragon's
special ability!

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.748
For every monster that's
co-linked to this card,

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.618
I can return a monster
that's on the field

00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:33.320
or in the graveyard back
to its owner's hand.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.623
Right now, one monster is
co-linked to Firewall!

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.259
So I can send your
Borreload Dragon away!

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.628
Nice try...

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.463
But that is not going to happen.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.431
Borreload Dragon
can't be targeted

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.567
by a monster's abilities!

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:48.268
(Ai)
Great, now he tells us!

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.203
It's like he doesn't want us
to win or something.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.806
Oh, wait.
He doesn't.

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:54.875
In that case, I choose
Mangarokket instead.

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.645
Why thank you because now
its ability activates!

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:02.483
You see, when a Link Monster's
uses its special ability

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:05.185
on Magnarokket, I can destroy it
to send one monster

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.488
on the field to
the graveyard

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:11.492
So say farewell to
your Firewall Dragon!

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.728
(Yusaku)
Varis seems to have a counter
for every move I make...

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:16.530
(Ai)
Interior monologue later...

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.798
Act now!

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.333
Okay, I'm on it!

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.835
I banish Cynet Refresh
from my graveyard

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.004
to activate its effect!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.173
It protects
my Cyberse Link Monsters

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.841
from your special abilities.

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:31.979
So...

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.682
Firewall Dragon
lives to see another turn...

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:38.118
But, I'll make sure that turn
will be its last with the help

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.555
of my Magnarokket!

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:44.191
Its special ability summons
another Rokket monster

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.194
from my deck
- Anesthrokket Dragon!

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.528
It's your turn, Playmaker.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.997
(Ai)
Phew...

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.299
You're not thriving,
but at least you're surviving.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.503
(Emma)
I may be more hacker
than duelist,

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:58.439
but even I can tell
he's in seriously hot water.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:01.408
If he doesn't turn things
around this turn, he's done.

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:04.077
♪♪♪

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:05.512
Playmaker...

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.114
Skye...

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.853
Come on, dude!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.056
(Ai)
So I ran through a bunch of
permutations and I found a way

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.291
to win this duel!

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:18.925
Just...
Wait for it.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.094
Be...
Here it comes.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:23.430
Lucky!
No, Ai.

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:26.434
This next draw doesn't have
anything to do with luck.

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:28.568
You see, I've constructed
my entire deck

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:30.237
for this very moment.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:33.006
And I'm certain it will come
through for me,

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.208
and not just me,

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.844
but for all
I'm fighting for.

00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:39.746
It all comes down to this!

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.615
I draw!

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.623
From my hand...

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:53.360
I activate the spell,
Battle Buffer!

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:56.263
As long as Encode Talker
and Firewall Dragon

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:57.964
are linked to
each other...

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.134
Both Anesthrokket Dragon and
Magnarokket Dragon's abilities

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.435
are sealed away!

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.307
(Ai)
Nice! Those two tin cans

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:09.577
won't be blasting away
our cards anymore!

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.845
Excellent move for you.

00:05:10.945 --> 00:05:13.246
I mean, average one for me but,
you know...

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.848
And now...

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.984
Firewall Dragon,
attack Borreload Dragon!

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:23.123
Playmaker, you fool, don't you
realize that your monster

00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:24.658
has less attack points
than mine?

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.162
I'm acutely well aware of each
and every move that I make.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.831
When my Firewall Dragon is
linked to Encode Talker,

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.999
it can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:35.936
What are you up to?

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.772
(Ai)
Varis is confused,
Varis is confused!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:39.773
(surprised grunt)

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.408
Now go...

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:42.476
Firewall Dragon!

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.945
Tempest Terahertz!

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.953
Next, Encode Talker's
special ability

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.788
gives Firewall Dragon
attack points.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.489
(roars)

00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.860
But what good does that do?

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.362
Firewall Dragon's
attack is already over.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:04.398
(Ai)
Firewall's may be...

00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.833
I activate
a Spell.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.201
Go Battle Buffer!

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:08.969
Since my Firewall Dragon
battled,

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:10.537
this card gains
one counter.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.041
And all Cyberse Link Monsters
gain 700 attack points

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.308
for each Counter!

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.514
(Ai)
Which means Encode Talker now
has more attack points

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.516
than your Borreload Dragon!

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.585
Clever.
Quite clever.

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.554
Attack, Encode Talker!

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.063
Too bad, but you weren't
clever enough!

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.764
In fact, far from it!

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:40.400
Because Borreload Dragon's
ability lowers

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:44.038
your Encode Talker's attack
and defense points by 500!

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:47.174
And this ability's
so mighty that you can't play

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:48.875
any card to stop it!

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.377
Too bad for you.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:51.912
(Ai)
Aww, glitch!

00:06:52.012 --> 00:06:54.881
You two actually thought
that you were hunting me,

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:57.083
but you were
always the hunted.

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:00.787
Now then...

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:01.788
fire!

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:09.095
Now then... fire!

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.632
(grunting)

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.001
(Ai)
So, umm...

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.470
Have you considered not trying
to lose life points?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.205
I know what I'm doing, Ai.

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:20.607
Since my monster
was involved in a battle...

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.809
Battle Buffer gains
another counter,

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.278
further powering up
my Firewall Dragon.

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.782
So?

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.818
With Encode gone, Firewall's
no longer co-linked.

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:35.288
Meaning Battle Buffer no longer
seals away Anesthrokket

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:38.792
and Magnarokket Dragon's
special abilities.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:42.162
(Emma)
Well, that's that.

00:07:42.262 --> 00:07:45.466
No matter how many attack points
Firewall Dragon has,

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.101
Varis can use Magnarokket's
special ability

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.104
to get rid of it
next turn.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.740
That means Playmaker will have
no monsters left to defend with,

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:54.708
and that's game over.

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:57.477
I tore through
your entire playbook.

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.681
How does it feel to be such
a failure, Playmaker?

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.950
Why don't you tell me?

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:04.351
Say what?

00:08:04.384 --> 00:08:06.120
(Ai)
You think you can
back up that burn?

00:08:06.186 --> 00:08:09.156
It's true that I currently have
no monsters on my field

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.691
that can attack
for the rest of this turn.

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:14.394
But that doesn't mean
I can't summon a new one!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.729
You can?
Without cheating?

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.198
Yes, Ai.
I can.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.035
I activate my trap
Recoded Alive's effect

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.270
by banishing it
from my graveyard!

00:08:24.472 --> 00:08:26.273
From your graveyard?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.975
That lets me revive
Decode Talker!

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.950
And my Decode Talker gains
500 attack points

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.352
for each and every
monster that's linked to it!

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:43.189
That's why I placed it right in
front of your Borreload Dragon!

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.027
Power Integration!

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.498
(Ai)
And that's just step one
in pumping up its power!

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:54.234
The field spell
Cynet Universe

00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.438
gives it another 300
attack points!

00:08:57.505 --> 00:09:00.808
And Battle Buffer will provide
it with even more strength!

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:05.346
Cyberse Link Monsters gain 700
attack points for every Counter!

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:06.846
And since I have two,

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:11.752
that means Decode Talker
gains 1400 attack points!

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:13.454
(Ai)
Guess who's stronger
than Borreload?

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:15.255
Attack!
Decode Talker,

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.257
destroy Borreload Dragon!

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.929
Ha, I don't think so!

00:09:21.962 --> 00:09:24.465
I activate my trap
Borrel Cooling!

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.533
By tributing
Anesthrokket Dragon,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.569
I can equip this trap
on Borreload Dragon.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.774
Now Borreload gains the ability
to target one of my monsters

00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:36.243
and prevent it from being
destroyed in battle

00:09:36.277 --> 00:09:39.046
or by any effects.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:43.550
And naturally, Borreload targets
my Magnarokket Dragon!

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:45.585
Because that triggers
Magnarokket Dragon's

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:46.921
special ability!

00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:50.224
Which will bring all your
moves to a screeching halt!

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.860
By self-destructing,
it sends one of your monsters

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.461
to the graveyard too!

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.430
So your Decode Talker
is lost to the abyss!

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.903
(laughs)

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:06.006
So goes your last
ditch effort, Playmaker.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.175
I stopped it like
all the others,

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:10.010
with not a single problem.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.512
You're like
a pebble in my shoe.

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:14.014
Annoying and uncomfortable, yes,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.217
but ultimately small
and worthless,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.086
not given a second thought
once it's tossed away.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:22.089
And when you lose,
you'll be lost to history.

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:24.791
You're wrong.
I must win.

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.094
And there happen to be exactly
three reasons why I will.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.931
For one...

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.533
I must avenge the horrors
that the Knights of Hanoi

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.535
put me through
a decade ago.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:39.206
Two: Defeating you
is a step towards uncovering

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.108
the truth about
that incident.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:45.746
And three: I must rescue
the one who rescued me.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.748
Did you say three?

00:10:47.848 --> 00:10:49.416
No way...

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.252
Can it be you?

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:53.254
After all of these years?

00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:55.389
(Yusaku)
Ten years to be exact.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:57.791
But I'm back to get justice!

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:04.331
(Emma)
Ooh, interesting.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.333
Ten years ago.

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.269
(Kiyoshi)
Impossible.

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:11.405
But if it's really him...

00:11:11.472 --> 00:11:14.241
Destiny never ceases
to surprise.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:23.484
Playmaker, whether it's ten
years or even a hundred years,

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:26.319
you do not have what
it takes to defeat me!

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.159
Listen to me, Playmaker,
You have it all wrong.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.662
You blame us for all your woes,

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:38.165
when you should instead be
directing your anger

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.600
at SOL Technologies!

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.335
SOL Technologies?

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.439
(Emma)
Ooh, this is getting
juicier and juicier!

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.340
I should do some
digging of my own

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.309
when the gossip's
this good...

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:51.511
And worth a lot of coin!

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:54.981
(Yusaku)
Your attempts to sidetrack
me won't work, Varis.

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:58.318
My past may be hazy,
but I'm sure of one thing.

00:11:58.351 --> 00:11:59.987
The Hanoi must be defeated!

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.254
(surprised grunt)

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:04.057
From my graveyard,
I activate the effect

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:05.726
of Parallel Port Armor!

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.662
I banish this trap along
with two Link Monsters

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:12.233
from my graveyard to upgrade
my Firewall Dragon!

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:15.336
Parallel Port Armor
allows Firewall Dragon

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.037
to attack one final time!

00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.338
Oh, no...

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:21.008
If his Firewall Dragon
attacks again I'll be...

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:22.009
(Ai)
Finished!

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.743
Just like I finished
your thought!

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:27.914
Tempest Terahertz!

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:33.220
(Ai)
Time for you to go kapow!

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.387
(groans)

00:12:41.394 --> 00:12:43.363
(Emma)
Playmaker actually
pulled it off.

00:12:43.397 --> 00:12:45.566
Yes!
Way to duel, Yusaku!

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:46.766
He won!

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:55.308
(Yusaku)
You're finished Varis.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.711
And you'll tell me
everything I want to know.

00:12:57.811 --> 00:12:59.146
(Ai)
No he won't!

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:00.413
He's a baddie.

00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:05.452
So I'll just eat
the info outta him!

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:14.828
I want a meal,
not a snack!

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:20.600
(Ai screams)

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:21.802
What is that?

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:22.903
Father?

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:29.943
Someone's hacking the system

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.378
Retract, Ai!

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:33.613
Lucky villain...

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.054
I can't believe
he's getting away.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.591
I'm a man of my word...

00:13:43.624 --> 00:13:44.958
So here...

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:50.097
It's Blue Angel's antivirus,
as promised.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.467
You may have been victorious
today, Playmaker.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:57.070
But as long as you carry
that A.I. with you,

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:59.540
we won't stop
stalking you down!

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:02.042
This I swear!

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.315
(Ai)
Well, I'll give him
this much.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.151
He certainly knows
how to make an exit.

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:13.119

Where'd she go?

It's okay.
She's just logged out.

Oh, yes...

I was here?

You're always here.
Plus I received a tip.

Have you no idea
what you possess?

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.058
Allow me
to educate you...

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:47.227
The Ignis may be an A.I...

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:50.630
But it's unlike any type
you've ever come across before.

00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:54.802
While A.I. are supposed to do
what we program them to do,

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:57.204
the Ignis do whatever
they want to do,

00:18:57.271 --> 00:18:59.874
because the Ignis,
they have free will.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.508
(gasps)

00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:02.976
Free will...

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:04.377
Lemme guess...

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:07.781
You were dreaming about what
Varis said back in your duel.

00:19:07.847 --> 00:19:09.550
Do you think
any of it's true?

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.184
Now you're
undecided?

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:13.654
You certainly weren't
at the time.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:17.524
Unlike you, the Knights of Hanoi
are on the right side of history

00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:20.661
because we are the ones
who will save the world.

00:19:20.694 --> 00:19:23.330
You would be aiding us instead
of trying to fight us

00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.365
if you weren't so daft.

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.800
Nice try.

00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:28.702
But I don't buy
a single word you said!

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:32.939
We know this much is true:

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.675
Varis certainly believes
in what he is saying.

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:37.177
But still...

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.013
An A.I.
that's actually alive?

00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:41.782
And free to make
his own decisions?

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:43.517
Is that possible?

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.653
I dunno but maybe
we can run some tests...

00:19:46.687 --> 00:19:48.489
You know, try and get
to the bottom

00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:50.290
of this mystery
ourselves.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.960
(Ai)
Uhh, my eye is shut
but my ears are open!

00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:55.229
So give us your take
on all this, Ai.

00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:57.031
On whether
I'm alive or not?

00:19:57.064 --> 00:19:58.465
Why do I gotta prove that?

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:00.000
Just because
I don't breathe oxygen

00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.835
or eat hot dog sandwiches?

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:02.970
(Kolter)
Not a sandwich!

00:20:03.003 --> 00:20:05.806
But if you really insist
then okay, the truth is,

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.307
of course I'm alive!

00:20:07.341 --> 00:20:09.676
If I wasn't, do you
think I could do this?

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.645
What exactly
are you doing, Ai?

00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:13.547
Expressing my free will!

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.549
Huh?
What's that?

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.352
Ai musta snatched
that image file from Varis.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.720
Hmm...

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.855
Wish the resolution
was better though.

00:20:21.955 --> 00:20:24.191
Oh, I'm sorry I'm not
providing pristine pics

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.060
of my personal programming.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.229
But if you ask nicely,
maybe I will...

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.864
Huh?
Huh?

00:20:30.897 --> 00:20:32.666
If you don't show us
right now,

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:35.168
I'll have no choice but
to delete you immediately.

00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:38.005
Umm...
I guess that is nice for you...

00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:41.042
Okay, tighten your britches
and knuckle your robes,

00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:43.843
because the data I retrieved
from Varis is...

00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:46.112
my true form!

00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:49.383
Whoa!

00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:52.385
♪♪♪

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:11.838
Ta-da!

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:14.241
It's Ai version 2.0!

00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:16.910
See me, love me, adore me,
worship me!

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:18.879
Now that I have hands,
I can give you autographs

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.114
before I get too famous!

00:21:21.214 --> 00:21:23.917
Come on, tell me what you think
of this bodacious bod!

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:26.553
And don't hold back on your
praise because I can take how

00:21:26.586 --> 00:21:28.555
awesome you think I am.

00:21:28.589 --> 00:21:29.957
You're small.

00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:30.957
(scoffs)

00:21:31.058 --> 00:21:33.593
Did you absorb any other
data from Varis?

00:21:33.693 --> 00:21:34.795
Well, um...

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:35.796
Let me check...

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.431
Uh...
Nothing of note.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.266
But you're missing
the point.

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.835
I'm more than just
an eyeball now!

00:21:43.404 --> 00:21:46.240
See if there's any
actual useful info in there.
Excuse me!

00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:47.674
Yeah, I'm on it.
Over here!

00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:48.776
Hey, fleshpods!

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.911
What are you doing checking out
flash drives

00:21:50.944 --> 00:21:53.346
when the flashiest thing
since lightning was invented

00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:55.582
is standing right
in front of you?

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:57.417
Oh, come on!

00:21:57.518 --> 00:21:59.220
If ten fingers,
two hands and free will

00:21:59.253 --> 00:22:00.921
don't impress, what will?

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:02.355
How about silence?

00:22:02.455 --> 00:22:04.157
Ai should have
seen that coming.

00:22:04.257 --> 00:22:07.127
Get it?
Ai, as in "A.I."?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.030
Hello? Is this thing on?
Anybody?
