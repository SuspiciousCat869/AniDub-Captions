In a typical Master Duel, there
are five zones for our cards.

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:04.244
But in the new Speed Duel,
that number is cut by 40%,

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.779
down to three.

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.281
This decrease actually makes

00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:09.350
an increase
in the pace of duels,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.019
so that's where the name
Speed Duel comes from.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:14.888
We don't need to run simulations
to know that each card's value

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.924
in a Speed Duel exceeds that
of a Master Duel because...

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:21.762

Number one, if she is my one

I can't risk her getting
harmed in a Speed Duel.

Number two,

I only want to fight
the Knights of Hanoi.

00:13:13.427 --> 00:13:17.097
