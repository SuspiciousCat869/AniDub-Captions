Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.175
(The Shepherd)
I've never needed
anyone's help before,

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:09.944
and I don't need it now.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.247
Even from you, Varis.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.348
You're here to help me,
Shepherd.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.152
I know that AIs have put
your mother in the hospital

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.488
and I know you spent
your entire life erasing AIs.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.125
And of course, you know that
the Knights of Hanoi

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.026
have no love for the Ignis.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.962
So it seems our interests
are aligned,

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.332
and it's in your best interest
to join the Knights of Hanoi.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.003
The Shepherd takes
orders from no one.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.405
I'll fight the Ignis on my own.

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.441
That doesn't work for me,
Shepherd.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.245
So you're going to join me,
whether you like it or not.

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:45.579
Let's duel!

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.417
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.451
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:54.120
Ready, Sheppard?

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.698
So...
This is the power of the Hanoi.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.902
No. This is a mere fragment
of our power.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.037
Now that you're
one of the Hanoi,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.172
I'll help improve your game,

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.708
and you'll help
with my master plan.

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.176
I don't think so.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:19.146
I never agreed
to join you if I lost.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:24.351
And after I defeat the Ignis,
you're next on my bounty list.

How interesting...

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.788
Varis and The Shepherd...

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.424
together in the same place...

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:43.097
Individually,
neither has the ability

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.933
to interfere in my plans.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.334
But if they team together,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.270
that may prove to be
a different story.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.072
So if they're capable of posing

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:55.208
even the slightest bit
of a threat, logically,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.477
it's not something
I should ignore.

00:02:58.078 --> 00:02:59.646
Isn't that right, Jin?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.616
Ah, I forgot,

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:05.319
you're in no state
to conversate.

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.388
And speaking of those
in a state,

00:03:07.488 --> 00:03:09.556
I wonder how Windy is healing.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.398
(grunting)

00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:20.200
Those vile vile
vile vile humans!

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:24.504
How dare they melt me
like a stick of butter!

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.207
But when I heal
and congeal,

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.442
I will crush them under my heel!

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.645
(Lightning)
Look at you, Windy.
Still full of spirit.

00:03:32.813 --> 00:03:36.116
Even when you're half
the Ignis that you used to be.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:36.984
(Windy)
That's right!

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:38.952
And when I'm back to 100%,

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.121
I'll drop
the human population to 0%!

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.824
100%?

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.225
I hate to tell you this,

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.395
but the damage
you took was severe.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:50.498
So some of your coding
can never be fixed.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.698
What?

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.467
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I refuse to hear this, I refuse!

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.802
Are you telling me this is
how I'll look

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.303
for the rest of my days?

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.972
You should be happy
that you have days.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:01.342
Unlike Earth.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.378
(Windy)
Yes, yes, I suppose
it could be worse,

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.913
being decompiled
out of existence.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.381
And I suppose I should feel sad
for Earth but I don't.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.517
I. Do. Not.
'Cause he betrayed us.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.720
Betrayed us by freeing Aqua
and shooing off on his own.

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.222
He would still be
ticking and tocking

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.958
if he decided to join us
instead of the humans.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.561
And Aqua...
is gonna pay as well.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:23.898
Too true,
but not right now.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.934
Just focus
on our current plan.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.369
And where is it
that you think you're going?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.273
(Lightning)
To take care of some business.

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:34.074
What business?

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.209
(Lightning)
Permanent business.

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.384
I still haven't found Lightning.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:46.720
How's the search going
on your end, Ghost Gal?

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:50.290
(Ghost Gal)
Just as well as you,
unfortunately.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.627
(Soulburner)
Ghost Gal!

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.398
Well, guys?

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.034
I hope you three brought me
some good news.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.470
I didn't find any trace
of Lightning.

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:04.738
Neither did I.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.773
Yeah, ditto.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.341
I thought I said
I wanted good news.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.178
Maybe Lightning decided
to just give up?

00:05:11.278 --> 00:05:13.280
I wouldn't be
so optimistic.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.616
(Aqua)
The Lightning we know
never gives up

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.518
once he sets his mind to it.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:20.287
(Ai)
Yeah,
he's the definition of focus.

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:23.290
Well, then I guess we gotta
keep on searchin' for him.

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:24.859
Yeah, but that's
like trying to find

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.293

in a blizzard.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:27.862
Even with my fireflies,

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:30.430
it'll take months
to search all of LINK VRAINS.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:34.268
If we only had more eyeballs
around to assist us,

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.502
we could explore more.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.304
Well don't look at us.

According to
the dictionary, shepherd...

you don't protect

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:32.339
There may be billions of humans,

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:36.210
but as you yourself can attest,
they're sheep.

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:39.346
I have nothing to worry
about from them.

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.881
And as for you, my friend,

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:44.618
you can fight
with all your might,

00:09:44.718 --> 00:09:47.054
but I can fight forever.

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:50.023
Because while my lifespan
is infinite,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.392
yours... is not.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.564
But I can still delete you
with a single keystroke.

00:09:57.398 --> 00:10:01.402
Theoretically you can,
but in reality, you can't.

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:05.106
We are superior to humans
on every level.

00:10:05.206 --> 00:10:07.575
I understand this fact
is difficult for you

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:08.742
since you humans have been

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:11.511
the dominant species
on this planet.

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:14.047
But that time
has come to an end.

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:16.583
And it's time
to pass the baton.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:17.851
To us.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:21.722
Enough!

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:25.125
I didn't come here to debate.
I came here to duel!

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:29.396
(Lightning)
Yes, yes, shut me down because
what you hear scares you.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.633
But if you truly believe
that you're superior,

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.169
then you wouldn't
mind risking...

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:39.539
everything in our duel,
would you?

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:41.675
Everything?

00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:43.944
That's right. Everything.

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:47.047
Meaning your very existence.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.117
If I win, I get your data.

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:54.020
As in, your consciousness
will belong to me.

00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:58.058
But if I win,
I'm erasing you.

00:10:58.358 --> 00:10:59.893
Of course, my friend.

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:02.028
That is only fair.

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:03.463
(laughs)

00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:06.967
You just made
a huge mistake, Ignis.

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.468
'Cause as a bounty hunter,

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:11.238
I've always been willing
to risk everything.

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:13.774
So this duel doesn't
scare me one bit.

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:16.343
Ah, then I must be careful.

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:18.111
Thank you for the warning.

00:11:18.445 --> 00:11:19.646
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.422
Hey, Playmaker,
have you found anything yet?

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.457
No, nothing of consequence.

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:32.959
But according to Kolter,

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:35.129
there should be
something around here.

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:38.031
(Soulburner)
Uh, do you think
he meant something like that?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.735
I bet you won't be
surprised to learn

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.437
that a certain
Ignis's fingerprints

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.272
are all over that portal.

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.107
And I can guess which one.

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:48.842
Yeah!
Lightning's!

00:11:49.109 --> 00:11:50.610
Indeed.

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:52.312
We finally found him.

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.414
You sure?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.282
What if it turns out
to be a trap?

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:58.952
Even if it is, we can't risk
letting a lead slip us by.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:11:59.786
Let's go!

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:01.355
You heard Aqua.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.223
Let's get the going, going.

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:05.058
(Flame)
And bring this war to an end

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.394
before it spins
further out of control.

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:08.529
Let's move.

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:09.496
Okay!

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.003
Surprise surprise,

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:17.137
Playmaker and his pals

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.673
are butting into other
people's business again.

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:22.876
You're going as well?

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.479
Of course I am, I wouldn't miss
this opportunity for the world.

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:29.684
Then I shall
accompany you.

00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:33.687
(Roken &amp; Spectre)
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.025
(Soulburner)
We're here!

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:40.694
But where's here?

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:41.661
Yeah, right.

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:43.563
(gasps)

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:46.533
It's The Shepherd!

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.701
Say what?

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:50.537
(Ai)
And it's obvious
who he's duelin', Playmaker!

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.340
It's Jin!

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:56.009
More like the yellow guy
standin' on his arm,

00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:57.411
but same difference right?

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.213
Lightning may be
in control of Jin,

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:00.814
but that is not Jin dueling.

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:02.816
Hey Shepherd!

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.618
What are you
doing here?

00:13:04.752 --> 00:13:07.888
I could ask all of you
the same thing.

00:13:07.955 --> 00:13:10.390
I told Ghost Gal
to leave me alone,

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.160
but she decides
to bring her dweeb team.

00:13:13.394 --> 00:13:14.494
(Ai)
Dweebs?

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:17.665
How dare you talk to everyone
except for me that way!

00:13:17.932 --> 00:13:21.268
The Shepherd is here
because I invited him here.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.903
I left the portal open
so that you could join us

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.074
as spectators
and watch him lose.

00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:28.275
Oh really?

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:31.277
And what exactly makes ya think
you're gonna win, huh?

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:31.945
Huh?

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:34.915
Because I have no other choice
but to win.

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:37.818
Not if I want
to win this war.

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:39.753
You weren't here
when The Shepherd and I

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.422
had our little tete-a-tete
about sheep,

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:43.723
but to summarize:

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.661
On my side, there's only me,
Windy and Bohman.

00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.331
While there are many more
non-sheep on your side

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.500
who wish to destroy us.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.436
And if The Shepherd
changes his mind

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:57.771
and teams up with you well,

00:13:57.905 --> 00:14:00.073
that would make
my fight more difficult.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.644
So it's important to cut away
the weeds.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.812
Did you just call me a weed?

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:08.482
Let's be honest,
that is what you are.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:10.684
You're just a nuisance.

00:14:10.818 --> 00:14:15.121
After all, you are the weakest
duelist currently in the room.

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:17.224
(grunts)

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:20.794
Then it will be humiliating
when the weakest duelist

00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.129
crushes you into oblivion!

00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:25.699
I'm going first.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:29.769
I'll start by summoning
DRONE XL from my hand!

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:37.811
And I'm going to use this
DRONE to forge my circuit!

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:43.817
I Link Summon!
Link 1 BATTLEDRONE SARGEANT!

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.457
Since I sent DRONE XL
to the graveyard

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:51.058
in order to Link Summon,

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:53.494
its special ability activates,

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:57.664
allowing me to summon one
DRONE TOKEN to my field!

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.902
And whenever there's
a DRONE on my field,

00:15:01.969 --> 00:15:05.238
I'm allowed to summon
SCUD DRONE from my hand!

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:11.378
Next, I'll set
my BATTLEDRONE SARGEANT

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.947
and my SCUD DRONE
in the Link Arrows

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:16.050
to Link Summon again!

00:15:16.183 --> 00:15:19.386
Link 2 BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:25.058
And what I can do twice,
I can do thrice!

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:29.296
The summoning conditions
require my final two DRONES!

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:34.868
I Link Summon!
Link 3 BATTLEDRONE GENERAL!

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:38.773
You summoned your best
monster already?

00:15:38.873 --> 00:15:41.242
The best is still yet to come

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:43.043
because my GENERAL's ability

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:46.046
resummons a DRONE
from my graveyard.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.449
Take flight,
BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:52.219
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:54.421
(Soulburner)
Now that's what I call
a first turn.

00:15:54.755 --> 00:15:57.124
He got everything
he wanted plus dessert.

00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:58.191
He's crushing it.

00:16:00.594 --> 00:16:02.095
That may be true,

00:16:02.162 --> 00:16:05.099
but we have yet to see
what Lightning has in response.

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:07.034
It's my turn.

00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:09.402
If you'll do the honors
for me, Jin?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.308
Huh.

00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:17.077
I'll activate the field spell

00:16:17.611 --> 00:16:19.412
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM.

00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:31.791
You see this?

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:34.027
Yeah, I do.

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.830
(Soulburner)
This whole place
is getting a makeover.

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:50.610
(Lightning)
If we're going to fight,
let us fight as gladiators.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.948
When I activate
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM,

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:55.916
I get to draw

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:59.286
one ARMATOS LEGIO monster
from my deck.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.257
It appears that we have
arrived just in time.

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:07.828
Do you think The Shepherd has
any chance of winning this duel?

00:17:07.895 --> 00:17:09.997
He does if he actually
listened to me...

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:13.867
But If he didn't, well...
he's gonna wish he did.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.906
(Lightning)
I'll summon the card
I just drew:

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:21.242
ARMATOS LEGIO SICA.

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:24.712
And I shall use it
to illuminate my circuit.

00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:27.881
I set my SICA
in the Link Arrow

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.549
to Link Summon...

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:33.420
Link 1 ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:42.329
Next, my ARMATOS COLOSSEUM
activates its second effect.

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:45.365
By discarding an ARMATOS LEGIO
from my hand,

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.168
I can resurrect SICA
from my graveyard

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:51.138
and summon it
next to DECURION's link

00:17:51.205 --> 00:17:52.639
in defense mode.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.642
But I still wish
to have another monster.

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.544
So it's fortunate
that I can discard

00:17:57.677 --> 00:18:02.749
another ARMATOS LEGIO to summon
SPECULATA from my hand.

00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:08.255
And with that, I can now do
what I want to do.

00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:12.626
The summoning conditions
require two ARMATOS LEGIO.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.498
I Link Summon.
Link 2 ARMATOS LEGIO CENTURION.

00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:25.238
And I can use
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM's effect

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:28.709
to discard an ARMATOS LEGIO
to bring back

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:32.079
both SPECULATA and SICA
from my graveyard

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:35.649
and summon them
next to my CENTURION's links.

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:39.153
And with an extra monster,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.955
I get an extra chance
to Link Summon.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:44.291
I set SPECULATA
in the Link Arrow

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:47.160
to Link Summon
a second DECURION.

00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:52.432
Now, I activate my Link Spell...

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:54.201
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:55.202
Hmm.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:57.738
(Lightning)
Yes, you heard correctly.

00:18:57.805 --> 00:19:01.308
It's not a Link Monster,
but a Link Spell.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.511
When a Link Monster is linked
to JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:08.048
its attack points
double during battle.

00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:10.484
So the more Link Monsters
I summon,

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:13.119
the more damage
I will deal.

00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:16.523
That's the card Varis
warned me about.

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.558
And the Ignis
doesn't have a clue

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.861
that I already know
all about it.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.665
(Lightning)
I'm going to illuminate
my circuit again!

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:28.635
I set two ARMATOS LEGIOS
in the Link Arrows

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:31.872
to Link Summon another CENTURION

00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:34.007
right next to JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:39.013
As expected, the Ignis
summoned CENTURION

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:40.981
next to JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:42.649
No surprise there.

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:46.319
Let's see if The Shepherd's
capable of dealing with it.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.555
It's time to battle.

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:51.791
CENTURION, attack
BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:55.729
And begin to bring
an end to this duel.

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.465
(Ai)
Well, you can stick a fork
in Shepherd's pie.

00:19:58.532 --> 00:20:00.967
Due to JUDGMENT ARROWS,
all of Lightning's monsters

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:02.970
are gonna get double
the attack points.

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:05.539
So if all of Lightning's attacks
are able to get through,

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:07.808
The Shepherd will
run out of life points.

00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:09.142
It's hard for me to believe

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.878
that The Shepherd
would lose so quickly.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.481
Is it?

00:20:14.548 --> 00:20:16.283
It's not for me.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.818
It should be.

00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:20.187
Because you fell for my trap!

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.457
I activate SNATCH DRONE!

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.693
It not only negates
your spell card,

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:28.995
it also destroys it!

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:32.165
So your JUDGMENT ARROWS
is no more!

00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:33.133
What?

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:40.640
(Varis)
So he did take my advice.

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:42.142
Indeed he did.

00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:43.711
And reconstructed
his deck

00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:46.379
accordingly to counteract
the Link Spell.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.482
(The Shepherd)
And I also know one thing

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:50.651
that you conveniently
forgot to mention.

00:20:50.718 --> 00:20:52.719
When JUDGMENT ARROWS
leaves the field,

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:55.388
all monsters it's linked to
are destroyed.

00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:56.656
(Lightning)
Oh, really.

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:59.626
You seem to have done
your research on me,

00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:03.230
but you didn't do
your research on everything.

00:21:03.363 --> 00:21:06.466
When an effect would destroy
my ARMATOS LEGIO,

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:09.036
I can send DECURION
to the graveyard

00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:12.439
to prevent my other monsters
from being destroyed.

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:15.208
And my CENTURION is
still strong enough

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:17.878
to destroy
your BATTLEDRONE WARRANT!

00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:19.679
Fortis Lux!

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:23.783
(explosion)

00:21:26.887 --> 00:21:29.522
With that, I end my turn.

00:21:29.723 --> 00:21:31.625
When The Shepherd
countered JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:34.528
I thought he had
lightning on the ropes for sure.

00:21:34.595 --> 00:21:36.230
I thought he did
as well.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.032
But Lightning
was still one step ahead.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.035
(Ai)
That's true and everything,
but unlike his sombrero,

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.538
it's not like The Shepherd's
in bad shape.

00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:46.706
He does have the strongest
monster on the field.

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:49.576
And that counts for more
than a stack of paper clips.

00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:50.710
(gasps)

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:54.014
It's my turn, Ignis.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.685
And with it, I will end you
once and for all!

00:22:04.024 --> 00:22:09.029
