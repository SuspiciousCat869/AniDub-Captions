WEBVTT

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.437
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.573
C'mon! Get 'im!

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:08.509
Ah!

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.110
(Knight of Hanoi)
It's a dead end.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.678
(Playmaker)
You down there.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:14.247
Take my hand.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.921
You should stay
away from the Hanoi

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:22.089
for your own safety.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.291
Well, that's not gonna happen!

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.294
I know those guys
are uber dangerous.

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:30.597
But if they're the ones who
are behind the Lost Incident...

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.334
I'll track 'em down forever!

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.935
(Playmaker)
Take my advice...

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.237
Log out and don't come back.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.507
I may not be around next time
to save you.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.614
(Knight of Hanoi)
You can't run, kid.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:50.650
(Kolter)
Heads up!

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.751
(gasps)

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:56.824
Since we have a foe in common,

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.425
how about we help each other?

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.894
Maybe meet up when you
get back to the real world?

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:05.231
I know you told me to stay
out of LINK VRAINS,

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:09.036
but you know I can't do that cuz
I gotta help my brother Jin.

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.138
And I could sure use your help.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.041
You watch my back,
and I'll watch yours.

00:01:14.475 --> 00:01:16.209
I may not be a great duelist,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.580
but you won't find a better
hacker or programmer anywhere.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.148
(Yusaku)
Kolter, is it?

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.383
My name is Yusaku Fujiki.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.418
Let's get to work.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:35.829
♪♪♪

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:37.224
Wait!

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:38.425
Oh.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.561
Ah!

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.295
Aah! Ah!

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.833
Hold on.
I'm gonna pull you up.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.334
Hurry up.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.635
My hand's slippin'!

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.605
(grunts)

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.707
(Kolter)
Looks like a bunch
of other duelists

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:55.376
weren't as lucky as me.

00:02:55.476 --> 00:02:57.477
If it wasn't for your
super quick reflexes

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:00.247
I would've been skewered
worse than a campfire hotdog.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.050
I'm sure that would not
have been enjoyable.

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:04.385
(Kolter)
No kiddin'.

00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:05.452
What was this?

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.454
The third,
fourth trap we've run into?

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.189
(Playmaker)
Hmm.

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.657
Don't you mean
you've run into?

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.125
Got me there.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.727
So like,
do you think it's worth it

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.495
to keep exploring this dungeon?

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:18.965
Don't forget that this
was actually your idea.

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:21.701
(Kolter)
Mmm.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.641
(sighs)

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.510
(Yusuka)
No matter how many
Hanoi I defeat,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.146
I feel no closer to learning

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.281
the truth
about the Lost Incident.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:38.051
I get ya but we just
gotta keep on pushin' on.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.353
Most of the Hanoi know nothing,

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:41.522
but some of 'em have to know

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:43.457
somethin' about somethin',
right?

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.793
The leaders
of the Hanoi must know,

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.894
but how do we ever find them?

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.463
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:51.998
Mm?

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:54.835
What's that you're
you're working on?

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.103
(Kolter)
Oh, this thing?

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.639
Just a lil' research
I was doing in the deep net.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.440
You know
how the Knights of Hanoi

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.209
are hunting for Cyberse cards?

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.345
This site says there's
a secret dungeon in LINK VRAINS

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.780
that houses a deck full of 'em.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.415
But who knows.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:10.183
It's just a rumor.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.052
(Yusaku)
But what if it's not
just a rumor?

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:13.087
Mm?

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:14.621
The Knights of Hanoi
would surely want to get

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.089
their hands on these cards.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.959
So if we can get this deck
in our possession instead,

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.061
the Hanoi will come to us.

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:23.530
And not just any Hanoi.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.965
For a deck this valuable

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:28.168
I believe their leaders would
personally want to hunt us down.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.169
Let's go.

00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.172
Ah.
R-Right.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.344
(Kolter)
It's a dead end.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:38.445
(Playmaker)
Perhaps...

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.281
But I find it
difficult to believe

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.517
that they would booby trap
a dead end.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.018
(Kolter)
You sure?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:48.021
You've been massaging
that wall a good ten minutes.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.022
(sighs)

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.965
(Kolter)
Nice. Didn't doubt ya for a sec.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.803
But surprise surprise...
another trap.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.105
(Playmaker)
But I believe
it's the final one.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:05.972
Look.

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.941
The deck must be
inside that coffer.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.443
(Kolter)
But how are we supposed
to reach it?

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:15.649
(Knight of Hanoi)
Yes!

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.684
I've found the Cyberse Deck!

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:20.587
(laughing)

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:25.359
(Knight of Hanoi)
The Cyberse Deck
shall belong to the Hanoi!

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:26.427
(laughing)

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.930
It's just our luck
that the Hanoi's here too.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.864
Actually...

00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:33.433
this may turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.835
We can learn
how this trap works.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:38.905
Oh.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.256
I see.

00:05:55.322 --> 00:05:58.458
The final trap I have
to get past is a duel puzzle.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.927
(laughing)

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.638
If this really is
a duel puzzle,

00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:12.873
then the rules
are pretty easy.

00:06:12.973 --> 00:06:15.542
You just have to win
the duel in one turn.

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.011
The rules may be simple,

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.745
but the actual
puzzle may not be.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:21.315
I sure hope so cuz
if he solves this trap,

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:23.484
he's getting the Cyberse deck.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:24.418
You're right.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:25.919
But there's no point worrying

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.988
about things
that we cannot control.

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:31.224
What we can do is figure out
this puzzle ourselves...

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:33.326
in case the Hanoi
fails to solve it.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.028
(Kolter)
But what's the point of that?

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.329
If he messes up,

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.032
he can just keep on trying
'til he gets the right answer.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.701
Perhaps that's true.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:42.836
But from what I've
seen of this dungeon...

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.039
I don't think
you get second chances.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.008
(Kolter)
All right then,
let's break down this puzzle.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:49.543
You're takin' on a ghost
who could use

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:51.312
a little more moisturizer.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.979
And he has 4000 life points,

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:55.382
which is a lot of life
for someone who's not alive.

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:58.319
He has five monsters
on his field

00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.487
that are Extra Linked,

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.222
meaning that they're
all linked together,

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:03.390
along with one facedown card.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.492
And on our side,
we have two monsters

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.261
and two facedown cards.

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:09.296
We also have
three cards in our hand,

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:12.066
but I can't see
what they are from here...

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.934
Well, I think that's everything.

00:07:14.068 --> 00:07:16.270
Let's see how this Hanoi
handles this.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.038
(laughs)

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.073
I've solved the puzzle!

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.608
Watch!

00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:24.411
First, I equip UPDATE JAMMER
with MEGAMORPH

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.547
to double its attack points!

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.283
When UPDATE JAMMER
destroys a monster in battle,

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:33.820
its special ability deals
1000 points of damage.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.256
So if it attacks
your LINK SPIDER,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.293
I'll deal 3000 points
of damage from the battle

00:07:39.393 --> 00:07:41.796
and 1000
from the special ability,

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:44.731
which equals all 4000
of your life points!

00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:46.766
He figured it out!

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:50.937
What a joke.
This was too easy.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.307
UPDATE JAMMER!
Attack LINK SPIDER!

00:07:58.112 --> 00:07:59.546
Wha--?
CHAOS BURST?

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.314
By tributing a monster,

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:05.318
that trap destroys my monster
and deals 1000 points of damage!

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.357
I didn't know he had that trap.

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:11.859
But now that I do,

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.495
there's no way that I'm going
to fall for it a second time.

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.563
What should I do instead?

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.200
Maybe I should attack
that other monster first...

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300
But if I do...

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:22.269
What's this?

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:31.344
Oh!

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.816
(screaming)

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:46.460
Ah?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.728
As I thought...

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:49.196
Like the other traps,

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.799
you only get one shot
to solve it.

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:54.501
Oh man,
what a way to go out.

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:55.836
Not in a hail of glory,

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.271
but as a teeny
tiny appetizer.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.107
I hate to be a downer...

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:02.676
But the same thing'll
happen to you if you lose.

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.778
It is a risk that we must take

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.015
if we ever want to possess
that Cyberse Deck.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.184
And we've come too far
to back down now.

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:18.024
Let's go.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.503
Time to duel.

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:33.174
Here I go!

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.174
I draw!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.044
For this puzzle,

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:39.413
the four cards in my hand
are TREMENDOUS FIRE,

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:42.416
THUNDER CRASH, MEGAMORPH
and CYBERSE GADGET.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:46.520
Along with two facedown cards,
I have two monsters on my field:

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:49.055
UPDATE JAMMER and SEA ARCHIVER.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:51.525
And my facedown cards
are LINK RESTART

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.027
and TORRENTIAL REBORN.

00:09:53.127 --> 00:09:54.794
Remember to look at everything!

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:58.098
Don't forget to check your deck
and your graveyard too!

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:00.434
I have DOTSCAPER
in my graveyard...

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:05.038
And I have three
Link Monsters in my Extra Deck:

00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:06.607
SECURE GARDNA,

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:08.275
BINARY SORCERESS

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:09.843
and PROXY DRAGON.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.012
I have 100 life points.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.848
He has 4000.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.683
And like last time,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.053
his five Link Monsters
are all Extra Linked.

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.791
The Knight of Hanoi chose
to attack with UPDATE JAMMER

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:26.894
because it has
two powerful abilities.

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:28.696
During damage calculation,

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:31.365
it can not only negate
all other card effects,

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.967
but it can also deal
1000 points of damage

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:36.002
if it destroys a monster.

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:37.737
But we both know
how that turned out.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:38.839
What a joke.

00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:41.908
UPDATE JAMMER!
Attack LINK SPIDER!

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.711
Hmm?
I don't get it.

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:48.014
If UPDATE JAMMER negates
all other card effects,

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:51.117
then how was CHAOS BURST
able to use its effect?

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:52.853
Because of timing.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.256
You see the ghost
activated CHAOS BURST

00:10:55.356 --> 00:10:57.524
right when
UPDATE JAMMER attacked.

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.627
Since an attack occurs
before damage is calculated,

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:03.430
UPDATE JAMMER's special
ability never triggered.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.332
That's being nitpicky.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.501
No, that's knowing
the rules.

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.502
Mmm.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:11.839
Well... you say toma-toe,
I say toma-toh.

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:14.808
But knowing
these subtleties are key.

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:16.443
Cause this is a tough one.

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:20.014
Well I find it helpful when
you break it down step by step.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.415
Starting with this:

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:24.651
Can you deal damage
without using any monsters?

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.521
I have three cards
that can do that.

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.490
TREMENDOUS FIRE,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.925
THUNDER CRASH

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.259
and TORRENTIAL REBORN.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:35.696
TREMENDOUS FIRE lets you
deal 1000 points of damage,

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:37.765
but you'll take 500 also.

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:40.600
And since you only have
100 life points to play with,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.769
you can go ahead
and rule that spell card out.

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.739
That would leave
these two cards.

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:48.775
Hmm.

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:51.812
THUNDER CRASH is a spell
that destroys all my monsters

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.748
and deals 300 points
of damage for each one.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.817
While TORRENTIAL REBORN
is a trap

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:59.086
that revives my monsters
from my graveyard

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:02.322
and deals 500 points of damage
for each of those monsters.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:04.825
But to activate
TORRENTIAL REBORN,

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.526
I need
a Water Attribute monster,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.996
which I do have in SEA ARCHIVER.

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:11.932
But how can you deal
4000 points of damage

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:13.667
with just those two cards?

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.902
The math just
doesn't add up.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.239
Maybe it does...

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:25.478
Did Playmaker
solve the puzzle?

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:26.880
Or did he zonk it?

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.749
Think logically, AI.

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.750
If Playmaker failed
to solve the puzzle,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.020
we wouldn't be here
to have this conversation,

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:33.921
would we?

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:36.490
Shees!
Spoiler alert.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.158
Actually...

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.162
It wasn't that easy.

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:43.731
(Playmaker)
First, I summon CYBERSE GADGET!

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:46.199
Due to my GADGET's
special ability,

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:49.136
I am allowed to summon
a Level 2 or lower monster

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.304
from my graveyard
in defense mode.

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:54.240
Come on out, DOTSCAPER!

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:57.711
Now, I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.649
In order to Link Summon...

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:04.618
I require
two non-Token monsters.

00:13:07.387 --> 00:13:10.390
I Link Summon Link 2
BINARY SORCERESS!

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:16.663
Since CYBERSE GADGET
was sent to the graveyard,

00:13:16.764 --> 00:13:20.767
its special ability activates,
summoning one GADGET TOKEN.

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:24.638
Next,
DOTSCAPER's ability activates!

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:27.641
When it's sent to the graveyard,
it can resummon itself!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.210
(Kolter)
Nice!

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:32.746
Now you got five monsters
on your field!

00:13:33.447 --> 00:13:35.115
That means you can
use THUNDER CRASH

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.251
and TORRENTIAL REBORN
to deal enough damage

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:38.385
to win this duel!

00:13:39.887 --> 00:13:41.455
Actually, I'm going to-

00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:42.723
(mocking laugh)

00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:43.757
(Kolter)
Huh?

00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:44.958
That won't work.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:47.895
Because TORRENTIAL REBORN
can't resurrect a TOKEN.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:50.965
But you've given me enough clues
to solve this puzzle.

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:53.567
Another Hanoi?
Aww c'mon!

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.035
Now step away.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.771
Before I send you
plunging into the abyss!

00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:59.206
Oh no ya won't!

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:00.941
(grunts)

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.642
Wait, what are you doing?

00:14:02.776 --> 00:14:03.443
(grunts)

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.212
(Knight of Hanoi)
Let me go!

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:07.848
Ah!

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:08.815
Huh?

00:14:09.883 --> 00:14:11.117
Hey, are you okay?

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:12.953
I'm good.

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:15.789
But I'm not sure how long
this chain will hold him.

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:17.791
Long enough.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:19.459
You sure?

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.129
Hanoi part two said that trap
won't win ya the duel.

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:23.630
And he is right.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:26.066
Well,
actually he is only half right.

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:29.870
But that's why I already had
a different move in mind.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.807
I Link Summon Link 2
PROXY DRAGON!

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.712
Next I'll set BINARY SORCERESS

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:40.981
in the Link Arrow
to Link Summon again!

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:44.718
Link 1 SECURE GARDNA!

00:14:46.954 --> 00:14:48.289
(chuckles)

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:49.657
You sure messed up!

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.192
That isn't the way
you solve the duel puzzle!

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.161
(gasps)

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:55.629
(Knight of Hanoi)
(laughing)

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.799
You can't win if you have
fewer monsters than before!

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.202
And you have
no monsters left to summon!

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:02.169
Yeah.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.772
I hate to admit it
but this bozo's right.

00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:06.173
(Playmaker)
Is he now?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.174
Ah?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.543
Do you remember
what you told me earlier?

00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:12.012
You said to break down
this puzzle step by step.

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:15.749
Since all those individual steps
have led us to this moment,

00:15:15.849 --> 00:15:17.851
this must be
the correct direction.

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:19.753
Hey, you're right.

00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:21.021
I got so caught up

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:23.123
on how it didn't look
like it was working

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:25.426
that I forgot
that it was working.

00:15:25.526 --> 00:15:28.395
And I know you're gonna make
the rest of this work too!

00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:34.301
Here goes!
I activate... TREMENDOUS FIRE!

00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.205
You take 1000 points of damage
while I take 500!

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:39.940
Great work, genius!

00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:42.509
You dropped your own
life points to 0!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.511
Aww no!

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:45.879
And..

00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:49.216
I also activate my trap card
LINK RESTART!

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.184
It negates any damage

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:53.120
I would take
from TREMENDOUS FIRE!

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.554
(Kolter)
Aww he has one too!

00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:57.123
It also re-summons
one Link Monster

00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:58.258
from my graveyard.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.294
BINARY SORCERESS!

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:07.134
You're back to five monsters!

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:10.571
Now's the time to activate
my spell THUNDER CRASH!

00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:13.273
It destroys
all five of my monsters

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:16.243
and deals you 300 points
of damage for each of them.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.345
That's a total of 1500 points!

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.585
2500 life points left to go!

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:28.688
Since my SEA ARCHIVER
was just destroyed,

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:32.459
I'm allowed to activate
my trap card TORRENTIAL REBORN!

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:36.463
It resurrects all my monsters
that were just destroyed,

00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:40.267
and you take 500 points
of damage for each monster!

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.137
That's 2500 points of damage...

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:46.740
which is exactly the same amount
of life points you have left!

00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.619
(Kolter)
The deck's right there!

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:02.222
(grunting)

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:03.757
C'mon will you budge?

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:06.260
Quick! Let's move!

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.094
Ah!
Hold it!

00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:15.069
We did it.

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.704
Let's get this deck
and ditch this crypt!

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.976
Aah!

00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:24.411
(gasps)

00:17:27.148 --> 00:17:27.981
Ha!

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.417
Seems the deck
was nothing but a hoax.

00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:31.751
(laughing)

00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.654
We went and risked our lives
for nothing, dude?

00:17:35.422 --> 00:17:37.057
Not cool, man!

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.364
(Playmaker)
This place is collapsing.
We need to log out.

00:17:54.642 --> 00:17:56.577
(Kolter)
I'm done taking
wild goose chases

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:58.145
for a lifetime.

00:17:58.212 --> 00:17:59.480
(Yusaku)
Are you sure?

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:02.249
How about taking
one last one?

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:07.054
(Kolter)
Uh, if you mean taking
a long walk off a short pier,

00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:09.223
that's a hard no.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.891
(Yusaku)
Just follow me.

00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:16.964
We're here.

00:18:17.064 --> 00:18:18.765
(Kolter)
Here where?

00:18:22.202 --> 00:18:23.703
I've been doing some thinking...

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.140
Since the Cyberse Deck
wasn't in the dungeon,

00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:29.576
what if that duel puzzle
wasn't the final puzzle?

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:31.945
When I solved the duel,

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:34.315
the play field formed
a unique layout.

00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:38.485
A layout which looked like
a specific district in Den City.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:40.954
The one we're
walking in right now.

00:18:41.055 --> 00:18:43.390
I believe that
this map will point us

00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:45.492
to the location
of the hidden deck.

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:47.928
But how do you know
where we're supposed to go?

00:18:48.062 --> 00:18:49.796
I didn't see a big
neon X on the map

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.565
saying X marks the spot.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:54.402
The precise location of the deck
was actually hidden

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:55.603
within the duel itself.

00:18:55.703 --> 00:18:57.538
Think back to the duel, Kolter.

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:58.773
Do you remember what happened

00:18:58.873 --> 00:19:00.507
when I summoned a Link Monster?

00:19:00.608 --> 00:19:01.174
(Kolter)
Yeah.

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:02.275
A pillar would rise up

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:05.445
showing that those
Link Monsters are connected.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.615
That's right.

00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.284
But when I summoned
SECURE GARDNA

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.953
a pillar didn't rise
to link those two cards.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.122
The pillar only rose
at the very end of the duel

00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:18.191
when the puzzle was solved

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.127
and every Link Monster
on the field

00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:21.729
was connected to each other.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.299
As if to say that SECURE GARDNA
was the final key.

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.836
So now back here
in the real world,

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:33.273
the location on the map where
I summoned SECURE GARDNA...

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.676
is here.

00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:41.114
(gasping)

00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:47.120
This coffer sure doesn't look
like a hologram this time!

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:55.829
I've never seen some of these
Cyberse cards before.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.999
And I'm sure
neither have the Hanoi.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.536
They will come after us
in full force to destroy them.

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:04.437
And we'll be waiting.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:08.141
Looks like our partnership's
off to a rip roarin' start!

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:13.780
(AI)
Aww, if I had tear ducts
I'd be crying right now.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.017
Now I understand why
your Cyberse Deck is so unique.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:18.018
Yeah.

00:20:18.118 --> 00:20:19.119
(AI)
Ah?

00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:21.821
Too bad Yusaku's not here
to add to the story.

00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:23.791
Hmm.

00:20:23.857 --> 00:20:25.125
He doesn't need to be.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:31.498
(Shima)
I know your secret, Yusaku.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.369
I know... that you're Playmaker!

00:20:37.204 --> 00:20:39.874
Heh!
But you look nuthin' like him!

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:41.842
But Playmaker's sidekick here

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:44.177
will help you out
with some styling tips!

00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:46.146
Some styling tips?

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.615
Yeah, for my costume party?

00:20:49.283 --> 00:20:50.117
Ahh...

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.285
I heard thru the grapevine

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:53.187
that you're dressin'
up as Playmaker!

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:54.287
So flash!

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:55.622
It's like my best friends

00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:57.358
in both the real
and virtual worlds

00:20:57.458 --> 00:20:59.126
are fusing into one!

00:20:59.193 --> 00:21:00.360
(laughs)

00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.396
But I won't spoil your surprise

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.865
if ya fill out
my invitations for me!

00:21:05.299 --> 00:21:06.566
Huh!?
Where'd he go?

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:08.768
Yusaku!

00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:13.273
The real Playmaker
woulda helped me out!

00:21:15.676 --> 00:21:17.678
(Kolter)
Yusaku doesn't
need to sit around here

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:18.712
and add to the story

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.683
because he's still
writing it to this day.

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:25.118
And I don't know
what the final chapter will be,

00:21:25.218 --> 00:21:28.521
but those first few pages
set the stage for everything.

00:21:29.423 --> 00:21:30.357
(Knight of Hanoi)
No!

00:21:30.724 --> 00:21:32.859
Who are you?
What do you want?

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:37.932
My name is Playmaker.

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:42.502
And I'm going to put an end
to the Knights of Hanoi!
