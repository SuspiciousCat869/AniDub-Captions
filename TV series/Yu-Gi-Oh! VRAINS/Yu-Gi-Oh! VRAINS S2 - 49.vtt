Yes, that duelist
has an Ignis.

Soulburner, you
do of course realize

that two on one is
against the rules?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.152

F for ferocious.

down an Ignis, Bit.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.051
Yes and they never
said Playmakers,

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:40.654

Right, boss (squawks).

Speed Duel.
Speed Duel.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.941
We are going first, capiche?

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.578
I begin by suminifying
D-Scale Saber Sardine

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:42.516
(electronics beeping)

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:45.719
Saber Sardine's special
ability lets us walk

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:49.356
over 500 light points to
summon a D-Scale token.

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:52.126
And with these two monsters,

00:04:52.193 --> 00:04:54.528
We can bridge our circuit.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.597
We setifize our Saber Sardine

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.132
and our token in
the link arrows.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:01.968
(Both) We link summon.

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:04.905
Link to D-Scale battles Coela.

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.778
Whoa, nice catch.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.581
Next, we activate our
spell D-Scale torpedo

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:18.285
and equipulate it
with Battle Coela.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.989
And this here swimmer's got
other tricks up its fins'.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:25.592
Indeed, it can matricularize
itself from the extra

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.796
Monster Zone to the
main Monster Zone.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.331
Huh, why would they
move their monster?

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.699
Yeah.

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:35.903
You don't need to
percolate long for an answer.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.737
It's moved so that
I can maximize

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.641
the effectivity of my
skilled Marker's Portal.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.978
It permits me to activitate
a links spell from our deck.

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.813
This one to be precising.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:49.150
Please, now focus
your oculids and gaze

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.152
upon on the links
spell, Judgment Arrows!

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:53.320
When a Link Monster

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.822
that's connected to
Judgment Arrows battles,

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.958
it's attack points get doubled.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.626
But, on the down side,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.396
if Judgment Arrows
leaves the field,

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:05.565
all their monsters next
to it's links get iced.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.169
That crazy hybrid mash up's
playing with links spells too?

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:12.506
Not just any links
spell, but Judgment Arrows.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.309
The same card that was
used against Playmaker.

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:16.910
And against the Cyberse,

00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:18.545
even if they weren't
directly involved

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.514
with the destruction
of my whole world,

00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:23.050
they must know who's behind it.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:24.718
That's info we must acquire.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:25.986
That's true.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.056
Plus, they just deserve
a good old smack down.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.925
We activitate our
Coela's ability,

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:35.596
allowing us to move our
aquaderm to a new location,

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:38.164
indicitated by Judgment Arrows.

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:42.536
Consequently, sliding one
space over in the Monster Zone.

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:45.372
Why would you move
your monster again?

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.041
Everything we do
serves a purpose.

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.710
And that purpose is
going to clobber ya,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.746
'cause we're puttin'
our equip spell

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:54.548
D-Scale torpedo into action.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.418
Every time the
monster it's equipped

00:06:57.485 --> 00:06:59.352
to swims to another space,

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.921
you take 800 points of damage.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:03.924
Damage every time
that thing moves?

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.160
No wonder why
people hate moving.

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:07.294
Nice one.

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.963
Since Coela ambulated
twice this turn,

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.799
you receive 1600
points of damage.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.803
(explosion booms)

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.638
(computer beeping)

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:19.607
(evil laughing)

00:07:19.607 --> 00:07:21.775
Our three card combinatorium

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.278
will keep slashing away
your life points every turn.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.082
Until you ain't
got nothing left.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:30.951
Except for your Ignis,
which we will possessify.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.754
(Both) We end our turn.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.956
Ah man, I don't know
how many more times

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:38.459
I'll be able to survive
taking a pounding like that.

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:40.494
Thrice, to be precise.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:43.630
If their monster moves
three more times we lose.

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.466
You must break their
combo before then.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.603
Then that's exactly
what I'll do, Flame.

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.104
I draw!

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:56.476
I draw!

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.814
First, I'll place
this face down.

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:05.152
Next, by sending
Salamangreat Foxy,

00:08:05.152 --> 00:08:07.821
in my hand, to the
graveyard, I can summon

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.356
Salamangreat in the air.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:16.730
And Salamangreat Foxy has
it's own special ability.

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:19.666
When there is a face up
Speller-Trap card on the field

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:23.037
and you have two, I can
send another Salamangreat,

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:25.672
in my hand, to the
graveyard, to revive Foxy.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:32.313
Then Foxy gets to destroy one
of those Speller-Trap cards.

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:34.981
So, your judgment arrows
is going up in flames.

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:38.986
(blazing fire)

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.455
I perish the thought
It ain't happening

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:45.392
Since we used our skill
marker's portal to call out

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.828
this card, none of your effects
or abilities can destroy it.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.798
Seriously?

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.901
Ah, yes. Seriously.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.002
Why wouldn't they be serious?

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.538
Remind me to teach you
about being rhetorical.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.774
But, for now we've
got to battle.

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:04.878
Salamangreat Falcon's ability
activates from my graveyard.

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:07.615
My returning Salamangreat
mirror to my hand,

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.516
Falcon takes it's place.

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:15.956
And when Salamangreat
mirror returns to my hand

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.258
then, I can automatically
summon him right back

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.459
to the field.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:22.796
(computer beeps and
small explosion)

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:24.765
Yes, with three monsters,

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.900
infinite options
appear before you.

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:30.704
But, there is only one optimal
choice, a links summon.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:31.872
You may proceed.

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:41.829
What?

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:43.397
Impossible.

00:17:43.397 --> 00:17:44.231
Ahhh.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.701
Heatleo isn't
chained up anymore.

00:17:47.735 --> 00:17:49.903
He Houdinied it.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.539
He didn't have the right
monsters to resummon Heatleo.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.375
So how on earth did he do it?

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.378
Reincarnation Link Summon?

00:17:57.378 --> 00:17:59.379
Well, that sure was new.

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:02.583
Instead of fulfilling the
usual Link Summoning conditions

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:05.285
Salamangreat Sanctuary's
effect lets me use

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:07.621
a Salamangreat Link
Monster to summon

00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:10.156
another copy of
that same monster.

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:15.629
So you used Heatleo to
summonify a new Heatleo?

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:17.731
[Flame] Yes, except one that

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:20.567
isn't chained down by your trap.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.636
Heatleo's ability reactivates

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:25.272
sending Judgment Arrows
back to your deck.

00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:27.975
(fire rumbles)

00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:29.910
(card explodes)

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.045
[Flame] When Judgment
Arrows leaves the field,

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:36.484
all monsters next to its links
are automatically destroyed.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.285
[Bit] Or so you think!

00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:40.554
[Boot] Fullmetal Dunkle
gots its own ability

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:43.123
that not only stops
it from bein' fileted

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:44.958
but it can also
move to another spot

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:46.459
in the Main Monster Zone.

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:50.731
And then it destroys the monster
that's vertically above it

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:54.601
meanin' your kitty cat's
losing all nine of its lives.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.236
Meow!

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:58.072
(machine rumbling)

00:18:58.105 --> 00:18:59.940
[Bit] Without Heatleo
you have nothing

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.942
to protectorate your next turn.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:06.380
[Boot] Meanin' we got
you hook, line and sinker.

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:08.048
[Flame] Sigh, it's over.

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:10.851
We gave it our best, but it
was just not good enough.

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:15.121
It was your pleasure to
be my partner, Soulburner.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:16.556
Hold up, Flame.

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:19.159
Why are you pretending
like we're going to lose?

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.494
[Flame] For drama.

00:19:20.528 --> 00:19:22.996
Yeah, that's exactly
what I thought!

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:25.699
When Heatleo is
Reincarnation Link Summoned

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.634
it can change a
monster's attack points

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:30.337
to match those with
one in my graveyard.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.504
Flame Possession!

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:34.874
Now Fullmetal
Dunkle's attack points

00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:38.512
become the same as
Salamangreat Meer's.

00:19:38.546 --> 00:19:41.549
(crashing)
(electronic beeping)

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:44.184
What, just 800 attack points?

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.519
Oh, no!

00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:46.987
Oh, yes!

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.624
Heatleo, attack
Fullmetal Dunkle!

00:19:50.658 --> 00:19:52.192
(fire rumbles)

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:53.193
Inferno strike!

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.667
(fire crashes)

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:03.336
(ship explodes)

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.945
(robotic screaming)
(electronic beeping)

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:13.346
(body thuds)

00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:15.615
[Flame] How lucky for them.

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.484
That building broke their fall.

00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:19.353
Let's loop back so
we can question 'em

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.521
and find out who
attacked the Cyberse.

00:20:21.555 --> 00:20:23.023
[Flame] Right.

00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:23.957
(Soulburner groans)

00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:26.060
What's wrong, Soulburner?

00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:28.495
Using Burning Draw
takes a lot out of me.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:30.497
[Flame] Then you should
improve your dueling tactics

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.200
so that you can actually win
without using your skill.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.468
Maybe you could just say that

00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:36.503
you're glad it's not
life-threatening?

00:20:36.537 --> 00:20:37.637
[Flame] Hmm, I see.

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:40.840
Aww, is my Burnsy-Wurnsy
okie-dokie?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.008
I take it back.

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:44.010
(Flame giggles)

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.547
Your boneheaded
moves cost us, Bit!

00:20:46.614 --> 00:20:48.548
No, it was your mistakes!

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:50.184
No, it was yours!

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:52.219
No, it was yours!

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:53.387
No, it's all your fault!

00:20:53.453 --> 00:20:54.889
No, it's all your fault!

00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:56.624
It's both your fault.

00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:58.359
[Both] You should be fired!

00:20:58.359 --> 00:21:01.228
(fire whooshing)
(both yelling)

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:03.197
Well, that's that.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.264
[Ai] There they are!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.565
Huh, what?

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.433
Seriously?

00:21:08.034 --> 00:21:09.403
(Bohman groans)

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:10.570
Just hang on, Bohman.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.072
It's okay, we're almost there.

00:21:13.274 --> 00:21:15.609
(whooshing)

00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:21.915
So sorry to tell ya, Playmaker,

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:24.384
but you won't be
getting Jin's data back!

00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:25.519
You're wrong!

00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:27.087
You won't get away with this!

00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:29.957
Oh, I'm pretty sure
that we definitely will,

00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:32.059
so you can drop the dream.

00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:34.261

Hey, Playmaker!

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.586
Looks like the two
of them got away.

00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:01.688
How'd they pull off
gettin' through?

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:03.190

Well then, that's my

You should get outta
here too, Playmaker.

Before you go, who are you?

00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:22.476

Be seein' ya around!

Soulburner, huh?

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.250
I'm sure that you will.
