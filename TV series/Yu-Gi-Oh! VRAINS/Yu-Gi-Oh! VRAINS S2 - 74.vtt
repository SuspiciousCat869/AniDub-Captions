WEBVTT

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.814
(breathing)

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.854
(System)
<i>Gore wins.</i>

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:21.822
Oh, wow!

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.757
That's ten in a row!

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.460
His neural programming
is far from complete,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.161
but he's beating our
virtual Playmaker

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.696
one hundred percent
of the time!

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.966
It's a success!

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.301
You may exit the chamber now.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:48.982
(electronic whirring)

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.330
(electronic whirring)

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:48.842
(Zaizen)
Playmaker!

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.143
Are you here?

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:50.877
(deep voice)

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:51.645
(Yusaku)
Don't move.

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:52.012
Huh?

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.248
(Yusaku)
And don't turn around.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:58.419
If you do,
you'll never see me again.

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.754
How do I know
you're Playmaker?

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.757
(Ai)
Cuz a fake Playmaker
wouldn't have a real Ignis

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.292
like moi!

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:07.394
How do I know that
that Ignis is real?

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:08.796
For all I know...

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.965
it could simply be a voice
recording of some sort?

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.567
(Ai)
Well, uh--

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:14.869
I guess you got me there.

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:15.970
(Yusaku)
It means that it comes

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.271
down to a matter
of trust, Zaizen.

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:20.941
Fine.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.242
So what was so urgent

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.777
that you wanted
to meet me face-to--

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.379
Well, back-to-face

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.781
that couldn't have been
taken care of online?

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.750
(Ai)
We need to warn
ya about somethi''

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.318
and the net ain't secure.

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:34.287
The situation with the Ignis
has evolved and unfortunately,

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.623
I cannot say it's
for the better.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:37.992
(Theodore)
So that's Zaizen, huh?

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.326
Nice suit.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:40.927
(Flame)
Again, I want to state
for the record

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.296
that I don't agree
with this plan

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.463
to share our information

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.399
with a SOL Technologies
executive.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.734
Yeah, well Yusaku
trusts him to help us.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.603
And I trust Yusaku
a hundred percent.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.604
As do I.

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.139
But this is the same corporation

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.741
that hired bounty hunters
to track me down.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.077
You can understand
my hesitation.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.580
The Ignis declared war
on humanity?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.947
(Ai)
Not all of us...

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.149
but more than one.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.650
So, yeah.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.283
That

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.518
's not good.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:07.688
Like you, I hoped humans
and Ignis would come together.

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.289
An all-out war between us

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.392
is the last thing
I wanted to see happen.

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:12.159
We'll do everything

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.794
we can to stop Lightning.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.063
In the meantime,

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:18.498
I suggest you beef up
security in LINK VRAINS.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.833
If the Ignis attack,

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.702
the destruction
could be even worse

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.370
than what the Knights
of Hanoi did.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:25.005
No!

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.606
(Yusaku)
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that...

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.209
but it never hurts to prepare.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:30.844
And what about you?

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.980
How do you plan
to stop Lightning?

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:34.481
And more importantly,

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.950
what happens
if you fail, Playmaker?

00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:39.619
Playmaker?

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.994
(Emma)
Well that's one heck
of an info dump.

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.897
(Zaizen)
Yes, the bad news is
that the two Ignis,

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.364
Lightning and Windy,

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.734
along with a next-gen
AI known as Bohman,

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.301
have declared war

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.503
on us humans.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:59.539
Okay, so then what good news
do you have for us?

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.442
I never said there was
any good news.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.944
You know you really
do need to work

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:05.712
on your phrasing
of things, Akira.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:06.914
Be that as it may,

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.082
I can't stress enough

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:10.417
the dire nature
of this situation.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.586
You've done a great job
o' that, hun.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.388
But for all your doom-and-gloom,

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:17.758
there is a tiny glimmer
of good news that you missed.

00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:20.093
Ai and Flame
are still on our side.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.929
Yes and no.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.430
They're on everyone's sides

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.734
since they're still hoping
for a peaceful resolution.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.102
Do you think that's
actually possible?

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.904
(Zaizen)
That is the question.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.440
I would say no
if it were anybody else,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.744
but Playmaker and Ai
have surprised me before.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.913
I guess that's better
than nothing.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.182
What about the other two Ignis,

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:42.916
Earth and Aqua?

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:43.584
Whose side do you think

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:45.219
they're on?

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.687
They appear to be
neutral for now.

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.357
But sooner or later
they'll have to choose.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.860
And that decision will
ultimately determine

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.762
who wins this fight.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.063
Then maybe we outta think about

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.099
taking a little recruiting trip.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.068
Not to bang my own drum

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:04.404
but most people have a really
difficult time saying no to me.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.140
And I'm going with her, Akira.

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:09.810
I work better on my
on Skye, you know that.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.678
Promise me
you'll be careful, alright?

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:12.779
When am I not?
Of course.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.482
We're just gonna sit around here

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.251
and do nothing
until we get a lead?

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.418
I don't like this.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.921
But I thought sitting
around doing nothing

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.823
was your specialty.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.291
It is when it's my choice,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.026
not when I'm forced to.

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:27.661
Big difference.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:29.029
Well, in the real world,

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.365
a lead doesn't just
suddenly materialize

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:32.866
because you want it to.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.435
It really should though.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.836
It really should.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:38.305
So have you found
any clues yet, Yusaku?

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:40.007
As a matter of fact, we have.

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:40.941
Ah!

00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:42.476
Yeah.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.912
Cuz at least one of us wasn't
sitting around doing nothing.

00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:46.313
Lesson not learned,

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:47.314
but what did you find?

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:49.249
When an Ignis travels
through LINK VRAINS

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.286
they leave a tiny digital
trail behind.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.487
Usually it's so faint
that we can't track it

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.823
but lucky for us,
it seems our good buddy Earth

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:59.626
has been doing
a lot of traveling.

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.528
Whoa! He's been everywhere!

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.663
Looks like he's got
the sightseeing bug!

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.499
Hope it's only a 24 hour thing.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:08.035
It seems that he's
searching for something...

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:09.336
or someone.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.538
Oh, yeah?

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:12.472
I'll bet ya soup to nuts
I know who it is!

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.140
And judging by the dot pattern,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.976
we know where he's going next!

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.251
Aqua...

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.887
where are you?

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.923
Initiate scan.

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:37.530
There.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:48.308
(gasps)

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:50.677
(Earth)
Aqua!

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.350
Oh, did you come to save me?

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.885
Of course...

00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:58.652
Aqua.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.086
Aqua?

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.588
That is...

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:02.789
your name...

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.925
in this world.

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:08.228
Do you not like it?

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:10.097
No, I love it.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:10.764
They...

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.332
call me...

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:13.567
Earth.

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:14.401
Earth.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.736
Let me...

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.103
free you.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:18.772
No, don't!

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.607
You'll crash your code!

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.277
So what?

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.544
(electric whirring)

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:28.882
(grunts)

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.386
Are you okay, Earth?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.621
Yes.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:36.456
Because...

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:37.958
you're free.

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:42.396
We should split up.

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:43.931
We'll cover more ground.

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:45.099
Sounds like a plan.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.766
I'll catch ya later guys!

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.371
(Aqua)
Here. Let me heal your hands.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:51.805
(Earth)

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.307
Thank you.

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.709
Aqua, why...

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:56.443
were you...

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:57.444
locked up?

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:58.879
The Light Ignis.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:07:59.746
What?

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:00.614
(Aqua)
Uh-huh.

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:01.815
No...

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.017
There! All done.

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:07.788
He wanted to meet in secret,

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.524
saying he had something
important to tell me,

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.058
and me only.

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:19.666
Umm, hello?

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:21.234
Ah!

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.270
Perfect timing.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.873
I was getting worried
that you wouldn't show up.

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:27.474
What are you doing?

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.510
I'm creating a new card.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.679
Or more accurately, a new weapon

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.514
that will protect the Cyberse

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.983
from destruction.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.683
Hmm.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.287
You don't believe me, do you.

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.790
You know that I have a
special ability to tell

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.325
when someone's lying...

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:46.693
so I know you're not
telling the truth.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.829
Yes, you're right.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.563
I'm not telling the truth.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.131
But no one needs

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.366
to know that.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.272
As you surmised,

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:02.609
I'm not going to use this
card to save the Cyberse.

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:05.278
I'm going to use it
to destroy it.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.715
But you won't be around
to warn anyone.

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:11.185
Now that you're gone,

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:13.687
no one can stop me.

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:15.222
But rest assured Aqua

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:18.291
that this is for
the greater good.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.362
How dare...

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.696
he hurt...

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:23.797
Aqua!

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:25.299
But I'm fine now.

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:27.033
Because you saved me.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:28.101
(gasps)

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.004
(Aqua)
Someone's following us.

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.573
The Light Ignis?

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.375
No.

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.076
It's someone else.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:36.710
Someone...

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:38.845
human.

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:43.850
(grunts)

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.520
It's the Ignis!

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.923
(Kolter)
<i>Guys, I found Earth!</i>

00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:50.624
<i>But so did someone else!</i>

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.259
<i>Sending you the
coordinates now!</i>

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.930
Well, looks like
they're closer to you

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.431
than they are to me.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.965
We're on it, Soulburner.

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:10.411
He's still on our tail.

00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.345
Yes.

00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:13.747
But I won't let him...

00:10:13.747 --> 00:10:14.915
capture you.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.351
What?! By pushing meee?

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.019
Sorry...

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:20.020
I am...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.288
socially...

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:22.188
awkward.

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:28.628
(Earth)
Stop!

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:31.231
You won't get...

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.098
Aqua!

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:33.767
I really don't care which Ignis

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.235
I get to capture first.

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:37.837
So if you wanna rumble,
let's do this.

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.409
There they are! Step on it!

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:43.343
Heeya!

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.245
(Ai)
Hey, Earth!

00:10:45.379 --> 00:10:46.447
Ai?

00:10:46.447 --> 00:10:48.682
And his pal Playmaker.

00:10:48.682 --> 00:10:49.850
(Playmaker)
Who are you?

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.084
Can't believe you already
forgotten me,

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:53.219
ya rainbow-colored pork chop.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.721
Wait. Hold on.

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:55.922
Is it really you?

00:10:58.859 --> 00:10:59.693
Gore?!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.034
That's...

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:07.601
Gore?

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.235
You're too late

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:09.904
to the party, bub.

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:11.304
This Ignis is mine.

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.773
And you can't do
anythin' about it.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.512
I won't lose.

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.280
We'll see about that, pal.

00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.419
Can't we ever get
a simple mission

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.853
where nothing goes wrong?

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.656
How did Gore get here before us?

00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:29.924
I mean, look at him,

00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:31.658
he looks like
he can hardly get out of bed.

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:34.094
Yeah, he doesn't look
healthy at all.

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.429
That's an understatement.

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:37.664
He looks like he has one foot
in the hospital

00:11:37.664 --> 00:11:39.833
and the other foot
in the grave.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.302
What could Gore
have done to himself?

00:11:43.103 --> 00:11:44.638
Let's see if you got
what it takes

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:46.273
to keep up with me, Ignis.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.476
(Zaizen)
What is Gore doing
in LINK VRAINS?

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:51.178
I never gave him
permission to resume

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:52.579
his bounty hunting duties!

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.180
I'm sorry, sir,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.149
but the order came to us

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:56.783
straight from the top.

00:11:56.783 --> 00:11:57.817
From the Queen.

00:11:59.787 --> 00:12:02.656
Your brother patched us
into Sol Tech's feed.

00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:04.758
That must be the Earth Ignis.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.326
And he's dueling Gore!?

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.162
It's my turn.

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:11.031
I'll place a monster
in defense mode...

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:13.167
and that'll end my turn.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.401
That's it?

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.536
The Gore I know is all about
offense, not defense.

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:19.539
Looks like his body's not
the only thing that's changed.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:22.009
It's my turn.

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:23.344
I draw.

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.379
I activate...

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.714
my spell...

00:12:26.714 --> 00:12:28.582
COST DOWN.

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.150
I discard...

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.585
a card...

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:32.252
to lower...

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:32.853
G GOLEM ROCK HAMME

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:35.589
R's Level...

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:36.523
by 2...

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.559
and summon it.

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:39.159
(computer chirping)

00:12:39.727 --> 00:12:40.694
Then I...

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:41.895
tribute...

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.564
my ROCK HAMMER...

00:12:43.564 --> 00:12:44.431
to summon...

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.067
three G GOLEM TOKENS...

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.869
in defense mode.

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:51.005
And I'll...

00:12:51.005 --> 00:12:52.239
use two...

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:53.707
to accrete...

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.408
my circuit!

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.211
I Link...

00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:58.546

00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:00.047

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.117

00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:03.918

00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:04.951
(computer chirping)

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.420
And I'll use it...

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.654
to Link Summon...

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:08.822
again!

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:10.291
I set...

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.992
my MENHIR...

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.661
and my TOKEN...

00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:16.229
in the Link Arrows!

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:19.767
I Link Summon!

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.368
Link 2...

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.103
G GOLEM...

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:24.638
CRYSTAL HEART!

00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:25.639
(computer chirping)

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:29.442
Earth already summoned
the key card in his deck,

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:31.445
the monster he received
from Aqua.

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:34.581
Aww, cuz he can't stop
thinking about her.

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:35.949
That's so cute.

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:38.118
Like a lizard with a cowboy hat.

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:39.953
I activate...

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:41.589
CRYSTAL HEART's...

00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:43.123
ability...

00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:44.491
to summon...

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.725
an Earth...

00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.294

00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:49.463
from my graveyard...

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:50.397
next to...

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.099
its link.

00:13:52.099 --> 00:13:53.233

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.568

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:55.202

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:56.303
(computer chirping)

00:13:56.303 --> 00:13:58.906
And when CRYSTAL HEART...

00:13:58.906 --> 00:13:59.973
uses...

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.675
this ability...

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:03.176
it gains one...

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.778
G Golem Counter...

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:07.280
and gives 600

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.448
attack points...

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:09.650
per counter...

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.185
to all Earth Monsters...

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.687
it's linked to.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.856
(timer beeping)

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.324
Then I activate...

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:17.791
STUBBORN MENHI

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.360

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.696

00:14:21.696 --> 00:14:23.363

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:25.299
from my graveyard.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.534
Return to the field...

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:28.302
ROCK HAMMER!

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.437
(computer chirping)

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:33.207
Earth has built up
a sizable force.

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.509
If you think your pebble
collection impresses me,

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.477
it doesn't.

00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:37.844
Cuz I ain't three years old.

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:39.613
Then how's...

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:40.480
this?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.449
I Link Summon...

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.017

00:14:46.654 --> 00:14:47.688
require...

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.022
at least...

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:50.190
two...

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.559
Earth monsters.

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:52.626
(shooting)

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:55.162
I Link Summon...

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:56.497
Link 3...

00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:58.231
G GOLEM...

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.867
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:01.067
(computer chirping)

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.004
(Earth)
And CRYSTAL HEART...

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.072
gives it...

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:06.373
600...

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:07.741
attack points.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.743
(timer beeping)

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.446
Ah.

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:14.448
Earth is rockin' this turn!

00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:16.950
He summoned the strongest
monster in his deck!

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.619
I place...

00:15:18.619 --> 00:15:20.087
one card...

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.622
facedown.

00:15:21.622 --> 00:15:22.522
Then...

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:24.525
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:25.725
Attack...

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:27.460
his facedown...

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.896
monster!

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:31.765
But since my monster's
in defense mode...

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.767
I don't take any damage!

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:34.835
(roars)

00:15:34.835 --> 00:15:35.735
(computer chirping)

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.738
Incorrect!

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:39.573
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:15:39.573 --> 00:15:40.574
can deal...

00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:41.742
you damage...

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:43.209
even if...

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:44.445
your monster...

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:46.613
is in defense mode.

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:48.015
Then I'll discard

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:50.183
DINOWRESTLER MARTIAL AMPELO

00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:53.253
to activate
its special ability.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:56.289
It not only prevents my
monster from being destroyed,

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.460
but it also cuts the damage
I take in half.

00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:02.296
So my DINOWRESTLER
CAPAPTERA

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:03.663
survives your attack.

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:09.769
(timer beeping)

00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:11.638
I...

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:12.639
end...

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.174
my turn.

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:16.276
Well, well, well...

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:18.778
That lil' fella's sure
giving Gore the business.

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:23.417
Where you headin'?

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.919
I'm going into LINK
VRAINS of course!

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:26.687
Oh, yeah?

00:16:26.687 --> 00:16:27.955
We promised my brother

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:29.022
that we'll make contact

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:30.591
with the rest of the Ignis.

00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:32.492
And that's exactly
what we're going to do.

00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:36.330
Yeah, but Playmaker
already has this handled.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.598
But he shouldn't have to solve
all our problems.

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:41.334
You stay here and feed me
the real-time data, okay?

00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:42.636
Sure.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:43.571
Anything else?

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.939
No, just send me
the coordinates.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.474
(scoffs)

00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:51.144
When did she get so bossy?

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:00.354
It's now my turn.

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:01.922
I draw.

00:17:01.922 --> 00:17:04.892
Since you have
more monsters than I do...

00:17:04.892 --> 00:17:06.560
DINOWRESTLER CAPAPTERA's

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.328
special ability activates,

00:17:08.328 --> 00:17:10.664
destroying one monster
on your field.

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:11.899
So I

00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:14.534
'm bootin' your
G GOLEM INVALID DOLMEN

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.036
to the graveyard.

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:16.904
You can't.

00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:18.906
When INVALID DOLMEN...

00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:22.042
is co-linked
with my CRYSTAL HEART...

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.044
your monsters' abilities...

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.646
can't affect it.

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:26.680
Well then...

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.650
I summon DINOWRESTLER
PANKRATOPS!

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.718
(roars)

00:17:30.718 --> 00:17:31.518
(computer chirping)

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:32.185
But that monster

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:33.721
's Level 7!

00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.556
You can't summon it
without tributing!

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:36.323
(Gore)

00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:37.858
I can when my opponent has

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:39.926
more monsters in play than me.

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:41.828
Next,

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:42.663
I summon

00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.731
DINOWRESTLER ESKRIMAMENCHI!

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:45.399
Now that I have

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.868
a third monster in play,

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:51.137
I have everything I need
to mash up my circuit!

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:55.709
Now go!

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:59.246
I set CAPAPTERA,

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.816
ESKRIMAMENCHI, and PANKRATOPS

00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:04.117
in the Link Arrows.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.387
I Link Summon!

00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:08.756
Link 3 DINOWRESTLER KING

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:10.457
T WREXTLE!

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:11.124
(roaring)

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:12.626
(computer chirping)

00:18:15.729 --> 00:18:16.930
(Gore)
I Link Summon!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.400
Link 3 DINOWRESTLER
KING T WREXTLE!

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:20.968
Gore summoned his

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:23.537
strongest monster.

00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:25.973
Since I used DINOWRESTLER
CAPAPTERA

00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:27.974
to summon my Link Monster,

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.910
its special ability activates

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.644
and gives KING T WREXTLE

00:18:30.644 --> 00:18:33.313
1000 attack points

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:35.782
until the end of this turn.

00:18:35.782 --> 00:18:36.917
(timer beeping)
(roaring)

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:38.985
That's not all.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.288
When KING T attacks,

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.790
you can't activate any spell
or trap cards,

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.258
so there's nothin' stoppin' me

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:47.595
from destroying your monster!

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:48.395
Go!

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:50.264
Shatter his CRYSTAL HEART!

00:18:50.264 --> 00:18:51.665
I don't...

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:53.099
think so!

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:57.070
When INVALID...

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.106
DOLMEN is on...

00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:00.540
my field...

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.709
you're only...

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:02.676
allowed...

00:19:02.676 --> 00:19:04.210
to attack...

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.846
that monster.

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:08.015
You will never...

00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:09.716
hurt Aqua!

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:10.951
Nice!

00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:12.118
CRYSTAL HEART's fragile,

00:19:12.118 --> 00:19:13.354
but it won't break if you can't

00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:14.621
tinktinktink at it!

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:15.723
That's true.

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:16.690
However--

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:21.295
Aww, glitch!

00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:21.795
Without INVALID DOLMEN

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:24.531
to protect it...

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:27.601
Gore is now allowed
to attack his CRYSTAL HEART.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.538
But when...

00:19:31.538 --> 00:19:32.772
my DOLMEN...

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:34.608
is destroyed...

00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:36.543
all your faceup...

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:37.678
cards...

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:39.680
lose their effects...

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.716
and special abilities!

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:45.986
(Ai)
That means Earth can now

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:47.787
use his spell and trap cards!

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.056
I activate...

00:19:50.056 --> 00:19:52.693
Gravity Vision!

00:19:52.693 --> 00:19:55.128
Since my Earth...

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.664
Link Monster...

00:19:56.664 --> 00:19:59.366
was destroyed in battle...

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.234
I can summon...

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.470
a G GOLEM TOKEN...

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.305
in defense mode.

00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:07.541
(computer chirping)

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:08.775
(Earth)
And this TOKEN...

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.777
gains 800...

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:12.279
defense points...

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:14.180
for every Link...

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.516
my monster had.

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:18.685
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:20.287
was Link 3.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:21.888
(timer beeping)

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.457
That's 2400...

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:26.326
defense points.

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:27.527
Plus...

00:20:27.527 --> 00:20:30.664
not only is KING T WREXTLE...

00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.166
only allowed...

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.300
to attack...

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.669
this TOKEN...

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:36.169
but your monster...

00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:37.538
also loses...

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:39.340
2400...

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.307
attack...

00:20:40.307 --> 00:20:42.609
and defense points.

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:44.445
(timer beeping)

00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:47.614
There's no way Gore's
getting past that!

00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:49.683
This duel's like groceries:

00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:50.985
in the bag!

00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:53.687
Earth certainly seems to be
in control of the duel,

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:55.055
but if so,

00:20:55.055 --> 00:20:56.990
why doesn't Gore look worried?

00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:00.360
Not too shabby, Ignis.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.595
I gotta admit,

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:04.598
your dueling would've
flustered the old Gore.

00:21:04.598 --> 00:21:06.767
But I'm a new Gore.

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:08.235
Brain Hack!

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:09.736
(screaming)

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.112
What is going on?

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.414
Calculation...

00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:21.448
complete.

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:23.617
DINOWRESTLER ESKRIMAMENCHI's

00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:25.853
special ability now activates.

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:28.388
Since you summoned
a monster during my turn,

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:31.091
I can return this card from
my graveyard

00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:32.893
back to my hand.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.462
And then I can summon
another Level 4

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:39.099
or lower DINOWRESTLER
directly from my graveyard.

00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:41.068
DINOWRESTLER CAPAPTERA.

00:21:41.502 --> 00:21:42.235
(computer chirping)

00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:46.207
Next I'm going to activate
the spell card

00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:48.341
TYRANT DINO FUSION.

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:50.244
It allows me to fuse my monsters

00:21:50.244 --> 00:21:53.113
together to create
a new DINOWRESTLER.

00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:56.884
I fuse DINOWRESTLER KING
T WREXTLE

00:21:56.884 --> 00:21:59.719
and DINOWRESTLER
CAPAPTERA together.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:04.024
Projecting attack
strength increase

00:22:04.024 --> 00:22:06.793
between 16 and 59 percent...

00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:08.461
I Fusion Summon!

00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:12.032
Now witness my

00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:15.569
DINOWRESTLER CHIMERA T WREXTLE!

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:19.673
(roaring)

00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:22.609
(computer chirping)

00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:25.913
Since I used TYRANT DINO FUSION

00:22:25.913 --> 00:22:27.280
to summon this monster,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.682
CHIMERA T WREXTLE

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:30.850
can't be destroyed one time.

00:22:31.986 --> 00:22:33.153
(roaring)

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.358
I've hacked my brain

00:22:37.358 --> 00:22:40.127
so that I can calculate
moves faster and better

00:22:40.127 --> 00:22:41.362
than any human...

00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:42.462
or Ignis.

00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:44.798
Your defeat is only
a matter of time.
