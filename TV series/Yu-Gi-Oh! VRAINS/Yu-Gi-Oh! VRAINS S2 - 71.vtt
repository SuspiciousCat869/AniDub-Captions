WEBVTT

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.606
(Spectre)
Ah.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:06.406
Seems we've arrived

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.775
at the most exciting moment.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.344
Hold up, Windy,
what are you doing here?

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.246
(Ai)
Flame!

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:13.114
(Playmaker)
Soulburner!

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.149
Perfect, another
Ignis arrives to join the party.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.185
Lightning, will you
do the honors?

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:19.185
Certainly.

00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:21.154
Look out!

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.660
Huh, looks like our pal's
program came in handy.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.596
(Flame)
And he created extras
for you.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm free!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.401
You're in for it now!

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:35.803
Wait your turn.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:38.939
I still have this Varis
to dust away.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.240
It's my turn!

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.741
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:44.812
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.745
(computer chirping)

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.181
Attack!

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:50.651
(blasting)

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.152
(screams)

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.187
(timer beeping)

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:57.757
Finish it.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:00.427
No stop! Don't do it!

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:05.065
Lightning! Save him!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.369
(Ai)
Without Windy,
you're all on your own!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.006
(Lightning)
I'm not as alone
as you may think, Ai.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.874
Huh! Soulburner, it's them!

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.242
Bohman! And--

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.977
(Ai)
And his cheerleader.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.546
(Playmaker)
I won't rest until I learn
where you're hiding Jin's soul.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.914
Hiding?

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.716
It hasn't been hiding.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.884
In fact,

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:26.653
it's been here all this time.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:29.522
Lightning's counterpart is Jin!

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:41.234
(electronic whirring)

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:29.482
(electronic whirring)

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.224
Jin is your partner?

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.491
Jin...

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.564
(Lightning)
Partner is too strong of a word.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.466
That would imply
some form of kinship

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:47.401
that does not exist.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.104
But you wouldn't exist
if it wasn't for him.

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.739
Am I right?

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.807
(Lightning)
In that, you are correct.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.443
And you pay him back
by taking his soul.

00:02:56.644 --> 00:02:58.279
But that ends now.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.048
Because we're going to take him
home to his brother.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.018
And how exactly do you plan
to do that?

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.019
Because what you say
you're going to do

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.988
and what you can actually do

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.790
are polar opposites.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.059
After Bohman brought him to me,

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.393
I imprisoned him deep

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.963
within his own consciousness,

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:18.031
so he's not going anywhere.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.036
And to tell you the truth,
it actually wasn't that hard.

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:25.172
With all the traumatic
experiences he's lived through,

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:28.776
it's as if he wanted
to retreat into his own mind.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.145
That's not true Lightning,
you're wrong!

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:32.446
With his brother's help,

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:34.348
Jin was getting
better day by day!

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:36.950
And you halted his progress!

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.552
Must you yell?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.122
We're standing
only meters apart.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.025
We can all hear you just fine.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.894
And if what you said is true,

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:48.529
if Jin was improving,

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.964
I intervened
at just the right time.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.134
Because he could've proven
to be a threat

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.502
to the Ignis's existence.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:58.339
(Ai)
No he wouldn't.
Jin wasn't bothering anybody.

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.474
The only threat would've
been to his waistline

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.443
crammin' dogs down his gut.

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:05.079
I didn't say he would've proven
to be a threat.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.681
I said he could've proven
to be a threat.

00:04:07.948 --> 00:04:11.218
He is a human after all.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:14.921
So I decided to get rid
of my human counterpart,

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.690
just like Windy...

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.127
except with
a bit more elegance.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:24.031
It's not logical to leave
any lingering threats...

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.134
you never know when they can
come back to bite you.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.735
And I am not willing

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.071
to take any risks.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:33.874
(Ai)
Oh yeah, your plans
worked greeeat.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:35.509
All that scheming got ya was

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:38.211
Windy like a balloon
that went--
(imitates balloon deflating)

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.047
And if you continue
on this path,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.116
it can only lead
to more suffering for the Ignis.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:45.018
You make that sound

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.521
as if it's a bad thing
when it's not.

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:49.190
(Ai)
You're not helping.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.026
(Lightning)
I didn't expect any remorse
from you, Varis.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:54.594
And you exceeded
my expectations.

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.064
That is why I,
along with Bohman,

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:59.767
will have to put an end
to humanity.

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.668
(Playmaker)
Now I understand
why Bohman's deck

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:03.671
kept getting stronger
with every meeting.

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:05.806
Because you two
were working together

00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:08.175
and you were supplying him
with new cards.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.010
Like JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.145
What? JUDGEMENT ARROWS?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.747
You mean the card that was used

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.249
to destroy the Cyberse?

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.250
That means...

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.419
The one who destroyed
the Cyberse was...

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:20.587
Lightning?

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.924
(Flame)
What would possess you to do
such a terrible thing?

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.325
You're getting too emotional

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:28.028
so you're not thinking
rationally.

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.863
As the leader of the Ignis,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.166
I'm the one tasked
with making the tough

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:34.835
if not unpopular decisions.

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.804
Now I don't expect you
to fully understand but--

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.407
You're right Lightning, I don't!

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:43.477
But it was the most logically
sound decision.

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.179
I don't think you know
what logically means!

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.749
Then I guess I must
spell it out for you.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:51.585
The humans were going to destroy

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.287
the Cyberse anyway.

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:56.457
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.125
but it was inevitable.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.394
All I did was speed up
the timeline.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.929
(sighs)

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.202
(Varis)
I guess this is one time

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:10.537
I should thank you
for saving me the trouble

00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.374
of having to destroy
the Cyberse myself.

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.076
(Ai)
Still not helping.

00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:17.678
If I convinced you that
it was the humans,

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.046
not me, who destroyed
the Cyberse,

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.916
I believed you would join
my side in this battle

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.518
against the humans.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.021
But even now
that you know the truth,

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.889
I think you should
still join my side.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.691
Are you insane?

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.560
How do you expect us to join you

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.031
after you've admitted
to destroying our homeworld?

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:40.233
(Lightning)
Because I expect you
to think logically.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.403
Everything I've done is for
the greater good of the Ignis.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.239
Making short-term sacrifices

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.641
for our long-term survival.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:50.210
Must I remind you of what
the Ignis have been facing

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.512
since Day 1,

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:54.048
since Dr. Kogami created us?

00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:55.749
Oh, I know.

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.153
The results are startling.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.323
All the simulations
reach the same conclusion.

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:04.959
The extinction of mankind?

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:05.760
(Kogami)
Yes.

00:07:06.127 --> 00:07:08.329
But I thought you had created
the Ignis to help solve

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:10.630
all of humanity's problems.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.966
I did. But as the Ignis evolve,

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.468
the simulations state

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.804
that they will start thinking
differently than they do now.

00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:19.940
Eventually hitting
a critical decision point.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.441
A point where the Ignis

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.578
will think that instead
of solving mankind's problems...

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.947
it will be easier
to solve all problems

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:29.616
by eliminating mankind itself.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.554
And since the Ignis are evolving
exponentially faster,

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.989
this decision point
is fast approaching.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:38.926
We must eliminate the Ignis

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:41.228
before they eliminate us.

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.163
My father had the foresight

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.665
to know that the Ignis
would be a problem,

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:47.234
and it turns out he was right.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:50.270
So that's why we started
to hunt you down.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.139
Yes, and not just
for a day or two.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.608
But for years.

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.577
FIVE years.

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.612
Ai, while you were traipsing

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.213
around LINK VRAINS,

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:03.350
the rest of us Ignis discussed
how to fight back.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.385
But to my surprise, like you,

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.654
some didn't want to fight...

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:10.891
there were those who thought
that we could co-exist.

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:14.060
(Ai)
Hmm. Like Flame and Aqua.

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:19.032
Yes. And they were
impossible to convince.

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:20.367
I couldn't understand.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.836
I still don't understand.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.972
If humans have hunted you
continuously

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.439
for five long years,

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:29.643
why would you ever believe
that they would want peace?

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.178
Because I do not believe

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:33.513
that past always
dictates the present.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.517
And in my experience,
I can coexist with humans

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.651
because as we speak,

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:40.220
I am coexisting
with one just fine.

00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:41.721
Right back at ya.

00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:42.690
(sighs)

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:44.858
Or the more realistic conclusion

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:47.661
is that your logic circuits
were malfunctioning,

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:50.965
as if you have fatal glitches
in your core programming.

00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:51.832
(laughing)

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.201
He called you a glitch!

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.171
I'm talking about you too.

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:58.606
What? Me?

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:00.040
(Flame)
Yes, you.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.909
He called you a glitch too.

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:03.877
(Ai)
Really? Aww, glitch.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.012
As I said,

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:06.613
I did try to convince

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.114
Flame and Aqua.

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:09.416
I really did.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:12.085
I was sure that if they thought
the humans attacked the Cyberse,

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.554
they would join my cause.

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.590
But if that still
didn't convince them...

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.357
Well then...

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.959
If they were accidentally

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.395
collateral damage
in the attack?

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.730
It would be
a small price to pay.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.068
So you'd eliminate everyone
who disagrees with you,

00:09:27.068 --> 00:09:28.736
even your own Ignis.

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:30.504
You keep harping
on the negatives

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:32.573
while ignoring the positives.

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.574
This was all
for the greater good.

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.044
Can't you get over the fact
that I destroyed the Cyberse?

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.182
Windy and I were planning
to rebuild the Cyberse anyway!

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:42.849
And not just any Cyberse,

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.286
but better Cyberse than before.

00:09:45.286 --> 00:09:48.355
A Cyberse without
the threat from humanity.

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.591
Isn't that what we want, Flame?

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.292
To live without fear?

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.595
(Flame)
Of course I don't want
to live in fear, but--

00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:58.098
But you're just tweakin' words
to suit your angle, Lightning.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.634
No matter what words you spew,

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:03.337
it all comes down to you
just trying to justify

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.740
your desire to end humanity.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.408
I didn't say I wanted
to end humanity.

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:11.745
I said I wanted
to end the threat of humanity.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:13.414
And if ending humanity

00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:15.516
is the only way to do it,

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.284
so be it.

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:18.685
But there can never be peace

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:21.221
when it's built upon lies
and aggression.

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:23.924
(Lightning)
At this point, it's clear
no matter what I say,

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.526
no matter how logical
my argument,

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:28.095
I cannot convince you because

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:30.263
you simply refuse to listen.

00:10:30.263 --> 00:10:33.367
Since a peaceful resolution
is out of the picture,

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:35.369
I'm ready to duel...

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:36.069
except...

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:36.870
(Windy groans)

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:38.839
Time is of the essence

00:10:38.872 --> 00:10:40.741
if I'm to save Windy.

00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:43.777
Save it? There is no saving it.

00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:46.246
We infected it with a new,
more powerful virus

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.048
that Baira and I invented.

00:10:48.048 --> 00:10:51.052
It destroys your programming
at its core,

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:54.088
so it will soon be gone
without a trace.

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:55.922
(Lightning)
That may be the case,

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:56.924
unless I can write

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.193
an antivirus counterprogram

00:10:59.193 --> 00:11:01.829
that is stronger
than your virus.

00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:05.165
You Hanoi have always
threatened to hurt us,

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.468
but you never
actually succeeded,

00:11:07.468 --> 00:11:08.468
until now.

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:11.906
By hurting Windy,
you finally crossed the line.

00:11:11.906 --> 00:11:15.475
A line from where
there's no turning back.

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:18.512
This is no longer just a fight.

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:21.581
This is war.

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:25.786
(Lightning)
This is war.

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.455
And I will end anyone
who stands in my way,

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:30.324
human or Ignis.

00:11:30.324 --> 00:11:33.160
You're not talkin' about
this cute Ignis, are you?

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.995
I never said you were cute.

00:11:34.995 --> 00:11:36.163
(Ai)
Savage.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:37.297
Let's go.

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.144
Follow them!

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:57.818
Here!

00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:58.685
(grunts)

00:11:58.685 --> 00:11:59.520
You'll need this.

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:00.387
Yeah?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.188
Yeah.

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.390
It's a firmware update
for your Duel Disk

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:04.859
so that Kolter
can track us,

00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:05.826
even in...

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:07.328
whatever place this is.

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:08.395
Understood.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.168
So Kolter now knows
what went down with his bro.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.469
That's gotta be rough.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:19.139
But it will be even rougher
if we fail to save Jin.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:22.209
Should we chase after them
as well, Varis?

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:25.178
No, leave them be
and let them duel each other.

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.546
It doesn't matter to me whether

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:29.482
Lightning defeats Playmaker
or the other way around,

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:32.886
it means there'll be one
fewer enemy for us to face.

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:35.389
So we'll come out ahead
either away.

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:36.390
Clever.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.059
And to make it more interesting,

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:40.995
why don't we let another of
our enemies

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:42.829
do our work for us.

00:12:44.031 --> 00:12:45.833
C'mon guys don't lose 'em!

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.835
This is our best chance
to save Jin

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.903
and maybe our only chance!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.541
Chief! We just got a message!

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:55.876
It's from the Hanoi!

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:57.911
I received it as well.

00:12:58.312 --> 00:12:58.979
Huh?

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:02.583
They claim to have found
the Ignis in this area.

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:05.219
Yes, they also sent us
a live feed.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:06.253
Look!

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.122
Of course Playmaker
would be there.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.792
(Hayami)
I've seen those two
he's chasing after...

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.126
but who's the third?

00:13:13.727 --> 00:13:16.129
And he seems to have
a new Ignis.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.798
You know I don't trust
the Hanoi,

00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.233
but we gotta check this out.

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:22.435
Dispatch our bounty hunters
to those coordinates.

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:26.707
Hey, why isn't Gore in
on this hunt with us?

00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.875
Beats me, I thought
you called him.

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:31.245
(Ai)
You can't outrun us
Lightning!

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:34.381
We're stickin' to you
like toilet paper to a shoe!

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:37.117
Did you just compare yourselves
to toilet paper?

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:38.885
This is the thanks I get

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.887
after all I have done for you?

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:43.491
Like what?
Trying to end my life?

00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:45.959
How about saving your life?

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.961
Think back to your duel
against Spectre

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.663
when you fell off the bridge.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:51.665
What? The bridge?

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:53.166
(Lightning)
Yes.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.702
How do you think you suddenly

00:13:54.735 --> 00:13:56.970
unfell from the bridge?

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:00.774
That was you?

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:03.143
You created that Data Storm?

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:04.344
You're welcome.

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:05.479
But why?

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:07.515
(Flame)
Don't let Lightning
fool you, Ai.

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:09.716
He didn't do it out of
the kindness of his heart.

00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:13.187
He did it so that you wouldn't
interfere with his plans.

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.222
If you were busy dealing
with the Hanoi,

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:18.325
you couldn't stop him
when he attacked the Cyberse.

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.361
That is a cynical way
to look at it.

00:14:20.394 --> 00:14:21.695
Am I wrong?

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.230
I didn't say that.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.232
But if the ends
justify the means,

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:28.335
and I am the reason
why you're still alive, Ai.

00:14:28.335 --> 00:14:30.170
You must acknowledge that.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.839
Fine! You want me to say
thank you for saving my life?

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:34.442
Okay, I'll say it!

00:14:34.442 --> 00:14:36.877
ThaaAAaaAnK yOuUU...

00:14:36.877 --> 00:14:39.312
That didn't sound sincere.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.451
What's that?

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.153
It's bad news plus two.

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:48.956
Shepherd and his bounty boys.

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:51.959
Well now, an interesting
development indeed.

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.294
(Flame)
Who do you think they're here
for: me and Ai...

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:55.295
or Lightning?

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.897
Or all of the above?

00:14:58.532 --> 00:15:01.167
Allow me to even up the odds.

00:15:06.407 --> 00:15:08.208
We have returnified!

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.010
And will combine!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.078
To unite into Bitboot!

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:15.382
No, if you combine, you'll cut
my army's size in half.

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:16.784
It was Boot's idea.

00:15:16.784 --> 00:15:18.285
No, it was Bit's!

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:20.387
I don't care who's idea it was.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.688
Just defeat them.

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:23.357
(Both)
Right, Boss!

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:26.026
They will keep
the bounty hunters busy.

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.127
However...

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.929
They're another matter.

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:30.697
(Windy groans)

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.433
(Lightning)
And time is running out.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.671
If you believe you can
handle Soulburner on your own--

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.173
Allow me to deal with Playmaker.

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:42.008
(Lightning)
Yearning for another rematch?

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.545
To prove that my skills
have evolved past his.

00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:48.915
Get 'em!

00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:52.018
(shooting)

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:54.221
(groans)

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.625
(Lightning)
Okay, Bohman.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.260
We need to split them apart.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.429
Windy, I know
you're not feeling well,

00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:04.531
but I could use your assistance.

00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:05.499
(Windy)
How?

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:06.700
(Lightning)
Like this.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.670
(Ai)
Look out!

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:18.645
(Flame) Lightning,
stand by and do nothing.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.782
All that you are trying
to do ends here and now.

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:23.451
You will be stopped!

00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:25.285
And we'll stop you together!

00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:32.192
I'll destroy you all!

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:33.860
(shooting)

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:41.168
This is our third meeting,
Playmaker.

00:16:41.168 --> 00:16:44.438
And as you humans say,
third time's the charm.

00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:46.006
"You humans?"

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.475
You talk like you're not
a human yourself.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.177
Like you're an AI!

00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:52.012
Because I am an AI.

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:52.679
Huh,

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:53.813
not what I expected

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:55.849
but welcome to the cool club!

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:57.784
So, Bohman, If I am correct,

00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:00.720
Lightning created you
to serve him and do his bidding?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.688
That's right.

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:04.991
But know that I am an AI
that's superior to the Ignis.

00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:08.062
Uh, that's not true.
It's not even close to true

00:17:08.062 --> 00:17:09.730
How can ya think
you're better than an Ignis

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.366
when this Ignis
keeps kickin' your tail?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.201
Because unlike you,
I can keep evolving.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.137
The Bohman you defeated
in the past,

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.738
no longer exists.

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:20.507
It embarrasses me

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.809
when I think back
to how I used to be.

00:17:22.843 --> 00:17:25.579
Lightning has been working
on creating new AIs

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.681
for a good portion of time.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:30.183
His first attempt
was Bit and Boot,

00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:33.553
and you can see how primitive
those prototypes are.

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:36.523
Harlin was his second attempt,

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:39.527
but the results were
not to his satisfaction.

00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:42.229
But the third attempt,
Playmaker,

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:45.732
the perfect attempt
resulted in me.

00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:59.213
I've been reborn.

00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:02.916
Yes, and reborn better
than before.

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:06.820
Now, you are ready
to fulfill your destiny.

00:18:07.488 --> 00:18:10.324
Have you wondered why
Lightning would create me,

00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:12.125
an AI that can evolve?

00:18:12.125 --> 00:18:15.295
That can grow smarter
and stronger with every defeat?

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:17.565
No, because I don't
think about you.

00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:19.332
(Bohman)
He did it because
though he realizes

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.601
that the Ignis
are superior to humans,

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.205
the Ignis themselves
are not perfect either.

00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:25.639
Speak for yourself.

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:27.541
You know this to be true.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:30.944
It's only natural that humans
would fight amongst themselves

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.246
because they're such
imperfect creatures.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.715
But if the Ignis were perfect,

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:36.416
why would they have
disagreements,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.218
like you're having right now?

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:39.954
Well...

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:40.821
that's...

00:18:40.821 --> 00:18:41.989
because--

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:44.224
Lightning in his
infinite wisdom knew that

00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:46.226
if this was allowed to continue,

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.461
then the Ignis

00:18:47.494 --> 00:18:50.297
would eventually become
no better than the humans.

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:53.466
So Lightning wanted
to create a great unifier.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:55.469
A perfect being that everyone,

00:18:55.535 --> 00:18:57.103
both human and Ignis,

00:18:57.137 --> 00:18:59.707
will recognize
as their superior.

00:18:59.707 --> 00:19:02.142
And that someone is me.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:04.611
I am the epitome of perfection.

00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:07.147
I am the one
that everyone will obey.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.015
Because only I am capable of

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:11.618
saving everyone from themselves.

00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:14.989
The only thing that's evolved
about you is your ego!

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:17.358
It is not ego
if it is the truth.

00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:20.294
When all Ignis fall in line
before me,

00:19:20.294 --> 00:19:23.496
then the other inferior
creatures will as well.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.336
Because I am the vessel
that will once again

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:32.172
unite the Ignis as one.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.841
(Playmaker)
None of this sounds
appealing to me.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.043
Of course not,

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.044
because humans lack the function

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:40.114
to know what's always right.

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.150
But unlike Lightning,
Playmaker,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:46.019
I do not care
to force you to submit to me.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.354
(Ai)
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.022
(Bohman)
But I will if I have to.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.523
(Ai)
Now we're getting nowhere.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.691
Listen, Bohman.

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.294
The peace you're talking about
isn't really peace at all.

00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:55.829
Because you want to
force it on us

00:19:55.863 --> 00:19:57.698
instead of letting us choose.

00:19:57.698 --> 00:19:59.366
I view things
differently than you.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.135
I believe we can
co-exist in peace

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.604
because we want
to co-exist in peace.

00:20:03.604 --> 00:20:05.772
Not by force but by choice.

00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:08.109
What you speak of is impossible.

00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:10.477
No. The impossible is just
the possible

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:12.212
that has yet to be done.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:14.648
No, it is impossible.

00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:16.650
Take a human and a dog.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.852
Do you say you two co-exist?

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:21.488
No, you call that dog a "Pet."

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:24.391
You clearly feel superior
to that other animal,

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:25.860
as you should.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.862
Because it's written in your DNA
that you are.

00:20:28.862 --> 00:20:31.031
And the difference in
superiority between

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:32.366
an Ignis and a human

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.669
is greater than a human
and a grain of sand.

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:37.871
You speak of co-existence?

00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.273
You're not even worthy
of being my pet.

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:41.308
(laughs)

00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:43.476
But that's only because
you haven't seen him

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.013
turn three times and say woof.

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:47.681
(laughing)

00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:49.716
(Bohman)
If my words fail
to convince you,

00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:53.186
allow me to demonstrate
my superiority in a duel.

00:20:53.186 --> 00:20:56.857
And when I win,
I will take your Ignis.

00:20:56.857 --> 00:20:57.958
Me?

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.460
Aww, woof.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:01.695
This is your chance, Playmaker.

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:04.464
Your chance to prove
that humans are not as pathetic

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:07.267
as they've shown
time and time again.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.236
(Ai)
Ready to do what you gotta do?

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:11.672
I most certainly am, Ai.

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:12.339
Good.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.280
Here we go, Bohman!

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.782
It's time to Speed Duel!
