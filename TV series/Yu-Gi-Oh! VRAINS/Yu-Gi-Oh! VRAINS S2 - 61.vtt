00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:02.570
(intense music)

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:04.237
(Ghost Gal)
Breaking news Skye,

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.640
Playmaker just found
another portal.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.942
But my scans are showing
that it's a fake.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.078
If someone's trying
to trick Playmaker

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.979
we gotta help him Ghost Gal!

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.582
(Ghost Gal)
Slow down Skye.

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:16.783
First off, don't use
my alias on the phone

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.419
you don't know who's listening.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.355
And second, I think I might
know who the individual is

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:22.956
that laid this trap.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.758
And if it's who I think it is,

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.961
you don't wanna rush off
without a plan in place.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.498
(intense electronic music)

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.524
(Male Voice) What? The
shepard created that portal?

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:35.663
Yeah, it was another one
of his traps to capture us.

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:37.597
But, as a consolation prize,

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.900
he caught Soulburner
and Flame instead.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.537
Ah man, then let's find a
way to get them out, pronto!

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.138
(Male Voice)
I know Kolter,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:46.973
but I don't see an
opening anywhere.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.910
What are your scans picking up?

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:51.745
Any weak points we can exploit?

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:52.979
I don't know.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.382
There's a lot of
code to go through.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.317
(Ai)
Then shouldn't you start?

00:01:57.317 --> 00:01:59.319
Already did, hang on.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.623
Um, hang on for how long?

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:03.990
'cause we have guests.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.394
See 'em?

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.899
I do, more bounty
hunters after us.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.667
(Kolter)
Well, that's just great.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.602
If you could speed
things up on your end,

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:16.703
that'd be helpful.

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:22.375
I backed the wrong target.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:27.048
But since this guy also
has a Ignis, he'll do.

00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:30.050
Let me scan his memories
to see if he knows

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.052
where the other Ignis are.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.254
(Male Voice)
Let's speak to him

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:34.722
(Other Voice) But why
can't I live at home?

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:37.791
Have to take care of something
that needs taking care of.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.728
(Keku)
Teddy, Teddy!

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:41.928
Come on, wake up!

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:44.931
You are in big trouble.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.904
You missed school for the
second time this week.

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:53.373
Really? I thought
it was three.

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.876
Come on, finals are
right around the corner.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.545
Yeah, yeah I know, I
already have all the info

00:02:58.545 --> 00:02:59.780
locked up in my noggin.

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:03.117
Are you sure? 'cause
you're grandpa's not.

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.319
He's worried about you.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.320
Did he tell you that?

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.556
Only about a
few million times.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.992
That's a few million
times too much.

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.063
(makes noises in pain)

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.832
(dramatic music)

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.171
(someone screams)

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:25.472
You okay?

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:27.774
(grumbles)

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:33.513
(Ridley)
You didn't pay
the toll for this tunnel kid.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.883
I'm sorry, I don't have
any money to give you.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.220
This all sounds like a you
problem and not a me problem.

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.722
He he he he he

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.692
And you really don't wanna
go and make your problem

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.993
our problem.

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:47.994
(Ridley) Hey boss,
we got company.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.801
What are you and
your eyes staring at?

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:58.038
( Ridley)
Uh, I think
he's staring at you Boss.

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.674
If you're looking for
trouble you found it.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:03.877
Let's go.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.583
Uh uh, you're lucky my
brother's in a forgiving mood.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.585
Hey guys wait up!

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:15.855
Hey hey Tazz, you're not
scared of that guy are ya?

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.424
Of course not.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.192
He just aint worth my time.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.729
Uh, thank you ...

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.568
I guess.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.369
Ah, he's just
having a weird day.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.444
Theodore, I found you.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:40.680
What is it Teddy?

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:45.086
You're acting weird.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.956
It's just, well, I
thought I heard a ghost.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.123
A ghost?

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.292
Spooky! (laughs)

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:53.460
Look, I know.

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:54.928
(laughs)

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:58.365
Don't you worry Teddy,
ghosts only appear at night,

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.633
Just forget it

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.436
but I'll hold your
hand if you're scared.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.071
Come on, I don't
have sweaty palms.

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.144
(Teddy) I'm home

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:11.578
You're late dear.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.750
Your grandfather has been
waiting for you in the dojo.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:20.754
Try again

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.692
You must focus, or else!

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.330
Get up, try again you may
think of giving up on school

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:34.634
but I won't allow you to give
up on yourself, Theodore.

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.337
(intense music)

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.244
Try again.

00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:47.247
(deep breaths)

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.983
(running water)

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:58.325
I won't allow you to give
up on yourself Theodore.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:01.995
I haven't given up, I haven't.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:06.900
I think you're pushing
him too hard dear,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.369
Theodore has to
find his own way.

00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:13.040
Or maybe I'm not
pushing him hard enough.

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:14.741
I doubt that's possible.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:18.345
Really? Then tell me this,

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.814
he could have defeated
me in our match just now

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:22.549
but he didn't follow through.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.850
Of course not,

00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:26.386
because that's not how
his parents raised him.

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.323
What do you mean?

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:31.992
What I mean is, I'm sure
his parents would frown

00:06:31.992 --> 00:06:35.162
if he injured his grandfather's
hip with a judo throw.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.997
It would have held up.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.032
I'm sure it would dear.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:44.170
I know these years
haven't been easy for him,

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:48.141
but he must realize that
no matter how deep he falls

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.478
he must get back up.

00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.746
He must always get back up.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:57.183
I just wish he didn't feel
he had to do this alone.

00:06:59.653 --> 00:07:04.558
Theo, Theodore, find the
Playmaker (electronic sounds)

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:15.802
Um, you there? Hello?

00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:21.975
Ah man, get a grip,
I'm talking to a TV!

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:29.250
(Ridley)
I bet I can beat
Playmaker with half a deck.

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.717
(Black Uniform
Guy) Yeah right.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.254
That guy took down
the Knight's of Hanoi.

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:36.323
I know, that's why I said
I could beat him half a deck

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.958
instead of a quarter of a deck.

00:07:37.992 --> 00:07:39.259
(Teddy)
Hey!

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:42.096
What do you know about
this Playmaker guy?

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.965
Ah! Not you again, stay
away from me, you hear?

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:45.999
Stay away!

00:07:46.066 --> 00:07:48.068
Just answer the question!

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.805
The Playmaker's this
duelist who saved Link Vrains

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.274
from a bunch of hackers
over in Den City

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:56.810
and then he just
logged out and vanished

00:07:56.877 --> 00:07:58.745
and no one's seen him since.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.280
Vanished, huh?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.348
Just great.

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:05.318
Hey! Leave my bro alone.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.387
(laughs)

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.691
Hey, you okay or what?

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:13.793
(crying)
Now that you're here.

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:19.366
What's his beef?
That's like twice now.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.868
We gotta teach that
punk a lesson, real good.

00:08:23.103 --> 00:08:26.706
Yeah right, one that
he'll never forget.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.379
(Teddy yawns)

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:33.547
Here's one.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.116
It says that Playmaker
saved Link Vrains,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.552
so that voice was
telling the truth.

00:08:38.619 --> 00:08:39.452
Whoa

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:45.392
Keku, sorry but I think I think
I somehow froze your tablet.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.627
You were supposed to swipe up

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:49.730
to read the rest of the article.

00:08:49.797 --> 00:08:51.398
Like this.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:56.436
The Hanoi, Playmaker had
some health from Blue Angel

00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:58.205
and the Gore.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.506
(phone rings)

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.107
Hey you, what's up?

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.609
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:11.451
Theodore, the Lost Incident
helped save the world.

00:09:12.619 --> 00:09:14.588
(scared cryout)

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:16.223
Hey, what's with you?

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.058
Be more careful with my stuff.

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.528
Do you know how many
babysitting gigs this cost me?

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.297
It talked, it talked.

00:09:23.364 --> 00:09:26.901
Duh! Ever heard of a
thing called a speaker?

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.535
I thought I muted it.

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.403
Computers, am I right?

00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:38.445
I'm not nuts, I'm not nuts!

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:44.217
I know what I heard.

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.889
(dramatic music)

00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.231
It said the Lost Incident.

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:01.735
(Duel disk) Yes, I
did. It's about time

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:04.037
you dug your duel disk
out of your closet.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.373
I was starting to
worry you never would.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.709
We can finally
talk face to face.

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.111
(screams)

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:12.880
This is no way to treat a guest!

00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:16.550
Aah, I knew it, I totally
knew I wasn't hearing

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.884
or seeing things.

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:19.120
You Sir are a ghost.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:21.588
Ghosts are not real Theodore,

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:25.025
now if we can discuss
this calmly ...

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:27.060
(screams)

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.729
If you cross me,
you'll never know

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:30.630
why you were in
the Lost Incident.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.369
Now if you would please
put down that trunk,

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:37.037
I would feel safer.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.243
(Teddy)
So you're saying
that during the Lost Incident

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:44.377
they created you
based off of me?

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.612
(Duel disk)
Correct.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.581
And you weren't the
only test subject.

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:50.350
Yeah, like you've said,
Playmaker two right?

00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:51.785
(Duel disk)
And others!

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:54.588
And I was hoping you would
assist me in finding Playmaker

00:10:54.622 --> 00:10:56.056
and the other Ignis.

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:58.291
After observing you
these past few days,

00:10:58.358 --> 00:11:00.060
I know you're not too busy.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.963
And there's one more
thing I'd like to discuss,

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.298
Yeah what's that?

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:07.000
Did you have to throw
me back into the closet?

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.802
I find it rather rude.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.805
What? Sorry I can't hear you.

00:11:10.838 --> 00:11:12.907
Well then, I'll come
over there, and --

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.910
No no, no need,
I can hear you.

00:11:15.943 --> 00:11:16.743
Huh!

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:20.581
Theodore, I know
there's no reason

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:23.751
for you to believe me, but
I also don't see any reason

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.619
why you wouldn't believe me.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:28.655
I'm asking you to help
me find the Ignis,

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.792
I'm asking you to help
me find my friends!

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:34.028
And your only lead
is finding Playmaker

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.195
and Link Vrains, right?

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:36.463
Yes.

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:38.431
And if I go to Link
Vrains that means

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:39.966
that I'm gonna have
to duel, right?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.469
Is that a problem?

00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:45.272
(dramatic music)

00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:49.410
(Computer Voice)
You lose.

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:52.480
(shocking sounds)

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.514
Yeah, I'd say it's a problem

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:56.617
'cause I don't duel anymore.

00:11:56.617 --> 00:11:59.586
I see, but with my help,

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.155
together, we can--
(door knocking)

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:03.323
(Grandmother)
Theodore, is
someone in there with you?

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.560
No, what's up?

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:08.428
Well you have a
visitor downstairs.

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.765
They're holding Keku hostage?

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:13.400
And they won't let her go.

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:15.636
Unless you show up alone.

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:16.737
No problem.

00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:21.575
Oh, also, they said don't
forget your duel disk.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.246
(dramatic music)

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.720
(Keku) Just let
me go you creeps!

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:35.055
(Ridley) Not until
your friend shows up.

00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:36.556
(Teddy)
Well I'm already here.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.526
(dramatic music)

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:40.861
(Keku)
Teddy!

00:12:40.895 --> 00:12:43.830
And I'm here alone,
just like you asked.

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.599
And your disk?

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:50.170
(Ridley)
Good, then get set to duel.

00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:53.840
You can mean mug
us all you want,

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:57.912
but it's about time to let
your cards do the talking.

00:12:57.978 --> 00:12:59.747
But I'm not a duelist.

00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:03.150
I don't care. (laughs)

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.419
You better learn how
to duel quick then.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.288
I guess so.

00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:10.090
If you lose you've
gotta be our get us guy.

00:13:10.124 --> 00:13:12.493
As in " Hey Bob, get
us whatever we want"

00:13:12.493 --> 00:13:14.127
And what if I win?

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.964
Then we'll never bother
you or your friend again.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:19.466
Yeah right, don't
trust him Teddy.

00:13:21.602 --> 00:13:23.971
Whether they're lying or
not, you have no choice,

00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:24.804
But to duel.

00:13:26.273 --> 00:13:29.376
Yeah, you better listen
to your duel disk Teddy.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.115
(growling noise)

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.550
(Computer Voice)
You lose.

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:42.556
So what'll it be Teddy?

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:45.559
The night may be long, but
my patience is running short.

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:50.297
I'll give you three
seconds, three, two, one.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.164
Fine!

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.667
Let Keku go!

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:54.634
See ya

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:56.703
Thanks Teddy

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:57.571
He he he

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:00.841
Sorry I got your
wrapped up in this mess.

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.475
Why don't you go on home?

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.944
What about you?

00:14:03.978 --> 00:14:05.111
I'll be fine.

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:14.054
(dramatic music)

00:14:17.224 --> 00:14:20.294
By the way, Ridley here
is the regional champ

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.962
two years running.

00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:24.131
Did we forget
to tell you that?

00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:26.466
Our bad, but it's too late

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.869
to back out now!

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:31.505
But I was never intending
to back out of this.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.041
Yes, but in the short time
I've been in your world,

00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.509
I've learned that those words

00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:37.778
are part of the bad guy lexicon

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.181
and as the good guy,
your optimal response is

00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:44.051
how vile your lips expend
you rascally ruffian!

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.185
Go on, say it.

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:46.519
Think I'll pass.

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:50.156
(dramatic music)

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:53.693
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:59.366
I'm gonna go first,
so check this out.

00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:04.405
I activate the spell
card, Call of the Mummy.

00:15:04.438 --> 00:15:06.940
When I have no
monsters on my field

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:09.776
this spell lets me summon
a zombie type monster

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:10.610
from my hand.

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:13.713
So Plague Wolf's
taken to the field.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.749
(growls)

00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:23.624
Next I summon a second
Plague Wolf to join my pack.

00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.792
(growls)

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:30.063
And by activating their
special abilities,

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:32.566
my wolves attack points double.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.467
(beeping)

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:37.438
But there's a side effect,
they'll both be destroyed

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.106
at the end of my turn.

00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:42.676
How curious, he isn't allowed
to attack on his first turn

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.544
so why would he double
their attack points,

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:46.413
knowing they will be destroyed?

00:15:46.447 --> 00:15:48.682
(Ridley)
I place
one card face down

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.250
and end my turn,

00:15:50.284 --> 00:15:55.122
that means the two Plague Wolves
on my field are destroyed.

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:56.790
(zaps)

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.626
I know he's up to
something, but what?

00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:03.798
I activate my spell
Surrounded by Fallen Wolves.

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:06.333
If my zombie type
monsters were destroyed

00:16:06.367 --> 00:16:08.335
by a special ability this time,

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:11.772
I can resummon them to
my field in defense mode

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.808
meaning my Plague Wolves
are back to hound you.

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:20.514
So then we're back to
square one or square two?

00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:23.016
Square three in fact,
because now I'm allowed

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:26.086
to draw a card for every
monster that I resurrected.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:29.256
(Duel Disk) Ah, so not only
did he maintain his defenses

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.258
he also replenished his hand.

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.526
Oh I'm quite impressed.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:34.628
You have your work cut
out for you Theodore.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.630
It's my turn! I draw!

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:40.834
I'll start by
activating my spell card

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:42.336
Majesty of Fire.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.338
When I have no monsters
out on my field,

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:47.675
this spell lets me summon
a fire attribute monster

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.943
from my hand that's
level five or higher.

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:53.847
Come out level eight,
Phoenix Gearfried!

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.616
(dramatic music)

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:02.322
Come out level eight,
Phoenix Gearfried!

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:06.527
Oh nice, your
monster sure does

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:08.895
have a lot of attack
points, now doesn't he?

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:10.397
(Teddy)
You know it!

00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:12.399
And it'll have even more when
I equip my Phoenix Gearfried

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:14.335
with Phenix Gear Blade.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.670
This sword increases it's
attack points by 300.

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:20.841
(electronic beeps)

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:24.011
And I'll follow that up by
summoning Valkyrian Knight!

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:24.844
Oooooooh

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.252
(Teddy)
As long as
Valkyrian Knight is on my field

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:33.086
Its ability prevents you

00:17:33.153 --> 00:17:35.822
from attacking
Phoenix Gearfried.

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.091
However, it won't
get to that point,

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:40.060
because I'm ending
you this turn.

00:17:40.094 --> 00:17:42.696
Quite the bold
statement you're tooting.

00:17:42.696 --> 00:17:45.165
Let me see you back it up.

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:46.434
(Teddy)
Valkyrian Knight!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.502
Dice up his Plague Wolf.

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:49.804
(explosion)

00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:53.506
And Gearfried, destroy
his other Plague Wolf.

00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:56.844
(zap)

00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:58.645
(explosion)

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:00.147
Not cool,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.249
that guy just got rid of
all of Ridley's monsters.

00:18:02.283 --> 00:18:04.051
Hmm, but he didn't succeed

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.821
in getting rid of a single
one of my life points.

00:18:06.887 --> 00:18:09.623
Not yet, but that
fact is about to change.

00:18:09.657 --> 00:18:12.126
When Phoenix Gearfried
destroys a monster,

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:15.062
I can send Phoenix Gear
Blade to the graveyard.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:18.098
To allow both Phoenix
Gearfried and Valkyrian Knight

00:18:18.132 --> 00:18:19.432
to attack again.

00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:25.372
Ah no, that's causing
700 points of damage.

00:18:25.406 --> 00:18:27.908
But he only had
4000 life points.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:31.912
That's right, so it's over
no matter how you do the math.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:35.382
But I don't wanna
lose, I just don't wanna!

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:37.718
Well too bad, here it goes!

00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:40.120
Valkyrian Knight attack!

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:42.756
Tazz, ahhh

00:18:43.824 --> 00:18:44.958
do something!

00:18:44.992 --> 00:18:45.793
I can't Ridley.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:48.395
Then I guess I will.

00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:52.065
Did you really think
that I was in trouble?

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:55.369
Well I wasn't, not when
I have my trap card

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:57.404
Howl of the Fallen Wolf.

00:18:57.437 --> 00:18:59.206
When you attack me directly,

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.641
I can resurrect two Plague
Wolves from my graveyard

00:19:01.675 --> 00:19:03.310
in defense mode.

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:04.344
Come on back.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:06.846
(loud growls)

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:12.352
Plus, I get to draw one
field spell from my deck.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.123
You still think you're
gonna win this turn?

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:20.160
Well, no, but I can still
clear your field of monsters.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.030
(explosion)

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:25.666
Phoenix Gearfried, go!

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:27.968
(explosion)

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:31.771
That ends my turn.

00:19:31.805 --> 00:19:32.873
Obviously.

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:37.143
I activate my field
spell, Edge of Darkness.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.981
(dramatic music)

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:48.822
Wow, lotta purple.

00:19:48.822 --> 00:19:52.993
He he he, go
ahead, play it cool.

00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:55.128
None of that will
help you because here

00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:58.665
at the edge of darkness I
can get a zombie type monster

00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:01.835
from my deck in my graveyard
by banishing two copies

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.371
of the same monster
from my graveyard.

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.042
And this, this will
be your downfall.

00:20:09.109 --> 00:20:11.145
Just watch!

00:20:11.145 --> 00:20:13.347
I'm watching, I'm watching.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.483
I activate Call of the
Mummies Effect once again!

00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:17.951
(beeps)

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:19.820
Like before I can summon
a zombie type monster

00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:21.222
from my hand.

00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:24.792
In fact, it's the
monster that I just drew.

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:28.795
Teddy, feast your eyes
on despair from the dark.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.533
Theodore, what's
wrong? Theodore?

00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:40.507
(eerie laughs)

00:20:42.343 --> 00:20:44.945
(explosion)

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:47.047
(growls)

00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:53.887
Please, please stop,

00:20:53.887 --> 00:20:55.488
please, stop.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.562
Go away, leave me alone.

00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:06.533
(dramatic music)

00:21:06.567 --> 00:21:08.668
(screams)

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:14.741
(eerie growls)

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:21.248
No, anything but this.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.451
(screams)

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:32.692
(intense dramatic music)
