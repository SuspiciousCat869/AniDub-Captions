I can't afford to lose
this duel to Kolter,

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:09.977
but I don't want him
to lose either.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.345
They shouldn't have been
dueling each other

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.614
in the first place!

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.849
It's all because
Lightning's blackmailing Kolter

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:17.617
by threatening Jin's safety.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.753
I know that this is not
how you and me

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.288
wanted things to end, buddy.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.824
But all good things gotta come
to an end sometime, right?

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.159
Ready Ai?

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.594
Ready for what?

My monster has
another ability!

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.810
When it destroys a monster
next to its link,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
it can attack for a second time
in a single turn!

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.482
It looks like Game Over.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.820
Kolter!

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:54.988
No!

00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.626
Kolter's gone...

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.696
Time to see
what you're made of.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.765
Kolter knew that you
would force him to duel me,

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:07.868
so he prepped me for this.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.172
To make sure
that if my spirit did break,

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:13.707
that I could forge it
back together

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.510
and make it
more powerful than before.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.078
He tricked me?

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.714
But Kolter
isn't holding me down,

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.218
he's lifting me up and giving me
the strength to stop you!

No, no, he's in great shape!

He, uh, thought it would be cool

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.299
to fight his next duel
lying down with his eyes shut.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.868
Why does it feel like
Playmaker's the one who lost

00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:49.803
when he's the one
who actually won?

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.039
Yeah,
it's really bringing me down.

With that attitude,
it's no wonder ya lost altitude!

You don't know Playmaker
like I do!

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.986
He's still got plenty.
Now get up and go!

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.889
Now, prove me right, Playmaker
and get up!

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.691
I knew the duel against
Kolter

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:12.025
would take a lot out of you,

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.195
but even I am surprised
it worked this well.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.698
Though it is a pity
that I didn't get to crush you

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.666
with my own hands.

He can't hear a word
you're saying, Ai.

A fact that almost
makes me envy Playmaker.

Except I couldn't
possibly envy this useless husk.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:38.718

If I erase Playmaker,

it will appear that
we avoided dueling him

because we believed that
humans were superior to AI's.

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:29.536
Instead, we should allow
Playmaker to recover.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.039
We can then
defeat him in a duel,

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:33.840
proving our superiority.

But it's gonna turn out
the other way around.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.704
'Cause I'm more fueled up
than you could ever be!

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:07.908
(both) Time to duel!

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:10.511
Roll roll roll!

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.712
I'm way ahead of ya, Boss!

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.382
Soulburner's duelin' Bohman?

00:10:17.418 --> 00:10:18.852
Soulburner, be careful.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:21.589
His Hydradrive deck
is very powerful.

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:25.425
So powerful, that it was able to
defeat Blue Maiden and Aqua.

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:27.761
They may have lost,

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:30.231
but they were able to show us
how his deck works,

00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:32.933
helping me set up
the perfect counter strategy

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.301
to use against him.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.036
I can't wait to see it.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:37.738
I'll go first.

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:40.340
And I summon Hydradrive Booster.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.245
And with it...

00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:46.580
I will now generate my circuit!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.183
I set Hydradrive Booster
in the Link Arrow!

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.918
To Link Summon!

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.255
Link 1,
burn Hydradrive!

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:58.725
When you have a Fire Attribute
monster on your field,

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.162
Burn Hydradrive can attack
your life points directly.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.032
Seems you know I play
a lot of Fire monsters.

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:07.968
Let's be honest,

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.070
it's not that hard
to figure out.

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:14.007
And by summoning
this Hydradrive Bringer,

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:17.244
I can retrieve a Hydradrive
from my graveyard.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.982
I'll follow that
by link summoning once again!

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:26.753
I set Hydradrive Bringer in
the Link Arrow to Link Summon.

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.656
Link 1 Coolant Hydradrive!

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.494
Now Observe where my
monsters' Link Arrows point to.

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:37.264
They add point to my
Spell &amp; Trap Zone.

00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:39.833
And since they do that means...

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.969
I am now allowed to go
and play a Link Spell!

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.807
He's playing
Judgment Arrows.

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:48.809
This is not good.

00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:50.444
You're quite correct,

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:52.979
and it's only going to
get worse, Flame.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:56.483
Because I'm going to
Link Summon for a third time!

00:11:56.984 --> 00:12:00.720
The summoning conditions are
two Hydradrive Link Monsters!

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:08.562
I Link Summon, Link 2
Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.636
When Twin Hydradrive Knight
is Link Summoned,

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:18.539
it gains the Attributes of the
two Hydradrives

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.006
that were used to summon it.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.543
Therefore, it becomes
both Fire and Water.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.381
Next to safeguard my cards
from whatever you plan to do,

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.417
I activate the spell
Hydradrive Protection

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.653
and use it on my
Twin Hydradrive Knight

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.221
and Judgment Arrows.

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.758
As long as Hydradrive Protection
is in play,

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:40.527
you can't use your
effects or abilities

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.763
against my
Twin Hydradrive Knight

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.931
or my Judgment Arrows!

00:12:45.699 --> 00:12:47.367
His Hydradrive Deck
is designed

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.070
to target my monsters'
Attributes to shut them down.

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:53.540
So just like he shut down
Blue Maiden's Water Monsters,

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.643
he's targeting my Fire Monsters.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.545
But since we know
that's what he's trying to do,

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:00.113
we can counteract it.

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:02.482
You read my mind.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.551
Let's do this.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.490
It's our turn!

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:13.893
We'll start by activating the
Field Spell Salamangreat Shrine!

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:17.631
Whenever Flame and I summon a
Salamangreat Link Monster,

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:19.433
this Field spell lets us use

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.434
that one monster
to Link Summon again.

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.270
So in other words,

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.605
you're able to
Reincarnation Link Summon.

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:27.274
You know it!

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:30.544
And next up,
we summon Jack Jaguar!

00:13:31.312 --> 00:13:34.214
And we'll use it
to now blaze our circuit!

00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:36.950
We set Salamangreat Jack Jaguar

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.153
in the Link Arrow
to Link Summon,

00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:42.489
Link 1 Salamangreat Balelynx!

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:47.461
And due to our
Balelynx's special ability,

00:13:47.728 --> 00:13:49.930
we get to draw
Salamangreat Sanctuary

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:50.998
from our deck.

00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:52.599
I don't think so.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.703
Twin Hydradrive Knight
negates the abilities of

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:58.305
all monsters
it shares an attribute with,

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:01.174
and both our monsters
are Fire Monsters!

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:03.843
So your Balelynx
loses its powers!

00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:05.979
No, it doesn't!

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:08.648
Not when we have
Salamangreat Shrine!

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.385
If your monster
is a Fire monster,

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.021
this spell protects our
Salamangreats from its abilitie.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.028
Ah, I see.

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:23.864
So this is what you meant
by your counter strategy.

00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:25.966
Good to see
you're keeping up with us.

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:28.168
And since we
Link Summoned this turn,

00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:29.870
we get to play this!

00:14:30.338 --> 00:14:31.872
Salamangreat Mole!

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:37.345
And with these two monsters,
we'll Link Summon again!

00:14:37.678 --> 00:14:41.214
Link 2
Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf!

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:47.121
That's not all!

00:14:47.454 --> 00:14:48.889
Summoning Sunlight Wolf

00:14:49.023 --> 00:14:52.292
triggers Jack Jaguar's special
ability from our graveyard!

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:55.695
It lets us return one
Salamangreat in our graveyard

00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:56.997
back to our deck!

00:14:57.497 --> 00:14:59.533
Then we get to summon
Jack Jaguar

00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:01.568
next to Sunlight Wolf's link!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:02.903
Like this!

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.074
And next up,
we're using Jack Jaguar

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:09.276
to bring back a familiar feline!

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.247
We Link Summon!

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:16.416
Link 1 Salamangreat Balelynx!

00:15:17.584 --> 00:15:20.687
And that triggers
Sunlight Wolf's special ability!

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:23.090
When a monster is summoned
next to its link...

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.860
We get to retrieve one
Salamangreat from our graveyard!

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:29.596
And with that,
we're gonna do something

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:31.198
that even you couldn't do.

00:15:31.632 --> 00:15:33.767
Link Summon for a fourth time!

00:15:36.437 --> 00:15:41.008
We Link Summon,
Link 3 Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:44.277
Now we've got the
most powerful monster in play!

00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:47.080
Our Heatleo is stronger
than his Knight,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.050
but Bohman can use
Judgment Arrows to power it up.

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.253
Yeah, I wish we could
get rid of it ASAP,

00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:54.588
but we can't,
'cause his Hydradrive Protection

00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:56.423
is, well, protecting it.

00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.593
But that gives me an idea.

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.829
I use Heatleo's ability

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:04.764
to return Hydradrive Protection
to Bohman's deck!

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:09.236
Oh. (laughs)

00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:11.672
Ah, I see.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.507
You went after the protector
instead of the protectee.

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:17.845
And that now leaves
Judgment Arrows vulnerable!

00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:20.614
I activate
Salamangreat Shrine's effect!

00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:26.620
Now go!
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:16:26.821 --> 00:16:29.123
Rise again
from the valley of flames,

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:31.025
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:33.159
By Link Summoning Heatleo,

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:36.530
its special ability sends
one of your spell or trap cards

00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:37.965
back into your deck!

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:40.334
And you can do
nothing to stop it.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.969
So say goodbye to your
Judgment Arrows!

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.910
And now to put
the icing on the cake, Bohman,

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.745
every single monster that was

00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:54.648
next to Judgment Arrows' links
is destroyed!

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:57.918
Got ya!

00:16:58.085 --> 00:16:59.320
Got me for what?

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:01.255
If you're referring
to my monster,

00:17:01.388 --> 00:17:02.923
you're sorely mistaken.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.724
Mistaken how?

00:17:05.158 --> 00:17:06.259
(growls)

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:08.862
Impossible...

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:11.532
When Hydradrive Protection
leaves the field,

00:17:11.732 --> 00:17:13.667
it leaves behind a parting gift.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:15.369
My monster can't be destroyed

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.538
by effects
for the rest of this turn.

00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:20.140
What?
Then how's this!

00:17:21.174 --> 00:17:23.844
We activate
Heatleo's additional ability!

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:26.647
It changes your
monster's attack points

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.649
to become the same as a monster
that's in the graveyard!

00:17:30.483 --> 00:17:32.152
Meaning your
Twin Hydradrive Knight's

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:35.755
attack points become exactly
the same as Salamangreat Mole's!

00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:40.827
It's down to 0?

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.931
An effect might not be able
to destroy Bohman's Knight,

00:17:44.065 --> 00:17:45.165
but an attack can!

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.033
Ain't that right, Playmaker?

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.169
(groans)

00:17:50.037 --> 00:17:51.304
Here goes!

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.374
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:55.675
Attack Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:03.083
Feel the burn of a thousand
raging infernos, Bohman!

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.118
(groans)

00:18:07.288 --> 00:18:08.455
(screams)

00:18:13.761 --> 00:18:16.930
Feel the burn of a thousand
raging infernos!

00:18:16.997 --> 00:18:18.064
(screams)

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.603
And with that attack,
we'll now end our turn.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.138
Wow!
You see that?

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.708
You betcha!
That attack was sizzling!

00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:28.809
He's on fire!

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:31.412
This duel's so hot.
My eyeballs are burning!

00:18:31.478 --> 00:18:33.613
Stop roastin' your oculars!

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.283
Very impressive, Soulburner.

00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:39.620
I never expected you'd be able
to deal me damage.

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:41.621
You should feel
very proud of yourself.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:43.223
What?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.258
I'm the one who has
the life point lead, you know!

00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:48.261
He's only trying to
provoke you, Soulburner.

00:18:48.828 --> 00:18:50.164
Yeah, I know
and it's annoying

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:51.465
that it's kinda working.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:52.566
(grins)

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.634
But don't you worry, Flame.

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:57.037
I won't let him
throw me off of my game.

00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:00.374
You may say that
and believe that to be true,

00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:04.177
but I find that the actions of
humans often betray their words.

00:19:04.511 --> 00:19:06.012
Now, my turn!

00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:07.615
When neither of us have

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.683
any monsters in our
Main Monster Zones,

00:19:09.783 --> 00:19:13.453
I can automatically summon
Hydradrive Booster from my hand.

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:19.059
Then by tributing
Hydradrive Booster,

00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:22.028
I'm allowed to summon
Hydradrive Agent.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:27.134
And due to Hydradrive Agent's
special ability,

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:30.303
I can re summon one Hydradrive
from my graveyard.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:34.374
Return to me,
Twin Hydradrive Knight!

00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:41.314
When the monster that was
resurrected is a Link Monster,

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:43.784
I also get to draw one card.

00:19:44.185 --> 00:19:47.688
And now,
I shall generate my circuit!

00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:51.291
The summoning conditions require
at least two Hydradrives,

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.526
one of which
is at least Level 5!

00:19:55.695 --> 00:20:00.367
I Link Summon
Link 3 PARADOX Hydradrive Atlas!

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:06.540
(growls)

00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:16.783
I've seen
that monster before...

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.488
It's the worst of them all.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.457
What's up with the glitch?

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:26.893
Glitch?
Hmm, strange.

00:20:27.127 --> 00:20:29.463
Anyway, I know that monster.

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:32.366
It's the one that
destroyed the Cyberse.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:36.670
The one that destroyed my home
and everything I knew.

00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:41.175
Soulburner, that is one monster
that we cannot allow to exist,

00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:42.676
no matter what it takes!

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:44.044
What's this?

00:20:44.345 --> 00:20:46.346
Do I detect that
you're losing your cool?

00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:48.715
As much as you preach to
Soulburner

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:50.817
about falling prey
to his emotions,

00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:53.387
you should be the one
looking in the mirror as well.

00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:55.155
As my AI improves,

00:20:55.222 --> 00:20:57.191
I've become
an expert on emotions.

00:20:57.858 --> 00:20:59.727
How they can fuel you to
great heights,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.597
or plummet you to great depths,
if you cannot control them?

00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.766
And only I can
maintain that balance.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.602
You're a primitive AI.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:11.238
So primitive you couldn't
save your home world.

00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:12.572
Yes, you're right.

00:21:12.706 --> 00:21:14.374
I could not save the Cyberse...

00:21:14.575 --> 00:21:16.410
But though I cannot
change the past,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.080
I can change the future
by defeating you in this duel.

00:21:20.214 --> 00:21:21.615
No, buddy, not "I".

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:23.917
"We" will defeat
Bohman together!

00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:25.719
I'd wish you luck,

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.355
but I'm not one
for wasting wishes.

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:29.923
Save it for yourself.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.593
I don't need it
as you shall observe!

00:21:32.893 --> 00:21:36.429
When I summon my Atlas,
I get to roll a die.

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:41.869
And what I roll will determine
my Atlas's Attribute.

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.571
So you are relying
on luck to help ya!

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.573
No, I'm not.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.443
Since I am one
with Link VRAINS itself,

00:21:49.577 --> 00:21:52.279
I control all the luck
in this world!

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.081
(thunder)

00:21:57.518 --> 00:21:58.385
Oh, man.

00:21:58.452 --> 00:21:59.620
It's an earthquake!

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.821
(screaming)

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:08.028
The fate of all creation
rests in the palm of my hands!

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.830
Judgment Dice!

00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:15.001
Witness what destiny
has chosen for you!

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.674
