00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.112
(Spectre)
Just like it was
when I was a child,

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:14.080
so long as this tree
protects me,

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.985
there is no possible way
that I can be defeated and...

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.453
And?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.257
And since I can't be,
you can't stop Varis

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.327
from destroying Link VRAINS,
along with the Ignis!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:31.498
But Spectre, don't
you realize you'll be
destroyed as well?

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.267
Of course I realize that,
but I have

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.739
the utmost faith in Varis
and entrust my fate to his will.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.276
I'll add that to your
long list of bad decisions,

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.144
because I will defeat Varis

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.947
and I will put a stop
to the Tower of Hanoi!

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.582
You're going to
have to defeat me

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.417
before you can get to Varis.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.653
But, as I said,
I can't be beat!

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.322
(laughs)

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.393
♪♪♪

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.352
Face it,
you have been outmatched

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.056
from the very start,
Playmaker.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:03.957
You don't have
one move to make!

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.994
You're right.
I have more than one,
and here they come!

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.964
Since I just attacked with
a Cyberse-Type Link Monster,

00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:13.434
my Multi Sledgehammer
gains one Hammer Counter!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.737
Next, I activate Binary
Sorceress's ability!

00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:19.539
Once per turn, I can
cut the attack points

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:22.743
of one of the monsters
currently on my field in half

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.979
and then give those
points to another monster!

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.250
Binary Sorceress grants
800 of her attack points

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.252
to Binary Blader!

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.657
And now...
let's do this!

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:42.163
Binary Blader!
Attack his Sunvine Gardna!

00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:45.433
And Spectre, this won't
be a single attack.

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:46.466
What?

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.535
My Blader can attack twice,

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.871
though your monster
will not be destroyed.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.807
Can't say the same for
your life points, though!
Womp womp!

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.209
I activate
Gardna's ability!

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:59.113
For every one of
Sunavalon Dryas's links,

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.715
it decreases
the damage by 800!

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:04.818
So instead of taking
2,000 points of damage,

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.687
I only take 1,200.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.157
I'll take any damage
I can get!

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:12.393
And Binary Sorceress's
special ability

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:15.663
restores my life points
equal to the damage you took!

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.665
So your loss is my gain,
Spectre.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.501
And since I attacked
with a Link Monster,

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.970
Sledgehammer
gains another Counter!

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.473
You're not
the only one who profits.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.510
When I take damage, I can
play Sunavalon Glorious Growth.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.880
This trap summons
a Sunvine Token.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:41.355
In addition, I can now utilize
it to manifest my circuit!

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.656
Huh?
What?

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.625
The manual says you can't
Link Summon during our turn!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.895
Then you should update
your rulebook, because I can.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.164
I thought you were
supposed to be smart.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.234
Or does AI stand
for artificial idiot?

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.503
The summoning conditions
require me to use

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.606
at least two Plant monsters,

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.708
so I set my Sunvine
Token Gardna

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.578
and Sunavalon Dryas
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.046
(sinister laughter)

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:12.552
I Link Summon!
Link 3 Sunavalon Dryanome!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:19.292
I think we're
knee deep in stink.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.795
Yes, you're quite right.

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.898
But I'm afraid for you,
Playmaker,

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.900
the worst
is still yet to come.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.042
We'll never hear the end
of it if we lose to a tree.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.510
Obviously.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:40.047
Now then, due to Glorious
Growth's additional effect,

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:43.017
I regain life points equal
to the damage I just took

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.252
and you take damage
equal to that amount!

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.124
(groans)

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:53.226
So my life points
are back to 4,000.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.229
As long as Spectre
has that trap,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.597
no matter how many of his
life points we get rid of,

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.032
he'll just regain them!

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:01.802
He has the ultimate
defensive deck,

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.970
one that Blue Angel
couldn't break through.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.174
His strategy revolves
around his Sunavalon Dryanome.

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:09.075
Yeah, so unless
we figure out

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.612
a way to chop it down,
we'll be fragged as well!

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:13.813
Ah, easier said than done,

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.016
because if you try
to attack my Dryanome,

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.853
well, those attacks will
be redirected toward me.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.456
So we nail him instead?
I don't hate that.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:24.024
And neither do I!

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:27.027
Binary Blader!
Attack Spectre!

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.598
(groans)

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.668
Nice! And due to Binary
Sorceress's ability,

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:38.505
we gain life points
equal to the damage
you took-- 2,600!

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:42.276
6,600 life points?
How do you like that?

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.345
Fine, actually.
Huh?

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:48.181
I told you that any damage
I take is temporary.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:50.584
Dryanome's ability
activates!

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:53.587
Since you dealt me damage,
I can summon

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:56.356
a Sunvine Link Monster
next to its link!

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:59.526
So, come!
Sunvine Gardna!

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:02.863
(roars)

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.431
Then I regain life points

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:07.601
equal to the damage
that I just took.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.971
Geez, great job giving him
an extra monster, Playmaker.

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.207
And like before,
Glorious Growth

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:15.910
deals you damage equal
to the amount I regained.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.712
(groans)

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:21.181
We're right back
to square one!

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.150
No, you're wrong, AI.

00:06:23.184 --> 00:06:25.519
My Sledgehammer
gets another Counter.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.888
And it uses
its second ability!

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:29.857
When you have a monster
on your field

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.593
and Sledgehammer is co-linked
with another Cyberse monster,

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:35.362
it can attack you directly!

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.230
Go right ahead.

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:41.268
I'll just regain my life points
like every single time before.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:43.637
Must I keep teaching you
this painful lesson

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.839
or will you learn
from your mistakes?

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:48.843
There are no mistakes
in my game, Spectre.

00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:52.312
My Sledgehammer activates
its third ability!

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:55.182
By removing all
of its Hammer Counters,

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:58.185
Multi Sledgehammer
gains 1,000 attack points

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.720
for each one until
the end of the turn!

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.556
That's 4,000
attack points!

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.660
(growls)
Ha ha!
Deuces, Spectre!

00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:07.928
Go, Sledgehammer!

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.166
Attack Spectre directly
for all his life points!

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:14.735
You can't pump up
your life points

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.403
if you already
lost the duel!

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:20.541
Wait! So you mean all
those silly useless attacks

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:24.211
were just a setup to erase
all my life points at once?

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:27.414
Oh! How did I miss it?

00:07:27.448 --> 00:07:29.750
Probably 'cause you were
focusing on your tree

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.985
instead of the forest!
Get it?!

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:36.223
Hmm. Actually it's me
who's got you.
Huh?

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:38.926
My trap has
another effect too.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:43.263
It's an effect that allows me
to stop your monster's attack

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.067
if it happens to be
directed straight at me!
No!

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.038
Then I redirect
your attack

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:55.308
to another one of my monsters,
Sunvine Gardna!

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.743
Aw, glitch!

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.482
Sunvine Gardna's
special ability

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.783
lowers the damage
I take to 1,000!

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.659
Aw, so much for
breaking the cycle!

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.862
Yes.
So sorry to disappoint.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.497
This means
Binary Sorceress

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:19.633
once again restores
my life points.

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:26.273
While you gain life points,
I gain a monster.

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:28.141
Sunvine Gardna!

00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.312
(roars)

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.284
Oh, I regain all of
my life points as well.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.720
It's like we're
dueling on a treadmill.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.889
That's very well put because
you're going nowhere fast.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.161
Glorious Growth lashes away
the life points you've gained!

00:08:48.228 --> 00:08:51.665
(groans)
Allow me to pull
the plug on this charade.

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:53.400
By destroying
Sunvine Gardna,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.103
you're no longer allowed
to battle this turn.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:59.606
Well, Playmaker, at least
we learned what doesn't work.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.208
Right you are.

00:09:01.275 --> 00:09:03.176
But your problem is
that the options

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.880
you haven't even tried
won't work either.

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:07.715
Just because you
speak with confidence

00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:09.015
doesn't make it true.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.085
By placing one card
facedown and ending my turn,

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.556
my monsters' attack points
return to their original value.

00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:17.090
(chuckles)

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.259
I have some bad news
for you.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:22.429
Your life points will
soon be lost in the woods!

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.567
(squawks) Look, boss,
I'm flapping as fast as I can!

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:29.736
Your beak may be flappin'
in the fast lane,

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:31.738
but your wings
are still in slo-mo!

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:34.608
We have a scoop
to scope, so faster!

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.010
Whadaya want from me?

00:09:36.043 --> 00:09:37.944
I'm a pigeon,
not a Peregrine falcon!

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.847
Talk less, flap more!

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.216
Time is ticking,
featherface!

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:46.052
And you're ticking me off
by taking so long!

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.255
Right, boss,
full speed ahead.

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:51.458
Huh?!
Over there!

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:54.227
Playmaker is dueling!

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:56.596
All right! That's
total trending material!

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.232
Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.502
I'm not aimin' to be
particle-ized!

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:03.170
Keep a safe distance!

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:05.672
I'm not sure
any distance is safe!

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.374
♪♪♪

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:10.343
Nice.
My anonymous tip worked.

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:12.446
Now I've got a visual
on Yusaku!

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:15.782
And his opponent's...
Uhh! That guy.

00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:18.752
I really hate
that dude's eyebrows.

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:20.121
Face it, Playmaker.

00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:22.556
Though we both went
through the Lost Incident,

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:25.692
only I have been able to find
a noble purpose from it!

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.193
You simply want revenge.

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:32.232
I want to help ensure Varis's
triumphant new world order!

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:35.168
(groans)
Triumphant or twisted?

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:38.338
I'm not so sure those are
mutually exclusive.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:41.208
Not that it's any of
your concern, Playmaker.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.411
It's my turn.
I draw.

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:47.414
First I send one card
in my hand to the graveyard

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:51.051
to activate the spell
Sunvine Shrine!

00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:53.587
With this card,
once per turn,

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:57.525
I can resurrect a Level 4
or lower Plant-Type monster

00:10:57.558 --> 00:11:00.260
directly from my graveyard!

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.464
I return
Sunseed Genius Loci!

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:07.868
And with it,
I can manifest my circuit!

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:11.572
The summoning requirement
is one Plant-Type monster,

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:14.675
so I set Genius Loci
in the Link Arrow.

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:18.612
I Link Summon!
Link 1 Sunvine Thrasher!

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.618
And since it's linked
to my Dyranome,

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:28.989
it gains 800 attack points
for every one of its links!

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:37.964
Now Thrasher,
thrash his Binary Blader!

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.132
(growls)

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.967
(squawks)
This is gonna hurt!

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:43.270
Flex your tenderloins,
Playmaker!

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:46.440
Binary Sorceress,
activate your ability!

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:49.443
Give half of
Multi Sledgehammer's
attack points

00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:51.645
to Binary Blader!

00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:01.088
(groans)

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:03.423
You saved yourself
some life points,

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:05.692
but thanks to
Thrasher's ability,

00:12:05.726 --> 00:12:08.061
you will now unfortunately
lose the allegiance

00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:10.831
of one of your
best monsters!
What?

00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:12.532
Yeah, what
he said. What?

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:15.636
It's quite simple.
I gain control of the monster

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.671
that was just
destroyed in battle!

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:26.513
This is bad news
for Playmaker!
And Link VRAINS!

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:31.017
And now Binary Blader
attacks your Binary Sorceress!

00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:35.422
(groans)

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:37.257
We're getting
a beat down.

00:12:37.357 --> 00:12:41.162
And that is exactly what
I was aiming for.
Huh?

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:42.897
By stealing Binary Blader,

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:45.899
all of Sunavalon
Dryanome's links are full

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:49.402
so he can no longer summon
monsters in those spaces.

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:53.507
And if he can't summon there,
he can't regain life points.

00:12:53.574 --> 00:12:56.243
Oh! I can't believe
I did that!

00:12:56.343 --> 00:13:00.380
But you did!
Yes, I did.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.951
You really think I would make
such an obvious mistake?

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:07.387
I summon Genius Loci
for a third time!

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:13.927
And I'll use it expand
the reach of my forest!

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.064
The summoning conditions
require two Plant monsters.

00:13:17.097 --> 00:13:22.703
I set Sunvine Gardna and
Genius Loci in the Link Arrows!

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:27.574
I Link Summon!
Link 2 Sunavalon Daphne!

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.248
A new Sunavalon.

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:39.419
Yes. So while my Sunavalon
Dryanome has its links full...

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:43.490
Why, look. Daphne has
an open spot to her left.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.894
Oh, no! His links are
spreadin' like weeds!

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:49.563
But, of course,
that's what trees do.

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.465
They branch out and grow!

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:54.501
This means he's able to
restore his life points again.

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:56.804
So while we can't
damage him anymore,

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:58.906
my ego's
taking a bruising.

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.942
Poor thing. I didn't
think that was possible.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:03.711
But it only gets worse.

00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:05.812
By tributing Binary Blader,

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:09.283
Daphne returns two Gardnas
in my grave to my Deck!

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.719
And that means
I opened up another link

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:13.687
to which I can summon!

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:17.490
Next, I place a card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.795
(groans)

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.964
I wonder which
will last longer--

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:26.166
your remaining life points
or this bridge?

00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:30.203
(gasps)

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:38.812
What are you waiting for,
my friend?

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.514
It is your turn.

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:43.984
Uh, Playmaker,
I think I'll be safer
in here. Good luck.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.886
Here I go. I draw!

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:49.523
Before you make a move,
I activate Sunavalon Force!

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:52.793
As long as this trap's
in play, your cards' effects

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:55.362
will not work against
any of my Sunavalons.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:58.732
So I can't attack or use
effects against them?

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.668
Starting to wonder
if we were better off

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:02.336
if the bridge
did collapse!

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:04.271
Well, I have a plan!

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.339
I summon out my Draconnet!

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:11.512
A monster with wings?
Great plan!

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:14.014
You think it can
swoop down and save us
if the bridge falls?

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:16.583
AI, you're making me
wish the bridge does fall.

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:20.354
Draconnet allows me to summon
another monster from my deck.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:23.890
I bring out Bitron
in defense!

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:29.362
And I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:34.468
I'm setting my Bitron
in the Link Arrow!

00:15:34.568 --> 00:15:40.840
I Link Summon!
Link 1! Link Spider!

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:47.047
Using Link Spider's ability,
I can summon a monster

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.383
from my hand directly
next to its link!

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.455
Hah! I now summon Digitron!

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:02.128
And I have all I need
to Link Summon again!

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:09.636
I set Link Spider and
Draconnet in the Link Arrows!

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:13.773
I Link Summon!
Link 2 Underclock Taker!

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.844
All that for a top?

00:16:16.944 --> 00:16:19.847
If my second Link Monster
isn't enough to satisfy you,

00:16:19.947 --> 00:16:21.782
perhaps my third one will!

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.452
I require at least
two Cyberse monsters,

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:27.788
so I set Digitron
and Multi Sledgehammer

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:31.491
in the Link Arrows to
create the ultimate circuit!

00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:35.262
I Link Summon Link 3,
Excode Talker!

00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:42.269
Excode Talker! Protect the
monster you're linked to!

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:46.273
Underclock Taker can no longer
be destroyed by effects,

00:16:46.307 --> 00:16:48.475
and it also gains
500 attack points!

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:52.846
So what? None of that does
anything to hinder my strategy.

00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:55.315
But Excode Talker's
second ability will!

00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:57.585
Since it was
successfully Link Summoned,

00:16:57.618 --> 00:17:00.020
for every monster
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.156
one of your Main Monster
Zones can't be used!

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.160
Huh?

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:07.427
That's two zones, Spectre!

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:10.864
Enough to sandwich
your Daphne like a hot dog!

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:14.367
Oh, no!

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:18.071
Next, Underclock Taker's
special ability activates!

00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.741
One of your monsters
loses attack points

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.876
equal to the attack
points of the monster

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:25.846
next to
Underclock Taker's link,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.182
and it's pointing
at Excode Talker!

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:32.186
Watch 2,300 attack points
leave that leaf!

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:35.189
No! My absolutely perfect
defense formation

00:17:35.222 --> 00:17:37.758
is falling apart.
This can't be!

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:39.859
But yet,
it appears to be.

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:43.063
I've finally broken your
combo, so I've broken you.

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.865
Uhh! No, no, no!

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.501
Yes, yes, yes!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:49.736
All right, fine.

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:53.139
You leave me no choice but
to play my ace in the hole.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:54.174
(snaps fingers)

00:17:55.676 --> 00:17:58.712
What is...? Zaizen?!

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.081
Is that you, Playmaker?!

00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.582
This is all sorts of bad!

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.988
You were wrong to think
I was out of options.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:09.322
There's the game,

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.259
and then there's the game
outside the game.

00:18:12.293 --> 00:18:16.130
If Zaizen touches his cage,
one tiny prick from its thorns

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.899
will digitize him
out of existence.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:21.802
So what?
Just don't
touch the bars.

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:23.771
(groans)

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:26.240
I've linked my life points
to Zaizen's cage

00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:30.076
so any damage I take
will grow those thorns,

00:18:30.143 --> 00:18:34.581
and if they grow much more,
then Zaizen Will meet his doom!

00:18:34.648 --> 00:18:37.217
That's cheating!
Super cheating!

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.387
I don't care.
(laughs)

00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:43.056
If I did care,
I wouldn't've done it.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.158
Isn't that obvious?

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:47.261
You really are
the worst!

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:50.430
Thank you for the compliment,
but kind words

00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:52.265
won't get you
out of this situation.

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:55.436
You have a choice to make,
Playmaker.
(gasps)

00:18:55.536 --> 00:18:59.706
You can attack me and put
Zaizen's well-being in jeopardy

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.975
or you can choose
not to attack me

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:05.112
and put all of Link VRAINS
on the brink of destruction.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.481
I know what logic says
is the right choice,

00:19:07.547 --> 00:19:10.117
but will you be logical?
(gasps)

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.986
Listen, Playmaker!
Forget about me!

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.621
Listen to him.
He's right!

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:16.323
If you lose and
Link VRAINS is gone,

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:20.060
Zaizen'll be a goner
anyway! So let's attack!

00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:23.197
I end my turn.
Uhh! You what your what?

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:25.065
Playmaker.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.800
(laughs)

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.436
Yes.
That's the problem

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:31.205
with actually having
a conscience, you see.

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:32.973
You're simply
not able to make

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.542
really tough decisions
when you need to.

00:19:35.643 --> 00:19:39.813
Now, if it was me,
I would let Zaizen be

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.483
and not hesitate to get my
revenge on the Knights of Hanoi.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.655
But no, you let your one
opportunity to defeat me pass.

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:49.556
I bet you think
you're being noble

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:50.891
and every single person

00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:53.126
in the whole wide world
would think so too.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.197
But they're wrong.
You are just weak.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:20:00.333
What happens from here on out
is your doing, Playmaker,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.536
but I doubt you'll be
feeling guilty,

00:20:02.636 --> 00:20:05.772
because you can't feel
emotions if you don't exist.

00:20:05.806 --> 00:20:07.108
By ending your turn,

00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:09.976
so ends Underclock Taker's
special ability,

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:13.948
so Sunvine Thrasher regains
all of its attack points.

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:17.617
C'mon, no do-overs?
(groans)

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:20.454
(cracks knuckles)

00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:23.990
You have no one to blame
but yourself, Playmaker.

00:20:24.057 --> 00:20:26.827
The next time you have
a chance to seize victory,

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.029
don't hesitate!

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:32.633
Allow me to demonstrate!

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:35.302
It's my turn. I draw!

00:20:36.437 --> 00:20:38.939
Thrasher! Attack!

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:41.308
Time's up
for Underclock Taker!

00:20:44.144 --> 00:20:46.313
(groans)

00:20:46.347 --> 00:20:49.483
And since your monster was
just destroyed in battle,

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:52.486
Sunavalon Force's effect
activates!

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:54.821
The Monster with the
most links on the field

00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:58.826
deals you 100 points
of damage per link!
(gasps)

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:01.895
Sunavalon Dryanome
has three links.

00:21:01.962 --> 00:21:04.898
That means 300 points
of damage to you!

00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:08.168
(groans)

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:12.740
And speaking of damage,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.908
this bridge is looking
pretty beat up!

00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.109
And I got a bad feeling

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:18.879
the same might be
true for us too!
