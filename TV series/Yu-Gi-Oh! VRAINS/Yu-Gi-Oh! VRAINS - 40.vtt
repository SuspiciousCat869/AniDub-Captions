WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.404
(Ai)
Previously
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS!"

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.608
All right,
I made it to the tower.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.744
Just because it's
within your sights

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.580
doesn't mean
you've made it.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.949
This is as close
as you will get.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.285
(both)
Time to duel!

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.820
(panting)

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.855
(Ai)
There he is!

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.692
Sorry to steal
your spotlight, Playmaker.

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:28.595
But not really.
You're done
duelin' for today.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.797
'Cause I'll pin
this jobber for ya.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.133
I've got kids counting on me

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.737
to save Link VRAINS
and put the Hanoi on ice!

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.105
Beginning with you!

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.073
Go ahead and finish me.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.342
Oh, I will.

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:45.612
Gouki the Great Ogre,
attack Varis directly!

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.282
I activate Mirror Force!

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:52.686
Every monster on your field
in Attack Mode is destroyed.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:56.957
Every... single... one.

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:01.027
My Monsters!
No! This can't be!

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.501
So this is the card
Ghost Gal warned us about.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.970
He got me!

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.873
(triumphant laughter)

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.647
(theme music playing)

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.442
That's not fair!

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.411
Gore's gonna lose!

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.448
No he's not!
He's the Gore!

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:29.749
He'll pull through.
Just watch!

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.621
This is looking bad.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.924
Come on Gore, it can't
end this way, it can't!

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.434
(9Ai)
Gore looks like a balloon
that went pfffffft.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.370
Your field's empty.
Just like that.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.307
(chuckling)

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:56.944
You may've wiped out
all my monsters, Varis,

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.279
but you can't
wipe out my spirit.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.315
Round one went to you.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:06.153
But this duel ain't gonna
go to the scorecards!

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:09.490
I'll topple you like I'll
topple that tower!

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.993
I activate
Gouki Ringtrainer's
special ability!

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.362
When there are
no monsters on my field,

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.731
I can summon Ringtrainer
in Defense Mode.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.800
(chuckling)

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.436
Then it can bring back
one of its protégés

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.639
by lowering its
attack points by 500!

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.441
Step back in the ring,
Gouki the Great Ogre!

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.545
Seems my field
ain't so empty.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.815
I bet you think your refusal
to give up makes you noble.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.216
It does not.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.219
All you are accomplishing
is wasting my time.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.189
And I will now bring
your charade to an end!

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.659
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.896
I activate my spell card
Quick Launch!

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.499
It summons a Dragon
from my deck!

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:56.303
Magnarokket, launch!

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:59.139
Your Magnarokket ain't
blastin' off nowhere!

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.541
Not when my Great Ogre
lowers its attack points

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.611
for every defense point
that it has!

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.281
(roaring)

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.917
Is that supposed
to be a problem?

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.719
I activate Squib Draw!

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.256
You may have gone to
all that trouble to
weaken my Magnarokket,

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:16.923
but I'll just destroy it...

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.126
so I can draw
two additional cards.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:24.098
Next I activate
my field spell
Boot Sector Launch.

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:26.900
It allows me summon
two Rokket monsters

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.036
directly from my hand
in defense mode!

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.205
Now take to the field,

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:33.540
Shelrokket Dragon
and Metalrokket Dragon!

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.678
My Boot Sector Launch
has another effect!

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:39.713
It gives 300 attack
and defense points

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.015
to each and every Rokket
monster on the field!

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.585
Now I'll use
these two monsters

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:46.787
to manifest my circuit!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:50.257
The summoning conditions
require two Rokket Monsters.

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:53.727
So I set Shelrokket and
Metalrokket in the Link Arrows!

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.433
I Link Summon!

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:02.769
Link 2 Booster Dragon!

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.407
Next I summon
another Shelrokket!

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:09.476
But that's not
all that I'm doing.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.250
Boot Sector Launch increases
its attack strength by 300,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.619
raising it to 1,400 points!

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.122
I don't think so!
(roaring)

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.591
My Ogre weakens
it to nothing!

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:29.029
Must I remind you that I don't
care about anything you do?

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.999
I use Booster Dragon's
special ability on Shelrokket.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:38.972
And by doing so,
Shelrokket is destroyed.

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:43.343
But it also takes down
the monster
vertically above it!

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.413
And if you so happen to have
any monsters next to it,

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:49.115
they're also destroyed.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.021
Aw, no!

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:56.356
Gore lost all
his monsters again!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.991
He needs to upend
this trend!

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:00.961
Gore's left himself
wide open to attack.

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.864
No kidding! The last time
I saw a field that empty

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.032
was, like, the last time
he let this happen!

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.002
Time to attack!

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:10.404
BOOSTER DRAGON,
strike Gore's life points!

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:13.407
(roaring)

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.342
Ahh!

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.350
Ahh!

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.086
Oh!
Is Gore still okay?

00:06:26.086 --> 00:06:28.055
<i>Ahh!</i>

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.024
Grr!

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.992
(groaning)

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:36.997
That it?

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.366
Since Magnarokket
and Shelrokket

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:41.535
were destroyed
by special abilities,

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:44.204
their own special
abilities activate.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.308
I can summon two other
Rokket monsters from my deck

00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:50.176
in Defense mode
at the end of my turn!

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:54.314
Come on out, Shelrokket Dragon
and Metalrokket Dragon!

00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.187
Then my field spell
Boot Sector Launch

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.655
raises their defenses,

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.424
making it more difficult
to get past them.

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:06.627
But you're welcome to try!

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:10.097
(Ai)
This is so bad
it's making me wanna cry.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.766
If I had tear ducts.

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:13.800
But I can at least
make my eyes wiggly.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.802
Gore's definitely
in trouble.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.039
But that doesn't mean he can't
turn this duel around

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.272
and make a comeback.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.041
Here I go, Varis!

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.743
I draw!

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:26.580
To start, I activate
the spell Gouki Re-match!

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.417
Once per turn, I can summon
two Goukis from my graveyard

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:33.787
in Defense mode just as
long as each of them
has a different Level.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:38.558
I revive Gouki Moonsault
and Gouki Twistcobra!

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:42.162
And then I activate
Moonsault's special ability!

00:07:42.162 --> 00:07:44.798
Not only do I get to return
a Gouki Link Monster

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.934
in my graveyard
to my Extra Deck,

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.303
but I also get to snag
a different Gouki monster

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:50.571
and add it to my hand.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.206
And that sets me up

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:57.911
to mash up my circuit
once again to Link Summon!

00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.412
Watch this!

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.283
I set Gouki Moonsault
and Gouki Twistcobra

00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:04.184
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:07.821
I Link Summon!
Link 2 Gouki Jet Ogre!

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.657
(roaring)

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.960
And then like last time,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.861
Twistcobra's
ability activates

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.363
when it goes
to the graveyard!

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:20.000
I get to draw another
Gouki card from my deck

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.969
and I'll follow that up
by summoning Gouki Suprex

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.304
in Attack mode!

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.143
Suprex's
ability activates

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:30.611
And Suprex's ability

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.146
lets me keep
adding to my squad

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:35.616
by summoning
Gouki Tagpartner!

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:38.485
And here's where
they fight as a team!

00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:40.821
Jet Ogre destroys itself
to switch every single scrub

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.791
you got on your field
into attack mode, Varis!

00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:49.963
It also gifts
my two remaining Goukis

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.866
with 500 extra attack points

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.567
until the end of the turn.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.169
But Jet Ogre
won't be gone for long

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:59.039
'cause I activate Gouki Grit!

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.608
It equips on to Jet Ogre
and revives it

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:05.278
so it can fight again!

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.048
He has more beef
than a cattle ranch!

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.417
(thinking)
If Gore attacks
with all three Goukis,

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:13.254
he can destroy Varis's monsters
and deal decent damage.

00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:14.888
But Varis remains unfazed.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.725
He knows that his Rokkets
are designed to keep reviving.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.729
So even if they're destroyed,
they won't be gone for long.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.631
This poses a dilemma for Gore,

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.367
but it's one
that he must overcome

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:28.202
for any chance at victory.

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:30.704
Does Gore have
what it takes?

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:34.408
It's about time
to step up my game!

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.343
With a game-changer!

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.679
I'm gonna be needin' at least
three Goukis to Link Summon!

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.516
So I set Gouki
Tagpartner, Suprex

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:45.052
and Jet Ogre in the Link
Arrows to bring out

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:48.756
the most powerful
wrestler in my deck!

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.590
You ain't ready
for this Varis!

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.559
I Link Summon!

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:56.429
Link 4 Gouki
the Giant Ogre!

00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:02.536
(roaring)

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:06.039
How interesting.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.718
That's Gore's
strongest Ogre yet.

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.620
Like a buff buffalo!

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.721
My monsters are pumped up.

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:25.626
And ready to give you
the workout of your life!

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.728
Since Gouki Suprex
went to my graveyard,

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.529
I get to reinforce my hand

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:33.300
with another Gouki
from my deck.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.004
And since I used Gouki
Tagpartner to Link Summon...

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:40.074
my Giant Ogre gains
1000 attack points

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:42.343
until the end of the turn!

00:10:42.343 --> 00:10:44.378
But it's not done flexin',

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:46.246
'cause whenever
its attack points change,

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:47.747
it gains 1000 more attack
points till the turn's done!

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:52.753
(roaring)

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:55.222
Whoa, Gore's sharper
than I thought!

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:59.225
(roaring)

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:01.862
(both yelping)

00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.131
You're supposed to be
flying that a'way!

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.532
I'm tryin', boss!

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.000
Ready, chump?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.238
Gouki the Giant Ogre,
slash up his Booster Dragon!

00:11:11.238 --> 00:11:13.340
Attack!

00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:21.848
Oof!
That musta hurt.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.284
That was so cool!

00:11:23.284 --> 00:11:24.618
Keep goin'!

00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:25.986
I don't even know
why I was crying!

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.525
This changes nothing.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.629
Nah, mac.
It changes everything.

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:38.765
You believe that because you
were never the brightest.

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:40.701
When Booster Dragon
is destroyed,

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.336
I can summon another
Dragon from my graveyard

00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:44.604
to replace it.

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:47.674
Triple Burst Dragon!

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:50.143
That's nothing
I can't handle.

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.945
You're just lucky
my Great Ogre

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.348
can't attack twice
instead of once.

00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:57.117
Got no choice
but to end my turn.

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.753
But when my next
turn comes up,

00:11:59.753 --> 00:12:02.189
you're goin down' like
a tree in a hurricane!

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.658
Or so you hope.
I draw!

00:12:04.658 --> 00:12:06.860
I tribute
Triple Burst Dragon

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.863
to resurrect Booster
Dragon from my graveyard.

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.370
Triple Burst also
allows me to summon

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.206
a Level 4 or lower,
Dragon from my hand

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:22.409
so emerging from
its eternal rest
is Hibernation Dragon!

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:25.312
(growling)

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:28.749
And when Hibernation Dragon
wakes from its slumber,

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:31.819
it returns a Dragon
in my graveyard to my hand,

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:34.221
but it won't be
on the sidelines for long

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:35.889
because I summon it!

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.857
Come, Magnarokket Dragon!

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:43.530
Since I have my Field Spell
Boot Sector Launch,

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.099
Magnarokket gains
300 attack points!

00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.571
Booster Dragon's special
ability would chip in

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:54.141
with 500 extra attack
points of its own.

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.309
But when Magnarokket
is targeted

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:58.512
by a Link Monster's
special ability,

00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:00.247
it self-destructs.

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:02.316
However, it doesn't
perish alone.

00:13:02.316 --> 00:13:03.784
It takes a monster
with it.

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.287
Like your Great Ogre.

00:13:06.287 --> 00:13:08.655
Which happens to be
your one remaining monster.

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:15.262
If Gore loses
his Great Ogre,

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:17.764
he'll no longer be able
to defend himself.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.433
Zero one one,
zero one one one,

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.401
zero zero one one,
zero one one one one!

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:25.572
Now fire!

00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:27.574
You mean misfire!

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:31.645
Since your monster has
fewer attack points
than Giant Ogre,

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.782
my big bad brute deflects
all your abilities!

00:13:34.782 --> 00:13:37.251
(Ai)
Phew! That was close!

00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:39.487
I almost deleted
all my data.

00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:41.454
That the best you can do?

00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:44.424
You are beginning
to annoy me.

00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:46.327
That's what I like to hear.

00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:49.396
'Cause that means I must be
doing something right.

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:51.565
In my past duels,

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.333
I only cared about
putting on a good show.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:56.202
'cause making huge comebacks
was what my biggest fans,

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:58.539
meaning my littlest
fans, loved.

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:00.241
But sometimes,
it didn't work out.

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:03.043
And I'd get that L.

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:06.513
But this is one match
I can't afford to lose.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:10.717
Not if I wanna save
Link VRAINS from you thugs.

00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:14.654
And prove that I rank
right up there
with the top duelists!

00:14:14.654 --> 00:14:18.492
That, Varis, is what
I just realized.

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:22.129
For once in my life,
I have to duel for myself!

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:26.566
Not for you, your mama
or your mama's mama!

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:31.472
I'm gonna duel my duel
and get that W over you!

00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:33.507
(chuckles)
My my.

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:36.210
That was quite
the lovely speech.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.512
Delusional, but lovely.

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:41.682
Gore's got a fez
of a lead in life points,

00:14:41.682 --> 00:14:45.852
but their practically
even-steven in every way.

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.055
Except Varis still has
four monsters.

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:50.457
Eh!
You're right!

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.160
How did you fail
to notice that, Ai?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.162
Hmph.
I'm not listening to you.

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:56.663
Whatever hope you had,

00:14:56.663 --> 00:15:00.634
you'll learn how
misguided you were!

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.536
In order to Link Summon,

00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:05.539
I require at least
three Effect Monsters.

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:08.241
So I set
these three Dragons

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.876
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:17.050
You said you wanted
to fight your fight?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.887
You were never
in this fight
to begin with!

00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:22.222
I Link Summon!

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:24.892
Link 4 Borrelsword Dragon!

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.727
(roaring)

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:28.695
Eh, it doesn't look
that tough.

00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.230
Take away
its titanium armor,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.966
laser-guided
tracking processors,

00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:34.935
and neutronic propulsion
system and what's left?

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.871
On second thought,
maybe Gore
should be worried!

00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:39.373
Gotta admit,
looks intimidating.

00:15:39.373 --> 00:15:42.376
It doesn't just
look intimidating.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:44.878
It is intimidating!

00:15:44.878 --> 00:15:48.382
I never expected to summon
this monster against you,

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:52.085
but you unexpectedly produced
a smidgen of opposition.

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.455
So to reward your competence,

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:57.057
I'll wipe you off
the face of this realm!

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:59.560
Get ready!

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.997
Borrelsword Dragon, destroy
Gouki the Giant Ogre!

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.470
Let 'em feel your steel!

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.438
(roaring)

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.678
Ow ow ow ow
ow ow ow ow!

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.647
(both yelping)

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.616
Whoa!

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:24.618
Ahh!

00:16:24.618 --> 00:16:26.319
Ahh!

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.589
No, not right now
no, not like this!

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:30.291
(all gasp)

00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:32.793
We're missing the most
important part!

00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.995
(Varis)
Our monsters' attack
points may be equal,

00:16:34.995 --> 00:16:38.465
but Borrelsword Dragon
can't be destroyed

00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:40.967
so it's not
going anywhere!

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.503
The same goes
for my Giant Ogre,

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:45.606
so it looks this
fight's a stalemate

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:48.175
and your attack was
a whole bagful of nothing!

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:50.644
That's where you're
disastrously wrong!

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:52.112
Borrelsword Dragon's
special ability

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:55.849
steals half your Ogre's
attack points!

00:16:58.118 --> 00:17:01.054
Aww glitch!
That means Varis's monster

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:03.690
has way more attack
points than Gore's!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.527
Therefore your Giant Ogre's
attack points drop to 1500!

00:17:11.565 --> 00:17:15.169
Gore's losing ground like
he's wearing ice skates!

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.804
Can't we do
anything for him, huh?

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:20.740
Borrelsword activates
its second ability

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.178
that would usually
switch my Metalrokket
to Defense mode.

00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:27.081
But when Metalrokket is
the target of an ability,

00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:29.016
it self-destructs.

00:17:29.016 --> 00:17:32.385
However, it won't go
to the graveyard alone.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.187
It also destroys
all your cards

00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:36.490
that are in the same
column as it.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.494
In other words,
your Giant Ogre!

00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:43.431
(growling)

00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:46.700
Go Blast Destruction!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.135
(roaring)

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.070
Ahh!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.005
(yelping)

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:57.344
(groaning)

00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:59.513
Huh? Are my eyes bugging?

00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:02.716
Giant Ogre's
still on the field!

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:06.487
When your Borrelsword stole
my Ogre's attack points,

00:18:06.487 --> 00:18:08.755
that's another way
of saying my Ogre's

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:11.291
attack points changed.
(chuckles)

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:12.959
And that triggers
its ability,

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:15.095
raising its power
by 1000.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:18.332
And since it's not affected
by monsters weaker than it,

00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:21.768
Metalrokket wasn't firing
anything packin' a punch!

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:24.037
In other words, you failed.

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:26.707
Are you sure?
Or perhaps it is you

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:29.243
who has failed to
comprehend my strategy.

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:30.744
Ohh.

00:18:30.744 --> 00:18:34.382
When Borrelsword utilizes
its special ability,

00:18:34.382 --> 00:18:37.418
it is allowed to attack
for a second time.

00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:40.721
What!?
You heard me.

00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:45.159
Did you really think I would
make such a silly mistake?

00:18:45.159 --> 00:18:48.495
(grunting and roaring)

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.235
Aah!

00:19:09.483 --> 00:19:11.051
(glass breaks)
Ah?

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.989
Oh, dear!

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:19.526
Do you think Gore won
his duel against Varis?

00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:20.827
I'm sure he did.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.295
That's right.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.198
Gore never ever
lets his fans down.

00:19:24.198 --> 00:19:26.400
(thinking)
But there's always
a first time

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.636
I just hope this
isn't it.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.637
(Ai)
Gore's still standing!

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.206
He's still in this duel!

00:19:33.206 --> 00:19:36.443
No, Ai.
He may be on his feet,

00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:38.812
but he doesn't have
any life points left.

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:41.315
He lost the duel.

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:43.317
Aww!

00:19:43.317 --> 00:19:48.221
Well, Playmaker...

00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:51.192
Looks like it's the end
of the line for me.

00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:52.959
But not our mission.

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.129
Thanks to you,
we now know the identity

00:19:55.129 --> 00:19:56.663
of Varis's secret card.

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:59.833
Hmm!
Put it to good use.

00:20:04.505 --> 00:20:06.606
Well, well!

00:20:06.606 --> 00:20:09.310
It appears that you and I
are the only two duelists

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.044
remaining
in Link VRAINS.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:15.816
But there's only room
in this world for one of us.

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:18.285
Yes.

00:20:18.285 --> 00:20:21.655
And that duelist will be me!

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:33.333
