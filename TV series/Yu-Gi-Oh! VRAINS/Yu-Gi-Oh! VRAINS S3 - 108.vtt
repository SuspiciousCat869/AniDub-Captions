WEBVTT

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:04.304
Previously
on Yu-Gi! VRAINS...

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:06.440
Someone went
after The Queen,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:10.010
SOL Tech's top executive
and put her out of commission.

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:12.312
The culprit executed
the assault

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.681
by hacking one of SOL Tech's
SOLtiS androids...

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.017
The culprit stole
the Queen's code key

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.187
in order to gain control
of SOL Tech's mainframe.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.090
You see, there are
two code keys that exist.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.025
And the second one is with me.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.526
And you want us
to protect you

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.762
so that your key
won't get stolen.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.264
Do you have any clue
who this culprit is?

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.699
See for yourself.

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.236
Hi!

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.272
Whaaat's up?!

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.841
To think we were once
working on the same team,

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:41.675
meatbag.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.243
On the same team?

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.245
It's me!
Ai!

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.582
Those meatbags don't
want us to reach Zaizen.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.418
They have that entire
place sealed up

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:51.685
tighter than
a paint can.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.487
(gasps)
They split
into three!

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.791
But I thought we just had
to worry about Ai and Roboppi.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.192
There's three
of it!

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:01.895
(All)
Let's duel!

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.831
(Kolter)
Two new blips on the radar!

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.734
Is that the real Ai?

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.335
It is indeed!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.072
And the three of us
are Ai's decoys.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:12.740
No!

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.508
Emma and The Shepherd lost!

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.243
I have even more bad news.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.478
Ai defeated Faust
and Spectre too!

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.849
The only one left
in their squad is Gore.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.316
(Both)
Time to duel!

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:35.061
♪♪♪

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:33.320
(Gore)
It's my turn!

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.489
I summon... GOUKI SUPREX!

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:43.630
SUPREX's ability
also lets me summon GOUKI GUTS!

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.434
I Link Summon!

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.871
Link 2 GOUKI HEEL OGRE!

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:56.243
Since I sent GOUKI GUTS
and RISCORPIO to the graveyard,

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.880
I get to draw two GOUKI cards
from my deck.

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:02.816
Next I activate GOUKI RE-MATCH!

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:06.386
It resummons GOUKI GUTS
and GOUKI TWISTCOBRA!

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.822
Then GUTS's ability activates...

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.693
But I can use my HEEL OGRE
to stop that ability

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:14.527
and also destroy it.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.198
However, I get to bring back

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:20.834
a GOUKI Link Monster
from my graveyard!

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.637
GOUKI THE MASTER OGRE!

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.106
(grunts)

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.141
I think it's rude that you'd
bring back a monster

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.210
that I worked
so hard to destroy!

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:31.778
I'm a rude dude!

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:34.381
I Link Summon!

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.384
Link 2 GOUKI JET OGRE!

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.555
Since I used GOUKI SUPREX
to Link Summon,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.725
its special ability lets me
draw GOUKI DIVER!

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.463
And I'll keep
the Link Summonin' goin'!

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.799
Link 3 GOUKI THUNDER OGRE!

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:58.939
Huh.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.775
Unlike when I stare
in the mirror,

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.109
this isn't looking good for me.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.711
You that right, bub,

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.381
and since I sent TWISTCOBRA
to the graveyard...

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.117
I get to draw another GOUKI.

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.754
Next, JET OGRE's special ability
activates from my graveyard,

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:17.891
increasing the attack points
of all the GOUKIS on my field

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.061
by 500 until the end
of the turn!

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.964
And I'm still not done.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:26.800
In fact,
I'm only gettin' started!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.602
I'm summonin' a monster

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.771
right next
to THUNDER OGRE's link!

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.739
GOUKI SUPREX!

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.177
Then SUPREX uses its ability

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.679
so that it can tag in
its partner.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.049
GOUKI DIVER!

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:45.285
And with it
I'll mash up my circuit!

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.455
The summoning conditions
require two or more GOUKIS.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.957
So I set GOUKI DIVER

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.727
and GOUKI THUNDER OGRE
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.431
Time to bring the power!

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.700
And the power
unleashes the pain!

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.169
I Link Summon!

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.640
Link 4 GOUKI THE POWERLOAD OGRE!

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.977
What?

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:11.979
A new Link 4 monster?

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:14.781
And when this powerhouse
is Link Summoned,

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:17.851
it's immune to all special
abilities other than its own.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.987
Then my DIVER's
ability activates!

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:23.090
It lets me draw
another GOUKI from my deck

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.591
and add it to my hand.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.294
Then POWERLOAD
does its own thing!

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.764
For every Link Arrow
that my other GOUKIS have,

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:33.634
POWERLOAD gains
200 attack points!

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.570
I'll follow that up
with a spell!

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.841
GOUKI FACE TURN destroys
one of my GOUKIS.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.510
Like my GOUKI SUPREX here.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:44.845
But in exchange,

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.781
I get to resummon a GOUKI
from my graveyard.

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.016
Come on back!

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.451
THUNDER OGRE!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.852
(roars)

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:55.422
Now I can use
POWERLOAD OGRE's third ability!

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.991
By tributing a Link Monster

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.993
I get to destroy
a card on the field

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.995
for every link that it has!

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.330
(grunts)

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:06.666
I tribute my Link 3
GOUKI THUNDER OGRE!

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:11.171
So I can now
destroy three cards!

00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:13.974
Starting off with those
two paint splatters

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.175
you got there!

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.712
And I'll also tank
that facedown card!

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.680
(grunts)

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.150
(Gore)
Now all you got left
is that single DARK TEMPLAR.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.555
And it ain't strong enough
to survive my attack!

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:30.524
That can't be right!

00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.993
Oh wait, it can be
and it is right.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.427
That's right!

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.097
MASTER OGRE's choppin' down
your DARK TEMPLAR!

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:37.731
Huh!

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:43.537
(grunts)

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.077
You've got no monsters
left to protect ya!

00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.846
True but you don't have
to attack me, right?

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:54.047
Correct.

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:57.351
But I ain't the type
to show any mercy!

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.287
POWERLOAD!
End this duel!

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:08.295
POWERLOAD!
End this duel!

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.497
(grunts)

00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:15.636
Gore won!

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:16.803
Just incredible.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:20.540
What?

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:22.409
How?

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:25.145
You got smoke
and dust all over me.

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:26.747
So tell me, Gore,

00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:28.615
you paying for my dry cleaning?

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.219
How?

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.321
How do you have
any life points left, Ai?

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:37.290
Because I activated
the facedown card

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.626
that you destroyed
just a little bit ago.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.827
What?

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:43.830
(Ai)
My facedown card
was A.I.'S HYMN.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.000
And by banishing it
from my graveyard...

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.302
I regain 200 life points

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:51.138
for every @IGNISTER
that is in my graveyard.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:55.142
Since there are four
@IGNISTERS in my graveyard,

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:57.310
I regained 800 life points,

00:07:57.444 --> 00:08:01.314
which was just baaaarely enough
to keep me tick tock ticking.

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:05.018
Thanks for destroying
my trap card, Gore.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.487
Or I would've already lost.

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:08.955
(grunts)

00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:14.395
Ai's skills are greater
than I estimated.

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:17.030
I guess I gotta end my turn.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.466
And that means
MASTER OGRE's attack points

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.868
fall back down to 2800.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.004
Phew!

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:26.841
I really thought
you had me there, Gore.

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.377
But I'm glad to know
when push comes to shove,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.446
I can still count on you
to make the wrong call.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:34.814
My turn.

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:36.350
I draw!

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:40.054
I activate the spell card
A.I.DLE REBORN!

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:43.223
It revives an @IGNISTER
from my graveyard.

00:08:43.691 --> 00:08:45.292
Come back, DOSHIN!

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:49.963
Now use your ability!

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.001
By returning
DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER

00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:56.504
from my graveyard
to my Extra Deck,

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:59.706
I get to add A.I. LOVE FUSION
to my hand.

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:03.043
And then...
I play it immediately!

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.280
This spell card allows me
to Fusion Summon,

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.548
not just using my monsters,

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:11.284
but also by using
your Link Monster,

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:13.787
as long as it's Attribute
is Earth.

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.089
Huh.

00:09:15.189 --> 00:09:17.792
That sounds like a good plan
but that spell

00:09:17.892 --> 00:09:19.760
can't affect my POWERLOAD OGRE.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.795
That's not the one I'm eyeing...

00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:25.365
I fuse my DOSHIN
with your MASTER OGRE!

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.837
When tectonic plates collide,

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.239
mountains erupt
over the horizon!

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:34.441
I Fusion Summon!

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.177
EARTH GOLEM @IGNISTER!

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.785
You say EARTH GOLEM?

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:46.286
Yes, that's right.

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:48.555
It's in tribute
to my fallen friend.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.690
The one who'll end you!

00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:54.628
Since MASTER OGRE's
not on my field anymore

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:57.797
POWERLOAD OGRE loses
800 attack points.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.268
EARTH GOLEM @IGNISTER,

00:10:01.369 --> 00:10:04.237
it's s time to attack
POWERLOAD OGRE!

00:10:05.773 --> 00:10:07.708
And for extra sauce,

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:11.511
my EARTH GOLEM's attack points
are doubled during battle, Gore.

00:10:13.447 --> 00:10:15.682
That means I'm not gonna
survive this attack!

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.052
Oh so you did do the math.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:20.120
Wasn't sure that you could.

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:21.888
(grunts)

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:23.023
Now go!

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:23.957
Bolder Blast!

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:26.927
This how it's gonna end?

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.933
No way I'm goin' out like this!

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.436
By banishing GOUKI DIVER
from my graveyard,

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.673
I'm not gonna take
any damage from this battle!

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.442
But your POWERLOAD OGRE's
still destroyed.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.951
But I have a counter to that!

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:53.453
My DIVER's additional ability

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:56.289
lowers your GOLEM's
attack points by 600...

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.792
and forces it to attack again!

00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:03.263
So then you're
letting me attack again?

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.832
That means I'll win.

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:07.701
No, that's not
what it means, bub!

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:10.403
Because I can still
use my Skill, Ai!

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.907
Pain and Gain lets me resurrect

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:15.976
all of the GOUKIS that were
destroyed this turn!

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:19.312
So POWERLOAD OGRE's
back to fight!

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:20.614
So what.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.182
You can keep
bringing them back,

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.451
and I'll just keep
knocking them down.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.353
Go right on ahead!

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:27.654
I will.

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:28.688
EARTH GOLEM,

00:11:28.822 --> 00:11:31.125
go and attack POWERLOAD OGRE!

00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:32.859
And once again,

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.362
its attack points
double during battle!

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:40.201
Gore will take 600 points
of damage from this attack!

00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:42.436
Life points that he
can't afford to lose!

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.504
Go, EARTH GOLEM!

00:11:44.638 --> 00:11:45.639
Knock him out!

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:50.844
You fell right into my trap!

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:52.313
Say what?

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.515
I discard GOUKI DOUBLE IMPACT

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:57.684
to activate its ability!

00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:01.588
By showing ya the GOUKI HEADBATT
that I have in my hand,

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:04.592
POWERLOAD OGRE gains
its attack points.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:07.060
But you said POWERLOAD OGRE

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.663
is immune to all abilities
other than its own.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:11.699
That's not what I said.

00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:14.268
What I said was
POWERLOAD OGRE's immune

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.569
if it happened
to be Link Summoned.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:17.304
I see.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.406
You didn't Link Summon
this OGRE,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.174
you used your Skill.

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.676
That's right.

00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:25.679
So that means I can use
my DOUBLE IMPACT's ability

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:26.646
to power it up!

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:27.915
(grunts)

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.916
That one slight
detail tricked me!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.651
Looks like it.

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:34.688
GOUKI HEADBATT has
800 attack points.

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:38.225
So POWERLOAD OGRE
powers up to 3600!

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:40.994
That is not cool.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.198
Gore's monster
is 200 attack points

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.433
stronger than Ai's.

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:50.137
Which is the exact amount
of lfe point Ai has left.

00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:53.574
It seems you stole victory
from the jaws of defeat.

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:55.743
I had you bamboozled
from the start

00:12:55.843 --> 00:12:57.144
and caught ya in my trap!

00:12:57.244 --> 00:13:00.081
So I didn't steal this victory,
I earned it!

00:13:00.548 --> 00:13:02.149
But the thing about victories

00:13:02.283 --> 00:13:04.618
is that I can steal it
right back from you!

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.320
And once you loosen
your grip for a moment,

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.155
you've already dropped the ball.

00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:13.126
I activate A.I.DLE REBORN's
effect from my graveyard!

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.494
By banishing it along

00:13:14.595 --> 00:13:16.730
with the IGNISTER
A.I.LAND in my hand,

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.000
I get to retrieve TA.I. STRIKE
back from my graveyard.

00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:24.070
You used that to deal me
big time damage!

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.974
And I'm hitting the replay
button to do it again!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.143
TA.I. STRIKE changes
my monster's attack points

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:32.379
to become the same
as your monster's.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.647
So my EARTH GOLEM

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:35.983
and your OGRE become
equal in strength.

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:39.587
And if our monsters happen
to be destroyed in battle,

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.622
each of us are going
to take damage equal

00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:44.425
to our own monster's
original attack points.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.495
So that means we're
both gonna lose this duel.

00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:49.496
C'mon now, Gore, get real.

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:52.165
Do I look like the type
that's willing to take an L?

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.535
So listen up cause
here's the 411,

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:56.437
my tenderized tenderloin.

00:13:56.937 --> 00:14:00.141
Whenever I successfully
Fusion Summon EARTH GOLEM,

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:03.310
I can't take any damage
for the rest of the turn!

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:04.711
That can't
be right!

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:08.015
You're the only one who's going
to take damage from this battle

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:10.184
so not only do
I get the win,

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.853
but I also get
revenge for Earth.

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:13.787
Can't be.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.390
This was excellently executed.

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:20.327
Now pummel 'em, EARTH GOLEM!

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:21.861
Boulder Blast!

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.371
Aah!

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.543
I truly wish the outcome didn't
have to be this way, Gore,

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.045
I truly do.

00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:42.549
But I wish a lot of things
didn't have to be this way.

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:50.558
Oh no, Gore just got K.O'ed!

00:14:50.658 --> 00:14:53.159
Now Ai has a straight shot
towards Zaizen!

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.496
And you three are the only ones
left who can stop 'em!

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.300
We have no time to waste!

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:04.271
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!
Attack him directly!

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:10.076
VIOLET CHIMERA, go!

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.951
Attack!
BORRELSWORD DRAGON end this!

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:28.262
You may have beat us,
but we did our job.

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:30.397
You won't get there in time,
Playmaker.

00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:33.967
Let's hurry!

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:39.206
Uh...

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:42.410
So, you sure we're
in the right place?

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.610
Yes, I am.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.446
But I kinda
expected this.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.381
Do ya think they got scared
and logged out?

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.619
Maybe, but I really don't
believe that's the case.

00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:54.254
There's more places
to hide in the network

00:15:54.355 --> 00:15:56.556
than there are
out in the real world.

00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.225
Unless...

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:07.434
Unless it's a location
in the real world

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:09.103
that no one can get to.

00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:11.605
Too bad I'm not no one.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.940
I know where they're hiding.

00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:22.182
What gives?
No one's here.

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.353
This place is empty.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.522
Did they all vanish
into thin air?

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.424
I can't speak
for the Ignis,

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:33.794
but Zaizen and Blue Maiden
were never here to begin with.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.128
Say what?
They weren't?

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:38.965
They were digital holograms
sent from a secret location.

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:41.635
Then where's the real
Zaizen and Blue Maiden?

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.604
Somewhere safe where
no one can reach them.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.975
39000 feet in the air.

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:55.683
You mean an airplane?

00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:58.919
There's no place
more secure than 39000 feet

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.754
in the air above Den City.

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:03.423
I developed a special algorithm.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.093
It cuts Zazien
from all exterior networks,

00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:09.596
so the Ignis can't digitally
infiltrate the aircraft.

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:12.733
So there's no way the Ignis
can get to Zaizen.

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:15.168
Unless he boards
the airplane itself.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.238
And what program can
actually do that?

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:27.147
I found you, Zaizen.

00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:29.983
As the crew chief
on this flight,

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:33.187
I not only have to make sure
my future fiancé is safe,

00:17:33.253 --> 00:17:35.589
but that his every need
is taken care of!

00:17:35.723 --> 00:17:37.891
But I forgot if he prefers
pretzels or peanuts...

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:39.859
(loud noise)

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:41.328
What?

00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:42.329
(screams)

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:43.830
(grunts)

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:45.999
Report!
What was that?

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:47.901
(Staff)
The cargo hold
has been breached!

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.135
Intruders aboard!

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:51.838
What intruders?

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:53.206
(Ai)
Me.

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.911
Hey, you're the guy
who attacked the queen!

00:17:58.045 --> 00:17:59.246
How did you find us?

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:02.449
With just a lil'
bit of logic.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.418
(sighs)

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.421
When I hacked
into the airport database,

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:10.056
I learned that a plane
owned by SOL Technologies

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:11.825
took off a mere hour
before I launched

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.761
my attack against Zaizen.

00:18:14.128 --> 00:18:17.464
So I put two and two together
and here I am.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.808
I've been waiting
for you.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:30.443
Hey, you're the AI that
was in Gore's Duel Disk,

00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:32.279
except you're
a jumbo sized version.

00:18:32.646 --> 00:18:35.782
I am Pandor,
an AI created by Varis.

00:18:36.083 --> 00:18:39.119
Did you say Varis created an AI?

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.387
When I woke up this morning,

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.790
that is not
what I expected to hear.

00:18:43.257 --> 00:18:46.260
But hey, if I've changed,
he can change too.

00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:48.629
Speaking from one AI to another,

00:18:48.729 --> 00:18:49.296
why don't you--

00:18:49.396 --> 00:18:50.397
(grunts)

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:52.666
Hmmm.

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.202
Speaking from one AI to another

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:58.104
it is in your best interest
to leave immediately.

00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:02.142
Seems that Varis forgot
to program you with any manners.

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:04.645
Varis placed me here
to protect Zaizen,

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:06.280
and that is what I will do.

00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:09.717
Is there really nothing I can
say to change your mind?

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:12.019
Negative,
absolutely not.

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:14.121
Then it seems you're
giving me no choice

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:15.822
but to defeat you
in a duel.

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:18.659
I anticipated that this
would be your thinking.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.527
That is why
I have analyzed

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.696
every single piece
of data about you.

00:19:22.796 --> 00:19:25.466
So you're ready for anything
and everything, huh?

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:26.867
Then what are we waiting for?

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.269
Let's take this outside!

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.646
Be sure to enjoy the fresh
breeze while you can.

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:43.617
It's a long way down, Pandor,
and you don't have a parachute.

00:19:44.117 --> 00:19:46.220
I can say the same for you.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.988
(Both)
Time to duel!

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:49.956
I'll go first.

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.193
I summon PIKARI @IGNISTER!

00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:00.467
Its special ability allows me
to draw IGNISTER A.I.LAND.

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.703
I use PIKARI...

00:20:03.137 --> 00:20:06.039
to Link Summon
Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.379
Next, I activate
IGNISTER A.I.LAND!

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:14.715
It summons a Level 4
or lower @IGNISTER

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:16.116
that's in my hand.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.985
Here's ACHICHI @IGNISTER!

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.190
Your opening moves
are similar to what I observed

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.625
in your battle against Gore

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:27.060
so none of these moves
can catch me off guard.

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.964
Well if it ain't broke,
why fix it!

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:34.001
So I'll keep it rollin'
by summoning HIYARI @IGNISTER!

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.770
If I have a monster
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.471
which I most certainly do,

00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:43.143
I can summon this turquoisian
teardrop next to its link.

00:20:44.612 --> 00:20:46.680
Now I'll build my circuit!

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.350
The summoning conditions
require three Cyberse monsters!

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:56.223
Finally, it is time
to unleash a monster

00:20:56.357 --> 00:20:58.658
forged from the darkest
depths of the shadows,

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:02.429
striking fear to all who witness
its majestic might!

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:04.799
I Link Summon!

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:07.767
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:14.574
I expected you to summon that.

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:18.279
Then it's time for me
to throw you some curveballs.

00:21:18.412 --> 00:21:22.015
First, IGNISTER A.I.LAND
summons BURURU @IGNISTER.

00:21:23.284 --> 00:21:26.087
Then DARK TEMPLAR's
ability activates!

00:21:26.187 --> 00:21:28.789
Since I summoned a monster
next to its link,

00:21:28.889 --> 00:21:31.692
I can summon additional
monsters from my graveyard

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:33.560
next to its other arrows!

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.397
So HIYARI and ACHICHI
are back in play!

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:40.801
But they're not
sticking around for long

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:42.836
cuz I'm using them
to Link Summon again!

00:21:44.038 --> 00:21:45.505
Rise up from the flames!

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.176
Link 3 FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:58.886
Next, I activate the spell card
A.I. MINE from my hand!

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.657
For every @IGNISTER on my field
that's Link 3 or higher,

00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:05.325
I draw a card.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.662
Then I'll place these
two cards facedown

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:10.530
and end my turn.

00:22:11.198 --> 00:22:12.198
Hmmm.

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:14.034
What's wrong?

00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:15.736
You're not smiling anymore,

00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:20.006
which is good because this duel
was never a joke.

00:22:27.147 --> 00:22:32.152
