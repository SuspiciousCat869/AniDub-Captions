WEBVTT

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.442
You may think you're
doing the right thing

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.277
but you don't know
the whole story.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.483
(Roboppi)
Hey!

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.154
Whadaya say?
Wanna get going?

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.122
Before my arm falls off!

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.958
(Ai)
Well everyone... it's time.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.128
I'll do what needs to be done.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:31.831
(Yusaku)
Kolter.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.602
Hey, Yusaku,
what's up!

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.170
Grab a seat
why dontcha?

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.442
Thanks for mannin' the stand
while I was out yesterday.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.511
Of course, how's
your brother doing?

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:45.779
Great.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.448
After he regained consciousness,

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.649
his condition really
started to improve.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.419
The doctors said
that if things keep improving,

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:54.421
he might be able
to come home soon!

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.257
That's great news, Kolter.

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:57.290
Yeah.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.626
If anyone deserves a break,
it's my brother.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.195
Just when he
was starting

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.896
to recover from
the Lost Incident,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.399
Lightning had to straight up
hijack his mind

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.870
so that he could use him
as a pawn in a war against us.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.205
(Yusaku)
But when Lightning was defeated,

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.074
Jin was freed from his grasp.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.143
It's so hard
to imagine one person

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.712
having to live
through all of that.

00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:20.180
You said it.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.848
But despite everything,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:25.085
his heart stayed strong
and he never ever gave up.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.154
(Yusaku)
He finally has a chance
to move forward

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.990
without being haunted
by the ghosts of the past.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.559
And with your help,
I'm sure he will.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.695
Yup, cuz if anyone
deserves a brand new start,

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.230
it's definitely him!

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:38.599
Yeah.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:40.767
(Kolter)
So gotta ask,

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.168
have you heard from Ai?

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:43.737
Not yet.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.239
He told me that he needed
some time to himself.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.043
Now now,
no mopey faces.

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:51.077
You're gonna scare
the customers away!

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:53.013
You know Ai can take
care of himself.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.516
So why don't
I grill you up a dog

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.818
and turn that frown
upside down!

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:58.885
Sounds good.

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.757
(Man)
SOL Technologies brings you
the future with SOLtiS:

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:05.959
the world's first android
made just for you!

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:08.428
For the office, at play,

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:09.930
or even at home,

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:11.966
SOLtiS will take care
of your every need!

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.966
Yeah, right.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.368
I bet it can't grill
a mean dog like me!

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.444
♪♪♪

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:16.497
(Hayami)
Good news!

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.532
Our SOLtiS sales
are off the charts!

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.867
Everyone from small families

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.468
to large corporations
are buying!

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:22.936
Even my grandma
bought one

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.172
and she doesn't even know
how to operate a toaster!

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:28.042
That's good to hear,
every bit counts.

00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:30.143
Since we had to shut down
LINK VRAINS,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.547
SOL Technologies future
depends on its success.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.482
I believe our future's
in great hands

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.318
under your
stewardship...

00:03:37.385 --> 00:03:39.152
Executive Director!

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.554
Executive Director.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:41.989
I'm still not
used to that.

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:43.657
Well you deserve it!

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.459
#2 in charge
at SOL Tech,

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.727
which means your second
only to the Queen.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.330
After all,
you are the hero

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.200
who saved everyone trapped
inside LINK VRAINS!

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.102
I didn't do much of anything.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.471
Playmaker is the one that
deserves the credit.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.541
He is the real hero.

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.376
C'mon, don't be
so modest!

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:03.443
I've watched
the footage

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.612
of you sacrificing
yourself to save everyone,

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.180
many, many times!

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.683
Why it might even be
over a hundred times!

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.618
So what you're
saying, Hayami...

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:14.388
is you've watched me
get knocked unconscious

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.023
over a hundred times?

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.892
Well, I suppose
that's true, yes,

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.362
but that only goes
to show why you deserved

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.898
to be promoted
above all the rest!

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:25.399
I wonder what my grandma
would say

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.200
when I tell her
my future fiancée

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.536
is gonna run all
of SOL Tech someday!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.841
(Pigeon)
Hey boss,

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:35.909
ya ever wonder why Bohman
let us film his duels

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.445
instead of absorbin' us
like everybody else?

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.279
(Frog)
Let us?

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.048
He didn't let us do nuthin',

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:43.717
makin' us dodge
all his tornadoes and stuff!

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.285
But it was worth it

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.222
cuz it's the best footage
we got inside LINK VRAINS.

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.724
We're going to be
superstars I tell ya!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:52.693
Do superstars
get bonuses?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.560
You bet!

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.894
And not just bonuses,

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.096
they get promotions,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.465
and I'm angling
for Editor in Chief!

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:00.067
You deserve it,
boss!

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.335
And then I can be
your Vice Chief!

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.271
How dare you!

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.106
(grunts)

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:07.574
Uh, do I know you?!

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:11.011
Oh you know me all right
and now I know the real you!

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.847
I recognize that voice...

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:14.414
(Pigeon)
It's our boss!

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.017
That's right!
In the flesh!

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:17.451
Well, blue flesh
anyway.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:19.352
I've been watching you
two for this entire time!

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.621
(screaming)

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:23.790
And you are correct,
superstars do get bonuses!

00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:26.293
But people angling for my job...

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.260
do not!

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.628
Aah!

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:31.866
Oh no!

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.502
Our superstar status
just went supernova, Boss!

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.140
Everyone seems happy
with their new SOLtiS.

00:05:39.273 --> 00:05:40.106
They are.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.908
Emails are pouring in
thanking us

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.744
for helping
with their lives...

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.013
with a sprinkling
of complaints.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.482
Complaints?
Complaints about what?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.418
Well for some,

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.920
SOLtiS are better at their
own jobs than they are.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.090
They're kinda scared
that the SOLtiS

00:05:57.157 --> 00:06:00.227
are going to take
over the world from humanity.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.529
That again, huh?

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:05.665
That fear never seems
to go away, does it?

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.835
It's unfortunate
that no one knows

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.971
what Playmaker
was fighting for.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.341
What was it that he
was fighting for?

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.242
(Zaizen)
People are scared of AIs,

00:06:15.342 --> 00:06:18.244
so in turn,
AIs are scared of people.

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:20.414
When both sides
are scared, they fight.

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:23.216
But Playmaker saw
things differently.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.985
He knew that we could coexist

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.821
if we just stopped being
scared of one another.

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:29.890
And eventually
we will.

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.525
We just have
to be patient

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:33.594
because when a new
technology comes out,

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:35.362
people are scared
of it at first,

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:38.699
but soon think how they
could've ever lived without it!

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:41.969
Like how you seem scary
at first with your scowl,

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:45.005
but I now can't imagine
living a day without you.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.673
Live without me?

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.342
(gasps)

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.643
(chuckles)

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.380
(Woman)
What a day at sea.

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:54.148
Pass the shrimp.

00:06:54.215 --> 00:06:55.348
(Captain)
Madam Queen,

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:57.517
when I bought your company's
SOLtiS to work on my ship,

00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.319
I didn't know what to expect.

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.121
But what I certainly
didn't expect

00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.557
was that it would exceed
my expectations!

00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:05.225
I'm glad to hear it,
Captain,

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:07.928
but I must say that I never
had a doubt that they would.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:09.663
These androids are
at the cutting edge

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:10.998
of AI technology,

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.466
and their intelligence
is still rapidly improving.

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.535
Hope not too fast.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.738
Or they'll be steering this ship
across the seas instead of me.

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:21.976
(Roboppi)
Hey, I found a way
into their ship!

00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:24.145
Just like I told ya!
See!

00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.145
Androids!

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:26.780
That's how we
can sneak in!

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:45.065
All aboard,
Captain!

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.601
You've already
swabbed the deck?

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:49.637
Yep! Followed all
your orders to a T!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.573
I disabled any tech
that could trace us!

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.808
So there's no way anyone
knows we're onboard!

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.710
(laugs)
Nice.

00:07:57.243 --> 00:07:58.746
I can't believe
I'm on a boat!

00:07:58.812 --> 00:07:59.947
A real boat!

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.549
The last boat I saw was
floating in the bathtub.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.819
Yes, but this one is a tiny
bit bigger than that one.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:08.289
But don't you forget
that we're here on a mission.

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:09.489
So, don't get lost

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.192
and wander into a broom closet
or something.

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:14.829
So this boat comes
with broom closets too?

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:18.331
With like real brooms
and buckets and mops inside?

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:19.566
Are you super sure

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.301
we don't have time
to check it out?

00:08:21.368 --> 00:08:24.138
Because thanks to
SOL Technologies techsperts...

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.106
I now have this
awesome body

00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:30.110
to touch and grab
and feel everything!

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:34.181
Maybe we can find some time
to sightsee later on

00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:36.650
but for now,
we have a job to do.

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:52.999
This will be fun.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.303
(Ai)
Wakey wakey!

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:57.504
(gasps)

00:08:58.372 --> 00:08:59.973
Greetings, my Queen.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.075
Yeah, hi,
Your Highness!

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.543
Who are you?

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.544
(Ai)
Oh you know,

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:06.213
just a couple of programs

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.115
who've taken the liberty
of commandeering

00:09:08.215 --> 00:09:10.717
two of your SOLtiS
for a test drive.

00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:12.786
And I must say--

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:14.555
That's enough out of you.

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:17.090
I don't know who you are
or what you want

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.892
but I can tell you this much.

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:21.395
You've made a huge
mistake coming here!

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:22.229
No, Queen.

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:24.097
It's you who's
made the mistake.

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:24.865
Me?

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.100
What are you talking about?

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.402
A while ago,
your company acquired,

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.504
I mean, captured
an Ignis.

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.874
And while in your possession
your people disintegrated him.

00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:37.177
Under your
personal orders.

00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:39.379
So what?

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.582
That ignis was nothing
but a program.

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:42.849
(Ai)
Just a program?

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:43.851
Perhaps for you.

00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:45.853
But for me, Earth was my friend.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:46.720
Hmmm.

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:48.422
And I'm here
to get his revenge.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:50.791
And oh, not just
against you.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:53.126
But against your
whole company.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:54.261
(sighs)
You see,

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:57.898
as SOL Tech's top dog,
you hold all its secrets.

00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:00.067
Including the special code key

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.603
that gives you control
of SOL Tech's mainframe.

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:05.839
And I can't wait
to get my finger on it.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.042
Where am I?

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:09.843
(Ai)
Welcome to my world.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.512
The digital world.

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:13.546
A place where no one
can bother us

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.716
because I don't want
anyone interfering

00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:17.518
with our private
little duel date.

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:19.053
(Roboppi)
Ooooooh, a date?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.754
The one with smoochies
or the fruit?

00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:22.189
Ugh, no smoochies.

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:23.390
Right!

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:24.525
Enough!

00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:26.560
Let's get this over with now!

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:28.895
(Ai)
Are you mad?

00:10:29.396 --> 00:10:30.397
I think you're mad.

00:10:31.898 --> 00:10:33.266
But, very well.

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:36.036
(Both)
Time to duel!

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:51.118
I must admit,

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:53.554
you're playing quite
an impressive turn.

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:55.389
And I'm not done yet.

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.924
I will now rule my circuit!

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.495
I Link Summon!

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:04.297
Link 3 GOLDEN ALLURE QUEEN!

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:09.102
Then I activate
my Field Spell's effect!

00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:11.438
ALLURE PALACE increases

00:11:11.572 --> 00:11:15.809
GOLDEN ALLURE QUEEN's attack
and defense points by 500!

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.681
Next I activate
her special ability!

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.250
She gains the attack points
of the ALLURE QUEEN

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.751
that's next to her link!

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:30.524
5000 attack points, not bad.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.960
And while ALLURE PALACE
is in play,

00:11:33.027 --> 00:11:34.995
if you try to destroy
my ALLURE QUEEN

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:36.630
with an attack or an ability,

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.665
my QUEEN won't be destroyed.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.736
But I get to destroy
one of your monsters.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.104
I see...

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:47.408
(Queen)
But if you choose
to summon a monster anyway,

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:49.476
my other spell ALLURE DANCE

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.246
forces it to attack
my GOLDEN ALLURE QUEEN,

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.948
which is the strongest
monster in play.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.484
So is that some good news
or some bad news?

00:11:57.618 --> 00:11:59.452
Oh it's bad bad news.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.822
Well, you still
got this!

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.324
I'm not so certain
about that.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.760
The Queen here has
put me in quite the pickle!

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.195
Yay!

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:11.398
You're cheering
for the wrong side now!
The Queen's
gonna win!

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.066
Sorry!

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.534
With that I end my turn.

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.670
Let's see what you can do now.

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:20.007
But know that whatever
you try will never be enough.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.742
I cannot wait
to prove you wrong.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.044
Hmm.

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:26.080
I calculated the odds
of you winning

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.316
and let's just say
it doesn't look pretty.

00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.986
Then good thing this was
never a beauty contest.

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:33.854
It's my turn!

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:35.355
I draw!

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:36.991
First I activate...

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:39.393
This here IGNISTER A.I.LAND!

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.996
Since I currently
have no monsters

00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.564
in my Main Monster Zone

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:47.034
I can summon a Level 4
or lower @IGNISTER

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.401
directly from my hand.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.238
Come, PIKARI @IGNISTER!

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:55.242
And I'll use it
to create my circuit!

00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.713
I Link Summon!

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:02.249
Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:06.821
Since my Main Monster Zone's
empty again...

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.723
I can summon another @IGNISTER!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:10.590
BURURU!

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:12.058
And now

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.594
I summon DOYON @IGNISTER!

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.732
And I'll activate
its special ability

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.468
to add one @IGNISTER
in my graveyard...

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:23.437
to my hand!

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:27.574
I now have what I need
to create my circuit again!

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:31.312
The summoning conditions
require three Cyberses,

00:13:31.412 --> 00:13:33.748
including a Dark Attribute
monster!

00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:35.716
Finally, it is time...

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.251
to unleash a monster forged

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.253
from the darkest depths
of the shadows...

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:41.755
striking fear to all

00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:43.724
who witness its majestic might!

00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:46.126
So here it is,
the one, the only,

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:48.595
Sometime today
would great!
the awesome,
and awe-inspiring--

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:50.096
Alright fine!

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:51.932
I Link Summon!

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.571
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR
@IGNISTER!

00:14:03.944 --> 00:14:06.280
Oh yeah!
You got this now!

00:14:06.614 --> 00:14:07.681
And there's more!

00:14:07.815 --> 00:14:10.517
IGNISTER A.I.LAND
activates again

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:13.320
summoning another
@IGNISTER to my field:

00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:15.222
PIKARI @IGNISTER!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:19.025
And doing so triggers
DARK TEMPLAR's special ability!

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:23.196
Since I just summoned a monster
right next to its link,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.133
I'm now allowed
to resurrect my monsters

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.334
and summon them next

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:30.938
to my DARK TEMPLAR
@IGNISTER's other two links.

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:33.640
So welcome back
DOYON and BURURU!

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:36.277
But they won't
stick around for long.

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:40.046
Cuz Level 3 BURURU
tunes Level 4 DOYON!

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.723
When the gale mixes
with the cosmic beyond,

00:14:48.956 --> 00:14:52.726
the wings of the mighty
gallops across the heavens!

00:14:52.827 --> 00:14:54.494
I Synchro Summon!

00:14:55.295 --> 00:15:00.000
Level 7 WIND PEGASUS @IGNISTER!

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.205
I've never ever seen
that monster before!

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:07.240
Becuz I've
never played it.

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:10.344
And I have plenty more
surprises in store.

00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:11.879
Like this one.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:14.347
If BURURU is
one of the two monsters

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.016
I used to Synchro Summon,

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.519
I can resurrect
the second monster.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.121
So DOYON, rise again!

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:24.024
And watch this...

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.059
I'll use it to summon again.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:29.530
But this time I'll Xyz Summon!

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.765
With these two monsters

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.401
I will build
the Overlay Network!

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:44.845
The electric light travels
the expanse of the universe

00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:48.515
to manifest itself
in a roar of glory!

00:15:50.384 --> 00:15:52.719
I will now Xyz Summon!

00:15:52.853 --> 00:15:56.756
Rank 4 LIGHT DRAGON @IGNISTER!

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:17.645
Is that supposed to scare me?

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:21.415
All that razzle dazzle
for only 2300 attack points.

00:16:22.183 --> 00:16:25.752
My GOLDEN ALLURE QUEEN
has 5000 attack points.

00:16:27.121 --> 00:16:27.821
(giggles)

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:31.024
That's right, keep acting
as if you're not worried.

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:32.826
Oh, this is no act.

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:33.794
(gasps)

00:16:34.128 --> 00:16:36.930
(Ai)
Not when I have
my WIND PEGASUS' ability!

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:39.432
For every @IGNISTER
I have in play,

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.302
it can destroy
one of your spell or trap cards.

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:45.106
And I'm counting three of 'em,

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.674
so you can get rid
of all of Queen's cards!

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.276
WIND PEGASUS,

00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:52.245
destroy ALLURE PALACE
and ALLURE DANCE!

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:55.816
With them gone,
they're taking a big chunk

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:58.118
of ALLURE QUEENs'
attack points with 'em!

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:02.256
Yes, and it'll keep dropping

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:06.594
since ALLURE QUEEN LV7's attack
points have decreased by 500,

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.929
so does GOLDEN ALLURE QUEEN's.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.898
And now...

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.067
I'll activate my LIGHT DRAGON's
special ability!

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:17.037
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:19.573
for every @IGNISTER
I have in play,

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:22.175
it destroys
one of your monsters!

00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.178
That means all your
ALLURE QUEENS

00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:25.812
are losing
their crowns!

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:26.580
(Queen gasps)

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.649
(Ai)
Your reign is over!

00:17:28.716 --> 00:17:30.350
Bye bye!

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:35.523
No, this can't be
happening.

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:37.023
I had every advantage!

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.026
You had.
Past tense.

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:42.529
But this is the present.
WIND PEGASUS, attack!

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:46.700
Now...

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:49.002
One last attack
and you're finished.

00:17:49.303 --> 00:17:50.204
Actually,

00:17:50.337 --> 00:17:52.072
the only thing that
I'm finished with

00:17:52.172 --> 00:17:54.842
is losing to a badly
written piece of malware

00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:57.410
that got away
with a few lucky draws!

00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.846
But I'm rewriting the script.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.414
I play my Skill!

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:03.617
(Ai)
Hey!

00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.752
You're only allowed to use
Skills in Speed Duels!

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:08.923
I can do whatever I want,
whenever I want!

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:10.324
(Roboppi)
Including cheat?!

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:11.992
You have a problem
with that?!

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.093
(Roboppi)
No, ma'am!

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:17.297
When I activate my Skill,
Power Possession,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.467
if you attack me directly
and deal me damage,

00:18:20.601 --> 00:18:24.238
I regain those life points
as if you didn't do a thing.

00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:27.874
Then I also get to play
a trap card from my collection.

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:30.110
Even if it's not in my deck!

00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:32.312
I play DROWNING MIRROR FORCE!

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:36.483
Now, if you try
to attack me again

00:18:36.584 --> 00:18:38.585
my trap will send
all of your monsters

00:18:38.718 --> 00:18:40.554
straight back to your deck.

00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:42.589
Well now, that would be
a problem

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:45.058
if I didn't have
a problem solver.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:48.262
I activate Lingy's ability
from my graveyard!

00:18:48.596 --> 00:18:51.398
By tributing my
WIND PEGASUS @IGNISTER,

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.800
I can resummon Lingy
back to my field!

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:03.377
And I know you said
I shouldn't attack you, but...

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:03.877
Go!

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.646
LIGHT DRAGON @IGNISTER!

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.382
You arrogant fool!

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:10.016
I now activate

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.152
my trap DROWNING MIRROR FORCE!

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:14.821
I did warn you.

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:17.224
If you attack my
life points directly,

00:19:17.324 --> 00:19:19.894
all monsters on your field
return to your deck--

00:19:19.994 --> 00:19:22.162
Allow me to stop you
right there!

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:24.198
Whenever you
activate a trap card,

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.400
I can tribute
my good buddy Lingy

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:29.202
to negate that trap's effect
and banish it!

00:19:36.877 --> 00:19:39.312
(screaming)

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:43.617
And now, DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER,
finish her!

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:44.618
(growls)

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.654
(screaming)

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:48.889
(grunts)

00:19:51.125 --> 00:19:54.694
And with that, the Queen
has now lost her castle.

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:58.065
(Zaizen)
What?

00:19:58.165 --> 00:19:59.332
How could that happen?

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:02.502
I see.
I'm on my way.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.139
(Skye)
Is everything okay, Akira?

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:07.207
No, Skye, nothing is okay.

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:09.209
W-What happened?

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.945
(Zaizen)
Someone attacked the Queen.

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:11.678
(gasps)

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:13.047
I have to go
check it out.

00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:13.980
Don't wait up.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.124
How is she?

00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:26.293
The Queen's been asleep
ever since we found her,

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.661
and we can't
wake her up.

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.663
And how many know?

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.198
Not many.
It hasn't been easy

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.834
but so far we've been able
to keep things fairly quiet.

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:36.003
Even members of the media
onboard this ship

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:37.337
haven't caught wind
of this yet.

00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:39.840
Good. Let's try
and keep it that way.

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:42.476
Do you have any leads
on who the culprit is?

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.144
We know exactly who he is

00:20:44.278 --> 00:20:46.212
because he didn't try
to cover his tracks.

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:48.015
Show me at once.

00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:53.054
(Captain)
The culprit left a video message
directly addressed to you, sir.

00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.454
(Zaizen)
Addressed to me?

00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:55.956
Here it is.

00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:01.127
It can't be!
