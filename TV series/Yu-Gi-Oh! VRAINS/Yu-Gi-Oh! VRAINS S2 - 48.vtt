WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.605
Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:07.140
(laughs)
I'm finally going home!

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.142
Back to the Cyberse!

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.644
Hey everybody!

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.012
Your hero's home!

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:14.815
No!

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.350
It's all... destroyed.

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.021
But Queen I don't
see why you would want

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.457
to capture Playmaker
when he saved us all?

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:27.094
If Playmaker has an
Ignis, I want Playmaker.

00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:28.662
I'm putting you in charge

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.265
of my new bounty
hunter task force.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.499
Hey Kolter.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.634
(Kolter)
Yusaku, Jin was attacked!

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.634
He was attacked?

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.337
Yeah, and whoever or whatever

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:38.505
that thing is fled
into Link VRAINS!

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.741
I'm on it!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.409
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.746
(Kolter)
Look for some guy glowing
yellow,

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.482
flowin' like plasma,
like a sun or something.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.084
(Playmaker)
I'm not finding anyone.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.486
But I found you, Playmaker.

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:56.023
I don't know why SOL
Tech wants you so bad,

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.659
but then again, I don't care.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.529
They're after me because
they think I have an Ignis.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:02.396
(Ai laughs)

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.064
Ai, why are you here?

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.033
There he is!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.736
Firing my Data Storm!

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:11.138
Emergency log out initiated.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.873
(Ai)
Let's go get 'em

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:14.541
Let's Speed Duel!
Let's Speed Duel!

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.712
I activate the Link
Spell, Judgment Arrows.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.047
A Link Spell?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.549
I never heard
of that!

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.385
My second Flow Hydradrive
attacks you directly.

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:30.056
I'm back for a sec and I'm
gonna get glitched already?

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.060
♪♪♪

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.292
Hey, that fella down
there looks familiar.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.594
A bud of yours?

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.496
Bud? Hardly.

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:44.564
What gave you that impression?

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:47.868
If that was me down there, I
would've already won the duel.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:56.610
My second Flow Hydradrive
attacks you directly.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:02.116
(Playmaker growls)

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.050
I now use Linkuriboh!

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.688
By tributing it, I can
lower Flow Hydradrive's

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.358
attack points to zero
until the end of this turn!

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.993
(computer calculating)

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:14.828
(explosion pounds)

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.297
But now that Linkuriboh
is no longer here,

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:20.033
Elphase loses 300 attack points.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.336
(computer calculates)

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.972
I end my turn.

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:28.342
(computer calculates)

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.511
Whoa, nice work, Linky!

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.846
You spherical miracle!

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.650
We'll handle it from here,
so you can take a nap, 'kay?

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:38.152
Sweet dreams!

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:39.786
Who is this duelist?

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.189
And how does he have
cards from the Cyberse?

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.024
Don't ask me.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.692
I didn't give it to him.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.495
There's only one guy that can
fill out your questionnaire.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.564
That gasbag.

00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:53.833
Then it's imperative
that we capture him.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.170
Argh! They're getting away!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.306
Fly faster before we lose 'em

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.676
I'm already givin' every
ounce that I got Boss!

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:05.212
Then how can ya still talk?

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.447
I could just drop you...

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:07.381
What did you say?

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.415
Nothing!

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.583
(crowd chattering excitedly)

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.084
(Man)
This is gonna be great!

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:12.385
(Girl)
It's been so long!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.286
(Man)
It's so cool!

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.288
These folks may be
glad to see him back,

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.758
but I know that
where Playmaker goes,

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.092
trouble's sure to follow.

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:22.862
Playmaker!

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.566
♪♪♪

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:29.937
Chomp 'em up!

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.505
"Beary" that guy Playmaker!

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:32.339
I'm a tree.

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.607
Be careful.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.176
He may still have other
tricks up his sleeve.

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.946
If there is a sleeve
in that glow stick.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:40.513
I'm well aware, Ai.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:41.581
It's my turn!

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:47.020
I'll start by activating my
spell card One-Time Passcode.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:50.523
It allows me to summon a
Security Token in defense mode.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.562
And since I summoned it
next to Elphase's link,

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.765
Elphase gains 300 attack points.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.800
That'd usually be enough, but

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.670
against this thing, I
have another plan in mind.

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:06.140
I'm going to create my
circuit by setting both

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:10.310
my Elphase and my Security
Token in the Link Arrows!

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:13.280
(explosion roars)

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.517
I Link Summon.
Link 2 Cyberse Witch!

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.321
Since I used Elphase
to Link Summon,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.658
its special ability activates,
allowing me to resurrect

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.695
a Cyberse monster
from my graveyard.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.364
Rise up, Defcon Bird!

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:33.701
(computer calculates)

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:36.837
By summoning Defcon Bird
next to my Witch's link,

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.939
I've triggered her
special ability.

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.108
If I banish a spell
card from my field,

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.610
I can draw two new
cards from my deck.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:48.515
Therefore, I get rid of my
One-Time Passcode to draw!

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.018
And there's a second
part to this ability!

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:55.488
I can bring another Cyberse
monster back from my graveyard!

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.425
Rejoin the duel, Cyberse Wizard!

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.063
(computer calculates)

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:03.997
Yes!

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:07.201
Playmaker's brewing up trouble!

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.069
Now to try something new!

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.074
I activate... my Ritual
Spell Card, Cynet Ritual!

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:16.676
He has a Ritual Spell?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.481
I must tribute monsters
from my hand or my field whose

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.549
total Level
equals or exceeds

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:24.151
the monster I intend to summon,

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:26.687
so I tribute my Level 4 Cyberse
Wizard

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.822
and my Level 3 Defcon Bird!

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:34.094
Together, their
Levels add up to 7!

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.868
These two souls
offer their essence

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.804
to break the barriers of reality

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:47.207
and conjure the ultimate
sorcerer to this realm!

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.911
I Ritual Summon...
Cyberse Magician!

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.217
(Cyberse Magician growls)

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.253
Since when did Playmaker
get that monster?

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.655
You had time to beef
up your deck, huh?

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.623
Cuz you weren't
around to pester me.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.994
Cyberse Magician,
attack Flow Hydradrive!

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.800
And when he battles
a Link Monster,

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.302
he gains 1000 attack points!

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.905
(magic charges)

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.773
(computer calculates)

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.974
Oh no!

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.242
That's way more than
enough to wipe out

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.777
the rest of his life points!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.913
Stop this!

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:29.382
My Link Spell, Judgment
Arrows, activates.

00:07:30.884 --> 00:07:32.586
When a Link Monster that's
linked to this card battles,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.155
it's attack points are doubled.

00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:38.059
(computer calculates)

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:40.828
Your 2000 is still
less than our 3500,

00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:43.230
and I didn't even
need to use an abacus!

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:47.000
I activate the trap
card, Property Spray.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:49.570
I can tribute one of
my monsters to gain

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:52.072
life points equal to
its attack points.

00:07:52.106 --> 00:07:55.409
Since Flow Hydradrive
has 1000 attack points,

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:57.544
I gain 1000 life points.

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:02.516
Your monsters' Attributes
also become the same

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.318
as Flow Hydradrive's
until the end of the turn.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:08.054
So they transform
from Dark into Wind.

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.294
Why would he go and
change their Attributes?

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.029
And why do
ghosts say boo?

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:17.564
It doesn't matter,
just take 'em down!

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:19.066
Now Magician!

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.201
Cyber Magic Attack!

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.604
(Cyber Magician groans)

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:27.007
(explosion roars)

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.843
(groans)

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.146
(computer calculates)

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.680
Yeah!

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:37.684
You sure dimmed that
light bulb a few watts!

00:08:37.718 --> 00:08:40.387
(Bohman growls)

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:45.191
(Bohman screams)

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.229
Um, did we hit him that hard?

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.732
I think his mind is
as cracked as his abs.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:52.866
Who are you?

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.870
I, I am...

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:00.040
I don't know!

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.910
Who am I?

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:10.384
(Bohman)
You two there, do you know
who I am?

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.052
How should we know?

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:14.588
We asked who you were first!

00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:17.391
If you don't know who I am,

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:20.193
then why in the world
would you attack me?

00:09:20.227 --> 00:09:21.528
(Playmaker)
We didn't attack you!

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:23.063
You attacked us.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:25.633
(Ai)
And we're not just talkin'
about Kid Kolter.

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:28.101
I bet you're the one who
trashed the Cyberse too!

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.436
That's ridiculous!

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:32.006
What reason would I have
for doing such a thing?

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.341
You tell us!

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.043
Tell you what?

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.345
I don't even know
what I'm doing here!

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:40.180
I don't think that
we're getting anywhere.

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:43.950
(Ai)
Yeah, like runnin'
on a treadmill made of ice.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.886
(Bohman growls)

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.855
(Bohman)
Why can't I remember?

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:50.624
Bohman!

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.459
I know your mind's
in shambles

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:55.396
but... just do what
I say okay?

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.031
I'm hearing things.

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:59.934
about your communicator.
Or you just forgot

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:01.268
Who is this?

00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:03.270
Harlin, you know,
your little bro?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.606
Look, don't try to remember
everything at once,

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.607
just know that
every duel you win,

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:09.175
the more memories
you get back!

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.077
That's right.

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.247
Yes I remember now.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:18.552
I must win this duel in
order to regain my memories.

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.554
He seems different.

00:10:20.588 --> 00:10:22.189
It's all clear now.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:25.359
Winning this battle against
you is my only objective.

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:26.894
Let me see...

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.763
Those two have more than
double my life points,

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.733
but this isn't a deficit
that I can't overcome.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.601
Far from it!

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.270
(Ai)
Uh uh, you're not bouncin'
this house!

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.009
I never said that I was
running away from this duel.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.177
Since you destroyed
my Flow Hydradrive,

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.347
it's special ability activates,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.882
summoning a Hydradrive Token
in defense mode.

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:55.221
Next, I activate my trap
Hydradrive Generator.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.057
Since I summoned a
monster when I had

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.959
fewer life points than you,

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:01.828
I can summon another
Hydradrive Token.

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:07.634
Seems like he got over
his mental meltdown.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.138
It was like binge watching a
whole season of soap operas.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.607
You think he'll go
crackers again later?

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:15.742
There won't be a later
if I can bring this duel

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.944
to an end to as
quickly as possible.

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.681
Go Cyberse Witch! Attack!

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:23.283
Destroy his Hydradrive Token!

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:26.787
(Cyberse Witch screams)

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.190
With that, I end my
turn, so Cyberse Magician

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:34.127
and Cyberse Witch's Attributes
revert back to dark.

00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:35.596
It's my turn.

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:37.798
I draw.

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.466
I'm afraid you're
not the only one

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:41.501
who can Link Summon, Playmaker.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.339
The summoning condition
is one Hydradrive monster.

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:52.245
I Link Summon... Link 1
Coolant Hydradrive!

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:55.916
Hmm, that's an upgrade,
just not much of one.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.619
Since I summoned a monster,
my Hydradrive Generator

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:03.023
activates, summoning
another Hydradrive Token.

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:07.894
And I'll use it to
Link Summon... again!

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:12.499
Why have only one
Coolant Hydradrive,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.668
when I can have two!

00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:22.075
I follow that up with my
trap card, Property Spray!

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.180
By tributing one of my
Coolant Hydradrives,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.816
I not only gain life points
equal to its attack points

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:31.985
but I can also
change your monsters

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:34.388
from Dark to Water Attribute!

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.524
And this alteration
gives me the advantage.

00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:41.328
Because when there's a Water
Attribute monster on your field,

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.863
my Coolant Hydradrive
is permitted to attack

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:46.366
your life points
directly, Playmaker!

00:12:47.368 --> 00:12:49.670
Okay, that's a big upgrade!

00:12:49.703 --> 00:12:51.204
That's why I did it.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.308
And this next step
will be your end.

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.210
When Judgment Arrows is
linked to my Link Monster,

00:12:57.244 --> 00:12:59.579
it's attack points
double during battle!

00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:03.584
That'll kibosh
our life points!

00:13:03.584 --> 00:13:05.418
NG! NG!

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.455
Must you always
jump to panic mode?

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:09.757
It's not over yet.

00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:11.958
Cyberse Magician's
special ability cuts

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.793
the damage I take in half.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.830
(magic charges)

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:19.566
(magic charges)

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.869
(Playmaker groans)

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.406
Covered Hydradrive's
special ability activates!

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:27.641
When you take battle
damage, I'm permitted

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.276
to summon it from my hand.

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:33.747
Not only can't Covered
Hydradrive

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.915
be destroyed in
battle,

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:37.418
but I also don't take any
battle damage as long as

00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:41.722
I have another Hydradrive
on my field, which I do.

00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:44.491
In other words, I've
been able to create

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.660
an impenetrable barrier
that protects me

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.796
from any strategy that you
can possibly come up with.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:50.964
Is that so?

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:53.900
Then I can only
conclude that you

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.936
do not have much
of an imagination.

00:13:56.971 --> 00:13:58.572
(Bohman)
We shall see.

00:13:58.572 --> 00:14:01.508
I end my turn, so your
monsters revert back

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:03.377
to their original
Dark Attribute.

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:06.379
So I've analyzed
our odds of winning,

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:08.349
and I got good
news and bad news.

00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:09.684
Which do you wanna
hear first?

00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:10.717
Neither.
(Ai gasps)

00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:11.518
What?

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:12.652
Listen

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.522
Listen, whether the
odds are good or bad,

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:16.890
we just need to win this.

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:19.326
For Jin... and for Kolter.

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:26.666
Yusaku, I'm countin'
on ya,bud.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.102
It's now my turn!

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.674
I send one card in my
hand to the graveyard.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.678
By doing so Covered Hydradrive's
special ability activates,

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.013
limiting your offense
by only allowing you

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:43.017
to attack with one
monster this turn.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:43.951
Only one?

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:46.020
But he's blockin' with two!

00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.855
You got a card that can
help us break through?

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:50.957
I don't, at least not for now.

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:53.126
Oh, I getcha!

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.327
Here we go!

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:02.236

Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.288
A Data Storm!

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:24.858
Since I have less than
a thousand life points,

00:15:24.858 --> 00:15:28.128
I can use my Skill
to get a monster

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:31.097
from the Data Storm and
add it to my Extra Deck.

00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:33.533
(Playmaker groans)

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:35.035
Storm Access!

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.610
All right, this is it.

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:48.381
First, by banishing Elphase and
Dotscaper from my graveyard,

00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:53.921
I can summon Degrade
Buster from my hand.

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.457
(Degrade Buster growls)

00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:59.125
Then Dotscaper's special
ability activates.

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:01.428
Whenever this card
is banished

00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:03.363
It can summon itself
to my field.

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.768
And since Dotscaper
is a Level 1 monster,

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.070
I can tribute it to bring
Linkuriboh back

00:16:10.104 --> 00:16:11.672
from my graveyard!

00:16:11.672 --> 00:16:13.641
(Linkuriboh activates)

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:17.110
I follow that up with my
trap, Break and Reuse!

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:20.814
By destroying one Link
Monster on my field,

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:23.183
I can revive a monster
from my graveyard

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:25.852
with equal or fewer
attack points.

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:28.956
My Linkuriboh has
300 attack points

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:31.491
so I can replace it
with Defcon Bird!

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:35.462
And I'll use it... to
create my circuit!

00:16:36.864 --> 00:16:41.935
I set my Degrade Buster and
Defcon Bird in the Link Arrows!

00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:47.173
I Link Summon Link 2
Recovery Sorcerer!

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.846
Recovery Sorcerer's
special ability allows me

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:56.016
to resummon a monster that
was destroyed this turn.

00:16:57.685 --> 00:17:00.587
So I return Linkuriboh
to the game!

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:04.758
And you can use
Linky to Link Summon again!

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:08.028
I know, so that's
exactly what I'll do!

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.367
I set Linkuriboh and
Recovery Sorcerer

00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:16.303
in the Link Arrows
to create my circuit!

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:19.573

For every monster
it's linked to,

it gains one additional attack.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.371
Since it's linked
to two monsters,

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:56.210
Shootingcode Talker can
