WEBVTT

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:05.139
Huh?

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:06.339
Where am I?

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:08.241
Maybe I'm dreaming.

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.510
But if I was,

00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:13.146
why don't I see a panda riding
a unicorn riding a tricycle?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:13.747
(gate opens)

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:14.447
Huh?

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.456
No glitching way!

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.292
(laughs)

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:26.760
It can't be, it can't be,

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.262
it can't be, it can't be.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:28.995
It can't be.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:30.597
It is!

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.633
It's the Cyberse!

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.171
It's no dream.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:41.074
I'm home!

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:44.471
(Roboppi)
<i>Master.</i>

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.341
<i>Master, where are you?</i>

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.809
(Playmaker)
What's wrong, Roboppi?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.912
(Roboppi)
<i>The Master
is presently not present.</i>

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.846
Oh?

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.882
You mean, Ai's not
in the Duel Disk?

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:56.984
<i>Positive.</i>

00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.153
<i>Which is a negative for me.</i>

00:01:59.253 --> 00:01:59.887
You're right.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.656
No wonder, I thought
it was quiet around here.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.458
But where could he have gone?

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.933
<i>Roboppi has never been outside.</i>

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.069
<i>Roboppi's sensors
are overwhelmed!</i>

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:17.738
<i>Is that a tree?</i>

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:19.072
<i>It is a tree!</i>

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.374
<i>Ooh-ho.</i>

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:21.542
<i>Is that a bird?</i>

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:22.876
<i>It is a bird!</i>

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.411
<i>Nice, birdie!</i>

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.378
<i>Oh!</i>

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.113
<i>Oh?</i>

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:32.953
<i>Oh, are we buying hotdog
sandwiches?</i>

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:34.588
Not today.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.227
So, you're the world-famous
Roboppi.

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.494
It's nice
to finally meet you.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.264
Hi there, Roboppi.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.898
Are you my new best friend?

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:46.399
I hope you are!

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.901
<i>Squee!</i>

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.636
And do you know who I am?

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:50.237
<i>Yes.</i>

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.406
<i>Master told me all
about you, Kolter.</i>

00:02:52.473 --> 00:02:53.941
<i>You make sandwiches.</i>

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.809
I have so much to teach you.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:57.644
But for now...

00:02:58.612 --> 00:02:59.579
<i>Ooh!</i>

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:03.050
Hmmm.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.318
I can confirm that
there's nothing wrong

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.653
with your Duel Disk, bud.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:09.189
I thought Ai was locked
inside your Duel Disk

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.157
and couldn't leave.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.159
I guess he had a spare key.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.328
Anyway, Roboppi's memory cache

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.863
should point out the last thing
he and Ai were doing.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.066
And here it is.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.967
They were on this website.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:22.936
Hey, that's a crossword puzzle?

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.005
Why were they looking at this?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.608
<i>If you solve the puzzle,
you win a pin!</i>

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.310
<i>A one-of-a-kind ultra rare pin!</i>

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:32.012
What pin?

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:34.014
(Roboppi)
<i>That pin.</i>

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:37.851
I can definitely see why
that'd get his attention.

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.787
And he would be
the only one.

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:41.856
(Flame)
<i>My scans say that webpage</i>

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.457
<i>was created
using an Ignis algorithm.</i>

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.693
<i>Oh, Master?</i>

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.462
No, I'm not your master.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:49.696
I'm Flame.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:50.631
<i>Hello!</i>

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:51.698
<i>Wave emoji!</i>

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.367
Well, let's get cracking
and solve this thing.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:56.003
I already did that.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.205
And this square
doesn't belong.

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.640
(Kolter)
Okay. But now what?

00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:01.675
Do you have any ideas, Flame?

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.110
That blue strip

00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:05.879
has hidden text
written in my language.

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.382
"Care to share
what the message says"?

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:10.784
It's the address
to another site.

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.353
Here, I'll translate it for you.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.125
(computer beeps)

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:19.359
I found the page.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.198
It looks like a doorway.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.800
Maybe Ai went through it.

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:28.502
Hey, Kolter.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.337
Do you think that you'll be able
to teleport me

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:31.905
to this precise location?

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.174
Of course, that won't be
a problem.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:37.010
But the real problem is
this could be another trap.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.345
I doubt it.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:39.847
This algorithm is real.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.416
So only an Ignis
could have created it.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:43.050
So then,

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.284
Windy might've built it?

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:45.619
Or Maybe Earth?

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.588
Or it could even
be another Ignis?

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.056
Whoever it is, we have
to check it out

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.459
to see if the Ignis are trying
to contact us.

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.761
(Flame)
But they weren't trying
to contact us.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.764
They were trying
to contact Ai.

00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:57.764
In that case,

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.566
I will be going alone.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:00.433
(gasps)

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.136
I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.472
Ai is my responsibility
and not yours.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.774
And we also haven't completely
ruled out

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:09.309
that this isn't another trap.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.844
Nonsense!

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.913
Why would an Ignis
set a trap

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.581
for another Ignis?

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:16.016
It may not harm Ai,

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.085
but it may in fact harm
a human.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.687
Earth told us
that some Ignis still think

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:21.855
humans are the enemy.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.157
And that Ignis

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:24.691
could've created
this doorway.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.359
(grunts)

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.596
But if it'll ease your mind,

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.530
I'll log out if I run
into any trouble.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.766
♪♪♪

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.572
Here I go.

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:41.074
Hey!

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:42.075
Linky!

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:43.510
(indistinct language)

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.412
Uh, you okay?

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.080
You sound like you have a cold.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:50.083
Didn't I tell you to update
your antivirus?

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.451
(indistinct language)

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:52.919
Take me where?

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.123
Huh!

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:58.291
It's good to be back home.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.829
It's like a dream,
except better.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.497
Whoever said
you can't go home again

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:06.366
was just bad with directions.

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.670
Speakin a' directions,
where are you takin' me?

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:10.971
(indistinct language)

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:13.206
Beyond the set?

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:14.407
What do you mean?

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:15.976
What set?

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:19.246
Huh?

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:20.747
Oh?

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.318
Why's the tower missing
a back side?

00:06:28.823 --> 00:06:30.724
And the sky's got a hole!

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:34.061
Huh!

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:34.728
(knocks)

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.697
Everything here
is faker than fake!

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:38.832
Huh?

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:46.006
That's Windy's castle.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.742
I know he said he was rebuilding
the Cyberse,

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.978
but I didn't know
it'd be out of papier mache.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.647
Oh, geez, he bamboozled me.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.650
Well, no point staying home
if home isn't really home.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.051
Let's go, Linky.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:06:59.819
(indistinct language)

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:00.721
Huh?

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.323
I meant with me!

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.991
Huh. Maybe Windy
can get me a ride.

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.727
And I guess it can't hurt
to see what he's up to.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:09.896
Sure are a lot of stairs here.

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.068
Hello.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.073
Anybody home?

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.741
Windy?

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:25.378
Huh?

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:29.616
Hey, I remember you.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.884
You're Echo.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.087
I am who you remember as Echo.

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.323
Uh, yeah, that's what I said.

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.392
That is what you said.

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:41.127
That you do remember
that my name is Echo.

00:07:42.163 --> 00:07:44.231
Sorry to barge in
on this scintillating convo,

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:45.065
but hey there, Ai.

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:45.833
Windy!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.767
There you are!

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:48.102
Glad to see you got my message.

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:50.037
I was unsure you could solve
my crossword,

00:07:50.104 --> 00:07:50.704
but you must've

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:52.873
or you wouldn't be standing
there on your two feet.

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:55.743
Yup, it was piece of cake
for a brain like mine.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.377
So, where's my prize?

00:07:57.478 --> 00:07:58.579
My ultra rare pin?

00:07:58.746 --> 00:07:59.779
A pin? What pin?

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:00.814
Oh, that pin.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:01.482
There's no pin.

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:02.349
But I have something better.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:03.317
Look to your left!

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:05.652
After my previous prototype
was destroyed,

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:08.455
I got right back to rebuilding
the Cyberse and I'm doing it.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.890
I am doing it!

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:11.792
But maybe
I was kinda rushing it,

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:12.826
so I took a few liberties,

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:14.795
cut some corners,
a few shortcuts.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.696
Ahh, more than a few.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.464
Yeah.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:18.866
But I wanted ya to feel comfy

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:20.467
and at home for your meeting.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:21.302
Meeting?

00:08:21.402 --> 00:08:22.102
What meeting?

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.137
Oh, you know I hate meetings.

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:25.539
Well, you gotta deal
with this deal

00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:28.441
cuz someone really, really,
really, really wants to see you.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.879
Why did ya have to say it
all creepy like that?

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:33.314
I didn't.

00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.982
You did it again!

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:35.950
Calm down, calm down, Ai.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.117
No need to be on pins
and needles.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.785
It's somebody
you already know.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:39.553
I do?

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:40.287
Who?

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:41.521
(Lightning)
Me.

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:44.324
Oh! Huh?

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.330
Didn't you learn it's rude
to sneak up on folks?

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:53.967
My apologies.

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:56.703
But it is good to see
you again, my friend.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:57.838
Yeah.

00:08:58.005 --> 00:08:58.972
Same here.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.875
C'mon, hug it out!

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.542
You hug it out, Windy!

00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:03.577
Windy?

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.579
Why did you call him Windy?

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:06.346
Huh?

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:07.381
Oh, yeah!

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.716
Humans can't speak our language,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.118
so we have easier names
for them to use.

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:14.355
So if you wanna hang
with ‘em, Lightning,

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:15.289
you need one too.

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:16.357
Lightning?

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.193
Did you just try to slip
a name past me?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.194
You are welcome!

00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.563
Anyway, where've you been,
Lightning?

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:26.300
(Ai)
You couldn't hit me up
to tell me you're alive?

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.735
No, I couldn't risk it.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.238
You see,
after the Hanoi attacked,

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:33.874
the Cyberse, I was disturbed.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.409
Because they shouldn't
have been able

00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:37.878
to get past
the Cyberse's security systems

00:09:37.945 --> 00:09:39.180
in the first place.

00:09:39.213 --> 00:09:40.514
Then, how did they?

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.917
Because unbeknownst
to any of us,

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:45.852
someone shut down
the security system.

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:49.056
Whichever Ignis made
that mistake is gonna get fired.

00:09:49.189 --> 00:09:51.859
Unless, it wasn't a mistake
and it was intentional.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.760
You're saying one
of us is a traitor?

00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:55.896
It's a possibility.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.364
Well, it wasn't me!

00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:58.732
And to tell ya the truth,

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.701
I don't think any of us
would do that.

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.569
What about the Water Ignis? Hmm?

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:05.672
She did mysteriously vanish
from the Cyberse

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:07.908
moments before it was destroyed.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:10.845
And despite our repeated
attempts to contact her,

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.446
she hasn't responded.

00:10:12.513 --> 00:10:14.214
You're saying Aqua's
the traitor?

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.683
I didn't say it, you said it,
not me, you, you, you.

00:10:16.717 --> 00:10:18.852
C'mon, we're talking
about Aqua here.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.188
She's the nicest,
second only to me!

00:10:21.222 --> 00:10:22.857
You see, I was talki''
with Earth about her

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.557
the other day and--

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.091
Earth?

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.560
Oh, you mean
the Earth Ignis.

00:10:26.693 --> 00:10:28.028
Lil on the nose,
don't ya think?

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.697
That's what I told him too!

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:30.430
Hm!

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:32.365
Getting back on topic...

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:33.700
Oh, yeah.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.035
Accordin' to Earth,

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:36.870
Aqua predicted
that the Cyberse

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:38.338
would split in two.

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:41.008
So she knew the Cyberse
would be destroyed!

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:41.875
She admitted it!

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:43.410
No, she meant it

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.846
as in we'd start fighting
amongst ourselves.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.349
And it looks like
she was right.

00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:50.184
No, no, no,
it was not my intention

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.284
to cause disharmony.

00:10:51.952 --> 00:10:54.121
(Windy)
It's not a particular dark
spiral I want to dive into.

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.456
You or me, or we or she.

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:58.358
'Cause we didn't actually call
you here

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.459
to squabble about the past.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.662
We ring a ding a dinged you
to talk about the future!

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:03.997
A future that's bright like
a flashlight at midnight,

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:04.764
right?

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:06.132
That's right.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.901
Um, okay.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:09.103
So, what's up?

00:11:09.637 --> 00:11:13.273
(Lightning)
Windy and I intend to rebuild
the Cyberse.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.943
And not the makeshift set
that you traveled through,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.144
but for real,

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.079
exactly how it used to be.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.781
And we want you to help us.

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:33.693
Where are you, Ai?

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.597
Perhaps, this Data Storm
will lead me to him.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.485
You want me to help you rebuild
the Cyberse?

00:11:58.819 --> 00:11:59.487
Yes.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.589
The same Cyberse as before,

00:12:01.756 --> 00:12:03.056
with one difference.

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:04.992
We'll take precautions
to make sure

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:08.028
that the humans
can never destroy it again.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:08.762
How?

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.664
With a big “No Trespassing ”
sign?

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:11.699
No,

00:12:11.832 --> 00:12:14.201
by solving the core issue.

00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:15.969
You see, my friend,

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.205
the Ignis are far superior
to humans

00:12:18.305 --> 00:12:19.840
in every conceivable way.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.009
That is why they
are afraid of us.

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.377
They've been
the most advanced species

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:25.178
on this planet

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:26.179
for so long,

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:27.982
that they cannot comprehend

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:30.717
how it feels to be
in second place.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.986
They simply refuse
to accept

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.088
their new position.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:36.756
They do say second place
is the first loser.

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:40.193
But look at what
their superiority has led to.

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:43.163
They're consuming
themselves

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.165
in wars and famine.

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:48.502
Dr. Kogami created us

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:51.238
to solve
the world's problems.

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:54.174
But in the end, he thought
we were the problem.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.075
Yes.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.744
Sad, isn't it?

00:12:57.144 --> 00:12:58.646
Since he saw us as a threat,

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.414
he decided to eliminate us.

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:03.116
But it's time to flip the script
on their playbook.

00:13:03.717 --> 00:13:04.451
That's right.

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:07.387
We have decided to
eliminate the humans

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.156
so that they cannot
threaten us.

00:13:09.423 --> 00:13:11.491
When you say eliminate...

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:13.660
I mean eliminate them
permanently.

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:16.463
Are you serious?

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.098
Why wouldn't I be?

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:19.233
I don't know.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.934
Maybe it's a tad extreme?

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:22.703
I don't think so.

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:25.038
If the humans no longer exist,

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:27.207
they cannot attack the Cyberse.

00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:31.044
And our safety
will be 100% guaranteed.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:32.579
It's simple logic.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:34.448
No more hiding
from their seeking

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:35.216
is what he's speaking

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:36.750
and I see no drawbacks
to this plan.

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:38.152
None. No downsides at all.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:40.120
Except for the extinction

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.655
of all of humanity!

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:44.558
Like I said, no downsides.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:45.292
Ah!

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.329
Ai, I cannot help,
but to sense your reluctance.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.297
Uh, yeah!

00:13:51.098 --> 00:13:52.899
'Cause you made me think
we were rebuilding the Cyberse.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.803
But you're actually talkin'
about destructin' humans!

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.037
(Ai)
Just like with the pin,

00:13:57.104 --> 00:13:58.639
you bait-and-switched me again!

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:01.942
Like buying a 99 cent donut
with $80 shipping!

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.143
Must be some donut.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.179
Don't you glaze
over my argument!

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:06.280
We're not.

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.848
We're just simply trying
to understand

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:09.950
your point of view.

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:12.619
Humans want to destroy us,

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.456
so we want to destroy
the humans.

00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:16.791
It's nice and clean.

00:14:17.158 --> 00:14:19.193
What other possible solution
is there?

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.561
How about not fighting
each other at all!

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:23.730
You know, trying to live
together in peace?

00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:25.132
Like me and Playmaker.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:26.733
Sure we got our ups and downs,

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:27.702
mostly downs.

00:14:27.768 --> 00:14:28.702
But it's working out,

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:29.436
mostly.

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:31.938
You mean coexistence?

00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:35.009
While that sounds plausible,
it's impossible.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:38.778
Even your coexistence
with Playmaker will not last.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.216
You've spent too much time
with the humans

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:43.884
that it's clouded your mind.

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:46.520
I've run simulations
on you two,

00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:49.790
and every outcome ends in ruin.

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:51.825
But how could it not?

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:54.127
Let's look at the facts,
shall we?

00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:55.963
(Lightning)
When you two first met,

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:57.797
didn't he imprison you?

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.232
And when you saved his life,

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:01.368
was there even a simple
thank you?

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:04.738
Can you honestly say
you're happier with him

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:06.006
than with us?

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.575
(Playmaker)
Why does he have to choose?

00:15:10.044 --> 00:15:11.245
Playmaker!

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:12.712
You're here!

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.382
We meet again, Windy.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.551
Hello, Playmaker!

00:15:17.618 --> 00:15:19.419
Allow me to introduce
our leader, Lightning.

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:20.221
Lightning, Playmaker.

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:20.921
Playmaker, Lightning.

00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:23.023
So you're the Light Ignis.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.092
Indeed I am.

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.194
Playmaker, one question,

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.796
one comment and a question.

00:15:28.896 --> 00:15:31.599
It's not polite to eavesdrop,
but how much did you overhear?

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:33.433
Not all, but enough.

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.836
Especially the part about
how you intend

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.438
to eradicate mankind.

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:38.672
(Windy)
No, no, no.

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.508
No, to be fair, you did omit
some other crucial details

00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:42.342
in our tete-a-tete.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.678
But in general,
Playmaker is correct.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.213
Our existence

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.783
depends on your nonexistence.

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:51.685
You know that I cannot allow
that to happen.

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:53.520
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, we do.

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:54.555
But let me ask you.

00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:55.289
What do you think

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:57.457
you can actually do
to stop us?

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.094
Is that because you think
the Ignis are superior

00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:01.194
to us humans?

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:02.263
No,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.532
because we know we're superior
to you humans.

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:07.567
Our takeover is simply...

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:08.935
inevitable.

00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:10.971
You may be right, Lightning.

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.441
Ahhh, so you do understand.

00:16:14.775 --> 00:16:17.110
I always knew I liked you,
Playmaker, I always did.

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.513
But you didn't let me finish,
you also may be wrong.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.150
And you'll be starting a war
for no special reason,

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.953
not only putting every human's
life at risk,

00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:27.587
but your lives as well.

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:30.490
And I cannot allow that
to happen

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.125
for both of our sakes.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:34.595
Because I believe
that this world is big enough

00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:35.596
for all of us,

00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:37.431
both humans and Ignis,

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.266
to live together in harmony.

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.669
Tell that
to SOL Tech's bounty hunters

00:16:41.735 --> 00:16:43.003
who are trying to delete us.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.572
Tell that to the Knights
of Hanoi

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:45.739
who are trying to frag us.

00:16:45.806 --> 00:16:47.408
Just tell, tell, tell,
tell, tell,

00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:49.676
but it'll fall on deaf, deaf,
deaf, deaf ears.

00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:52.613
I always knew I didn't like you,
Playmaker, I always didn't.

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:54.948
It's never too late
to change your mind.

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:58.252
I agree, but my mind
doesn't need changing.

00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:01.554
Because while you live in
an idealistic dream,

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:03.057
we live in reality.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:05.926
(Lightning)
Ai, it's time to make
a decision.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:07.727
Which side will you join?

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:08.896
Ours?

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.563
Well...

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.697
(Lightning)
Or theirs?

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:11.498
Uh...

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:13.333
It's gonna be weird to say this,

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.835
but Playmaker's right.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.504
There's no us against them
or them against us.

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:20.207
It's like a rubber ball,
there are no sides!

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:22.243
And you can't force me
to choose,

00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:23.744
so the only decision I'm makin'

00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:24.912
is gettin' outta here.

00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:26.413
Let's go, Playmaker.

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:27.681
Well, well, well.

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:29.550
He may say that
he chose no sides,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.017
but he did choose a side.

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:32.752
He did, he did, he so did.

00:17:33.087 --> 00:17:33.821
Yes.

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.922
And the one that I expected.

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:37.557
Later, agitators.

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:39.559
So we're just gonna
let him leave?

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:40.660
Of course not.

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:41.561
(laughs)

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:49.402
(Ai)
Whoa!

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:50.470
(Ai shouts)

00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:51.972
(explosion)

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:04.251
They trapped us!

00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:05.318
Hey!

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.454
What's the big idea?
(electrocutes)

00:18:08.889 --> 00:18:10.891
(Lightning)
You know we can't allow you
to leave

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.059
after you've heard
our master plan.

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.161
(Windy)
Can't have leaks.

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:15.496
They say hindsight's 20/20,

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:16.597
but he's not wearing glasses

00:18:16.931 --> 00:18:18.932
'cause he really should've
joined our side, but no.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.036
How unfortunate
that one wrong choice

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:23.937
would cost him everything.

00:18:24.371 --> 00:18:26.773
Let me out!

00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:28.241
Sure!

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.718
A Data Storm?

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:40.320
Why'd ya conjure that up?

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.756
To break that barrier.

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:43.957
Except in teeny
tiny pieces.

00:18:44.057 --> 00:18:44.591
What?

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:47.727
You're actually willing
to destroy your own kind?

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:48.395
Yeah!

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.564
It's not kind to destroy
your own kind!

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:52.165
It's actually kinda rude!

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:53.400
(Lightning)
Don't worry, Ai.

00:18:53.467 --> 00:18:55.102
We'll make sure
your sacrifice

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:56.236
won't go to waste.

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:57.905
We'll integrate your code

00:18:57.972 --> 00:18:59.540
into ourselves.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.675
I like my code right
where it is,

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:02.709
inside me!

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:03.343
Lightning!

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.378
Of all Ignis,

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:04.778
you're the one

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:06.279
who claims to think logically,

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:07.782
but you're not in this case!

00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:09.649
Then please share,
my friend.

00:19:09.783 --> 00:19:11.618
I am not above
being convinced

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.320
by a logical argument.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.055
Okay, so hear me out.

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:16.790
We're an endangered species.

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:18.459
(Ai)
There's only six of us Ignis,

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:19.960
maybe five without Aqua!

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.162
So even losing one of us,
as in me,

00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:23.463
is a huge blow!

00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:24.631
I see.

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.166
When you look at it
that way,

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:27.768
that is tragic.

00:19:28.302 --> 00:19:30.270
But when you look
at it another way,

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:31.539
as one in six,

00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:34.341
you represent 17%
of our species.

00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:35.776
If your loss would guarantee

00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:38.446
the survivability
of the remaining 83%,

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:40.847
it seems to be
an acceptable loss

00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:41.949
for the greater good.

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:43.950
If five by six
is squared to five,

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:44.785
count to three...

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:46.653
Playmaker,
is that math correct?

00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:47.888
It is, Ai.

00:19:48.122 --> 00:19:49.824
That's right.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.625
Well, it shouldn't be!

00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:53.560
Though I don't believe
in destiny,

00:19:53.627 --> 00:19:55.662
it's time you accept
your fate.

00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:56.497
Don't worry, Ai.

00:19:56.797 --> 00:19:57.631
This will be swift
and painless.

00:19:57.698 --> 00:19:58.466
Or I think it's painless.

00:19:58.532 --> 00:19:59.199
I don't actually know.

00:19:59.299 --> 00:19:59.966
I haven't undertaken

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.301
the slice
and dice process.

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:04.771
Well, I'll whip up a Data Storm
to blow away yours!

00:20:04.838 --> 00:20:06.273
You think you can outstorm me?

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.608
I don't know
if I should feel offended

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:08.275
or offended.

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.877
But sure, feel free to try.

00:20:10.977 --> 00:20:11.978
If I were in your position,

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.314
I'd rather do something
more fruitful,

00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:14.948
like write up a will,
but you do you.

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.819
(grunts)

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:20.854
Oh, and I forgot to tell you
that these winds?

00:20:20.954 --> 00:20:23.790
I wasn't even trying,
like I will now.

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:27.060
Oh, glitch!

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:29.362
(both)
Huh?

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.466
(explosion)

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:34.367
(shouts and grunts)

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:35.302
(screams)

00:20:45.446 --> 00:20:46.447
You.

00:20:46.947 --> 00:20:48.616
They said you were gone,
but I knew you weren't.

00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:51.017
Because evil never dies!

00:20:51.352 --> 00:20:51.851
Huh!

00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:54.287
(Playmaker)
Varis!

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.323
Huh?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.526
I think things just got
a lil more complicated.

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.031
(Varis)
I found you.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.268
(explosion)

00:21:07.368 --> 00:21:08.735
(building collapses)

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.179
(Varis)
And you should know,

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.514
I'm not the only one here.

00:21:24.452 --> 00:21:24.851
Heh.

00:21:25.518 --> 00:21:26.553
What's so funny?

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.589
I was just thinking
how you spent your whole lives

00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:30.857
trying to hide from me.

00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:33.693
But in the end,
it was all for naught!

00:21:33.927 --> 00:21:35.696
And now at my hands,

00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:38.965
your very existence is coming
to an end.
