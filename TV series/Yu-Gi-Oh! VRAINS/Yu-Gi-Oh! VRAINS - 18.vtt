Zaizen, Ghost Gal,

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.384
now I understand
why you're here.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.686
To stop me
from getting access.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:08.355
Well, I can't speak for
suit-and-tie over here,

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:09.790
but that's not my bag.

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:11.792
I'm after
the data too.

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.460
And you were a great diversion

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.630
so I could break into this
very-hard-to-break-into place.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.065
I see.

00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:19.466
So you used me.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.668
Figures.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.769
To be honest,
I'm not that surprised.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:26.339
I'm surprised you're so easy
to dupe like a videotape,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.942
except they don't
make 'em anymore.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.143
You even know what
I'm taking about, juvie?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.847
Y'know, I bet you even lost
against us on purpose!

00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:34.181
Not true.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.282
Had I won
that duel,

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.617
I would've won you,

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:40.388
Gaining access to this place
was the consolation prize.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.955
But a pretty great one.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.324
So, really, whatever
the outcome of our duel,

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.026

just fine.

Uh-huh.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.867
Well, it doesn't.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.703
So there's
no convincing you?

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.004
Obviously not.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:59.106
That is why
I'm standing here.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:01.842
If you won't voluntarily
step to the side,

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.543
then I'll go through you!

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.446
Hmm, that is certainly
one option...

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:09.182
but do ask
yourself this, Playmaker:

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.452
Shouldn't some truths
remain buried?

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:14.054
Before you arrived,
I accessed the databank

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:17.091
<i>and learned what happened
to you ten years ago.</i>

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:19.693
<i>Reliving that tragedy
isn't good for you.</i>

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.195
<i>So let me bring the Hanoi</i>

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:23.364
<i>and those at SOL Tech
to justice.</i>

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:24.632
It's true?

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:27.567
Then Varis wasn't lying about
SOL Tech's involvement?

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.236
SOL Tech?

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.437
What did we do?

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:32.272
What's he mean?

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:34.508
(Kitamura)
Whatever they're discussing
sounds important.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:38.412
Knowledge is power, and I'm not
sharing it with these dimwits.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.181
Patch this footage directly
to my office!

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:43.183
And make sure
it's a private channel!

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:45.552
And as for all of you
lot in here,

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.522
how rude of you
to eavesdrop on a conversation!

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:49.723
You're all fired!

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.024
So with this makes it

00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:53.694
how many times has
he fired everyone today?

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.195
Nine.

00:05:08.776 --> 00:05:10.511
I'll handle
my own problems.

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:12.179
Step aside.

00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:13.847
I will not.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.149
(Ai)
Didn't your mama
ever teach you to share?

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.919
Don't hog all the info for
yourself, ya swiny pig!

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.089
(Zaizen)
How ignominiously eloquent.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:25.092
How dare you call me
an ignoramus elephant!

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.027
Come on, you're gonna
make Playmaker cry,

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:29.496
and you don't wanna see
those salty secretions.

00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:31.865
So stop being rude,
you big bully!

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.634
Didn't your programmer teach
you that it's rude to point?

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:36.136
Oh...

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.439
There's no getting
through to him, Playmaker.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.073
It's like talking
to a wall--

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.409
if the wall
had less heart.

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.344
Now <i>that's</i> rude.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.846
Akira's all heart.

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:48.248
He even gave up his
career to save his sister.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:49.917
So you should watch
your words

00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:52.453
because Akira has
nothing left to lose.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.422
And there's no one more
dangerous than that.

00:05:54.488 --> 00:05:56.256
Actually you're wrong.

00:05:56.323 --> 00:05:58.959
I'm more dangerous
for three reasons.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.495
One: my deck is constructed

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:03.764
to defeat
any and all challengers.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.900
Two: my skills are
razor sharp.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.137
And three:
I'm dueling with a purpose.

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.806
And you're now getting
in the way of that purpose.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.542
I see.

00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:15.909
Let me be clear.

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.311
I'm willing to risk everything
to get what I want.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.980
And that even includes...

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.082
putting Ai on the line
and up for grabs.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:23.316
Yeah-- wait!
What?!

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.053
But if I win, I get direct
access to the databank.

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.256
Very well.

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:32.759
If it's the only way
to break our stalemate...

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:33.994
so be it!

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.330
We'll let our cards
decide the matter!

00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:37.598
I'll agree to that.

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.933
Let the records show
I never did!

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:45.372
(Ghost Gal)
Playmaker's about
to face a world of hurt.

00:06:45.472 --> 00:06:47.140
Akira rarely duels,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.810
but when he does,
he never loses.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.748
Yusaku, take this three-piece
suit to the cleaners.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:55.015
Okay!

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:56.149
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.254
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.293
I'll start things off
by playing this.

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:08.295
A monster facedown.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.799
And then I also summon
Tindangle Base Gardna

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.868
to the field
in defense mode.

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:17.237
What in the name
of nanobytes?!

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:19.773
How'd he summon
two monsters in one turn?

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.809
<i>(AI)
You must not have
the latest patch.</i>

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.477
<i>He can summon it when
a facedown monster</i>

00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:24.945
<i>is on his field.</i>

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:27.414
(Ai)
Didn't ask you, CPU!

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.450
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.786
Two monsters
in defense mode, huh?

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:33.921
Yeesh.

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.390
That barricade is as stiff
as his collar.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:40.060
No matter how tough it looks,
no defense is impregnable.

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:42.829
And I'll find...
it's weakness!

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:46.901
First, I discard
Stack Reviver from my hand

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.035
to summon Bitrooper!

00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:51.738
And just like you,
Zaizen,

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.940
I'll also summon
a second monster

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.909
to my field this turn!

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.744
Cyberse Gadget!

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.950
And while you stopped
at two monsters, I won't!

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.353
When I successfully summon
Cyberse Gadget,

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:09.456
I can revive a monster
from my graveyard!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.158
Take to the field,
Stack Reviver!

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:13.694
Clever.

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:16.897
And with these three,
now I'll Link Summon!

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:20.300
I set Bitrooper,
Cyberse Gadget

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:23.537
and Stack Reviver
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:28.775
Link the circuit!

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:36.283
I Link Summon
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:46.394
(Ai)
Oh yeah!

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.995
That sword's gonna
cut through his defense

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.997
like it's a soft cheese!

00:08:50.064 --> 00:08:51.698
I'm not done!

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:54.134
I activate Cyberse Gadget's
special ability

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.669
from my graveyard!

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:58.171
It summons a Gadget Token
to my field!

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.280
And since I also used
Stack Reviver to Link Summon,

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:08.081
I can revive
a Cyberse monster

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:10.350
from my graveyard
in defense mode!

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:14.521
So, Cyberse Gadget,
come back to the duel!

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.394
Cyberse Gadget's
return activates

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.263
Decode Talker's ability!

00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:24.130
It gains
500 attack points

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:26.066
for every monster
it's linked to!

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.534
And since it's linked to two,

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.003
it gains
1,000 attack points!

00:09:30.037 --> 00:09:31.738
And that makes our
Decode Talker

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.442
stronger than your
Tindangle Base Gardna!

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.077
I don't see how you're gonna
get outta this!

00:09:37.177 --> 00:09:38.612
(Zaizen)
Then you must be blind.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.347
(gasping)

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.683
I activate my Base Gardna's
special ability.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:46.620
<i>(AI)
When a monster is summoned next
to a Link Monster's link,</i>

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.722
<i>you can tribute
Tindangle Base Gardna</i>

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.625
<i>to summon a new Tindangle
from your hand.</i>

00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:56.096
Aww, glitch!

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.065
Glitch indeed.

00:09:58.132 --> 00:10:00.734
I shall summon
Tindangle Hound!

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:12.746
(roaring)

00:10:12.846 --> 00:10:14.081
(gasping)

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:16.183
Wait, that's all
yip and yap!

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.686
Decode Talker still
has higher attack points!

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:20.187
Yes, for now.

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.789
But all of that
is about to change!

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:25.225
Tindangle Hound, roar!

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.794
<i>(AI)
Its special ability lowers</i>

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:29.196
<i>your monsters'
attack points by 1,000</i>

00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:31.565
<i>for every monster
it's linked to.</i>

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:35.669
Aww, woof.

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:38.539
I can still recover.

00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.574
No you won't,
Playmaker.

00:10:40.675 --> 00:10:42.409
I activate my trap!

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:44.011
Lemoine Point!

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:46.213
As long as I have
a Tindangle on my field,

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.049
your monsters can't attack
any of my facedown monsters

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:50.784
when they're
in defense mode.

00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:53.020
That means we can only
attack your Hound?

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.589
But it's stronger
than our monsters!

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.725
That's... the point!

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.864
Well, attack me.

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:06.633
If you want your monsters
to self-destruct that is.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.937
Actually, my monsters
have other plans, Zaizen.

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.677
You're Link Summoning
again?

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:19.346
I set Cyberse Gadget
and my Gadget Token

00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:21.781
to create
the ultimate circuit!

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:26.754
I Link Summon

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.923
Link 2 Flame Administrator!

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:33.527
1,200 attack points?

00:11:33.594 --> 00:11:36.330
That monster's weaker
than Decode Talker.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.131
Or so you think.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.367
When Flame Administrator
is in play,

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:42.736
every Link Monster
on my field gains

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.438
800 attack points.

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:45.639
It ain't calculus,

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:47.308
but there's a whole lot
of calculatin'

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:48.743
goin' on here!

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.745
Your special ability
lowers attack points

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:52.446
while ours raise them!

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:53.913
So, can you
do the math?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.851
You look like a guy who still
works with a calculator--

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:58.919
or even a slide rule!

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.687
Or you can just have
the computer do it for ya,

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.522
ya lazy bum!

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:03.657
(sighing)

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.160
The end result, Zaizen,
is that my Decode Talker

00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:08.496
is stronger than your
Tindangle Hound!

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:09.496
Attack!

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:22.242
Yeah, that was
beautiful!

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:23.343
Akira...

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.481
(Ai)
And with your
pooch in the pound,

00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:30.350
our monsters are back
to full strength!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.652
Yes...

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.987
but my Hound has
a second ability!

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:35.656
When it's sent
to the graveyard,

00:12:35.723 --> 00:12:36.657
I'm allowed to flip

00:12:36.724 --> 00:12:39.593
one of my facedown
monsters face up!

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:43.697
Take to the field,
Tindangle Angel!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.137
Her special ability
now activates!

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:53.073
<i>(AI)
When Tindangle Angel
is flipped face up,</i>

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.576
<i>she summons a monster
from the graveyard facedown</i>

00:12:55.643 --> 00:12:57.378
<i>in defense mode.</i>

00:12:57.478 --> 00:12:59.713
You can't get rid of my
Hound that easily!

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:02.316
Because it's
back on the field!

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:06.453
And I thought it was just
cats that had extra lives!

00:13:06.553 --> 00:13:09.490
And you're no longer
allowed to attack this turn.

00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:11.325
I've shut you down.

00:13:11.392 --> 00:13:14.161
Aww, snap,
he snipped our attack!

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:15.996
Then I'll end my turn...

00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:17.965
by placing this
card facedown.

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.400
Remember how you said
every defense has a flaw,

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.869
so you'll find a way
to break it?

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.905
Well, I'm still waiting!

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:27.540
It's a shame you were never
programmed with patience.

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:28.909
With every move,

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.244
I learn a little more
about his strategies.

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:32.880
Information that I can use

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.382
to turn this duel
to my advantage.

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:37.451
Yes, information
is powerful.

00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:39.419
That's why
I looked up your past.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.390
Playmaker, I believe you're
approximately the same age

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:44.958
as my sister Skye.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.260
And...

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.462
(Ai)
He tryin' to set
you two up on a date?

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:49.797
I mention it

00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:51.264
because you're not
the only one

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.733
who suffered
a decade ago.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.602
You see, Skye and I didn't

00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:58.238
have such a wonderful
childhood either.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:01.942
Oh, Daddy only buy you five
ponies instead of six?

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:05.379
How about no ponies...
and no family either.

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:06.646
Huh?

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:12.553
You think
I crossed the line?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.954
Yeah, probably.

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.455
My "B."

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:17.223
Playmaker,
we had no family,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.393
no home, no money.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.963
It was just me
and Skye, the two of us...

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.032
against the entire world.

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:27.134
(Zaizen)
I may have only been 16,

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.603
but it was my duty
to take care of Skye,

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.538
so I had to grow up fast--

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.641
no, I was forced
to grow up fast.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.343
Desperate for
food and shelter,

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.112
I did whatever I could
to earn a dime.

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:46.653
So word on the street

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.557
is you're some
kind of hotshot hacker.

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:51.658
But you're just a kid.

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.828
And you are
just a goon.

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.729
Ha-- I like your spunk.

00:14:55.796 --> 00:14:57.665
Tell ya what,
I'll give you a chance

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.366
to prove your
skills.

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:01.068
Sit over there.

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:03.403
Break through that
bank's firewall...

00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:06.506
or I'm gonna do some
breaking of my own.

00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:10.377
(Zaizen)
I didn't want to do
his dirty work

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:13.179
but it was the only
work I could get.

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:22.256
(sighing)

00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:23.691
(Boss)
Nice job.

00:15:23.724 --> 00:15:24.691
Now beat it.

00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:32.032
(Zaizen)
It was a dark time

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:35.002
but a single glimmer of light
kept me going.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:36.169
Skye.

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:39.006
Huh?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.441
That took forever.

00:15:40.507 --> 00:15:42.175
I'm hungry.

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:45.011
I bet a pizza
will cheer you up.

00:15:45.078 --> 00:15:46.379
(giggling)

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:50.684
(Zaizen)
Skye was just six years old.

00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:53.253
Making her happy meant
the world to me.

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.522
And making
sure she felt safe.

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:57.624
Even to this day.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:01.162
(Zaizen)
I would've broken
if someone took her from me,

00:16:01.262 --> 00:16:02.596
which I know you
can relate to

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:05.098
because of that... incident.

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:06.867
(gasping)

00:16:06.934 --> 00:16:08.568
It must've been awful.

00:16:08.602 --> 00:16:10.904
I can't possibly
imagine.

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:13.240
What's this?

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:15.776
What incident
does he mean?

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:18.846
Come on,
details, details!

00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:20.814
He said it was
"awful"?

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:22.749
"Awful" ain't the word!

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.253
(grumbling)

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.422
You've suffered enough.

00:16:28.456 --> 00:16:31.324
Let me handle this
so you don't have to.

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.194
You know nothing!

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:36.697
You want to fight
our fight?

00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:39.966
This is not your battle!
This is not your battle!

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:47.174
(Playmaker)
Zaizen, your intentions
may be pure,

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.910
but you don't truly
understand my plight.

00:16:49.943 --> 00:16:51.478
You had your own struggles

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.413
but you didn't
live through mine.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.414
I must end this.

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:55.783
No, you're wrong.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.652
There is always
another solution.

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.621
He has an ear and a spare

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.389
and he doesn't know
how to use 'em!

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.657
This is our fight.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.858
Hello!

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:06.493
Oh, I heard you.

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:09.162
I was just hoping I didn't
have to believe you.

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.198
How "linguical."

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.834
Well, bring it on
if you wanna stop us!

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:15.302
Fine then.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.204
I believe it's my turn.

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:19.473
I took care
of the trash talk, Playmaker.

00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:20.807
The rest is
up to you.

00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:21.875
You're welcome!

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:25.546
Here I go!

00:17:25.646 --> 00:17:27.080
I draw!

00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:30.684
First, I'll flip over
my Tindangle Hound.

00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:38.259
And by doing so, I activate
its special ability!

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:39.860
Tindangle Hound targets

00:17:39.927 --> 00:17:43.330
one monster on the field
and gains its attack points.

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.333
Then that monster it targeted
is flipped facedown

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.068
into defense mode.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:50.303
Tindangle Angel!

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.040
Energize Tindangle Hound
with 500 attack points!

00:17:55.142 --> 00:17:56.643
(roaring)

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:57.844
Then Tindangle Angel

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:00.147
switches to defense mode
to protect me!

00:18:00.214 --> 00:18:02.249
Aww, I knew I shouldn't
have taunted him.

00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:04.251
Not that
I'm gonna stop.

00:18:05.052 --> 00:18:08.121
Next, I activate
Tindangle Hound's second effect!

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.724
Both your monsters lose
1,000 attack points,

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.159
making them
weaker than my Hound!

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:15.061
Attack!

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.464
Destroy Flame Administrator!

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:23.370
(groaning)

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.641
Since Flame Administrator
is gone,

00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:30.044
so is Decode
Talker's power boost!

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:32.813
Weakening it to 1,800.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.415
But it can go lower
than that!

00:18:34.482 --> 00:18:36.316
Since it's linked
to one fewer monster,

00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:39.319
it loses 500 more
attack points!

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:44.491
(Ai)
Oh, the tragedy of casualty!

00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:47.127
We can never recover
from this!

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:48.262
JK!

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.896
One fewer linked monster
also means

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.432
1,000 extra attack points!

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.737
As if that
scares me.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:59.206
I'll end my turn...

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.842
by placing
this card facedown.

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:03.677
(Ghost Gal)
Heh, how cute.

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:05.546
That hound is protecting
its angel,

00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:08.349
like how Akira
is always protecting Skye.

00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:10.718
But the angel in turn,
can use her ability

00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:12.453
to bring
the hound back to life,

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:15.790
like how Skye revived Akira's
spirit during those dark days.

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.558
This combo's tough to break,

00:19:17.625 --> 00:19:19.960
like a bond between
a brother and a sister.

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:21.395
But the question is:

00:19:21.462 --> 00:19:23.997
Is Playmaker even stronger
than that?

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:25.866
It's my turn!

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:27.534
I draw!

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:30.303
I'll start by summoning
Balancer Lord!

00:19:32.506 --> 00:19:35.209
I'll follow that
by activating my trap card!

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.677
Limit Code!

00:19:36.777 --> 00:19:38.478
This card gets
a Limit Counter

00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:41.781
for every Cyberse Link Monster
that's in my graveyard.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.552
At present, I have
only one monster...

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:47.287
the Flame Administrator
that you took down,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.557
therefore Limit Code
gets one Limit Counter!

00:19:53.828 --> 00:19:56.129
Next, I can summon
a Code Talker from my deck

00:19:56.163 --> 00:19:58.298
by equipping it with
Limit Code!

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:00.300
And I know just the one!

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:03.537
Now descending to the field
is my Encode Talker!

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:11.378
By summoning Encode Talker
next to Decode Talker's link,

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.280
its special ability
activates,

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:16.016
giving it 500
more attack points!

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.321
So what?!

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:22.690
Tindangle Hound's special
ability will cancel out

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.724
that bonus
and then some!

00:20:27.628 --> 00:20:29.062
Um, when you
let a puppy pound

00:20:29.129 --> 00:20:31.031
my Cyberse monsters,

00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:32.799
you're making
me look bad.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:35.969
Not that I have
an ego... that big-ish.

00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:38.873
My deck is built to counter
all of your Link Monsters,

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.774
so you should
stop summoning them.

00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:42.042
Oh.

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:44.945
I do appreciate the advice
but I'm not stopping.

00:20:44.978 --> 00:20:46.379
Huh?

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:48.816
In fact,
I'm doubling down, Zaizen!

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:50.184
Watch this!

00:20:50.284 --> 00:20:52.152
I create another circuit!

00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:57.291
See for yourself
as I bring out a new monster.

00:20:57.324 --> 00:20:58.659
I set Balancer Lord

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:02.462
and Link 3 Encode Talker
in the Link Arrows!

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.070
Why would you do this?

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.705
I Link Summon!

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:14.841
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.519
No way!

00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.455
That's Firewall Dragon!

00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:30.758
That's the monster
you used to defeat Varis.

00:21:30.858 --> 00:21:32.759
But you're going to find,
Playmaker,

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:35.028
that I'm no Varis!

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.433
