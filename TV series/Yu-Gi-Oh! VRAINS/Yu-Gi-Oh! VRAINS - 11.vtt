A Speed Duel isn't enough
to settle our differences.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.815

Speed Dueling is done.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.288
Like in Playmaker's

Not what I expected
in the eye of a storm...

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.106

Phew, good to see

I'm counting on you.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:20.788
When you neutralized
all my Cyberse monsters,

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.790
<i>you got rid of Ai as well.</i>

00:05:22.857 --> 00:05:24.658
Why, Playmaker...

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:27.427
Took you long enough
to figure out our strategy.

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:28.862
Foolish child.

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:30.864
So that was your
intention all along...

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:32.132
To get rid of Ai.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.768
That's why you didn't simply
destroy my monsters

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.304
using Toplogic Bomber Dragon!

00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:38.439
(Ryoken chuckles)

00:05:38.472 --> 00:05:41.275
Did you name your Ignis
like a little pet?

00:05:41.342 --> 00:05:42.743
So what?

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:45.746
How can you treat something
that dangerous like a puppy?

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.515
Have you no idea
what you possess?

00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:50.684
Allow me to educate you...

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.487
The Ignis may be an A.I...

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:57.090
But it's unlike any type you've
ever come across before...

00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:00.694
While A.I. are supposed to do
what we program them to do,

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:03.397
the Ignis do whatever
they want to do,

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:06.033
because the Ignis,
they have free will.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.302
And what the Ignis want to do

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:10.237
is bring an end
to the entire human race.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:11.671
I don't believe you!

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.874
No program
can think for itself.

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:15.509
You're wrong.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.811
The Ignis can.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.680
They should never have been
created in the first place.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.151
But if something can be built,
it can also be destroyed.

00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:26.821
And the Ignis
<i>will</i> be destroyed.

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:29.022
<i>We will see to that.</i>

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:34.828
Unlike you, the Knights of Hanoi
are on the right side of history

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:37.698
because we are the ones
who will save the world.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:40.534
You would be aiding us instead
of trying to fight us

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.669
if you weren't so daft.

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:44.538
But it's not
too late.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:46.506
You can do what's right.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.542
Destroy your Ignis.

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:52.145
Before it
destroys us.

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:57.384
(Ryoken)
The Ignis will destroy us,

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:59.319
but you can destroy
them first!

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:01.154
What?

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.757
Our lil' buddy
wouldn't hurt us...

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.926
I mean he really
wouldn't, right?

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.461
Nice try.

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.796
But I don't buy
a single word you said!

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.001
Hmph. Then you are an even
bigger fool than I thought.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:15.936
But so be it.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.270
You see...

00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:20.140
My mission is not
to convince you, Playmaker...

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.242
It's to save humanity!

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:25.779
And since you dare
to stand in my way,

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.148
you must
be dismissed.

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.750
It's a shame really.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:32.620
You had a choice,
a very simple choice.

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.155
And you made
the wrong one.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:39.126
And that one decision will cost
you your very existence.

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:41.395
But that's how it goes.

00:07:41.462 --> 00:07:44.397
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.634
At the beginning of every turn,
Linkbelt Wall Dragon

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:51.205
gains a Wall Counter,
raising the count to 4!

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:53.273
Next, I tribute
Triple Burst Dragon

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.975
to activate
its special ability

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.611
and summon one Link Monster
from my graveyard

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:59.747
and one Dragon from my hand.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.651
Your sacrifice will not go
to waste Triple Burst Dragon!

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:07.654
Not only do you give rise
to Twin Triangle Dragon...

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:10.857
But also bring out
my Sniffer Dragon!

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:18.065
But why settle for just one!

00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:22.669
Sniffer Dragon's special ability
allows me to draw a second...

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:28.441
... which means I can now
summon it to my field!

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:33.613
Yes...
All the pieces are in place...

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:43.357
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.995
I need at least three Effect
Monsters to Link Summon.

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:50.063
And that's exactly
what I have!

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.567
I set Twin Triangle Dragon
and my two Sniffer Dragons

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.303
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:58.271
Link the circuit!

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.044
And with their combination
comes your doom, Playmaker!

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.346
I Link Summon!
Rise up!

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:10.417
Link 4, Borreload Dragon!

00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:18.458
(roaring)

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:22.929
I know that dragon...

00:09:27.634 --> 00:09:30.937
It must be his
strongest monster!

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:34.374
Though you technically still
have your Cyberse monsters,

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.243
they're not around
to help you.

00:09:37.344 --> 00:09:39.179
So you can't stop
Borreload Dragon

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.348
from attacking you directly!

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.190
Energy chambers charged!

00:09:50.257 --> 00:09:52.759
Arm plasma cannon!

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:56.563
Target...

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:57.865
locked!

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.300
Activating anti-glare shield...

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.069
Retract safeguards...

00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:07.574
Now fire!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.743
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.352
No!

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:23.456
Yusaku!

00:10:23.557 --> 00:10:25.191
That's gotta hurt.

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:33.100
With that, I end my turn.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.570
(groaning)

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.772
Come on, Playmaker...

00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:41.575
And I must say,
from the looks of it,

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:43.243
I've ended you, as well.

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:47.547
(grunts)

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:49.916
(computer voice)
<i>Game over.</i>

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.418
<i>You lose.</i>

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:56.724
(voice)
Hey...

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.093
Hey...
Come on, get up.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.194
Why?

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:01.929
For three reasons...

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:05.332
One: If you give up now,
there won't be a next time.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:08.568
Two: You can't win if you
don't believe you can win.

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:11.005
And three: Just because
it's tough now

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:12.773
doesn't mean
it will always be.

00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:14.975
Three.
That's all you need.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:18.111
Just three simple reasons
can get you through anything.

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:25.752
(Yusaku)
That's right.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:29.656
And I have three reasons
why I must win this duel.

00:11:29.757 --> 00:11:34.328
One: I must make the Knights
of Hanoi pay for their crimes.

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:38.165
Two: I must regain my lost
memories to learn

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:39.833
why they made me suffer.

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:43.670
And three: I only survived my
captivity because a single voice

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.772
wouldn't allow my spirit
to break...

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:49.410
(voice)
Come on, get up.

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:52.479
(straining)

00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:57.684
(Yusaku)
Whoever that voice was,
I must find and rescue him

00:11:57.784 --> 00:12:00.487
if he's still imprisoned
after all these years.

00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:03.990
This duel isn't over!

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.060
You won't win,
Varis!

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:14.535
This duel isn't over!

00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:16.537
You won't win, Varis!

00:12:16.637 --> 00:12:18.539
(Emma)
He's okay!

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:19.673
Ah...

00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:22.509
It seems you can stand
but can you duel?

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:24.211
Just watch...

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:27.381
I draw!

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:29.016
(Yusaku)
But it'll be my last draw

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.884
if I don't immediately
make a comeback.

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:33.653
But what can I do
without my monsters?

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.825
What's this?

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:42.930
(gasps)

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.565
(Yusaku)
I sense the presence of a new
Cyberse monster in my deck...

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:46.934
But how?

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.336
Then again,
this isn't the first time.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.506
I've always felt what others
couldn't inside the network.

00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:55.542
A premonition, an aura,
a sixth sense,

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:58.912
as if some unknown force
was whispering in my ear...

00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:01.148
So if my gut is true,

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:04.151
that means Varis failed
to truly erase the Cyberse!

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.752
Or Ai.

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:09.222
Ai, I know you can hear me!

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.125
Answer me!

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.127
I know you're still here!

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:15.395
(Yusaku's voice echoing)
Ai!

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:16.797
Ai!

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:17.932
(Ai gasps)

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:19.799
Playmaker!

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.301
Nothing, huh?

00:13:21.335 --> 00:13:23.203
You're as unhelpful as usual.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.572
All right, then...

00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:26.740
I'll just duel on my own!

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:31.045
I'm now activating the
Field Spell, Cynet Universe!

00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:33.047
Now all of the Link Monsters
on my field

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.249
gain 300 attack points!

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:37.551
How does that
change anything?

00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:40.220
Your field is completely empty.

00:13:43.256 --> 00:13:44.991
Wrong...

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.593
Very wrong.

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.629
My Cyberses are still here.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.897
And they're here to help me!

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:53.434
I'll prove it!

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:56.069
By creating
the ultimate circuit!

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:01.841
What?
How can you Link Summon?

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.383
(Yusaku)
Link Arrows authorized!

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:13.888
The summoning conditions are
at least two Cyberse monsters.

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:16.156
Therefore, I'm going
to set my Decode Talker

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.892
and Encode Talker
in the Link Arrows!

00:14:21.462 --> 00:14:24.364
He's using his two
strongest monsters?

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.768
Link the circuit!

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.805
I Link Summon!

00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:35.008
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:14:58.032 --> 00:15:01.167
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:04.872
No...

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.373
Fire Prison's gone!

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.079
(Ryoken)
When Fire Prison no longer has
any Cyberses under lockdown,

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:14.415
it's destroyed.

00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:18.352
So when you used your Cyberses
to Link Summon, you destroyed

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:22.055
my Prison and summoned a new
monster at the same time.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:25.926
Ai!

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.261
(Ai)
Huh?
I'm back?

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:31.265
And trapped inside my Duel Disk,
right where you belong.

00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:34.434
So I left one prison
to get stuck in another...

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.370
And a smaller cell at that.

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:38.372
Maybe it would have been
better if you did lose.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.439
Wait!

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:40.907
You didn't lose the duel,
did you?

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:42.943
Of course not.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:45.612
But truth be told I'm not
exactly winning either.

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:47.080
600?

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.782
I take a nap for one second

00:15:48.882 --> 00:15:50.217
and you think you're
a philanthropist,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.752
donating all
your life points!

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.421
Thank you for that
wonderful feedback.

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:56.557
(Ai)
But don't worry, Playmaker!

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.393
Now that I'm back, I'll figure
this all out for ya!

00:15:59.427 --> 00:16:03.330
According to my analysis, since
Fire Prison's effect's gone,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.135
Linkbelt Wall Dragon's defense
points drop from 2400 to 2100.

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:09.970
And there's more...

00:16:10.004 --> 00:16:13.107
My Field Spell Cynet Universe
raises my Link Monster's

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.242
attack points by 300.

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:20.313
I said I'll do
the analysis, you meatbag!

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:22.282
But what you said
was correct, so...

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.685
props to you.
But you know...

00:16:24.785 --> 00:16:26.620
What in the world
is that thing?

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.155
It's enormously enormous!

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.491
That Borreload Dragon
may be stronger

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.160
than my Firewall Dragon,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.695
but his Linkbelt
Wall Dragon isn't!

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:37.797
(roars)

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:42.636
Go!
Tempest Terahertz!

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:57.517
Linkbelt Wall Dragon's
no more!

00:16:57.617 --> 00:16:59.252
And I'm not through...

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.421
Because now I'm going to
activate...

00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:04.825
Cynet Universe's effect which
lets me return Encode Talker

00:17:04.892 --> 00:17:07.228
from my graveyard
to my Extra Deck.

00:17:07.328 --> 00:17:09.430
Then I'll place two facedowns...

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:13.033
And end my turn.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.302
You made quite a good
accounting for yourself,

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.137
far better than I expected.

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:18.739
But it's too late.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.408
With only a paltry 600 life
points remaining...

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:23.877
Varis will close
the books on you!

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:31.886
(Kiyoshi)
Finish this duel and finish
Playmaker once and for all!

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:33.687
It's my turn!

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.821
I draw!

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.359
Before you make a move,
I activate my trap card!

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.894
Parallel Port Armor!

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:43.564
Now your cards can't target
Firewall Dragon

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:46.600
or destroy it in battle!

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.902
That move barely
poses a problem.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:49.970
I play...

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.039
The spell, Arrow Charge!

00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:55.242
Since there are two monsters in
the Extra Monster Zone that have

00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:56.810
the same number of Links,

00:17:56.877 --> 00:17:59.579
I'm allowed to draw
two cards from my deck!

00:18:01.048 --> 00:18:04.952
Next I summon
Anesthrokket Dragon.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.921
And I'll combo it with
these two spell cards!

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:09.790
First, Squib Draw!

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:14.394
I destroy the Anesthrokket
Dragon that I just summoned.

00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:17.231
That lets me draw
two more cards from my deck.

00:18:17.298 --> 00:18:19.934
Then I follow that up by
activating the Field Spell

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.802
Boot Sector Launch.

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:25.405
This lets me summon not one but
two Rokket monsters to my field

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:27.074
in defense mode!

00:18:27.108 --> 00:18:31.778
Emerge before me, Autorokket
Dragon and Anesthrokket Dragon!

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.953
And Boot Sector Launch
raises my Rokket monsters'

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:43.490
attack and defense points
by 300!

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.659
Next, once per turn,

00:18:45.759 --> 00:18:48.095
I can use Borreload Dragon's
special ability

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:52.499
to lower one monster's attack
and defense points by 500.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:56.269
And the monster I choose won't
be one of yours, but mine!

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:59.739
Borreload, weaken
my Autorokket Dragon!

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:05.179
(Ai)
Why would you lower
your own monster's defense?

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:08.716
I'll tell you why.
Because it lets me do this:

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.885
When Autorokket is targeted
by a Link Monster...

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:14.455
It self-destructs,
but it takes a spell

00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:16.823
or trap card along with it!

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:20.660
So I send your Parallel Port
Armor to the graveyard!

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.306
(groans)

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.375
Seems Varis was kind enough
to answer your question Ai.

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:38.478
(Ai)
Yeah, but he didn't have
to be so rough about it.

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.215
I bet he has less friends
than you.

00:19:41.315 --> 00:19:43.717
Without Parallel Port Armor,

00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:46.186
Firewall Dragon
can now be destroyed.

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:47.354
Get ready!

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:50.791
Borreload Dragon,
unleash your fiery fury!

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:51.791
(roars)

00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:55.462
(beeping)

00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:00.700
Actually, instead of destroying
your Firewall,

00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:03.603
why don't I take
control of it instead?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.807
(roaring)

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:13.513
Huh?
(Ai)
Aww, glitch!

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:18.185
No!

00:20:18.219 --> 00:20:20.153
Hey, didn't your
grandmama ever teach ya

00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:22.689
to keep your grimy paws
to yourself!

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.725
So that's Borreload's
special ability...

00:20:25.826 --> 00:20:27.193
(Ryoken chuckles)

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.663
How does it feel knowing
that your very own monster

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:32.166
will deal
the finishing blow?

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:34.501
Attack and end this duel!

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:44.211
(Ai)
Well, it's been
nice knowing you.

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:46.380
Kind of.
It's not over!

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.681
I activate this!

00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:49.517
My Cynet Refresh!

00:20:49.617 --> 00:20:52.686
Thanks to this trap,
when a Cyberse attacks,

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:56.356
all monsters in the Main Monster
Zone are destroyed!

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:59.125
Including Firewall Dragon!

00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:02.929
Hm. Seems that your facedown
card saved you there,

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.199
so I think I'll
set one of my own...

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:09.169
Then by ending my turn,
my Anesthrokket Dragon's

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:10.938
special ability activates,

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:14.441
allowing me to summon a new
Rokket monster from my deck.

00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:16.911
And I know just the one.

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:19.613
Magnarokket Dragon!

00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:23.517
And since my Autorokket Dragon
also has the same exact

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:24.885
special ability...

00:21:24.919 --> 00:21:28.555
I can summon a second
Magnarokket Dragon!

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:32.059
And as before, my spell
Boot Sector Launch

00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:36.363
energizes them with 300
additional defense points!

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.100
(Ai)
Can this guy go five seconds
without having a new monster?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.602
I bet he's the clingy type.

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:44.271
He isn't the only one who can
resurrect his monsters

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:47.207
because the power of Cynet
Refresh allows me to bring back

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:50.244
the Cyberse Monster
that was just destroyed!

00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:53.246
So Firewall Dragon
is back under my command!

00:21:57.685 --> 00:22:00.654
Then Cynet Universe powers
Firewall Dragon up

00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:02.956
with 300
extra attack points!

00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:09.196
Next I play the trap
Recoded Alive!

00:22:09.296 --> 00:22:12.333
By banishing Decode Talker
from my graveyard...

00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:14.601
I can summon another
"Code Talker"

00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:16.804
directly from
my extra deck...

00:22:16.904 --> 00:22:20.073
So join the fight,
Encode Talker!

00:22:23.844 --> 00:22:27.347
And just like it did with
Firewall Dragon, Cynet Universe

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:30.918
infuses Encode Talker
with 300 attack points.

00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:33.286
You thought
this duel was over,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.956
but this fight's only
getting started, Varis!
