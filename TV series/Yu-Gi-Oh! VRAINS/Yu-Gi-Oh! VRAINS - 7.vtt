Previously
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.407
<i>Hey, True Blues!
I need your help!</i>

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.143
<i>All of you!</i>

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.645
<i>If any of you
see Playmaker, tell him</i>

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.281
<i>that Blue Angel's challenging
him to a Speed Duel</i>

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.350
<i>because that's
what the whole world wants,</i>

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.986
<i>and what the whole wants
is what they'll get!</i>

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.188
An interesting
turn of events.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.490
I believe she'll be
quite useful

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.659
in our battle
against Playmaker.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.427
Doesn't a gentleman know

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.264
he should never
stand up a lady?

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.666
You're a...
a Knight of Hanoi.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.668
Indeed I am.

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:37.404
But I'm first and foremost
your biggest fan.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.675
I can bring Playmaker
straight to you, Blue Angel

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.445
In fact, I can even
guarantee you victory.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:47.447
Ohh!

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.816
If you should ever
find yourself

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.485
in peril during a duel,

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.420
do not hesitate
to put into play

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.656
the card
I just provided you.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.659
May you duel well,
Blue Angel

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.362
(Blue Angel gasps)

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.265
<i>Aww glitch!</i>

00:01:04.365 --> 00:01:05.565
Hey! Will you keep it
down already?

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
<i>But I've detected
a Knight of Hanoi!</i>

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.169
Where?
In Link VRAINS?

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.072
♪♪♪

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.208
Are you certain the Knight
of Hanoi you detected is here?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:18.212
<i>Yup! The signal's pinging
within 50 meters.</i>

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:21.682
There!

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.250
That's not one
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:24.584
That's Blue Angel.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.188
<i>Or perhaps they're
one and the same.</i>

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.155
(both)
Speed Duel!

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.426
♪♪♪

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.120
Here I go!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.656
I'll set the stage
for this Speed Duel

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:39.126
with my Field Spell,
Trickstar Light Stage!

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:41.995
It lets me get any Trickstar
I want from my deck,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.832
and I want this girl!

00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:47.301
Trickstar Lilybell's
never, ever, ever,

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:50.370
ever the wrong choice
because her special ability

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.706
lets me
automatically summon her!

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.111
- Oh!

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.648
(Blue Angel, thinking)
- Just watch, Akira.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:02.382
You'll see I'm not some
helpless little girl

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.684
once I defeat Playmaker!

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:12.159
Next to join my crew
is the one and only
Trickstar Candina!

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.328
Come on in!

00:03:14.362 --> 00:03:17.297
(Candina giggles)

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:20.867
She has a special ability
that you won't like, Playmaker!

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.304
I get to draw another Trickstar
card from my deck-- Ha!

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.940
Now this card'll be
really useful later,

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:31.178
but what's useful now
is my Trickstar Lycoris.

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.347
In order to summon her,
I have to return

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.217
Trickstar Candina
from my field to my hand.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.187
Huh?!

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:42.522
Bye till later Candina

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.525
Oh, it is later.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:47.227
Soo, I activate
my spell Trickstar Vision

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.195
to re-summon Candina.

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.198
Catch is, I have to
cut her life points in half

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.200
and get rid
of her special abilities.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.367
But ya know?

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.937
That's a small price
to pay to get her back!

00:03:57.004 --> 00:03:58.672
(Candina giggles)

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:04.244
Trickstar Vision lets us
both draw one card!

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.747
Uh, How about a thank you?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.783
No? Okay.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.686
But that's all right because
every time you get a card,

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.522
Lycoris deals you damage!

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.923
200 points at a time!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.633
200 points is not that much,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.936
but every time
my Lycoris damages you,

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:33.107
Trickstar Light Stage also
deals 200 points of damage.

00:04:33.207 --> 00:04:37.010
Unh!

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:39.046
(Ai)
<i>You sure you up
for this, Playmaker?</i>

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.182
<i>She summoned
three monsters
and dealt you damage</i>

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.083
<i>before you even drew
your first card!</i>

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.251
All these Trickstars
are great,

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.755
but I haven't summoned
my best one yet!

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.589
Not till I Link Summon!

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.291
Link Summon?!

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.760
Yup!

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.062
I'll build the circuit that
turns dreams into reality!

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.771
(laughing)

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.943
Link Arrows authorized!

00:05:08.976 --> 00:05:11.445
I need at least
two Trickstar monsters

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.779
in order to Link Summon.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:16.450
So I set Trickstar Lilybell
and Trickstar Candina!

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.985
(Blue Angel giggling)

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:19.853
(Trickstars laughing)

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:23.123
Link the circuit!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.658
(thinking)
This is just
what I need to win.

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:25.826
Without anyone's help!

00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.294
Why, Skye?

00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.329
Why must you always
disobey me?

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.031
Now I Link Summon!

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:34.301
Link 2 Trickstar
Holly Angel!

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.612
(crowd cheering)

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:45.979
(man)
We love you, Blue Angel!

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.816
Blue Angel's already
summoned her best monster!

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:51.185
Before I end my turn...
(giggles)

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:54.121
I place these two cards
facedown.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.823
Well, you're up, Playmaker.

00:05:56.923 --> 00:06:00.193
But all you're doing
is going down.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.499
(Blue Angel)
You're up, Playmaker.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.534
But all you're doing
is going down.

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.904
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:11.505
Yep, you certainly did
all right.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:14.408
And every single time
you draw a card to your hand,

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:19.079
Trickstar Lycoris stings you
with 200 points of damage!

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.382
And Trickstar Light Stage
follows up with 200 more!

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.423
And when my Trickstars
use their special abilities

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:32.693
to deal damage, my Holly Angel
gains attack points

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:33.994
equal to that amount.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:37.164
So since Lycoris dealt you
200 points of damage,

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:39.900
Holly Angel gets
200 attack points.

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.836
<i>Just the act of drawing
a card's busting you up.</i>

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.004
You're right.

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.006
All her cards
work together seamlessly.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.075
I can see why the Hanoi's
interested in her.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.477
But that doesn't mean
she'll win.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.580
I start my turn
by summoning Draconet!

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.852
Draconet, now go!

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.588
Use your ability

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:04.625
to summon a Level 2 monster
from my deck.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.227
I summon my Bitron!

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.499
Now it's my turn
to Link Summon.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.134
(Ai)
<i>I'm sure
it'll be great.</i>

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.402
Watch this!

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:18.271
I create
the ultimate circuit!

00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:28.148
Link Arrows authorized.

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:30.584
I require one monster
to Link Summon.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:34.287
So I set Bitron
in the Link Arrow!

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.625
Link the circuit!

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:40.894
I Link Summon!

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.663
Link 1 Link Spider!

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:51.772
And just like how you
summoned monsters

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:53.774
one after another,
so shall I!

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.376
Link Spider's special ability
allows me to summon

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.379
a monster that's Level 4
or lower

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.114
right next to its link.

00:08:00.214 --> 00:08:02.382
Like, another Bitron!
Huh!

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:07.655
And with Bitron's return,

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:11.125
I can Link Summon
for a second time!

00:08:11.191 --> 00:08:13.694
No way!

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:17.398
I set Draconet and Bitron
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:17.498 --> 00:08:19.399
Go!

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:25.172
Link the circuit!

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:26.773
And now I Link Summon!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.042
Link 2 Link Bumper!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.521
And why should I stop
at two...

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:43.023
when I can summon a third!

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.533
Now I require
two Effect Monsters!

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.669
So now I set my Link Spider
and my Link Bumper!

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:03.010
Link the circuit!

00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:04.745
I Link Summon!

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:08.114
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:18.191
Unreal!

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:21.395
<i>Playmaker just Link Summoned
three times in a row!</i>

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:24.231
<i>Your kiddies' kiddies
will be reading about this</i>

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:26.600
<i>in the history books!</i>

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.101
Now attack!

00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.104
Destroy Trickstar
Holly Angel!

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.745
You really think
that's gonna work?

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:40.714
I mean, I love how you said it
with so much conviction!

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:45.552
But... Trickstar Reincarnation
banishes your entire hand

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:49.623
and you have to draw a card
for every one you lose!

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.725
Four cards gone,
four cards back.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:55.296
And by drawing those cards,
you know the drill by now.

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.231
My Trickstar Lycoris
deals you

00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:59.432
200 points of damage
per card

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.335
and 4 times 200
equals bad times!

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.541
And Trickstar Light Stage
hits you again

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.743
for another 200 points.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:14.080
<i>She really thinks
she can chip away</i>

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.782
<i>200 at a time
and win?</i>

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.052
Why not
if it's working out?

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:21.388
Next, Holly Angel gains that
damage as attack points!

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:24.024
You go, girl!

00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:25.458
<i>Aww glitch!</i>

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:28.062
<i>That means her angel's
stronger than Decode Talker!</i>

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:30.064
<i>You really wiped out
big time, Playmaker,</i>

00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:32.233
<i>because DT's a goner!</i>

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:36.170
I activate my spell!
Go Security Block!

00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:38.605
It shields Decode Talker
from destruction

00:10:38.706 --> 00:10:42.075
and I take no damage
from this battle.

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.446
<i>Oh. Good.
I was never worried.</i>

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:47.348
That's a nice spell card.

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:50.851
Too bad though, because you
totally wasted it, Playmaker.

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:52.920
Trickstar Scatter destroys
the monster

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.188
that Holly Angel battled,

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:57.524
so your Decode Talker's
destroyed anyway!

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:01.495
<i>Umm, not good?</i>

00:11:01.595 --> 00:11:03.463
<i>I was never
not worried?</i>

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:06.166
I'm ready for whatever
you can dish out.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.109
Ya see,
this duel, ya know?

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:17.978
It's so much more
than a game!

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:19.513
It's my life!

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:21.781
So you won't break me!

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.256
This duel is far from over.

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:31.091
Though you have destroyed
my Decode Talker,

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.594
that has allowed me
to summon Salvagent Driver

00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.097
from my hand
in defense mode!

00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:39.099
(engine revving)

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:44.070
I end my turn!

00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:46.974
Then my Holly Angel's attack
drops back to 2K.

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:49.443
But don't get
too comfortable!

00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:52.446
<i>She's so bubbly that I want
to burst her bubble.</i>

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:54.147
<i>(sniffing)
And you smell that?</i>

00:11:54.247 --> 00:11:56.450
<i>Her deck's now reeking
with the stench of Hanoi!</i>

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:59.820
I still don't know how
an eyeball can detect scent,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.223
but I do agree that I sense
Hanoi's presence too.

00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:06.560
My turn! I draw!

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.763
<i>Look!</i>

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:11.531
(gasps)

00:12:11.565 --> 00:12:13.934
That card belongs
to the Hanoi!

00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:15.202
<i>I saw it first!</i>

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:19.539
Oh, man...
What was that?

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.842
I gotta get my head
back in the game.

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:24.478
I banish
Trickstar Reincarnation
from my graveyard

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.580
to revive
one of my Trickstars.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.717
And the one
that's sure to help me
is Trickstar Lilybell!

00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:32.752
Come join the fun!
Let's go, ha ha!

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:41.428
That na ïve girl drew
the card we gave to her.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:44.765
Once she plays it,
she belongs to us.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.834
Your silly scooter
won't protect you

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.537
because my Lilybell
can attack you directly!

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:53.707
Go, Lilybell!
Blast him!

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:59.647
Unh!

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:03.951
And don't forget about
Trickstar Light Stage!

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:07.154
Ahh!

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:09.123
<i>(sobbing)
We're falling!</i>

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:12.092
<i>I'm too young to frag!</i>

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:22.636
<i>You enjoy scaring me
like that?!</i>

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:24.538
Kinda.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:26.941
Well, it looks like you're
still hanging in there,

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.142
at least for now!

00:13:28.242 --> 00:13:31.612
In that case, since Lilybell
dealt you damage,

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:33.814
I can bring Candina
back to my hand.

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.282
<i>I was sure for sure</i>

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.917
<i>that she was gonna
play that Hanoi card.</i>

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.786
But she chose not to.
How Interesting.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.755
My turn.
I draw!

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:43.757
And draw more damage
to yourself.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.958
Zap him, Lycoris!

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.293
Unh!

00:13:46.327 --> 00:13:49.462
<i>We can't take
much more of this!</i>

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:53.667
And Trickstar Light Stage
zaps you, too, Playmaker!

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:57.204
Unh!
<i>Are you listening?</i>

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.706
Last and defi-not least,

00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:02.142
Holly Angel gains
200 attack points!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.877
(thinking)
I'm going to win!

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:05.546
See, Akira?

00:14:05.646 --> 00:14:08.816
I may be your sister, but I'm
not your baby sister anymore.

00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:11.852
So you can stop
babying me around!

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:14.388
(thinking)
Why are you
doing this, Skye?

00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:17.291
As your older brother,
I promised our parents

00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:19.059
that I'd always
take care of you.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:20.994
And I never break
a promise.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:24.865
Those late nights studying,
those endless days working,

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:28.335
year after year, ruthlessly
climbing the corporate ladder

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:31.672
to provide the safety and
security that you never had.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.107
I did it for you.
Just you.

00:14:33.174 --> 00:14:36.176
And you're choosing
to throw it all away?

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:41.715
Why?
Why can't you just do as I say?

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:44.017
(Blue Angel groans)

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.953
(thinking)
I don't know why,
but I don't feel so good.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.022
I just have to
keep it together

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.858
for a few more seconds.

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.694
(Ai)
<i>Whoa, she's wobblin'.</i>

00:14:53.794 --> 00:14:56.863
<i>Her Hanoi card must be
doin' a number on her.</i>

00:14:56.897 --> 00:14:58.832
Ohh!

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.401
I have to end this duel.

00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.536
I summon
my Defect Compiler!

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.743
Next, I activate Salvagent
Driver's special ability!

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:11.412
By discarding
one spell card from my hand,

00:15:11.445 --> 00:15:13.914
Salvagent Driver
salvages Link Bumper

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:16.216
back from my graveyard.

00:15:19.253 --> 00:15:21.354
Oh!
It doesn't matter.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.124
As long as I just--
I can't focus!

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:25.760
<i>Oh, Playmaker?</i>

00:15:25.793 --> 00:15:27.427
<i>Guess what guess what
guess what?</i>

00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:28.896
<i>With these monsters
and the fact</i>

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.098
<i>that you have less
than 1,000 life points,</i>

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.767
<i>now's the perfect moment
to activate your Skill!</i>

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:36.069
<i>Heh! Where'd you be
without my help!</i>

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:37.704
What exactly did you think
I was planning

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:38.906
this entire time?

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.107
<i>Ugh....
You're welcome.</i>

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.183
Oh!

00:15:53.454 --> 00:15:55.589
(grunting)

00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:57.124
Whoa! Huh! Ahh!

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.794
Unh!

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:04.798
(yelling)

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.467
<i>Seize the wind,
Playmaker!</i>

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:09.769
Go, Storm Access!

00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:21.315
Ah!

00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:22.683
(Blue Angel's AI)
<i>His life points</i>

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:24.017
<i>were low enough
to activate his Skill.</i>

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:25.919
What, they're low enough?

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:28.756
You mean to tell me that
he was taking damage on purpose

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.090
so that he could use
his Skill?

00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:31.491
That means he tricked me.

00:16:31.525 --> 00:16:33.660
That is so
totally way not cool!

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:47.641
Go!

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:57.017
This is for everything!

00:16:57.117 --> 00:16:58.952
The summoning
conditions require

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.920
at least two Cyberse-Types.

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:03.857
So, I now set
my Link 2 Link Bumper

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.227
along with my Salvagent Driver
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:13.734
Link the circuit!

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:17.470
I Link Summon!
Link 3 Encode Talker!

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.720
Ahh.. winning this duel
is slipping away from me.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.491
Even with all my best moves,
am I no match for Playmaker?

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:38.992
Is he that good?

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.994
Defect Compiler!

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.063
Attack Trickstar
Lilybell!

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:46.567
I also activate the spell
Frontline Disturbance!

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.368
That's not good at all.

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.371
That spell will wreck
Holly Angel...

00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:51.872
but not if I can
help it!

00:17:51.972 --> 00:17:53.707
I activate my own Skill!

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:55.709
A Skill?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.381
I activate my Skill
Trickstar Trick!

00:18:01.448 --> 00:18:03.617
By discarding one Trickstar
from my hand,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.219
you're forced
to keep drawing

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:07.087
until you have three cards
in your hand!

00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:08.221
(Playmaster and Ai)
What?

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:09.556
(Blue Angel)
Since your hand's empty,

00:18:09.623 --> 00:18:13.293
you have to draw three
new cards from your deck.

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:15.730
And thanks to
my Trickstar Lycoris,

00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:19.233
you'll take 600 damage.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.770
And then,
Trickstar Light Stage
deals you 200 more

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.372
for a total of 800,
which is all you have left!

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.876
Playmaker, thanks for playing
but this duel is all mine.

00:18:28.943 --> 00:18:30.978
Or so you believe.
Oh!

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:33.313
I still have
Defect Compiler in play.

00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:35.949
It stops all your damage!

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:40.387
And gains one counter.

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.790
What? But I was
so close to winning!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.124
Grr!

00:18:44.157 --> 00:18:48.795
Well, I have no other options
left than to-- Ohh!

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:55.269
Her final card's
the Hanoi one.

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:56.470
<i>Oh... oh!</i>

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.605
I have to win!

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:02.009
To show Akira, I have to win!

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.811
Play the card, Blue Angel!

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:05.279
Don't do it!

00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:08.515
I discard Dark Angel
from my hand

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:12.285
to activate
its special ability.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:14.188
Aah!

00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:15.990
What's happening to her?!

00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:17.624
(Shima)
Oh, no!

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:19.059
(students)
Huh?!
Shima!

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.695
Uh... don't mind me.

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:28.969
(moaning)

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.004
<i>That card's
put her in a daze.</i>

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:35.008
This is bad news.
The Hanoi have her.

00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:37.144
By tributing Lilybell,

00:19:37.178 --> 00:19:39.379
you are forced to attack
a different monster.

00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:47.721
Yes, your Defect Compiler
must attack my Holly Angel.

00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:50.991
A Holly Angel that gains
Lilybell's 800 attack points,

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:54.695
raising her to 3,000.

00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:58.131
That may be but my spell
Frontline Disturbance

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:02.837
places a Disturbance Counter
on my Encode Talker!

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.938
How does that help?

00:20:05.005 --> 00:20:08.809
Angel!
Annihilate Defect Compiler!

00:20:08.842 --> 00:20:12.780
And Playmaker!
Go!

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:15.882
My Encode Talker will put
a stop to this!

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:18.719
Monsters it's linked to
can't be destroyed in battle,

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:22.456
and I take no damage.

00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:23.957
Grr!

00:20:24.024 --> 00:20:26.293
In addition, until
the end of the turn,

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:29.863
Encode Talker
gains Holly Angel's
attack points.

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:35.369
Aah!

00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:37.471
<i>If her mind gets wrecked
in this world,</i>

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:39.273
<i>she might not wake up
in the real world.</i>

00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:40.608
Blue Angel!

00:20:40.674 --> 00:20:42.676
Stop this duel immediately!

00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:44.778
Shut down the servers
if you have to!

00:20:44.845 --> 00:20:46.179
Do it!
Yes, Sir!

00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:49.182
(screaming)

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:51.117
(man)
How horrible!
(spectators chatter)

00:20:51.184 --> 00:20:53.854
I remove
Defect Compiler's counter

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:57.324
to raise Encode Talker's
attack points by 800!

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:03.964
(screaming wildly)

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.610
<i>She's fading fast!</i>
I know!

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.412
No! Hey, you!

00:21:18.446 --> 00:21:20.848
What's taking so long?
Shut it down!

00:21:20.914 --> 00:21:25.252
Oh! We have
a system error!

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:27.721
(thinking)
No! No!

00:21:27.754 --> 00:21:31.592
I now activate the effect
of my Frontline Disturbance!

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:35.061
By removing Encode Talker's
Disturbance Counter,

00:21:35.095 --> 00:21:37.064
Holly Angel loses
attack points

00:21:37.097 --> 00:21:39.533
equal to
Lycoris's defense points.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.601
Which is enough
to end this duel.

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:48.942
Encode Talker!
Attack!
