WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.304
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi! VRAINS...

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:06.740
(Blue Maiden)
Ai, what are you doing here?

00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.075
To get to the point,

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:10.144
how about handing
over your code key.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.179
You've known me long enough...

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.315
to know I won't just hand
my code key over to you!

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.851
I'll duel you both for it.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.153
(All)
Let's duel!

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.624
(Ai)
I Link Summon!

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:27.861
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.430
DARK TEMPLAR,
attack MARBLED ROCK!

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.267
And JUDGMENT ARROWS
doubles its attack points!

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:37.938
(screams)

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.741
I teamed with the meatbags

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.944
'cuz I thought it was
the right thing to do.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.680
But look where it got me

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.348
and where it got my friends.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.483
Sometimes you can think

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.486
you're doing the right
thing but then...

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.821
you later learn it was wrong.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.122
Ai...

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.358
Yes!
Ready, Akira?

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.229
(Both)
Now, we unite our circuit!

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:06.066
The summoning conditions
require three TINDANGLES!

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.202
We Link Summon!

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:12.672
Link 3 TINDANGLE ACUTE CERBERUS!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.546
How sweet!

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.981
Two siblings united in defeat!

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.049
Hmm.

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.316
(grunts)

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:34.160
♪♪♪

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:40.294
Ai, this duel of ours
is far from over.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.897
When I have three different
TINDANGLES in my graveyard,

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:48.068
TINDANGLE ACUTE CERBERUS
gains 3000 attack points!

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.107
It also gains 500 attack points

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:55.775
for every TINDANGLE
next to its links!

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:02.716
Now ACUTE CERBERUS!
Attack FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.486
No way!

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.855
That big bowwow has
3500 attack points,

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.691
but JUDGMENT ARROWS
will double up

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.027
your FIRE PHOENIX's
attack points to 4600!

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.163
His puppy's gonna
get pounded!

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.364
That's doggone
silly.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.833
Yes, it may
appear that way.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.168
But they're up
to something.

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.605
I will now activate

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:28.175
MARINCESS DECISION
from our graveyard!

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.445
By banishing that trap
along with MARBLED ROCK...

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.215
your monster loses attack points

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:37.384
equal to MARBLED ROCK's
until the end of the turn!

00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:43.023
FIRE PHOENIX no longer
has any attack points.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:44.024
(grunts)

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:45.525
Well that's just great.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.695
Attack with Isometric Inferno!

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.670
(screams)

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.838
Oh no!

00:03:57.938 --> 00:03:58.972
Are you okay?

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:00.808
I'm more
than okay.

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.777
Because I can activate
ACHICHI @IGNISTER's ability

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.111
from my graveyard!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.580
When FIRE PHOENIX
is destroyed in battle,

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.550
I can banish ACHICHI
to destroy it twice!

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.086
Uuh!

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.688
(grunts)

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.257
Why'd you use your ability
to destroy your monster

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.292
when it was destroyed
in battle anyway?

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.628
Because when an ability,

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.965
and not an attack,
destroys my FIRE PHOENIX,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.402
I'm allowed to destroy
your monster as well!

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.771
So say bye-bye to your HOUND.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.205
Sayonara!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.774
FYI, that's Japanese
for sayonara.

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:38.779
Akira?
Technically
true.

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:39.446
Right.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.049
By banishing
MARINCESS BASILALIMA

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:43.050
from our graveyard,

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:44.918
it prevents your special ability

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.087
from destroying
our TINDANGLE HOUND.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.125
And BASILALIMA's
additional ability

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.096
also gives our ACUTE CERBERUS
600 attack points!

00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:00.267
And CERBERUS has
its own ability!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.303
Since it attacked this turn,

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:03.170
it can summon

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.805
a TINDANGLE TOKEN
on to our field.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:08.976
But not just to any location.

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:11.745
I summoned it
next to our CERBERUS's link,

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.514
so it gains 500
more attack points!

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:17.484
4600 attack points?

00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:20.754
That ends my turn.
You're up, Ai.

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:22.255
All right!

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.192
Blue Maiden and Zaizen's
teamwork is on point!

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.162
Yes, because their two minds
are behaving like one,

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.997
bringing out their best.

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:32.166
You're right.

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:33.467
Because as much as I hate

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.469
that we have to be
the ones to defeat you,

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:38.972
I'd hate it even more if Akira
was gone from my life.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.342
So I will do anything
to protect him!

00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.410
That's great.
Just great!

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:44.979
You be his firewall!

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.947
You be his everything,
Blue Maiden!

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.783
You two are really
tingling my heart.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.151
Don't mock me!

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:52.452
It's not.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.121
My vocal analysis indicates
it's quite sincere.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.292
Sorry, but I really
doubt that.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.161
There's no need to.

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:02.897
I can relate to fighting
for those you love.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.398
And the pain you
feel when you fail.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.567
Ai...

00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:09.837
So then let's see
who's stronger:

00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:12.707
A duelist like you who has
everything to lose,

00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:17.143
or a duelist like me
who has nothing to lose.

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.381
It's my turn!

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:27.220
First off, FIRE PHOENIX
automatically resurrects,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.256
at the start of my turn.

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:31.925
Then I summon HIYARI @IGNISTER!

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.162
Oh man, I can't
believe this.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.698
Ai's already
rebuilt his army.

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:39.766
That's what happens when
you give your opponent

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.068
a chance
to keep dueling

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:44.004
instead of defeating them
as quickly as possible.

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.673
Zaizen and Blue Maiden
are dueling pretty well!

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.709
(Varis)
But not well enough.

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.511
(Soulburner)
Speak for yourself.

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:52.413
Even if Ai uses JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:54.514
to double his PHOENIX's
attack points,

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.749
it still won't be stronger

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.885
than Zaizen
and Blue Maiden's monsters.

00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:00.187
They might not have
this duel in the bag yet,

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.421
but they're close!

00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:03.624
You sure about that, Burnsie?

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:06.827
By tributing my FIRE PHOENIX
@IGNISTER,

00:07:06.961 --> 00:07:10.664
HIYARI's ability lets me draw
A.I.'S RITUAL from my deck.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:13.900
And furthermore,
since I tributed a Link Monster,

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.135
HIYARI gains a Level

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.771
for every one
of FIRE PHOENIX's links.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.242
But you see,
that's only half the story.

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:22.976
HIYARI also lets me draw

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.079
an @IGNISTER Ritual Monster
from my deck.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:30.117
Then I activate my Ritual Spell,
A.I.'S RITUAL!

00:07:30.217 --> 00:07:32.820
To carry this off
it requires me to tribute

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.656
@IGNISTERS from my hand
or on my field

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.124
whose total Level is more

00:07:37.257 --> 00:07:39.293
than the Ritual Monster
I want to summon.

00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:42.463
But the only monster
you have is HIYARI.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.897
(Ai)
That's true.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.967
But when that Water @IGNISTER
is on my field,

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:49.937
I can banish an @IGNISTER
from my graveyard

00:07:50.037 --> 00:07:51.638
to also pay
for the cost!

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.375
I tribute HIYARI

00:07:54.442 --> 00:07:56.943
and banish PIKARI
from my graveyard!

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:01.348
This ferocious dragon awakens

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:05.018
from the deepest trenches
to flood the world with fear!

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.786
I Ritual Summon!

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.991
WATER LEVIATHAN @IGNISTER!

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.064
Now I activate its ability!

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:21.635
When my WATER LEVIATHAN
is successfully Ritual Summoned,

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:24.104
all your monsters
whose original attack points

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.840
are 2300 or less
return to your hand.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.208
Say what?

00:08:33.113 --> 00:08:35.149
I thought that weakness
was obvious

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:38.185
but it looks like Zaizen
wasn't ready for that move.

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:39.687
There's more.

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:42.722
WATER LEVIATHAN also returns
all my Link Monsters

00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:44.357
to my Extra Deck,

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:47.127
and your monster loses
600 attack points

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:51.865
for every one of their links,
so sit back and awwww away!

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:54.401
I return LINGY, DARK TEMPLAR

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.870
and FIRE PHOENIX
to my Extra Deck.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:59.172
Altogether,

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.608
that adds up to a whopping
seven Links!

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:04.878
So your TINDANGLE HOUND is...

00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.014
more meh,
than heh!

00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:11.084
Since it loses 600
attack points for each link...

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:12.352
Ha-ha!

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:15.188
That's 4200 attack points!

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:18.959
Here goes!

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:22.596
WATER LEVIATHAN,
attack TINDANGLE HOUND!

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:25.632
(gasps)

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.768
They're done for!
Not yet.

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:30.404
Since Ai's WATER LEVIATHAN
is a Ritual Monster

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:31.906
and not
a Link Monster,

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:34.908
JUDGMENT ARROWS can't
double its attack points.

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:36.009
Oh yeah!

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.578
That means they'll have
100 life points left.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.348
Can't believe Ai forgot
to get that last lil' bit.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:45.185
Actually I haven't
forgotten anything.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.388
When my WATER LEVIATHAN
battles your monster,

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:51.258
your monster's attack points
are cut in half!

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.628
They better think
of something ASAP.

00:09:54.762 --> 00:09:57.464
Cuz if this attack gets through
this duel's over.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.372
Akira! No!

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:10.077
No way!
You're still alive?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.846
He still has
150 life points!

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.281
(Ai)
But how?

00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:15.949
(Zaizen)
With this!

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.553
While you were
so busy attacking me,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.421
you forgot all about Skye.

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:24.258
And her trap card
MARINCESS BUBBLE CIRCLE.

00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:27.094
When there are MARINCESS
monsters in our graveyard,

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:29.029
MARINCESS BUBBLE CIRCLE restores

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:31.798
100 life points
for every one of their links.

00:10:32.266 --> 00:10:34.401
MARINCESS BLUE SLUG
and CORAL ANEMONE

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:35.402
are in our graveyard,

00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:37.437
and they have a total
of three Links.

00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:41.008
Therefore,
we regained 300 life points.

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:44.411
Though Zaizen wasn't ready
for the Dark Ignis's strategy,

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.079
Blue Maiden was.

00:10:50.584 --> 00:10:51.918
How's that, Ai!

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:55.422
I told you that I'll do
anything to protect Akira!

00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.424
Yes, yes you did.

00:10:57.557 --> 00:10:59.527
And you were successful.

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:03.163
All I can do now is place
one card facedown

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:04.531
and end my turn.

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:09.069
But I wonder if your success can
last to the end of this duel.

00:11:15.643 --> 00:11:17.644
(Ai)
You've survived
to see another turn,

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:19.280
but spoiler alert!

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.747
It's gonna be your last.

00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:22.449
Yeah, right.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:26.320
First, I summon
MARINCESS BLUE TANG!

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:28.822
And due
to BLUE TANG's ability

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:32.526
I send MARINCESS SEA HORSE
from my deck to the graveyard!

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:33.994
Then I'll use BLUE TANG

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:38.164
to Link Summon
Link 1 MARINCESS BLUE SLUG!

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.335
BLUE SLUG's ability
lets me retrieve

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:44.604
my SEA HORSE from my graveyard!

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.774
And then due
to BLUE TANG's ability,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.476
I get to look at the top
three cards in my deck.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.345
And if one of 'em's a MARINCESS,

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:53.314
I can add it to my hand.

00:11:53.414 --> 00:11:55.349
Just like the one I have here,

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:56.817
MARINCESS CROWN TAIL!

00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:59.953
Next, I can automatically
summon my SEA HORSE

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.689
next to BLUE SLUG's link.

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:05.059
And I'll use them together
to Link Summon again!

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.827
Link 2 MARINCESS CORAL ANEMONE!

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:13.734
Then check this out, Ai!

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.869
CORAL ANEMONE can
revive BLUE SLUG

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.804
and can summon her
next to her link!

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:22.543
And I'll use 'em to Link Summon
for a third time!

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:25.545
Link 3 MARINCESS MARBLED ROCK!

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:33.220
When CORAL ANEMONE
is sent to the graveyard,

00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:36.057
I get to add
BLUE TANG to my hand.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.760
Next, by banishing MARINCESS
SEA HORSE from my graveyard,

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:41.895
I can summon CROWN TAIL
from my hand

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.897
next to MARBLED ROCK's link.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.704
I now have what I need
to build the circuit

00:12:50.838 --> 00:12:53.541
that turns dreams into reality!

00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:55.142
The summoning conditions require

00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:58.211
at least two Water Attribute
monsters!

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:04.918
Though a single tiny droplet
may appear insignificant,

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:09.222
they combine to fill every ocean
on the planet with their purity!

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:11.458
I Link Summon!

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:14.628
Link 4 MARINCESS
GREAT BUBBLE REEF!

00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:21.435
Impressive!

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.403
I've never seen
that monster.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.607
It seems Blue Maiden has
certainly elevated her game.

00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:30.644
(Blue Maiden)
I activate my trap card
MARINCESS BUBBLE CIRCLE!

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:32.112
By banishing a Level 5

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:34.381
or higher MARINCESS
from my graveyard,

00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:36.316
you take 100 points of damage!

00:13:39.253 --> 00:13:40.220
Huh.

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:42.089
You did all that work
plus the extra credit

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.725
just to deal me
100 points of damage?

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:45.959
You're up to something.

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:48.061
You got that right,
and it's called

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.130
GREAT BUBBLE REEF's
special ability!

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:53.133
When a monster is banished
from the field or the graveyard,

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.402
GREAT BUBBLE REEF
gains 600 attack points

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:56.903
until the end of the turn!

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.541
Oh I see.

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:02.843
So this is what you
were going for.

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:05.780
Ai only has
300 life points left.

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.848
But to get to 'em,
Blue Maiden's gotta get

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:10.518
thru WATER LEVIATHAN,
which has a special ability

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:12.787
that cuts the opponent's
attack points in half.

00:14:12.987 --> 00:14:15.055
Since it has 2300 attack points,

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.824
she needs at least
4600 to destroy it.

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.326
Too bad, Blue.

00:14:19.393 --> 00:14:21.394
You may've powered up
your monster,

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.196
but not enough to destroy mine!

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:24.732
Then I'll just activate

00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.234
TINDANGLE RETURNER's
special ability!

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.336
It returns itself to my hand

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:32.505
and it also returns one banished
monster to my graveyard.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.808
MARINCESS CROWN TAIL!

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.513
Then I'll use MARINCESS
BUBBLE CIRCLE's effect again

00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:42.682
to banish my MARINCESS
CROWN TAIL from the graveyard

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:45.719
and deal you 100 more
points of damage!

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:49.990
(grunts)

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:54.561
(Blue Maiden)
Then GREAT BUBBLE REEF
gains 600 attack points!

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:59.633
Blue Maiden's working
two different strategies to win.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.703
Either use special abilities
to chip down Ai's life points,

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.605
or power up GREAT BARRIER REEF

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.239
'til it's stronger
than WATER LEVIATHAN.

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:09.276
Since Ai has to take
both strategies into account,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.078
it's straining what he can do.

00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:14.782
My GREAT BUBBLE REEF has
an additional ability.

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:17.717
By discarding a MARINCESS
card to the graveyard,

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.587
I can summon
my banished CROWN TAIL.

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:26.092
And now, I'm going to play
my brother's card!

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:30.397
I'm allowed to summon
TINDANGLE RETURNER

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:33.366
by tributing
my MARINCESS CROWN TAIL!

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:38.705
(small grunt)

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:40.074
And then,

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:42.709
GREAT BUBBLE REEF gains
CROWN TAIL's attack points

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.244
until the end of the turn!

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.249
It's up to 4400
attack points.

00:15:49.383 --> 00:15:51.919
And CROWN TAIL's
in her graveyard again.

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:55.422
That means she can use
BUBBLE CIRCLE to deal damage

00:15:55.556 --> 00:15:56.523
and also increase

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.392
her GREAT BUBBLE REEF's
attack points

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:01.261
to close in on victory
from both sides.

00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:02.162
Mmm.

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:05.098
Even I can tell
you're in bad shape!

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:07.434
Well looks can be
quite deceiving.

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.269
Just cuz I look
like I'm in trouble

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:11.104
doesn't mean I am in trouble.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:14.141
If anyone can
turn this around, it's me!

00:16:14.508 --> 00:16:16.242
My analysis of its voice pattern

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.979
indicate it is 3%
actual confidence,

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.115
97% overcompensation.

00:16:21.482 --> 00:16:23.917
Then let's drop
that three to zero!

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:26.153
I banish CROWN TAIL
from my graveyard

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:28.255
to activate her ability!

00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:32.626
For every link that a MARINCESS
in my graveyard has,

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:36.096
I take 1000 fewer points
of battle damage.

00:16:36.497 --> 00:16:40.367
The MARINCESSES in her graveyard
have a total of six links.

00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:44.438
So even if the Dark Ignis deals
6000 points of battle damage,

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:46.506
they won't lose
a single life point.

00:16:47.074 --> 00:16:48.775
I know you're being cautious,

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:53.113
but don't you think 6000 points
is going a bit overboard?

00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:54.815
But don't worry, Master!

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:56.149
When you lose,

00:16:56.283 --> 00:16:59.653
I promise to do all that I can
and more to get your revenge!

00:16:59.787 --> 00:17:01.722
I haven't lost yet!

00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:03.057
And now I activate

00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:05.058
GREAT BUBBLE REEF's
special ability

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:07.827
to give her 600
extra attack points!

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:12.099
5000 attack points.

00:17:12.233 --> 00:17:13.901
That's more than enough
attack points

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.470
to destroy Ai's
WATER LEVIATHAN.

00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:18.305
LEVIATHAN can
use its ability

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:21.375
to cut BUBBLE REEF's
attack points to 2500,

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.144
but LEVIATHAN
only has 2300.

00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:26.313
(Blue Maiden)
Ever since we were kids,

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.382
Akira had to look after me
cuz I was the lil' sister.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.386
And sure,
he went overboard sometimes.

00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:34.188
Wait, did I say sometimes?

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:35.489
I meant all the time.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.858
But as frustrating as it was,
I get it.

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:39.593
He just wanted to protect me.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.228
So never in a million years

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:44.231
could I have imagined that
we'd be fighting side-by-side.

00:17:44.931 --> 00:17:45.766
And now,

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.667
I'm the one who's
gonna protect him,

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.336
just like he protected me!

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:53.741
Time to battle!

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:55.375
MARINCESS GREAT BUBBLE REEF,

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:58.078
attack his WATER LEVIATHAN
@IGNISTER

00:17:58.212 --> 00:17:59.512
and end
this duel!

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:04.285
Oh yeah?

00:18:04.585 --> 00:18:06.587
WATER LEVIATHAN's
special ability

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:09.256
cuts your monster's
attack points in half!

00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:11.625
Yeah? So...?

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:14.761
But your monster will still
be destroyed, Master!

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:16.796
I can't do anything about that,

00:18:17.164 --> 00:18:18.965
but I can do this!

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:21.902
I activate my trap, HA.I.!

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.603
I'm glad our monsters

00:18:23.737 --> 00:18:25.872
are getting to know
each other face-to-face

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.441
because when they battle,

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:28.809
you take damage equal

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.444
to double the difference
in their attack points.

00:18:31.545 --> 00:18:33.781
You should've
never attacked, Blue.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:36.283
Fire back, WATER LEVIATHAN!

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:40.220
The difference between
the two monsters

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:42.089
is 200 attack points.

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:43.924
And she's gonna take
double the damage!

00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:44.958
That's right,

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:46.927
and since this damage
is from a trap

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:47.995
and not from
a battle,

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:50.964
Blue Maiden can't use
CROWN TAIL to stop it!

00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:56.269
Hang on, Skye!

00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:58.271
Akira!

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:09.316
GG you two, GG.

00:19:11.852 --> 00:19:12.886
Akira...

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.187
Skye, take...

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:15.889
my hand.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.995
Sorry, Skye.

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:21.861
I wish I...

00:19:22.963 --> 00:19:24.030
did more.

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:25.565
Don't say that.

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:27.534
You've done...

00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:29.970
more for me than you
can ever imagine.

00:19:32.639 --> 00:19:33.173
No...

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:36.376
Akira...

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:39.446
Way to win the duel,
Master!

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:40.881
That was amazing!

00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:42.182
Thank you.

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:44.384
And their loss is our gain

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:47.721
because now Zaizen's
code key is mine.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:54.161
Well, now that was fun.

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:55.962
I'll be seeing you,
Blue Maiden.

00:19:56.563 --> 00:19:57.865
Ta-ta...

00:19:57.965 --> 00:19:59.699
(Roboppi)
Yeah, ta-ta...

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:01.869
Time to go.

00:20:02.002 --> 00:20:03.637
Right on,
Master!

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:04.337
(Playmaker)
Ai!

00:20:04.437 --> 00:20:04.938
Wait!

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:06.439
Uh, yes?

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:09.476
I... I just...

00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:13.613
Good talk Playmaker,
good talk.

00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:16.350
Wait up, Ai!

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.885
I know that you know
that this isn't cool!

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:20.487
You're not
a bad guy!

00:20:20.687 --> 00:20:22.956
You're wrong.
It is.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:24.391
(gasps)

00:20:25.226 --> 00:20:27.861
It's been tricking you
this whole time.

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.998
The Dark Ignis has shown
its true colors.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.700
And I'll be the one
to fade it to black!

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:36.169
(giggles)

00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:39.373
Good luck with that.

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:41.508
Later, Playmaker.

00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:43.109
Ai...

00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:45.879
Akira...

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:07.400
