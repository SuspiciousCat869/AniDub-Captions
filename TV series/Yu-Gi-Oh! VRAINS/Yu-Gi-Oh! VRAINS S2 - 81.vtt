WEBVTT

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:22.289
(Gore)
I can feel it...

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:25.525
I can feel my mind
filling with every card...

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.661
with every combo...

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.197
I've become the perfect duelist,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.599
so victory's in my grasp.

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.569
(Playmaker)
Is it?

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.342
Playmaker... You're going down.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.847
Gore's brainwaves
are perfectly synchronizing

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.515
with his upgraded AI chip.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:49.917
But his heart rate
and blood pressure

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:52.286
are rapidly rising
to dangerous levels!

00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:56.022
(grunts)

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:05.265
♪♪♪

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.385
Kenneth.

00:01:58.852 --> 00:01:59.886
It isn't fair.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.824
It took our whole lives
to finally see eye to eye,

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.161
but it only took a second
to rip us apart.

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.331
It's another reason
to end this war ASAP,

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.233
because no one should have
to feel the way I do now.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.141
These past few days
were like sandpaper

00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:21.575
'cause they've been rough.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.810
I mean, first we lose Earth,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.079
now Ghost Gal's brother
is gone.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.915
Who'd a thought Kolter's bro Jin
would be the luckiest one

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.483
'cause at least
he's still around.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.719
Ahem.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:32.620
Huh?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.821
Not the right time.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.089
Oh...

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.659
Umm... my bad.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.493
You mad?

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.228
(Kolter)
Yeah. But not at you.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:42.429
At Lightning.

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:43.664
Phew...

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.565
In that battle of theirs,

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:46.733
Lightning was prepared

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.236
for every single one
of The Shepherd's strategies.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:50.971
Yeah, and then some.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:52.973
He was practically
toying with him.

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.742
(Flame)
And his intellect
will only continue to improve,

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.979
like every other Ignis I know,
with the exception of one.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.283
Aww c'mon, Flame.
Don't insult yourself like that.

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:04.985
I wasn't talking about me.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.721
Then you shouldn't talk
about Aqua like that!

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:09.223
I found something!

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:10.558
Huh? Huh?

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:12.492
(Kolter)
A signal's coming from here.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.662
You see that?

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.631
Yeah, it's an Ignis
algorithm.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:20.134
More specifically, Earth's.

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:21.802
What? Earth's?

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.504
Don't get my hopes up.

00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:25.205
Are you sure it isn't a glitch?

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:27.274
Nope, it's not a glitch.

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.210
But I thought SOL Tech
decompiled him.

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.679
Maybe he escaped.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.714
Yeah? Yeah... Yeah!

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.382
(laughing)
Yeah!!!!!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.385
I said maybe, not definitely.

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.386
(laughing)

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.555
Uh, c'mon.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.223
Way to adverb the party.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:44.958
I think what Flame's gettin' at

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.561
is that when something sounds
too good to be true,

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:48.796
it often is.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.397
It could be a trap.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.167
Yeah... and it could
also be Earth!

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:54.234
Don't get me wrong.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.836
I wasn't trying
to discourage you.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.505
I was just pointing out
that we should be careful.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.608
Just 'cause our last three,
make that four,

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.512
times turned out to be traps
doesn't mean this one will.

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:06.847
You do realize that
the thing about traps

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.249
is that it only
has to work once.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.051
(Ai)
So you think we shouldn't go?

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:12.619
(Flame)
I didn't say that.

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.454
Then why don't we go
check it out.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:15.455
Right.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:18.259
It's time...

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.926
(Yusaku &amp; Theodore)
To link into the VRAINS!

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:25.966
(Skye)
Ghost Gal...

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.168
Playmaker and Soulburner
just logged into LINK VRAINS.

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:30.338
(Emma)
Send me their coordinates.

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:31.505
(Skye)
I already did.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.907
(Emma)
Nice one, partner.
Way to read my mind!

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.444
We should go there too, Aqua.

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:38.612
Yes...

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.113
Hey, something wrong?

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:41.781
I don't know...

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.250
It's just a feeling.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.885
About what?

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.954
That something really,
really bad is going to happen.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.357
Excuse me, Queen,

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.059
I assume you know
that Playmaker and Soulburner

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.895
have both logged
into LINK VRAINS.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.130
I do.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.599
(Zaizen)
So am I also correct
to assume

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.868
that you're going to
send Gore after them?

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.837
Well, I can't send
The Shepherd now, can I?

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:06.674
Gore is the only one who has
the skills to defeat them,

00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.242
and their Ignis of course.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:09.843
That may be true,

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.180
but Gore is breaking down
both mentally and physically.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.148
The AI chip implanted
in his brain

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.251
is not good
for his long-term health.

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.420
I don't care about
the long term,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.921
only the short term.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.957
And the short-term
is to capture the Ignis

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:24.191
no matter what the cost.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.525
(gasps)

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.196
The Ignis carry a wealth of data
for SOL Technologies to exploit.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.465
Data that will ensure
SOL Tech's growth

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:33.968
and profitability
for the future.

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.503
But you must've already
gotten everything you need

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:37.672
from the Earth Ignis.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:39.773
(Queen)
No, I want more.

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.008
It's just business, Zaizen.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:43.577
Just business?

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:44.844
It's not right
to put Gore in any--

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:47.847
Your objections
are noted and dismissed!

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.917
Besides, you're
already too late.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:51.685
(sighs)

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:56.257
(Queen)
I already sent him
to LINK VRAINS,

00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:58.024
at his request.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.933
(Kolter)
You're pretty much on top
of the coordinates, guys.

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:09.703
Earth might be hiding in one
of these floating islands.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.572
Well, then...
Let's search each of them.

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:14.408
You hear something?

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.810
Yes, someone's droppin'
out of the sky.

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:18.579
I can't quite make it out yet...

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.381
But it's gotta be Earth!

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:23.650
C'mon, buddy!
Give your ol' pal a hug!

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:26.586
Never mind!

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.021
(sighs)

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:28.755
(sighs)

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.023
Ooh.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:33.326
You!

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:34.662
(laughs)

00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:37.764
What a surprise running
into you here, Playmaker.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.700
Yes, Gore, quite the surprise.

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:48.042
Things have just gotten
more interesting.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:52.045
You know what you must do, Gore.
Bring that Ignis to me.

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.580
Hey, Playmaker,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.316
it's time to cash in
my bounty pork chop.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.018
Man, he doesn't look good.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:00.754
It's like someone left him
in the dryer for too long...

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.157
and forgot to add in
the fabric softener.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.258
Yes, Gore has become
the battery

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.460
to power the AI chip
in his brain.

00:07:07.561 --> 00:07:09.930
And it drained him
from a D to a AAA.

00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:11.898
Gore, I don't know
if you looked in the mirror,

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.735
but you gotta get yourself
to a hospital for real.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.770
You don't need
to worry about me.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.139
You should worry more
about your friend there.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.741
Because you're up next!

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:23.811
Ai, it appears that Gore
is quite confident

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:26.646
that he's going to defeat
you and Playmaker.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.316
You don't think I'm afraid
of that dehydrated raisin,

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.550
over there, do ya?!

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.719
I'm gonna stomp ya

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:33.821
and get you back
for what you did to Earth!

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.823
I cannot wait to see you try.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.092
That won't be happening, Gore.

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:39.926
I have no interest
in dueling you.

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:41.895
Huh? You don't?

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.132
Since when does Playmaker
not want to duel?

00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:46.767
We shouldn't be
fighting each other,

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.103
we should be fighting
alongside each other.

00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:51.471
We were allies before,
and we can be again.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.743
This ally you're talking about
captured my ally Earth!

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.378
I know, Ai. I know...

00:07:57.478 --> 00:07:59.279
But just because
someone loses their way

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.648
doesn't mean he can't find
his way back.

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.883
So I'm not going
to give up on Gore.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.185
Ain't that sweet.

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.722
And I'm not giving up on
mashin' ya into a pulpy mess.

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.292
Well, you certainly got
through to him, Playmaker.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.328
Just give it time.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:16.864
But time's the one thing
we don't have much of.

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:18.966
Why do ya wanna
take us down so badly?

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.000
Here's the why.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.836
Because, Playmaker,
you beat Varis in a duel.

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.604
(Ai)
Wasn't that a good thing?

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.039
(Gore)
But Varis beat me.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.176
(Ai)
I... can see
how that's a bad thing.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.811
But I could never have
beat Varis without your help,

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:34.147
'cause you discovered what
special card he was using...

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:36.717
and that information was
the key to my victory, Gore.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.151
(Gore)
Blah blah blah.

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.020
The end story is
that you beat Varis

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.555
and Varis beat me,

00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:44.058
meaning you were a better
duelist than me.

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.326
And that don't sit right.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.295
(Playmaker)
Gore, winning isn't everything.

00:08:48.662 --> 00:08:51.398
You're right, Playmaker.
It's the only thing.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.568
I pretended it didn't bother me.
But it did.

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:56.804
Do you know how it feels
to risk everything,

00:08:56.871 --> 00:08:59.539
to risk your whole life
and still lose?

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:01.675
Well, I'll tell ya.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:03.844
It makes you feel worthless.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:04.911
Oh man.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:09.449
So then, to prove that I'm
actually worth anything,

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:13.353
I gotta defeat the best
and that means you.

00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.288
Playmaker.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.093
So get ready to lose...

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:20.461
I don't see any way

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:22.596
that Playmaker
can get out of this duel.

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:24.297
Me neither, Flame.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:29.269
If this is what you need, Gore,
then you and I will duel.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:30.738
Excellent!

00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:32.506
That's all my ears
wanted to hear

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.507
coming out of those
lips of yours.

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:39.780
Okay, Playmaker...

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.914
(Both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:53.260
My mission directive
may be to capture your Ignis...

00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:56.730
But my true mission...

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.965
is to defeat you, Playmaker!

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:05.539
(roars)

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.509
I'll play this facedown.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.947
And with that I end my turn.

00:10:13.581 --> 00:10:16.616
(Ai)
That's the same move he pulled
in his duel against Earth.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.253
If Gore believes
that will work against me,

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:21.422
then he'll be making
a serious mistake.

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:22.289
Check it out.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.957
I think that's
Playmaker dueling.

00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:24.524
Wow.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.559
It is.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.627
(Avatar A)
And Gore.

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:28.595
(Avatar B)
You sure that's Gore?

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.263
Looks more like jerky.

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:31.798
Beef jerky.

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.334
(Aqua)
Flame!

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:35.435
(Flame)
Aqua!

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:38.538
Is that really Gore?

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:39.573
Yeah.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.242
Or whatever's
actually left of him.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:45.379
You all worked together
to save LINK VRAINS...

00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:48.082
But now you're here
dueling against each other.

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:51.251
He wants to win so badly
that he forgot who he is

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:52.753
and sold himself out.

00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.956
I must admit that this new Gore
would've given me trouble

00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.391
in our previous duel.

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:00.527
But the price he paid,
his very humanity,

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:02.095
isn't worth it.

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.663
Because what's a victory

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.166
if you have to sell
your soul to get it?

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:09.804
Remember, Playmaker,
Gore can stop our Skill.

00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:12.172
So we gotta play this
as if we don't have one.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:12.973
Right.

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:15.009
It's my turn!

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.910
I'll play this facedown!

00:11:18.012 --> 00:11:20.680
I summon LINKSLAYER!

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.351
I can automatically
summon it from my hand

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.486
when I have no monsters
on my field.

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:30.123
Next I summon STORM CIPHER!

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.529
And when I successfully
summon a Cyberse monster,

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.598
then I'm also allowed
to also summon

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:38.865
BOOT STAGGERED.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.671
Playmaker has already summoned
three powerful monsters.

00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:46.406
He's not pulling
any punches in this duel.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:49.910
He wants this over before
Gore's AI chip kicks in.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.345
Here I go!

00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:54.682
STORM CIPHER,
attack his facedown monster!

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:57.484
You mean
my DINOWRESTLER VALEONYX.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:00.220
(Playmaker)
Since it has 0 defense points,
it's destroyed!

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:05.259
I discard
DINOWRESTLER MARTIAL ANGA

00:12:05.359 --> 00:12:07.394
to activate
its special ability.

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.697
My VALEONYX can no longer
be destroyed in battle

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:14.034
against a monster with equal
or higher attack points.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.836
(roars)

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.505
And you can't attack
for the rest of this turn.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.406
Whaaaaa?

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.208
Why ya gotta
flatten our tires?

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:23.377
That move sure
slammed the brakes

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:25.312
on Playmaker's plan, didn't it?

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.580
Indeed.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.183
His strategy to win quickly
can be a detriment

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:30.884
if the duel lasts too long.

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:34.755
Well, I end my turn.
You're up.

00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:36.256
What's the rush,
Playmaker?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.024
I'm beginning
to feel like...

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.427
you no longer want
to hang out with me.

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:41.562
Duh!

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:43.697
'Cause who wants to hang out
with a chumcruckle!

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:44.998
Ah!

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.366
I meant that respectfully.

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.335
Call me whatever...

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:50.504
'Cause when this is
all said and done,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.706
you're going to be
calling me one thing...

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:53.907
and that's the champion.

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:56.210
(Ai)
More like chump-ion, am I right?

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.144
(laughs)

00:12:57.244 --> 00:12:59.079
While you choose
to battle with words,

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.082
I choose to battle
with my cards.

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.384
I activate MARTIAL ANGA's
special ability!

00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:07.621
When you have more monsters
on the field than I do...

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:10.790
I'm allowed to resummon it
from my graveyard.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.395
And just like that,

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.130
whatever lead you thought
you had is gone.

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:19.500
You disappoint me.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.802
And y' wanna know why,
Playmaker?

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:24.204
While I moved mountains
to get on your level,

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.573
you're doing
the same moves as always.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.409
Meaning while I'm evolvin',
you're stuck in the mud.

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:32.546
And you're gonna find out
that this complacency...

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:34.614
is gonna cost you!

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.950
His chip must be
getting stronger

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.486
if he's now using words
like "complacency".

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:42.222
It's my turn. I draw.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.428
And here's proof to show ya
how my game's growin'.

00:13:47.495 --> 00:13:50.330
I set two DINOWRESTLERS
in the Link Arrows!

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:56.804
I Link Summon Link 2
DINOWRESTLER TERRA PARKOURIO!

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:59.540
(roars)

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.709
All that work to get a monster
with a thousand attack points?

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.144
Huh, your carnivore is more of--

00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:06.447
(Gore)
More of a carni-chore.
Predictable.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.616
But I know you couldn't
predict this card!

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:12.686
My spell CRAZY EVOLUTION

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:15.855
allows me to summon
a DINOWRESTLER from my hand

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.058
that has the same Level
as your monster

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:19.626
that's in defense mode.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.461
Your STORM CIPHER

00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:23.663
that's in defense mode
is Level 4,

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:26.066
so that means I can summon

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:29.470
my Level 4 DINOWRESTLER
SYSTEGOSAUR!

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:33.107
And SYSTEGOSAUR's
special ability activates

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.041
allowing me to add the spell

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.511
WORLD DINO WRESTLING,
from my deck.

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:40.480
Furthermore, CRAZY EVOLUTION

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:43.350
changes the Type
of all my monsters.

00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:46.853
So my Dinosaurs
evolve into Cyberses.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.122
(Ai)
Wait.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.058
Why would he want Cyberses
when his deck is full of Dinos?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.693
(shrieks)

00:14:55.162 --> 00:14:56.396
Aqua what's wrong?

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.967
I sense something in Gore's deck
that can't be true!

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:03.604
(sighs)

00:15:04.071 --> 00:15:08.109
I changed my Dinosaurs
into Cyberses so I can do this!

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:10.844
Concentrate my circuit!

00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:13.747
I'm summoning
a Cyberse Link Monster!

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:15.883
One that you're familiar with!

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:16.883
(gasps)

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.453
I Link Summon.

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.923
Behold, Playmaker.

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:24.891
Ooh.

00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:29.796
(evil laugh)

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.064
Impossible...

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:32.799
CRYSTAL HEART?!

00:15:38.072 --> 00:15:41.174
That's Aqua's--
I mean, Earth's monster!

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.611
No...

00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:49.784
(Zaizen)
Gore summoned Earth's monster?

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:51.084
But how?

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:53.520
That's unless...

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.624
(Ai)
I don't know how you got
your paws on that card,

00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:58.859
but take your paws
off that card!

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:01.795
Because CRYSTAL HEART
doesn't belong to you, Gore!

00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:04.030
It belongs to Earth!

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:05.766
If that's the case,

00:16:05.866 --> 00:16:08.402
I don't see what the problem is
with me using it.

00:16:08.502 --> 00:16:10.170
Because I am Earth.

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:11.471
Which part?

00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:13.173
The shape of your heads?

00:16:13.507 --> 00:16:14.341
(Gore)
No.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.276
The part where SOL Tech

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:19.613
inputted Earth's data
into my AI chip

00:16:20.014 --> 00:16:23.116
Whaaaaaa?

00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:25.018
That's right.

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:26.854
(all gasps)
That glitch.

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.824
Earth is now a part of me.

00:16:30.024 --> 00:16:32.025
No, poor Earth.

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:35.863
SOL Tech decided to mess
with Gore's brain even more.

00:16:35.963 --> 00:16:37.030
I would say...

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:40.300
I'm surprised but nothing
SOL Tech does surprises me.

00:16:45.406 --> 00:16:47.908
You uploaded Earth
into Gore's AI chip?

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:49.009
Was that wrong?

00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:50.610
Everything's wrong with that!

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.413
Do have any idea how dangerous
and immoral that is?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.348
Why would you ever decide
to do something

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:57.351
so completely irresponsible?

00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:58.752
(Queen)
Because I ordered it.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:16:59.352
(sighs)

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.689
By upgrading Gore,
his odds of success increase.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.925
I told you I wanted
the other Ignis

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:06.760
by any means necessary.

00:17:06.894 --> 00:17:09.697
(Zaizen)
But... but this is just so...

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:11.431
By any means necessary.

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:12.899
(grunts)

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.002
You clearly don't have
the stomach for it,

00:17:15.068 --> 00:17:16.737
so it's lucky that I do.

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:19.473
That's why I'm paid
to make the tough decisions

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:20.907
though I have to admit,

00:17:21.008 --> 00:17:23.376
this decision wasn't
all that tough.

00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:27.514
(Aqua)
They put Earth's life into him?

00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:30.751
(Flame)
They did, as if his life
meant nothing at all.

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:32.920
(grunts)

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.920
Oh!

00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:35.756
So when Kolter detected
Earth's signal,

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.657
he was actually detecting Gore?

00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:38.926
That's right.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.061
It was a trap
to lure us all along.

00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.163
And you fell for it.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.664
Another trap!

00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:46.033
Don't be so upset.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.802
Instead, why not look
on the bright side?

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:50.237
What bright side?

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:54.207
You actually thought you lost
the Earth Ignis forever.

00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:57.511
But, you see,
it lives on inside of me.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.813
(grunts)

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.248
And so together,

00:18:01.315 --> 00:18:04.084
the Earth Ignis and I
will defeat you!

00:18:04.151 --> 00:18:07.220
But know this, I am thankful
to the Earth Ignis.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.588
Because with its data,

00:18:08.655 --> 00:18:10.991
I've been upgraded
into the perfect duelist.

00:18:11.125 --> 00:18:12.926
As you will learn first hand.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.429
TERRA PARKOURIO's
special ability

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.430
activates from my graveyard.

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:20.133
Since I used it to Link Summon,

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:23.136
I'm allowed to revive
a DINOWRESTLER from my graveyard

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:25.472
by negating
its special abilities!

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.308
Come back, MARTIAL ANGA!

00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:33.780
Next I activate CRYSTAL HEART's
special ability!

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:37.150
It lets me resurrect
an Earth Attribute Link Monster

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.221
from my graveyard and co-link it
with my CRYSTAL HEART!

00:18:41.321 --> 00:18:43.490
Rise up, TERRA PARKOURIO!

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.162
And whenever
it uses this ability,

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:51.732
CRYSTAL HEART gains
one G Golem Counter.

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.568
And for every Counter
that CRYSTAL HEART has,

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.937
it gives 600 attack points

00:18:57.038 --> 00:18:59.806
to all Earth monsters
it's linked to.

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:04.344
Gore is using CRYSTAL HEART
just as well as Earth did.

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:08.281
Now I activate my field spell
WORLD DINO WRESTLING!

00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.317
By doing so, it triggers

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.852
TERRA PARKOURIO's
special ability!

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.487
(roars)

00:19:14.788 --> 00:19:18.392
I get to retrieve a DINOWRESTLER
from my graveyard.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:20.493
Come back, my VALEONYX!

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.397
Not good!

00:19:23.797 --> 00:19:26.000
And now... I'll Link Summon!

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:29.370
The summoning conditions
are two or more DINOWRESTLERS.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.706
So I set MARTIAL ANGA
and TERRA PARKOURIO

00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:34.207
in the Link Arrows!

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.712
I Link Summon!

00:19:38.813 --> 00:19:42.716
Link 3 DINOWRESTLER
KING T WREXTLE!

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.789
(roars)

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:53.493
Ah!

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:57.565
(laughs)

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:00.734
I hope you're enjoying
this duel as much as I am,

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:03.103
because it's going
to be your last.

00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:16.716
