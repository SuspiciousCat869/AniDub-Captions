WEBVTT

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.005
How sad that that was
the best you could do.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.339
Because your best,

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.610
is what I like to call mediocre.

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.445
Yeah, well go call
someone who cares.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.783
Really, dude?

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.520
I'm sure Varis
is quaking in his boots.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.422
Don't lose your cool, bud.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.592
(Playmaker)
Varis isn't the type
to feign confidence,

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:26.260
so he's absolutely sure

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:28.362
that he's going
to win this duel.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:31.098
Another reason
I brought you here

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:32.999
to where the Lost Incident
occurred

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
was to remind you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.970
that this is where
the Fire Ignis was created.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.271
By watching you duel,

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.473
it's clear
that that the Fire Ignis

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.676
was the brains
and without that help,

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.010
you can't win.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.180
So enjoy your final moments
while they last!

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:48.915
It's my turn!

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.161
♪♪♪

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.346
First off!

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.383
I activate my spell card
FINAL OFFGUARD!

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.220
If I have less life
points than you,

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.922
and you're the
only one who has

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:04.257
a monster summoned
from their Extra Deck,

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.994
I get to draw two cards.

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.231
Next I activate my field spell
BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH!

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.634
It revives ANESTHROKKET DRAGON!

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.538
Then I play the Equip Spell...

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.373
BORREL REGENERATOR!

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.110
I resummon SILVERROKKET
DRAGON from my graveyard

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.379
and equip this card on to it!

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.049
Next, I activate
the spell card SQUIB DRAW.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.318
By destroying
my SILVERROKKET DRAGON

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.887
I can now draw two cards.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.590
That in turn triggers
BORREL REGENERATOR's effect,

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:38.725
letting me draw one more card!

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.327
Slow down, Varis.

00:02:40.428 --> 00:02:42.329
You're drawing more
than an artist.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.799
When I have a ROKKET in play,

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.534
I can summon ABSOROUTER DRAGON!

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.307
I use ABSOROUTER DRAGON

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:57.244
and ANESTHROKKET DRAGON
to Link Summon!

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:00.981
Link 2 QUADBORREL DRAGON!

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:04.518
When I use ABSOROUTER
DRAGON to Link Summon,

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.654
I get to draw a ROKKET monster
from my deck.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.556
Then I'll follow that up

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.459
with the spell
BORREL HALF REPLACE!

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.195
It summons a BORRELOAD
from my Extra Deck

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.997
that has the same
number of links

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.133
as the BORRELOAD DRAGON
that's in my graveyard!

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.770
Rise up, Link 4
BORRELSWORD DRAGON!

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.274
On the down side,

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.943
BORRELSWORD DRAGON loses
its special abilities

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.612
and half of its attack points.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:33.880
But on the upside,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550
BORREL HALF REPLACE
has another effect.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:38.285
By banishing it,

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.488
along with two ROKKET monsters
from my graveyard,

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.125
I can Link Summon
a Link 2 DARK monster

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:46.160
next to BORRELSWORD's link!

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:49.129
Come on out,
Link 2 BOOSTER DRAGON!

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.435
Then due
to QUADBORREL's ability,

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.837
I can discard
a card from my hand

00:03:57.938 --> 00:04:00.173
to destroy a monster
that's in play.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:01.275
But Varis,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.210
when my VIOLET CHIMERA
is equipped

00:04:03.344 --> 00:04:04.611
with SALAMANGREAT
KERNEL,

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.113
your special ability
can't destroy it!

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:10.250
But it can destroy
my BORRELSWORD DRAGON!

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.917
Hmmm.

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:13.887
(Varis)
In exchange,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.124
I can summon a ROKKET monster
from my hand or graveyard

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.227
for every link
that my BORRELSWORD DRAGON had.

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:22.963
So come on back,
MAGNAROKKET DRAGON

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:25.198
and ROKKET RECHARGER!

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.901
And with that,
I have set up my combo.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.037
BOOSTER DRAGON activates
its special ability

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:35.108
to give my MAGNAROKKET DRAGON
500 attack and defense points.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.343
If an ability

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.612
should target
MAGNAROKKET DRAGON,

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:40.781
it has to automatically
destroy itself,

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.515
but there is a catch.

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:45.686
It takes another monster
down with it!

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.054
Your CHIMERA's a goner!

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:52.526
Your CHIMERA's a goner!

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:53.961
That's not good.

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.929
That's key to Burnsie's survival

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.365
and without it
he's just like a calendar,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.433
because his days are numbered.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.403
Huh!

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.838
You should get
your eyes checked out

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:05.905
cuz you failed to spot

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.408
one important detail
about my cards.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.276
Ya see...

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.612
Due to SALAMANGREAT
KERNEL's effect,

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.848
your monster's abilities don't
work against VIOLET CHIMERA

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.017
unless your monster's
a Link monster,

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.351
which it's not!

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:21.856
If an ability doesn't work,
then how about a spell instead?

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.957
LINK BURST allows me
to draw a card

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.926
by destroying
one of my Link Monsters

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:27.428
and one of your monsters!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:31.498
So I destroy my BOOSTER DRAGON
and your VIOLET CHIMERA!

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:37.337
SALAMANGREAT KERNEL
has another effect!

00:05:37.438 --> 00:05:38.972
So check this out!

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.507
By returning a SALAMANGREAT

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:42.743
from my graveyard
to my Extra Deck,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.412
my VIOLET CHIMERA
can't be destroyed!

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:48.682
Looks like you're not
gonna to let it go.

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.650
You better believe it, Varis,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.419
and there's no way
you're getting rid of it

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:54.921
cuz my CHIMERA can't
be destroyed in battle

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.591
or by any abilities
for the rest of this turn!

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:58.658
Awesome!

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.061
That means VIOLET CHIMERA
will survive this turn

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.497
no matter what Varis
throws at him!

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.498
(Soulburner)
You destroyed
your BOOSTER DRAGON

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.301
and that got you
absolutely nowhere fast!

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.171
You would be correct

00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:14.808
if my intention was to destroy
your CHIMERA, which it wasn't.

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.309
Say what?

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:17.744
You see,

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.147
I wanted my BOOSTER DRAGON
to be destroyed.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.415
Because when it is,

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:25.318
its ability resummons BORRELOAD
DRAGON from my graveyard.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.487
Oh my.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.023
That's not good, Soulburner.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:34.027
Next, I send ROKKET RECHARGER
to the graveyard!

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:36.530
By doing so,

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:40.000
I can resurrect a Dark Attribute
monster from my graveyard.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.870
So Return to my field,
QUADBORREL DRAGON!

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:48.075
Next I summon my Tuner Monster
ROKKET SYNCHRON!

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.243
Its special ability resummons

00:06:50.344 --> 00:06:52.479
ABSOROUTER DRAGON
from my graveyard

00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:53.813
in defense mode.

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:55.015
(groans)

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:58.385
My Level 1 ROKKET SYNCHRON

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:01.721
tunes with my Level 7
ABSOROUTER DRAGON!

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:10.898
The fuel of the cosmos mixes
with the boundaries of speed

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:13.100
to transcend the beyond!

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:14.634
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.105
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON!

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:24.411
When BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.414
is successfully
Synchro Summoned,

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:29.583
it equips one Link Monster
from my graveyard.

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.586
And for every Link Arrow
that Link Monster has,

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:34.621
this DRAGON gains a Counter.

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:37.458
So I'll equip it
with BORRELSWORD DRAGON!

00:07:37.558 --> 00:07:40.060
Since BORRELSWORD DRAGON
has four Links,

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:43.264
my SAVAGE DRAGON gains
four Borrel Counters!

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.400
SAVAGE DRAGON also gains
half the attack points

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.637
of the monster it equips
raising its strength to 4500!

00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:56.210
Then I'll team it up
with a monster just as powerful!

00:07:56.877 --> 00:08:00.780
I set my two QUADBORREL DRAGONS
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.050
The evolution of the universe

00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:06.687
transforms nothing
into the infinite!

00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:11.524
I Link Summon!
Link 4 TOPOLOGIC ZEROBOROS!

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.795
A new TOPOLOGIC monster?

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.130
Whoa.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.866
Varis is quite the magician

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:21.502
because he's still coming up
with new tricks.

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:24.371
My ZEROBOROS gains
200 attack points

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:27.174
for every card
that's been banished!

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.943
Varis has banished
a total of four cards.

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:33.313
Therefore, ZEROBOROS
gains 800 attack points!

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:35.849
(Varis)
Now I can deal enough damage

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.318
to wipe out the rest
of your life points!

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:40.054
Game over.

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:41.187
Time to battle.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:42.956
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.191
Attack VIOLET CHIMERA!

00:08:51.298 --> 00:08:52.199
Soulburner,

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.468
things will only get
worse for you!

00:08:54.568 --> 00:08:56.370
Because BORRELOAD's
ability lowers

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.773
your monster's
attack points by 500!

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.610
I'll counter that by activating

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.079
my trap card
SALAMANGREAT GEYSER!

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.415
It lowers your monster's
attack points when I return--

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:09.883
No, you won't!

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.885
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON uses

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.788
one of its Borrel Counters
to negate your trap!

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:20.694
So you're taking the full
brunt of this attack!

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.530
Now Go! BORRELOAD!

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:24.531
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:28.001
Due to SALAMANGREAT
KERNEL's effect,

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.670
my VIOLET CHIMERA
can't be destroyed!

00:09:31.004 --> 00:09:33.173
But you still take damage.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.213
BORRELOAD SAVAGE DRAGON,

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.849
it's your turn
to blast his CHIMERA.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.285
Thunderclap Borrel Cannon!

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:49.022
VIOLET CHIMERA uses its ability
to double its attack points!

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:52.692
(screams)

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:55.095
(groans)

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.734
(grunts)

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:01.602
How's that!

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:03.604
You may have survived,

00:10:03.704 --> 00:10:06.340
but I still have
one last attack left!

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:08.508
Malicious destruction!

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:11.845
VIOLET CHIMERA
uses its ability again!

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:26.960
Varis is all out of attacks!

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.028
Way to hang in there!

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:33.533
With that I end
my turn.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.671
Not too shabby, Soulburner!

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.339
You used
all those cards

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:42.175
and made all those moves
and I'm still here standing!

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.177
I ended my turn,

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:46.346
but that certainly doesn't
mean that I'm done.

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:50.584
Yeah, that's exactly what ending
your turn means Varis.

00:10:50.884 --> 00:10:52.852
Time to learn something new.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.521
When MAGNAROKKET's
in my graveyard

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:55.756
at the end of my turn,

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:58.358
I can summon AUTOROKKET.

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:02.629
And this summon triggers...
ZEROBOROS' ability!

00:11:02.997 --> 00:11:03.964
Say what?

00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:07.834
When a monster is summoned
next to ZEROBOROS's link,

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:10.337
all cards on the field
are banished!

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:16.276
That's not fair!

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.744
Every card
will be gone?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.982
Field Eradication!

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.988
(Ai)
Varis wiped the slate clean.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.258
That means Soulburner has
to start from scratch.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:34.528
(Varis)
Since it's your turn,
you can now attack me.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.596
But I found that
it's hard to attack

00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:38.932
if you have nothing
to attack with.

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:41.802
(Soulburner)
Man, I hate it when he's right.

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.470
Not that I'm
every gonna admit it.

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:46.740
I knew winning this duel
wouldn't be easy,

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:49.309
but now he's made it
nearly impossible.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.145
But there's still
gotta be a way to win!

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.780
There's just gotta be!

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:57.017
(Varis)
I can see that behind
those eyes is a brain,

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.286
and that brain doesn't
know a way to win.

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:02.089
So you may have all the fire
and passion in the world,

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:03.323
but it doesn't matter.

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:04.591
(gasps)

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.993
Not if you don't
have the right cards.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.999
How do you do it, Varis?

00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:15.368
How do you wake up every day
knowing you're the bad guy?

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.871
Cuz your Lost Incident
caused a whole lotta harm

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:19.339
to a whole lotta people.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:22.309
Do you just block it out
of your mind

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:23.644
and forget what you did?

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:26.880
Cuz I can't forget a single
moment of the Lost Incident,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.648
no matter how hard I try.

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.552
Especially that first morning...

00:12:31.652 --> 00:12:34.254
cuz that was the last time
I saw my parents.

00:12:34.988 --> 00:12:37.658
I still remember
what I said to them.

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.093
Oh yeah?
What was it?

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.728
That I wanted
lasagna for dinner.

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:42.729
If I...

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.065
if I knew those
would be my last words,

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:46.766
yeah, I would've said more.

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.503
I would've said
that I wanted lasagna

00:12:50.137 --> 00:12:52.239
and that...
I'd love them forever.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.541
But I never got the chance

00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.476
because you took it
away from me.

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:58.645
I think about them every day.

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:01.148
And my heart breaks every time.

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.451
So I try to forget about it
to block out the pain,

00:13:04.551 --> 00:13:05.719
but I can't.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:08.155
So my heart keeps
breaking and breaking.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.058
My mind's stuck in the past,
and it can't get unstuck.

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.294
So I ask again,

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:16.496
what do you do
to forget the past?

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:18.765
So that you could move on?

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:20.968
And find a way
to live with yourself?

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:23.904
Please, Varis, I have to know!

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:26.873
(Varis)
You want to know my technique?

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:30.210
It's quite easy.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.812
You see, I don't try
to forget my past.

00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:35.282
If something,
or someone,

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.651
or some memory
is important to me,

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.486
why would I try to forget it?

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:42.422
I don't care if they're
good memories or bad ones.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.759
As long as they're important,
I'll never forget them.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:46.927
My...

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.663
Who knew Varis
was such a philosopher?

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:50.931
Because those memories

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:53.633
have made me
into the person I am today.

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:54.935
So trying to forget
them means

00:13:55.035 --> 00:13:56.903
you're trying
to forget yourself.

00:13:57.037 --> 00:13:58.539
And when you forget yourself,

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.875
you have no clue what to do,
or what to live for.

00:14:01.975 --> 00:14:05.445
I use my past to move forward
to do what is right.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:06.680
You mean what's wrong.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.816
My right may be your wrong,

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.818
but that doesn't
make my right wrong.

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.119
(Soulburner)
Stop with the word games!

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.288
(Varis)
Fine.

00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:16.056
I'll put it simply.

00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:18.792
I know what I'm fighting for.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.360
Do you?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.795
(Soulburner)
What am I fighting for?

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:23.463
Getting revenge against Varis

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:25.332
is not gonna make
my life any better

00:14:25.466 --> 00:14:27.534
cuz my past is still
gonna haunt me.

00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:29.770
So what am I fighting
for really?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.505
(Flame)
Deep, concentrated thinking

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:34.775
was never your strong suit,
Soulburner.

00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:37.110
Perhaps a different
tactic would help?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.111
(gasps)

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:41.448
I find it offensive that you
want to forget your past,

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.951
because that means you
are trying to forget me.

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:47.187
And I am not one that deserves
to be forgotten.

00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:49.123
So don't let
your past haunt you,

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.958
let your past support you.

00:14:51.058 --> 00:14:54.462
Cuz I am your past,
and I will support you forever.

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:55.362
(gasps)

00:14:55.463 --> 00:14:57.330
And nothing will make me
or your parents,

00:14:57.464 --> 00:14:59.633
happier than if you're happy.

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.702
Besides,

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:05.505
how can I ever be gone if I
live on forever in your heart?

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.009
You're the best, Flame.

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:13.013
My mistake was trying to forget
my past instead of embracing it.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.581
I now know
what I'm fighting for.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.517
I'm fighting for me

00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:18.852
and everything that makes me me!

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:23.256
It's... my... turn!

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:25.692
I draw!

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:32.699
It's... my... turn!

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.101
I draw!

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:39.339
(Varis)
Hold on a second,

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:40.607
before you make a move,

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:43.410
ZEROBOROS activates
its special ability.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.111
And it resummons itself!

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:46.180
What?

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.113
(Varis)
That's not all,

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.683
ZEROBOROS also gains
200 attack points

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.551
for every card
that's been banished

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:53.353
through the course of this duel.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.556
And that number equals
a total of eleven cards,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.260
so ZEROBOROS gains
2200 attack points!

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:04.097
(grunts)

00:16:04.665 --> 00:16:07.534
(Playmaker)
Not only does it have
5200 attack points,

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.404
but its location on the field
is also problematic.

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:12.906
If Soulburner wants
to Link Summon,

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.409
he must summon the monster
in the Extra Monster Zone

00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:17.744
next to ZEROBOROS's links.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:19.279
But that will trigger
its ability,

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.948
causing his monster
to be banished.

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:23.417
(laughs)

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:26.119
Well this was fun
while it lasted.

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.423
(Varis)
Your defeat is all but assured.

00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.157
Actually, Varis,

00:16:31.258 --> 00:16:34.861
by summoning ZEROBOROS you've
improved my chances to win.

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:36.163
What?

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.431
From my hand,

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.933
I activate the spell card
BURNING DRAW!

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:41.835
That card's going to save you?

00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:44.405
When I have no cards
on my field,

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:46.106
I can draw a card from my deck

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.475
for every link
that your monster has!

00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:50.077
So I get four cards!

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:50.810
(gasps)

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.315
(screams)

00:16:54.415 --> 00:16:55.515
Four cards, eh?

00:16:56.082 --> 00:16:57.518
Yup, you heard
correctly.

00:16:57.818 --> 00:16:59.920
And the first one's
the spell card

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.489
LINK FIRE'S RETURN!

00:17:02.056 --> 00:17:04.525
I get to resummon
a SALAMANGREAT,

00:17:04.658 --> 00:17:06.860
and you take 200
points of damage

00:17:06.993 --> 00:17:09.196
for every single
link that it has!

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.999
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO
is back to fight!

00:17:18.806 --> 00:17:21.174
Varis is down
to 200 life points!

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:23.711
Then I activate
the special ability

00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:25.579
of the second card that I drew!

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.848
I can summon this card
from my hand

00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:29.984
as long as its Level
is equal or lower

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.152
than the total number
of links in play.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:33.853
I'm countin' seven links,

00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:36.223
but my monster has
one less than that!

00:17:36.756 --> 00:17:37.758
So come on out,

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:41.361
my Level 6 SALAMANGREAT
SALAMANDRA!

00:17:45.032 --> 00:17:48.135
And with these two
I'll blaze my circuit!

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:52.138
The summoning conditions require
two Fire Effect Monsters!

00:17:54.674 --> 00:17:56.042
I Link Summon!

00:17:56.476 --> 00:18:00.580
Link 4 SALAMANGREAT
PYRO PHOENIX!

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.716
(Varis)
Big mistake, Soulburner!

00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.318
Since you Link Summoned,

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:06.587
your monsters'll
now be banished.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.222
And to further the pain,

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:10.824
I activate KARMACEPT
DRAGON's ability!

00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:14.461
It equips on to the monster
that you just Link Summoned.

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:21.101
You want my monster to give
yours a piggy back ride?

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:23.970
(Varis)
No, what I want
is to ensure your defeat!

00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:27.741
If the monster equipped
with KARMACEPT is banished,

00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:31.244
you take damage equal
to your monster's attack points!

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:32.546
No way!

00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:35.215
When I activate
ZEROBOROS's ability,

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:36.817
you lose no matter what,

00:18:36.917 --> 00:18:39.819
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:41.622
We'll see about that!

00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:45.326
I activate the spell
SALAMANGREAT TRANSCENDENCE!

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:47.995
I can use my SALAMANGREAT
to Link Summon

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:50.230
another copy of that monster!

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:54.335
PYRO PHOENIX,
let the flames engulf your body!

00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:57.704
Because from its ashes,
you will be reborn!

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:03.177
Okay now, here... goes...

00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:06.146
Super Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:10.217
Soar, Link 4 SALAMANGREAT
PYRO PHOENIX!

00:19:10.617 --> 00:19:11.452
I see.

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:13.187
By reincarnating your PHOENIX,

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:17.190
you got rid of KARMACEPT DRAGON,
so you won't take any damage.

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:19.126
However,

00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:21.629
it doesn't change the fact
that ZEROBOROS's ability

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:23.464
will still banish your monsters,

00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:25.699
so you'll have
nothing to fight with.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:26.633
Furthermore,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.169
KARMACEPT DRAGON
has another ability.

00:19:29.537 --> 00:19:30.637
Huh?

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.607
When KARMACEPT is sent
to the graveyard,

00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:36.810
I can summon a Link Monster
that's been banished

00:19:36.944 --> 00:19:39.280
as long as it has
equal or fewer links

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.115
than a Link Monster
that's in your graveyard.

00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:46.787
I recall your SALAMANGREAT
PYRO PHOENIX has 4 links.

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:49.055
As does my BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.896
Every move Soulburner makes,
Varis counter's.

00:19:56.229 --> 00:19:57.297
(grunts)

00:19:57.397 --> 00:20:00.667
That isn't good at all,
but I won't stop fighting!

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:02.369
(screams)

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:03.203
Check this!

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.508
I activate SALAMANGREAT
SALAMANDRA's special ability!

00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:10.211
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:20:10.311 --> 00:20:11.945
I can resurrect a Link Monster

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:15.115
that has fewer links
than my PYRO PHOENIX!

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.151
So I'm gonna bring back
my HEATLEO!

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:23.323
SALAMANGREAT SALAMANDRA
also negates

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:25.226
both our monsters' abilities!

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:29.162
Next up, I activate
SALAMANGREAT SANCTUARY!

00:20:30.698 --> 00:20:32.632
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:20:37.104 --> 00:20:39.607
Rise again
from the valley of flames,

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:42.442
SALAMANGREAT HEATLEO!

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:49.383
When HEATLEO is reincarnated,
its ability activates!

00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:52.285
It lowers your BORRELOAD
DRAGON's attack points

00:20:52.352 --> 00:20:54.688
to become the same
as my BALELYNX's,

00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:56.122
just 500!

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:03.697
(groans)

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:06.200
Finally... at long last...

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.236
I'm getting my win!

00:21:12.907 --> 00:21:14.007
Well done.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:17.010
Now maybe you will be able
to move on from your past.

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:18.545
(gasps)

00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:23.084
Why did Varis want you
to help with his plan?

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:25.852
I have no idea.
What do you think?

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:29.189
Well, I can
only conclude...

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:30.924
he wanted
to see you.

00:21:31.024 --> 00:21:33.093
To atone for
the Lost Incident.

00:21:42.936 --> 00:21:44.004
(glass shatters)

00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:12.365
♪♪♪
