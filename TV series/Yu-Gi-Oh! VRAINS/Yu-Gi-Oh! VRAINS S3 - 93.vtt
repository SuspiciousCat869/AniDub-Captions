♪

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.805
I can't afford to lose
this duel to Kolter, but

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.475
I don't want him
to lose either.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.245
As much as
I hate to admit it,

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.114
Lightning has chosen the perfect
opponent for Playmaker.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:16.350
Yeah,
you got that right, Flame.

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.619
And as if this duel isn't
hard enough already,

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.188
it's like Playmaker has to take
on two opponents

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.491
at the exact same time,
Kolter and himself.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.860
And whoever ends up
winning this,

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.497
there's only one true winner
and that's Lightning.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.299
I can't watch this!

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:35.635
Will you stop pouting
and win this duel?

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.738
There are
more important things at stake.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:41.675
(gasping)

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:44.411
Come on, Playmaker.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.947
Step your game up
before your time's up.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.918
♪

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:52.680
Hey Boss, clue me in.
Am I like totally seeing things,

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:54.414
or is Playmaker off his game?

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:56.316
Stop your squakin',
you're seein' things.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:59.052
Playmaker's fine,
and dueling as dandy as always

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.888
and I should know
'cause these eyes have seen

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:02.723
more of his duels
than anyone else.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:04.492
Uh-huh!
I've seen just as many

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.160
Playmaker duels as you have!

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.629
But I get a closer look
by like two inches.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.499
Playmaker, I never thought
the Day would come

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.467
when I didn't know
the right thing to say...

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.804
But I'll still say something,
even if it's the wrong thing.

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:18.471
And that's what you should do.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.308
Don't worry if you're doing the
right thing or the wrong thing,

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:22.976
just do your thing.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.711
Just do my thing.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.080
So you're ready to duel?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.716
I sure am, Kolter.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.820
And first, I'll activate my
spell card, Link Satellite.

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:39.126
For every Link
that Decode Talker has,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.628
I place a Satellite Counter
on this card.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.097
As long as Link Satellite
is in play,

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.732
neither of us can attack.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.936
And with that, I end my turn.

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:51.772
I'm required to remove
a Satellite Counter

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:53.106
at the end of my turn.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.443
Then, when I'm all
out of counters,

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.477
my Link Satellite is destroyed.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:01.448
I thought you said that you
were ready to duel me, Playmake,

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:03.617
not just stand around and stall.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.487
Playmaker can't be
attacked for two turns.

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.289
Yes, he's safe...for now.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:10.858
You're right.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.559
But they shouldn't have been
dueling each other

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.827
in the first place!

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.029
It's all because
Lightning's blackmailing Kolter

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.698
by threatening Jin's safety.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.634
Look bud, if you don't wanna
fight me, that's on you.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.602
You're only making
my job easier.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:27.507
The only way to save my brother
is to defeat you.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.543
And this is one of those
one-way roads

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:31.111
where there's no turning back.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.013
I know that this is not

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:35.349
how you and me wanted things
to end, buddy.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:39.119
But all good things gotta come
to an end sometime, right?

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:40.987
Kolter!

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.893
I knew manipulating
Playmaker's emotions

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:46.993
would be fruitful,

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.863
but I could never
anticipate it to work this well.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:54.000
Humans are such silly
fascinating creatures.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.169
Jin!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.472
I know you're
counting on me to save ya,

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.874
but all I've ever done
was let you down.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:03.577
But in the end,
I'll make sure to be a brother

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:04.912
you can be proud of.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.415
Playmaker, you of all people
oughta know that attacking

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.917
isn't the only way
I can deal you damage.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:12.252
I draw!

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:13.587
(grunts)

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.424
First, I'll summon
Codebreaker Zero Day!

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.392
(dramatic music)

00:04:23.064 --> 00:04:26.366
And then,
I'll use it to code my circuit!

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.335
Check this out!

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:31.238
I set Zero Day
and Virus Swordsman

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.739
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:35.776
I Link Summon

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.778
Link 3
Codebreaker Virus Berserker!

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:44.751
That monster
doesn't look friendly...

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.456
I don't know about that
especially 'cause my Codebreaker

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.592
can bring a few friends
to join the party.

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:55.096
See Virus Berserker's special
ability lets me select up to

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.698
two Codebreakers in my hand
or my graveyard

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.967
and summon them
to your side of the field

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.236
next to your
Decode Talker's Links.

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:05.572
So Codebreaker Zero Day,
go be a pal.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:10.277
You do realize that
Decode Talker gains

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:13.246
500 attack points for
every monster it's Linked to.

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:14.682
I do!

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.251
And you realize that
Zero Day's ability turns

00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:19.152
that positive into a negative!

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.523
Come on, Kolter's getting
the upper hand.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.126
So you gotta
start doing your thing

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.627
before it gets out of hand!

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.829
And do what exactly, Ai?

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.331
While you figure that out,

00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:33.166
I activate my trap
Codebreak Backfire!

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:34.768
When a Codebraker is

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.303
summoned to your
side of the field,

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.639
you take 600 points of damage!

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.174
(dramatic music)

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.580
Oh, no!

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.516
We're down to 1200 life points!

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:52.652
Couple more hits of that goopy
green stuff and we're goners!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.790
It doesn't have to be
just the green stuff.

00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:58.292
Damage can come in any color.

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:01.162
For every Codebreaker
that's on your field,

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:04.064
Virus Berserker can destroy your
spell or trap card

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.499
as long as it's faceup.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.367
And for every card
that's destroyed,

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.636
you take 600 points of damage.

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.905
So say bye to your
Link Satellite

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.341
and half your
remaining life points!

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.079
Oh, man, Kolter destroyed
his Link Satellite!

00:06:19.313 --> 00:06:21.047
Meaning he's now
allowed to attack.

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.582
(grunts)

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.922
You know how I just told you
to do your thing?

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.557
You might wanna
try the opposite now.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.192
Ya better listen to him.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.694
'cause if this is
doin' your thing,

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.328
then your thing is broken.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.398
And I'm not just talkin'
about your duelin'

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:40.667
I'm talking about your
everything, Playmaker.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.972
And when I win this duel,
that's gonna make me a winner

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.707
and you a loser.

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:47.908
A loser...

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:50.410
Yeah,
you remember what I said

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:52.712
about winners and losers, right?

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.081
♪

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.920
Don't tell me
you already forgot

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.956
'cause I know your memory
isn't that bad.

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:05.125
Unless you took a few too many
hits to the noggin'.

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:12.799
What are you doing here?

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:15.435
The super villain convention
is next door.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.270
Calm down, Ai.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.040
I only came here
to have a closer look.

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:21.876
And a closer listen

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:25.979
Kolter, what could you two
possibly be discussing?

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:30.751
Playmaker is down
to his final 600 life points,

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:32.420
so instead of chatting,

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:35.622
all you need to do
is attack and end him.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.425
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:40.493
Here it comes!

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:42.796
Let's end this!

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:46.933
Codebreaker Virus Berserker,
attack Decode Talker!

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:51.805
Let's end this!

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:55.976
Codebreaker Virus Berserker,
attack Decode Talker!

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:58.445
Playmaker doesn't have

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.480
enough life points
to survive this!

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:02.349
Utterly pathetic.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.451
It's not over!

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:06.686
I activate Link Cancel!

00:08:07.454 --> 00:08:09.890
It returns Decode Talker
to my deck!

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.728
And in exchange,
I get to resurrect the monsters

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:16.296
I used to summon it!

00:08:16.864 --> 00:08:18.132
Return to my field,

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:21.001
Link Spider and Protocol Gardna!

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.538
Nice!

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.606
Due to Protocol Gardna's
special ability,

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.610
Kolter isn't allowed to attack
monsters next to its Links.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:32.980
But I can still attack
Protocol Gardna itself!

00:08:33.347 --> 00:08:35.815
Meanin' all those moves
were for nothing!

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.054
It can't be...

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.861
And that's all she wrote.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.166
Indeed.(laughs)

00:08:59.006 --> 00:08:59.839
What?

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:01.742
You're still alive?

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:03.109
No thanks to you!

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:06.380
But allow I,
Professor Ai to explain.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.449
Once per turn, Protocol Gardna
can't be destroyed in battle,

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.718
and we don't take any damage.

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.420
Lucky break, huh?

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:17.857
In that case, I activate the
spell card Codebreak Bind!

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.027
If your monster
that's Linked to

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.597
a Codebreaker destroys
my monster in battle,

00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:26.099
I can send Codebreak Bind
to the graveyard

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:29.236
to deal you damage equal
to my monster's attack points,

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:31.238
and that's damage
you don't wanna take.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:34.908
It's your turn, Playmaker.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.444
Playmaker
can no longer attack

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.446
because if he destroys
Kolter's monster,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.182
he'll run out of life points...
and lose!

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.921
Why is he breathing
as if he ran a marathon?

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:50.357
Because this duel
kinda is one, Flame.

00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.893
There's damage you take
to your life points,

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.629
and there's damage you
take to your actual life.

00:09:56.397 --> 00:09:59.032
And having to fight a friend
is taking a lot outta him.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.405
You need a time out?

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.741
There's no time outs
during a duel, Playmaker.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:10.444
But don't worry,
you'll get plenty of time

00:10:10.578 --> 00:10:13.580
to rest once this match is over,
like, for eternity.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.916
Yes, but when will that be?

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:18.585
I would prefer it
if you'd get on with it.

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:21.621
And I would prefer it
if you get off my back.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.291
I'm doin' what you want.

00:10:24.424 --> 00:10:27.193
So at least let me
do it my way, capiche?

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:31.265
So before I was rudely
interrupted, Playmaker,

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:33.868
in every duel, there's gotta be
a winner and a loser.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.202
That's just how it is.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.707
You're right, Kolter,
a winner and a loser...

00:10:40.608 --> 00:10:44.211
Yeah, remember we had a
nice long talk about it?

00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:46.680
Right here in this very spot,
in fact?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.349
Well, not right here,
right here,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.585
but right here
in the real world.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.056
What?

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:57.291
You heard me.

00:10:57.925 --> 00:11:00.361
Yes, but that doesn't
mean I understand you.

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:02.262
What isn't there to understand?

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.832
You and me are eventually
gonna have to duel.

00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:07.968
And why exactly do you think
that's going to happen?

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:11.738
Well, our missions are to
one: Save Jin

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:14.308
and two: Stop Lightning from
destroying the world.

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:16.776
But what if those
two missions clash?

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:17.945
Go on...

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:18.979
If I was Lightning

00:11:19.113 --> 00:11:21.281
and running through
scenarios to stop you,

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.617
the best plan
is to turn me against you.

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:26.687
Since he knows I'd do anything
to save my brother, Jin,

00:11:26.954 --> 00:11:28.121
sooner or later,

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.124
Lightning's gonna blackmail me
and force me to duel you.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:32.626
And I gotta accept.

00:11:32.826 --> 00:11:36.029
No offense, but you're not
good enough to defeat me.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.532
None taken,
because it's true.

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.301
Then why would Lightning
force you to duel me

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:45.472
when he knows the chances of
your victory are slim at best?

00:11:46.473 --> 00:11:47.741
Because he wants to hit you

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:49.776
where it really hurts,
your heart.

00:11:50.444 --> 00:11:52.279
You may not show
your emotions often,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.582
but that heart of yours beats
for the world like no one else.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.085
Lightning thinks that if
you defeat and erase me,

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.487
that it'll make it
easy pickins for later.

00:12:00.688 --> 00:12:03.423
But here's the thing,
even if you beat me,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.392
I don't want you
to feel bad about it.

00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:07.161
Not feel bad about it?

00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.429
I don't know
how that's possible, Kolter.

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.398
Well, get over it, bud.

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:15.402
'cause if you do let it
crush ya, Lightning wins,

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:17.237
and we both lose.

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.174
That's the thing about
winning and losing.

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:23.710
Losing a duel doesn't
make you a loser

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:26.246
and winning doesn't
make you a winner either.

00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:29.215
How you choose to deal
with the outcome does.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.387
You see, if the duel breaks
your spirit, you're the loser.

00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.891
So through good times and bad,
promise to keep fighting, okay?

00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:40.227
Because when this
whole journey started,

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:41.895
it was just the two of us.

00:12:42.763 --> 00:12:46.199
But see now, the whole world's
depending on you, buddy,

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.301
the hero of Link VRAINS.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:50.003
I promise, Kolter.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.574
My man, we made a pretty
good team, didn't we?

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.843
Yes. It's too bad that
whichever one of us wins,

00:12:57.745 --> 00:12:58.913
it's all coming to an end.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.048
Well, if this is the last
time we're gonna see each other,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.551
I gotta ask you something
and you gotta tell the truth.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:07.955
No lies, no wishy washy,
just the truth.

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.390
Can you promise on our
friendship that you'll do that?

00:13:10.724 --> 00:13:11.725
What is it?

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.161
You...don't think a hot dog
is a sandwich, do ya?

00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:16.796
No, I don't.

00:13:16.963 --> 00:13:17.798
(sighs)

00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:18.899
It's a taco.

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:21.769
Taco?
Come on, no way!

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:24.205
A hot dog cannot be a taco!

00:13:24.739 --> 00:13:26.607
First off,
the texture of the shell,

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.108
and then there's the crunch...

00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:31.545
Alright, Playmaker,

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:33.980
time to see if you're a winner

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.383
or a loser.

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:45.425
Playmaker, you gonna make
your move or what?

00:13:47.594 --> 00:13:48.962
What are you gonna do?

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.667
(screams)

00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:55.769
Uh-huh! Glitch!

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:57.437
Playmaker, no.

00:13:58.205 --> 00:13:59.105
Huh!

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.111
Ready Ai?

00:14:04.278 --> 00:14:06.013
Huh! Ready for what?

00:14:06.347 --> 00:14:07.814
To win this duel!

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:09.783
I draw!

00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:13.353
I'll start
by creating my circuit!

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:18.858
The summoning conditions require
at least two Effect Monsters,

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:23.363
so I set Protocol Gardna and
Link Spider in the Link Arrows!

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:27.267
I Link Summon!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:30.971
Link 3 Decode Talker Extended!

00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:43.617
Decode Talker Extended <i>?</i>

00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:45.719
My, my..

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:49.022
It looks like Playmaker got
himself a new Decode Talker!

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.293
It's about time you got your
head in the game, Playmaker.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:56.163
Similar to my previous
Decode Talker,

00:14:56.563 --> 00:15:00.333
Decode Talker Extended also
gains 500 attack points

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.036
for every monster
that's next to its Links.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.573
But Codebreaker Zero Day's
ability makes you

00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:08.074
lose those attack points
instead of gaining them!

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.211
Not again!

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.747
Due to
Codebreak Bind's effect,

00:15:14.782 --> 00:15:17.718
his DTE can't attack unless
it's Linked to a Codebreaker.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.120
But when it's Linked
to a Codebreaker,

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.123
it loses most of its
attack points.

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:24.424
This is what is called
a conundrum.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.429
I activate my spell,
Decode Destruction!

00:15:30.564 --> 00:15:32.633
It raises
Decode Talker Extended's

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.935
attack points by 1500!

00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:40.608
Now Decode Talker Extended,

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:43.276
attack
Codebreaker Virus Berserker!

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.180
Say what?

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.381
This attack seems...unwise.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.050
You nuts?

00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:52.786
Your Decode Talker Extended has
fewer attack points

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.888
than my
Codebreaker Virus Berserker!

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.357
That would only be true

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:58.925
if I didn't have this spell card
in my hand!

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.128
I activate Cyberse Pride!

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.966
When your monster has
more attack points than mine,

00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:08.636
I can pay 500 of my life points

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:11.105
to make our monsters' attack
points the same!

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.840
Also, my monster can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.613
But I can destroy yours!

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:26.987
With that, your Berserker's
no longer in play.

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:29.990
You just caused your own
downfall, Playmaker.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.626
When Virus Berserker
is sent to the graveyard,

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:35.996
Codebreak Bind's effect deals
you game-ending damage!

00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:39.032
Not when I have
Decode Destruction!

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.802
Its additional effect banishes
Virus Berserker

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:45.272
instead of sending
it to the graveyard!

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.275
What?

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.777
If it doesn't go
to graveyard,

00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:52.012
Codebreak Bind's
effect doesn't activate!

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:56.150
Even worse, when
Virus Berserker is destroyed,

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.752
both my Zero Days self-destruct.

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:01.488
That's not all
that you're losing!

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.224
Decode Destruction's
third effect

00:17:04.358 --> 00:17:06.993
destroys all the remaining cards
on your field!

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.699
Kinda overboard,
don't you think?

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.235
And now that your
Zero Days are gone,

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:17.904
Decode Talker's attack points
rise to 4300!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.074
And then my monster
has another ability!

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.045
When it destroys a monster
next to its Link,

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:28.248
it can attack for a second time
in a single turn!

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:37.357
This is it.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:57.310
It looks like
Game Over.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.784
Good luck, pal.

00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:08.622
Kolter!

00:18:09.323 --> 00:18:10.390
No!

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:18.798
Kolter's gone...

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:22.702
I didn't...

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:26.773
I didn't get to say goodbye.

00:18:32.546 --> 00:18:34.114
Playmaker!

00:18:34.314 --> 00:18:35.582
Kolter...

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.887
Come on, let's hurry it up,
you two.

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.456
The sooner we
complete Kolter's program,

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:44.958
the sooner we can hack
into Mirror Link VRAINS.

00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:51.298
Umm! Try to cheer up,
Playmaker.

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:58.238
You ask him
for the impossible, Ai.

00:18:58.872 --> 00:19:01.174
Do we look like
we need a couple of pennies?

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.677
'Cause no one asked
for your two cents, Lightning!

00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:05.812
Okay, okay.

00:19:05.879 --> 00:19:07.348
If you don't want
to hear the truth,

00:19:07.448 --> 00:19:09.516
then there's nothing
more for me to say

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.185
Good!

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:14.187
Except for my observation
of Playmaker's failure.

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:17.191
It must be crushing to know that
you could not save your friend.

00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:18.392
Or his brother.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.027
And you didn't just fail
to save them,

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:22.830
you're the reason
that they're gone.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.865
And from now
until the end of time,

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.366
they're just...no more.

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:28.001
As if they never existed.

00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:29.669
Except for in your memories.

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.304
How sweet that must be?

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:34.508
To be reminded by your own
subconsciousness that you were

00:19:34.641 --> 00:19:35.876
the cause of their demise.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.111
How you will live
with this pain?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.513
I do not know.

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:44.518
And this leads to my one last,
logical conclusion: I broke you.

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.654
And a broken Playmaker
cannot win this war.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.357
I'm broken, am I?

00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:55.028
Time to see
what you're made of.

00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:58.999
Yes.
I've clearly broken your spirit.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.035
You may be right.

00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:02.469
But a friend once told me that

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.938
if I can use these feelings
to come back stronger,

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.206
to come back a winner.

00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:08.175
What?

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:10.977
Kolter knew that you would
force him to duel me,

00:20:11.612 --> 00:20:13.013
so he prepped me for this.

00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:16.316
To make sure
that if my spirit did break,

00:20:16.784 --> 00:20:18.852
that I could forge it
back together.

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:21.555
and make it
more powerful than before.

00:20:23.124 --> 00:20:24.858
You can do this Playmaker.

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:28.028
He knew that
I would blackmail him?

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:29.663
He tricked me?

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:32.399
Kolter may be gone,
but as you said,

00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.167
he lives on inside me.

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:37.204
But Kolter isn't
holding me down,

00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:38.805
he's lifting me up

00:20:38.872 --> 00:20:40.941
and giving me the strength
to stop you!

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:49.483
Playmaker!

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.052
Heh! It seems Kolter
wasn't giving you

00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:53.787
as much strength
as you believed.

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:55.789
Playmaker, no!

00:20:58.359 --> 00:20:59.526
No!

00:21:00.194 --> 00:21:01.595
Calm down, Soulburner.

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:04.197
I understand your anger
but you mustn't lose control.

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.398
Don't worry, Flame.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.533
No need.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.537
I promise to stay in control
and not lose my cool,

00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:11.672
even for a second.

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:13.840
But I'm gonna use this fire...

00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:17.444
blazin' through me
to burn Lightning up!

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:22.082
