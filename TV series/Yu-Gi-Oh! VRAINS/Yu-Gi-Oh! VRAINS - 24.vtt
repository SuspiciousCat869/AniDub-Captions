Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains.

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:07.007
(MC)
<i>It's an epic smackdown
between The Gore</i>

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:11.111
<i>and the PhD of DNA, Dr. Genome!</i>

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:12.946
(both)
Now let's Speed Duel!

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:19.286
(Manager)
George, Mackendrick's well-being
depends on your victory,

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.989
but I hope it doesn't
cost you your own.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.126
(Gore)
I equip the spell Gouki Dark
Mask on my Thunder Ogre,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.594
unleashing its inner rage

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.031
and transforming it into
Dark Thunder Ogre!

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:33.701
You crossed the line first
by deleting Mac K!

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.936
So if you're playing
no holds barred...

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.571
(grunts)

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.107
You ain't dealin'
with Gore no more.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.676
You're facin' Grim Gore!

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.445
Gore made a heel turn!

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.849
Watch as I unlock my monsters'
true potential!

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.686
Witness genetic perfection!

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:57.624
Link 2 Helixx Necro Darwin!

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.927
<i>Aw, glitch!
Gore's gonna lose,</i>

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.862
<i>and I'll have to pay up
on his bet!</i>

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.563
<i>You remember, right?</i>

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.467
<i>The one where he'll reveal
Playmaker's secret identity?</i>

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.680
He's still alive,
but, like, barely.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:20.847
Yusaku?

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:28.114
Ahh!

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.264
Still hanging on, are we?

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.466
But for how long?

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.936
While you use up your resources
just to maintain

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:50.604
a paltry 200 life points,

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:54.041
I can recycle and reuse
my resources!

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:56.410
For I have unlocked the genetic
code to immortality!

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.412
That doesn't sound so good.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.048
No, it doesn't.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.050
Necro Darwin resurrects
itself from my graveyard!

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.655
And whenever I bring
a Link Monster back to life,

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.623
I can activate my Skill!

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.958
Go Minus Mitosis!

00:03:11.992 --> 00:03:14.561
Just like dividing a cell,
I'll splice your life points

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:17.664
and your monster's
attack points in half!

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.633
(crowd booing)

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.136
What!? But that's gonna
make Dark Thunder Ogre

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.539
weaker than Genome's
freaky Franken-bird!?

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.881
Now blast Gore's life points!

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.393
(MC)
<i>And there goes half of Gore's
life points into the ether!</i>

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.529
<i>Not that he had too much
to start with!</i>

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.565
<i>The glass half full guy's
saying it only cost him
a hundred life points.</i>

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.333
<i>While the glass half-empty
guy's, like,</i>

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.469
<i>losing half of not a lot leaves
you with a whole lot less!</i>

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.771
George.

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.782
(evil chuckle)
And with that I shall bring

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:11.218
my turn to a close.
You're up.

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.754
Or is that
the wrong choice of words?

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.924
You can hardly even stand up.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.625
<i>Warning, vital signs critical.</i>

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:21.895
<i>Emergency log-out required
but system is offline.</i>

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.231
I'm so curious.
Which will last longer,

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:28.435
your life points or your endless
sleep once you lose?

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:31.605
I hope it's the former over the
latter because though I desire

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:36.443
to win, and I will win, I truly
do want you to carry on.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:40.247
It would be a tragedy if you
fell into an endless sleep.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.048
A tragedy for me, that is!

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:47.054
Because you will be unable
to reveal Playmaker's
true identity to me!

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:49.756
And that's all I care about!

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.225
(laughing)

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.231
(AI)
<i>Hey, Playmaker! Look!
It's the guy voted</i>

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.101
<i>Most Likely to Make Bad
Life Decisions!</i>

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.009
Oh, now it's on!

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:09.009
All right,
Playmaker!

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.077
Go get 'em!

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:11.444
Yeah! Take 'em down!

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:17.084
Ha! Playmaker!
What a surprise.

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:18.985
Did you bring your Ignis?

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:20.287
<i>Ahem!</i>

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.456
<i>Get this straight!
I'm no fanny pack!</i>

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:23.524
<i>No one brings me!</i>

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.692
<i>In fact, I brought Playmaker!</i>

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:26.927
Unreal.

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:29.797
So much 'tude for a little dude.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.299
All the pieces are
falling into place.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.002
Thanks for saving
me the trouble
of finding you.

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:36.837
And bringing the Ignis.

00:05:36.937 --> 00:05:38.105
<i>Not brought!</i>

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.107
I'm sure you're here
to help your friend,

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.809
but you do realize that
you're not allowed

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.578
to interfere in a duel
already in progress.

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.014
I didn't come to help.

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.316
I just wanted a front row seat

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.351
and check out
whether you'll defeat Gore

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:54.788
as easily and as quickly
as I defeated him in our duel.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.323
(groaning)

00:05:56.424 --> 00:05:58.024
What did you say?!

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:04.331
Because if our
dueling is solely
governed by our DNA,

00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:06.233
you can use
my strategy
to defeat him.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.534
But if you're wrong, Genome,

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.970
then Gore can evolve
into a new duelist.

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:12.372
Then you've already answered
your own question.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.908
Because that Neanderthal
will do the same thing

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.177
he's always done
which is lose!

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:19.713
This is not fantasy
or speculation.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.181
It's a scientific fact!

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:25.152
So when I defeat Gore and prove
my theories correct, ha!

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:28.389
I will confirm my genius
to the entire world!

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:30.924
I do believe
that actual geniuses

00:06:31.024 --> 00:06:33.026
don't need to tout
their own intellect.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:35.161
But maybe you're the exception.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:37.030
Though that's highly unlikely.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.599
(sneers)

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.068
(Playmaker)
Always expect the unexpected.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.803
That's what a genius knows.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:45.006
(Gore)
Huh! That's tellin' 'em!

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:47.375
That doc don't know me!

00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:50.011
I don't care about no DNA!

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:53.380
But I'll get that TKO!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.149
It's my turn!
And I draw!

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:01.422
I'm taking my duel even higher!

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:02.889
(groaning)

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.331
<i>Whoa, what's this?</i>

00:07:10.431 --> 00:07:12.299
<i>His mask is flaking right off!</i>

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:15.235
<i>Like my radiator's paint!</i>

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.148
I'm evolvin' my dueling
style again!

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:31.118
'Cause no one but The Gore
decides how I'm gonna fight!

00:07:31.218 --> 00:07:34.888
I activate Gouki Face Turn!

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:37.824
This here spell destroys
one of my own Gouki cards.

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:41.761
So I'm gonna use it to tear off
my Gouki Dark Mask!

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:46.299
You destroyed
your own card?

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.235
What Genome, my DNA wasn't
supposed to do that?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.972
In exchange
for destroying my Mask,

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:54.708
I get to resummon a Gouki
from my graveyard!

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.910
Gouki Suprex
is back in my corner!

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:04.985
Now let's tag up
to take him down!

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:06.219
Mash up my circuit!

00:08:08.522 --> 00:08:11.191
<i>Whoa! Gore has another
Link Summon within him?</i>

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.161
(Gore)
The summoning conditions require
at least two Goukis.

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:17.798
And I have my Thunder Ogre
and Suprex.

00:08:17.832 --> 00:08:21.968
Go! Our time is now
while his time is over!

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.140
Link the circuit!

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:28.475
I'm now Link Summoning.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.878
Link 4 Gouki The Master Ogre!

00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:36.817
What monster is that?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.522
(Gore)
Just one that I wouldn't have
if I didn't evolve my game!

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:44.958
But my theories say that you
can't summon that monster.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:48.996
Yeah? That just means
your theories were
bogus to begin with!

00:08:49.063 --> 00:08:52.999
And whenever my Gouki Suprex
goes down for the three count,

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.170
I get to draw another
Gouki card from my deck.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.671
Here goes!

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.807
I activate Gouki Rematch!

00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:03.010
It returns two Goukis
back to my ring

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.379
as long as the two
of 'em got different levels.

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:07.848
So makin' a comeback
is Gouki Twistcobra

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.050
and Gouki Riscorpio!

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.021
(groans)

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:17.958
Next I activate
Master Ogre's ability!

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:22.729
Once per turn, for each Gouki
that I return to my hand,

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:26.066
one of your monsters loses
their special abilities!

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.434
And I'm subbing out two!

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:34.374
So your Helixx Necro Darwin
has its feathers plucked!

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:38.345
And Helixx Gothiclone
ain't lookin' too good either!

00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:39.547
No!

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:41.882
<i>Hate to brag,
but Gore only started</i>

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:43.550
<i>dueling better
when I showed up.</i>

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:44.551
Good to know.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:47.087
Gouki The Master Ogre's
special ability

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:51.258
allows it to attack every
one of your opponent's monsters.

00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:54.728
Then what do you say
we get to tearin' down
those jobbers one-by-one!

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.931
Go and dropkick
Necro Darwin
into next week!

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.412
And next and last,

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:14.447
carve up Helixx Gothiclon
and end this duel!

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:37.872
Yeah!
(laughing)

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.540
(MC)
<i>It's over!</i>

00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:42.876
<i>Grim, I mean non-Grim Gore
got the pin,</i>

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.077
<i>and that's no fairy tale!</i>

00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:45.946
Way to drop
the axe on him!

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:47.281
Man, so flash!

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:51.251
I knew George would
pull through in the end.

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.087
Because he would never
let a friend down.

00:10:57.524 --> 00:10:59.226
(Gore)
Now where's that antidote?

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.466
This better work.
Don't be pullin'
a fast one on me.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:10.771
Despite what you may think,
I am a man of honor.

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:13.674
As are the rest
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:11:13.774 --> 00:11:15.509
You wanna tell me
where the honor is

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:18.145
in deletin' folks
and destroyin' lives?

00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:21.248
You Hanoi are the true
heels in this arena.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:22.917
(laughing)

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.618
Though you've claimed
to have evolved,

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.587
your comprehension
hasn't evolved at all.

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:41.001
Ahh...
What a weird dream.

00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:46.974
Hey, Playmaker.

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:51.244
You really come here
to watch me lose?

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.114
Or was it some reverse
psychology stuff like...

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.816
my manager pulls on me?

00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:58.085
Does it matter?

00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:01.121
What exactly are you thinkin',
of course it matters!

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.858
Because takin' it one way means
us two got a real big problem!

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:07.561
But takin' it the other way,
us two can work together

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:09.829
to take care of a problem!

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.032
A problem
called Hanoi!
Us two?

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:16.503
Nah, I'm talki''
about us three.

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:19.839
You up for taking
down the Hanoi?

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:35.756
(Shima)
Oh, no!

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:37.257
(groaning)

00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:42.829
<i>(laughing)</i>

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.600
Attack Cracking Dragon!

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.135
Scrub out this scrub!

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:54.341
Ha! Nice one!
It's my turn!

00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.012
Delete her! Now!

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:04.985
(laughing)
This is just too easy!

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:07.921
If you're watching this,
we're coming for you!

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:09.290
(Shima)
Unh!

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.259
Are we gonna do something
about these no-flash punks?

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:16.763
Or are we gonna just sit around
here like scaredy-babies?

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:18.765
C'mon, we're the Duel Club!

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.968
We're the best duelists
in the whole school.

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:24.705
It's our job to take those
hooded hoods down!

00:13:24.738 --> 00:13:26.540
Right, Prez?

00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.909
Though I do appreciate
your enthusiasm,

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.478
you forgot yesterday
that you can't summon

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:33.747
monsters face-up
in defense mode.

00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.915
Honest mistake.

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:38.385
What I'm saying
is that you will lose.

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:40.921
And I'm not singling you out.
We're all not good enough.

00:13:40.955 --> 00:13:42.956
We may win a duel
or two or even ten,

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:45.325
but there are literally
thousands of them.

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:48.495
We'll lose eventually.
And as president, I cannot allow

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.098
any of our members to put
their lives in jeopardy!

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:55.068
So until this crisis is over,
I'm disbanding the Duel Club!

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:57.971
What!? No Way!
You can't, Prez,
come on, man!

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.540
(Skye)
Shima...
Huh.

00:13:59.573 --> 00:14:01.775
(President)
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.315
Today must be trash day

00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:10.383
'cause it looks like
I'm takin' out the garbage!

00:14:18.626 --> 00:14:19.860
(crowd cheering)
Way to go, Gore!

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.030
Yeah! Yeah, go, Gore!
That's showin' 'em!

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.666
Aw, man! Gore is
the man, man!

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.167
Uh, what are
you doing, dude?

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.635
I'm logging in!

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:30.170
If my man Gore's
fightin' the Hanoi,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.938
so am I!
Hey, wait!

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:42.115
Whoa! Whoo...

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:43.984
(Evil laughter)

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.619
Aw, man!

00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:48.221
Where is The Gore
when you need him, man?

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:51.024
Oh! Aw, man,
it's my man Playmaker!

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:53.327
I recommend you
log out immediately.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.829
But I can help ya, man.

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:58.966
(AI)
<i>You can hardly help yourself!
Now scoot!</i>

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.300
A'ight, man.

00:15:02.336 --> 00:15:04.037
I'll take you on.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.039
While I'll be takin' you down!

00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:07.941
<i>I don't think so.</i>

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:10.877
You back already?

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:12.713
Ah, man...

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:16.049
I knew he'd show!
Playmaker's duelin' the Hanoi!

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.884
<i>Your time here is up!</i>

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:20.020
Let's hope he saves
Link Vrains.

00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:21.888
Because if he doesn't,
this is likely

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.891
the last meeting
of the Duel Club.

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:26.627
Now I'm going to go hide
in the bathroom to cry.

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.862
Miss ya!

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:30.297
The Gore and Playmaker...

00:15:30.398 --> 00:15:33.901
I wish more people
had guts like them.

00:15:33.968 --> 00:15:36.369
But I guess everyone
can't be a hero.

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:47.047
Now hand over the antidote
so I can heal the Deleted.

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:50.183
You wasted your time kid 'cause
I don't have the antidote.

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:51.451
<i>Then who does?!</i>

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:52.786
<i>Spill the beans
or I'll eat you</i>

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:55.189
<i>faster than a bag
of microchips!</i>

00:15:55.222 --> 00:15:57.124
Okay stop!

00:15:57.224 --> 00:15:59.627
<i>The creator of the virus
has the antidote!</i>

00:15:59.727 --> 00:16:00.694
<i>Her name is...</i>

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:01.929
And delete!

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.863
Ahh!

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.070
Ahh!

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:13.974
He's not talking.

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:15.309
<i>Or walkin'.</i>

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.977
(Gore)
Playmaker!

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:19.613
Any closer to a cure?

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.181
No, you?

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.351
I wish we had
Blue Angel
helpin' us.

00:16:24.452 --> 00:16:28.956
I was sure she'd be
down to fight the Hanoi
but I was wrong.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.291
<i>Who can blame her?</i>

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:31.959
<i>I have better things to do
on Friday nights, too.</i>

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:36.663
Blue Angel or not,
there are three reasons
why we must not fail.

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:39.633
Number one: the Hanoi
are increasing their ranks.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.003
They must be stopped before
their numbers become too great.

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:46.106
Two: only the Hanoi have the
antidote to heal the Deleted.

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.609
And three: even the antidote
will be useless

00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:52.780
if there is no one left in
Link Vrains to administer it.

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.515
Then we best get movin'!

00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:02.556
(Skye)
I don't think we've ever
had dinner together

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.024
three nights in a row.

00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:08.095
<i>Master Akira now has an
abundance of free time,</i>

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.831
<i>ever since
his embarrassing demotion.</i>

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.033
It wasn't embarrassing.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.469
Humiliating at most.

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:19.673
And yet to tell you the truth,
it was a blessing in disguise.

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:23.376
I can make up for lost time and
spend more time with you, Skye.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.014
Or perhaps not.

00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:29.382
I-- I'm sorry.

00:17:29.482 --> 00:17:32.853
Nothing would make
me happier, Akira,
believe me.

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:35.322
<i>We interrupt this regularly
scheduled broadcast</i>

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:38.859

<i>Greetings.</i>

<i>SOL Technolgies

00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:48.001
<i>And I have a most exciting
announcement to share.</i>

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:50.403
<i>Many in the media have accused
SOL Technologies</i>

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:54.008
<i>for lacking the manpower to
stop the Knights of Hanoi.</i>

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.043
<i>But I have created

<i>programmed entirely
out of cutting edge AI.</i>

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.082
<i>An unstoppable force

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:04.251
<i>to eradicate the Hanoi menace!</i>

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.653
<i>And they
shall be deployed yesterday</i>

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.723
<i>all under my stewardship!</i>

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.558
<i>Feel free to thank me,
Chief Kitamura!</i>

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:15.095
<i>That's K as in Kitamura,
I as in Kitamura,</i>

<i>T as in Kitamura,
A as in Kitamura...</i>

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:21.235
<i>That guy sure does</i>
believe in his AI.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.903
You mean the same
ones I defeated?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.105
<i>And last but not least,
A as in...</i>

00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:28.308
If all the duelists are AIs,

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:30.577
they cannot be turned
into the Deleted.

00:18:30.644 --> 00:18:34.582
Like what
happened to you.

00:18:34.615 --> 00:18:37.083
Those were the scariest
days of my life.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.052
I thought I'd lost you forever.

00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:40.888
Promise me that you will not

00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:43.590
get involved in this
Hanoi crisis, will you?

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:46.093
Can you do that, Skye?

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.563
Sure... okay.

00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:51.565

(Kitamura laughs)
Big deal.

00:18:57.972 --> 00:19:00.574
My duels against Playmaker
provided me with data

00:19:00.641 --> 00:19:04.778
that enhanced my AIs'
performance by over 4,000%.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.714
We're ready, sir.
On your orders.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:08.983
Good.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:12.019
After my army crushes
the whole lot of 'em,

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:14.855
they'll have no choice but
to add a couple extra zeroes

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:16.656

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:49.789
Let's go!
Send those hackers packin'!

00:19:49.823 --> 00:19:52.326
If they're glued to the screen,
they won't notice

<i>Our AI logged a victory!
And another one! And another!</i>

00:20:25.993 --> 00:20:28.162
<i>I can't keep up! Unbelievable!</i>

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.831
<i>Our victory percentage is 100%.</i>

00:20:30.864 --> 00:20:34.334
This level of success is
just simply unprecedented.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.137
That's only because
I wasn't in charge until now.

00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.142
What's this?

00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.111
(operator)
<i>Our AIs are losing!</i>

00:20:44.144 --> 00:20:48.349
<i>Our army's down
50, 55-- no, 60%.</i>

00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:52.352
<i>And accelerating!
It's a cascade!</i>

00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:55.856
Ah! How is it possible
that this can be happening?

00:20:55.956 --> 00:20:58.158
Sir, the data says
that the tide began to turn

00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:00.894
when two new
Knights of Hanoi
entered the fray.

00:21:00.928 --> 00:21:02.196
Just two of them?

00:21:02.229 --> 00:21:03.697
I'll put it
up on screen.

00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:08.869
This cannot be!

00:21:12.205 --> 00:21:15.843
<i>Sir, they have completely
annihilated our army.</i>

00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:20.247
Not just my army,
but also my raise.

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:25.519
You're going
to work?
I am.

00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:30.391
I'm not sure how I can help,
but the least I can do is try.

00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:32.226
Don't wait up for me.

00:21:32.293 --> 00:21:33.927
Yeah, sure thing.

00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:42.069
You up for taking
down the Hanoi?

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.171
Promise me that
you will not get involved

00:21:44.205 --> 00:21:46.706
in this Hanoi crisis, will you?

00:21:53.881 --> 00:21:55.515
What should I do?
