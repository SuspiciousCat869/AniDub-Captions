WEBVTT

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.836
And this should do it.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.305
(computer beeping)

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:10.644
(Ai groans)
What happened? Where am I?

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.912
You're back home, Ai.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:12.613
(Ai)
Huh?

00:00:12.613 --> 00:00:14.781
Wait, now I remember.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.452
I went to eat up some info but
chowed down on a virus instead!

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.187
Which I purged
from your system.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.623
Hey Kolter!
Remember me?

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:23.624
Yeah...

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:26.260
You're kinda hard to forget
even if you want to.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.995
(Ai)
Umm... Thanks...?

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.296
But since you're here...

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.031
Maybe you can help me
find the guys

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.766
who stole my brother's soul.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.669
The big one's called Bohman.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.271
And the lil' one?

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.740
Beats me.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.141
But that rugrat's
not gettin'

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.976
a free pass
for what happened.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.579
So why do think
they went after Jin?

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.114
Don't know.

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:48.615
Tell ya what I do know:

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.651
snatching someone's soul
in real life

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.454
takes super tech-savviness!
I'm talkin' skills

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:55.155
beyond anything
you could ever scrounge up--

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:55.989
(Ai cries out)

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.157
Maybe...

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.525
But I'm not scared.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.061
Bohman's gotta pay
for what he's done.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.228
Yeah...

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.730
And he will pay.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:06.599
We're gonna find him,
Kolter.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.336
And I promise you
that we'll rescue Jin.

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.251
C'mon, bro,
take a knee.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.657
Did you acquire
Jin Kolter's data?

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.626
Yeah...
But it wasn't easy though--

00:02:38.726 --> 00:02:40.594
we ran into
a little bit of trouble.

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:42.829
What kind of trouble?

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.598
Playmaker trouble.

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.602
So... he's returned
to Link VRAINS.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:49.437
Yeah...

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:51.438
Along with
the Dark Ignis.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:52.973
They defeated Bohman...

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.775
But I think it was a learning
experience for him.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.245
However, that's not
the end of it.

00:02:58.312 --> 00:02:59.579
Oh?

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:02.349
Another Ignis showed
up on the scene.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.817
The Fire Ignis.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.219
(Mysterious Voice)
Surprising,

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.321
but not entirely
unexpected.

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:10.190
I ordered Bit and Boot
to go and capture him...

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.391
But they messed up.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.993
Patience, Harlin.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:16.230
Do not mistake a setback
for a failure.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.164
We will find him in time.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.468
Now,
hand over Jin Kolter's data.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:22.335
Go on...

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.709
(electronic chirping &amp;
crunching)

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:32.446
(Bohman)
There-- I fulfilled
my end of the deal.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.514
Now it's your turn.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.050
You promised to restore
my memories.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.019
Oh? Did I?

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:40.454
Yes, you did.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.556
(Mysterious Voice)
I remember no such thing.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.359
But don't worry.

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.329
You won't remember we ever had
this conversation...

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.630
when you go back
to sleep.

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:52.132
(Bohman moans)

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:54.168
(Mysterious Voice)
Let's reset his memories.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:54.834
Right.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.206
<i>(Roboppi)
Squee!</i>

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.442
<i>(Roboppi)
Roboppi is happy
that his master is back!</i>

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.379
<i>Roboppi was scared that
you forgot about his one</i>

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.782
<i>and only BBF--
Best Bot Forever!</i>

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:10.083
(Ai)
What? BBF?

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.252
Shh! Not so loud
in front of company.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.253
You heard nothin'.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.223
<i>All that matters is
we're together again.</i>

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:19.259
<i>Our two hearts
beating as one!</i>

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.595
Aww, that's so sweet...

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.930
but don't you know
to keep it down, you dumb dummy?

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:25.366
<i>Roboppi does not</i>

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:27.100
<i>because Roboppi's
intelligence</i>

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.402
<i>didn't get upgraded
like master promised.</i>

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.905
Ohhhh, yeah.

00:04:30.905 --> 00:04:34.908
I've been working on it
24/7 just for you, BBF.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.610
<i>Why is Roboppi's BBF</i>

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.346
<i>acting so BBF-ish
with that sphere?</i>

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:42.917
Oh, you mean Linky?
He's like my pet!

00:04:43.017 --> 00:04:44.351
Say hi.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.587
<i>Hi, never-will-be-
my-master's-BBF creature.</i>

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:51.691
Awww, you can feel the
electricity between ‘em already.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:55.395
(crowd
chattering excitedly)

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.597
Boy, Playmaker,

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:01.001
it's been a looong time
since I went to school with ya.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.337
Yet somehow,
still not long enough.

00:05:03.337 --> 00:05:04.972
Just keep a low profile.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:06.974
Like I have choice!

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:09.844
Since you jailed me up
inside your Duel Disk again!

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:10.811
Why ‘d you do that?

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.078
Because...

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:13.747
one: I don't want you
running around on your own

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:16.082
creating all sorts of
mischief and trouble.

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.751
Whaaaaaat?

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:19.586
Except for every weekday
and weekend,

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:21.188
when do I ever do that?

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.957
And two: If the enemy
is powerful enough

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:26.126
to locate the Cyberse
and destroy it,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.262
and possibly
the other Ignis--

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.030
then it should be more
than abundantly

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.365
clear to you, Ai--

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:35.502
that the safest place for you is
to be by my side at all times.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:36.903
Aw!

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:40.073
Three: And most crucial is...

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.975
You love hangin' with your bud!

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.978
I prefer it
when you're locked up.

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:44.911
(Ai sighs)

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.647
Why do I gotta
serve hard times

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.114
when times are hard?

00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:00.026
That's Skye.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.028
Or should I say
Blue Angel?

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.898
Wassup Skye...

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:06.199
You gonna make it to
the duel club meeting today?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.267
I'll be there!

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.369
But no one else
seems to know that.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.506
Guess I'm not the only one
with a secret ID.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.707
<i>(Flame)
No--</i>

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.676
<i>even the man
she's talking to has one.</i>

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.378
<i>He's the Brave Battler.</i>

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.180
Yeah, but he's not important.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:23.316
But he is.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.685
Yusaku.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.888
Or should I say
the one and only Playmaker.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.691
(Theodore gasps)

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.560
(Theodore)
Phew-- that was close.

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:35.028
It's like he knew
I was following him.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.264
<i>Because you were
following him!</i>

00:06:37.264 --> 00:06:40.234
<i>Why didn't you just
introduce yourself and say hi?</i>

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:40.734
Why?

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.370
Because I don't want to be
looking like a creeper, Flame.

00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:46.874
<i>I do not understand
how you humans communicate.</i>

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:49.377
There's kind of a
ritual you gotta go through.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.578
You have to think of it
like it's a duel.

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:54.548
You need just the right strategy
to start a convo.

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.917
<i>Ah, I think I understand.</i>

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.218
<i>So what you are saying is</i>

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.688
<i>that if the discussion
conditions are correct,</i>

00:07:00.688 --> 00:07:03.490
<i>you can summon your courage
to play your topic</i>

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.394
<i>and create a chain
of dialogue effects.</i>

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:07.894
Uh-huh, pretty much!

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.131
<i>I find this ritual
unnecessarily complicated.</i>

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:12.800
<i>I think it will be easier</i>

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.935
<i>if I send a direct message
to the Dark Ignis</i>

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:17.304
<i>indicating your desire
to meet Playmaker.</i>

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.473
No, no, no!
Don't do that!

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:21.442
(Theodore)
That's the worst way
to kick things off!

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:22.743
Promise me you won't.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.446
<i>(Flame)
Fine, I won't send the message.</i>

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.281
Okay good, thanks.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.915
<i>Because I sent
the message</i>

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.417
<i>forty five
seconds ago.</i>

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:31.485
(Theodore gasps)

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.054
Oh, hi...
Playmaker...

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.757
Who are you?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.461
How do you know about
my identity?

00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:42.296
Well, this is awkward.

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.964
I'd say
it's nice to meet you

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.599
but we've already met
before.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.901
I'm the one
who helped you out yesterday.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.537
So that means
you're Soulburner.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:53.039
Or Theodore when I'm out here.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.377
<i>(Ai)
Cool, but maybe
we should get out of here.</i>

00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:58.212
Why are you
following me around?

00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.613
You might not believe it...

00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:01.682
But you and I
have a lot in common.

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:04.951
I think you'll understand when
I introduce you to my buddy...

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.654
Hello.

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:07.554
An Ignis?

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:08.789
(Ai)
It's you!

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:10.190
(electronic beeping)

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:11.225
I am.

00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:12.526
(electronic beeping)

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:15.362
No one's called me
by my real name in so long,

00:08:15.362 --> 00:08:19.032
since it's unpronounceable in
this primitive human language.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.233
But I totally thought

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.002
that you liked that
your name was Flame.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:22.869
I do.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:25.706
Can't I love both?
They're both spectacular.

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:26.940
Unlike...

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.175
(digital sound of Ai's name)
over there--

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:30.211
would you like to know
what his name means?

00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:31.678
Whoawhoawhoa--

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.814
Just call me Ai,
all right? Ai!

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.182
Ai, huh?

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:37.151
Let's play a rhyme game, Ai.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.820
I'm Flame:
The F stands for ferocious.

00:08:39.887 --> 00:08:43.557
And I'm Ai:
The A stands for atrocious!

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.226
...Wait a sec...

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.728
I'm sure that you're not
gonna be at all surprised

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:49.563
when I tell you
that I have an Ignis

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:51.331
because I went through
the Lost Incident.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.833
Just like I did.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.602
But I didn't learn
about it until now.

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.538
Right around the time you
destroyed the Tower of Hanoi.

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:01.041
You see, when
you defeated the Hanoi,

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:03.210
the Ignis's troubles
should have been over.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:05.679
But they weren't over.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.915
In fact,
it only got worse for them.

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.916
Their Cyberse was destroyed.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:12.519
So this lil' fella
came to me for help--

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.954
and now I'm coming to you
to ask for yours.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.425
Then I gotta know what went
down in our homeworld, Flame!

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:20.060
And where all
our buddies are at!

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:21.928
(Flame)
I'll tell you what I know.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:26.032
But not here. You never know
who could be listening...

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.169
Whoa!

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.572
Everything looks like ants
from up here--

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:33.006
even the ants!

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:37.110
(Ai)
But of all the places to avoid
eavesdroppin', a Ferris wheel?

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.511
Yes.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.215
The gravitation created
from this slow circular rotation

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:43.350
can confuse even the most
technically advanced

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.785
listening devices.

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:45.920
No, they can't...

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.588
I think you just wanted
to ride a Ferris wheel!

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:48.421
That too.

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:49.589
Why don't you tell them

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.258
everything you told me,
Flame?

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.025
Sure...

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:54.461
It all began
when Ai hid the Cyberse

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.896
from the outside world.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.197
Knowing that we were safe

00:09:57.264 --> 00:09:58.932
from the humans who were
hunting us,

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:01.701
it finally gave the five of us
a moment to think...

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.270
and to discuss.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.738
(Ai)
Discuss what?

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.074
Our relationship
with humans.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:09.576
Whether our two groups
could co-exist or not.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.046
Because though Dr. Kogami--
a human-- gave us life,

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:16.349
these same humans
were trying to eradicate us.

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.851
But not every person wants

00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:19.286
that to happen to you,
Flame.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.522
I understand, my friend.

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:23.090
(Flame)
But many do.

00:10:23.524 --> 00:10:25.959
Yeah, I know...
It's sad.

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.294
Still, some of us felt

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:29.596
that if we could get past
these misunderstandings,

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.766
the Ignis and humans
could live in harmony.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:34.301
Others were not
so idealistic.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:35.569
They believed that humans

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:38.005
would never stop
trying to destroy us.

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:40.206
Those individuals are scared.

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.943
(Yusaku)
Scared that if
you evolve past us

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.845
and become
the superior species,

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:47.581
you will eliminate
those you consider inferior.

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.083
Because that's what
humans have done

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.184
to other species
throughout history.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:53.020
But I disagree.

00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.055
I believe that we are more
than capable

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.890
of evolving past conflict.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.125
As do I.

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:01.462
Because we can achieve greater
things by working together

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.096
instead of
struggling alone.

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:05.699
And I feel that I could've
convinced the skeptics

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:08.802
to see it my way... if we
weren't rudely interrupted.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.270
Interrupted by who?

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:14.274
(Flame)
By an enemy who knew
our every weakness.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.415
(Ai)
Somebody found the Cyberse?!

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:22.950
But that's impossible!

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.685
I hid the Cyberse
from the entire network!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.122
Yes.
But it wasn't good enough.

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.491
No, it was more
than good enough!

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:31.959
I was extra careful,

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:34.328
dotting my t's
and crossing my i's

00:11:34.428 --> 00:11:36.430
but the Cyberse
was still destroyed

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.331
so I guess I messed up.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.333
So Flame...

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.168
Who attacked the Cyberse?

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.436
(Flame)
It could be anyone.

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:43.504
(Ai)
No!

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.138
It had to be
the Knights of Hanoi!

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.573
I doubt that.

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:49.843
This attack occurred at the same
time you were fighting Varis,

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.645
so it couldn't be them.

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:52.679
(Ai sighs)

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.914
Then I'm stumped.

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:57.250
(Flame)
But I do have
one bit of good news.

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:57.951
Yeah?

00:11:58.352 --> 00:11:59.987
I'll take anything
at this point.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.423
I've ruled you out
as a suspect.

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.491
Thanks...

00:12:03.924 --> 00:12:06.360
What happened to the
other Ignis, Flame?

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.662
(Flame)
We all managed
to escape in time,

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:10.931
but I lost track
of them in the chaos.

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:12.999
So that means
that they're still alive.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.902
(Flame)
Yes, and I would like
your help in finding them.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.305
Yeah, that shouldn't
be too hard.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.341
We only have to search
every nook and cranny

00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:22.909
and every nook and cranny's
nook and cranny.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.011
Then we should
start our search immediately,

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:25.979
don't you think?

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.848
Just because
something is difficult

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:29.216
doesn't mean
you don't do it.

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:32.519
But I'm preaching to
the wrong Ignis about hard work.

00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:34.154
Hey, I work hard!

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.389
I work hard at
hardly working!

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:38.191
Playmaker, I believe
this endeavor

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:40.060
will benefit you
as well.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.229
And why do you think
that exactly?

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.231
Because the attack
on the Cyberse

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:47.000
and the attack on Jin
are connected.

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.302
Connected how?

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:50.404
The one who invaded
the Cyberse

00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:53.073
first ambushed us
with a Link Spell.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.844
(explosion roars)

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:01.148
Wait, a Link Spell?

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.451
The same Link Spell
that Bohman used against you.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.787
So they're all part
of the same squad.

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.322
I believe that
to be true.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.290
So whatever you can
do to help us,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.058
you're helping yourself too.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.294
(Theodore)
And vice versa. You in?

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.463
I've made my decision, Ai.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.330
Have you?

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.733
You mean to put
my life in danger?

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.769
It's getting kinda scary how I'm
getting used to doing that.

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.738
Whoever is behind
all of this...

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.875
Needs to be stopped before
any more damage can be done.

00:13:27.942 --> 00:13:31.211
(Flame)
And I believe we will
succeed because we must succeed.

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:33.547
As long as Ai
doesn't spoil it for us.

00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:35.782
(Ai)
Hey I'm still right here,
you know!

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:40.621
(Hayami)
The final bounty hunter
has arrived, Mr. Zaizen.

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:43.123
Excellent, now the team
is complete.

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.291
Seriously?

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:46.793
Scarf-face behind me
is the big bad bounty hunter

00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:48.562
we've been wasting our time on?

00:13:48.562 --> 00:13:51.932
Yes, Gore.
His name is The Shepherd.

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.734
The Shepherd, huh?

00:13:53.734 --> 00:13:56.737
This poor fella doesn't look
like he can even herd sheep

00:13:56.737 --> 00:13:59.406
without getting trampled
in a half ton of cotton!

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.176
(Shepherd)
I find those who talk too much

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:05.545
are covering up
for their own deficiencies.

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:08.515
And I find those
wearing anaconda scarves

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.350
are covering up
for their ugly.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.320
Who wears sunglasses
indoors anyway!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.356
Zaizen,
you really expect

00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:17.858
this caveman to find
Playmaker?

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.561
Hey don't you give me
the brush off!

00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.997
And yeah, I'm the one
who'll hunt him down!

00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.532
Then I wish you
the best of luck.

00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:28.168
As long as you don't get
in my way, that is.

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:29.636
Because if you do,

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.507
you'll be the next on my
contract list after Playmaker.

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:35.609
You might call this
a hunch...

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:38.511
But I really don't think those
two are going to get along.

00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:41.515
Good. I never
expected them to, Hayami.

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:42.516
What?

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.884
(Hayami chuckles nervously)

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.852
(Shepherd)
And I would've
already captured him

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.355
if another duelist
hadn't interfered.

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.125
Zaizen, that wasn't
one of your hirees

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:52.826
getting in the way,
was it?

00:14:53.194 --> 00:14:54.494
It wasn't.

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:59.700
(Zaizen)
I'm surprised to say that even I
don't know who he is.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.237
Whatever disagreement he has
with Playmaker is his own.

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:06.706
But if you find him,
he may lead us to Playmaker.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.176
Then where's
that glowstick at?

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:11.878
He was last seen
in the Restricted Area.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.446
Yes--
How'd you know?

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.349
I have my ways.

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.417
Then that's
where I'm goin'!

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.726
Thanks, Kolter.

00:15:26.027 --> 00:15:27.595
Nothing to it, man.

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:30.063
Mi food truck
es su food truck.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.900
Yusaku filled me in
on the details--

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.402
I gotta say
that's quite the story.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.837
Plus, you know
his secret identity?

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:39.840
That totally
caught me off guard.

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:41.675
More off guard
than the fact

00:15:41.675 --> 00:15:44.578
that Yusaku actually
made some friends!

00:15:44.578 --> 00:15:45.745
Unreal.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.715
Don't you worry,
Kolter.

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:49.683
We both know how
to keep a secret.

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:52.252
And I'm sorry about
what happened to your brother.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.421
It must be
really tough on you.

00:15:54.955 --> 00:15:56.223
Thanks, kid.

00:15:56.223 --> 00:15:58.725
Seems life dealt us all
a tough hand...

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.427
But the thing is...

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:03.631
As long as you don't fold
and keep on fighting the fight,

00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:07.101
we can take all of that pain
and use it do some good.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.136
And you can count on us...

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:12.406
to do everything we can
to help both you and Jin.

00:16:12.406 --> 00:16:14.808
I know Theodore
doesn't look like the type

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:18.112
who could fight a mosquito--
much less defeat one--

00:16:18.112 --> 00:16:20.914
but his dueling skills
are second to none.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:23.184
That's not how I'd put it
but thanks.

00:16:23.184 --> 00:16:25.953
So Kolter...
have you found any leads?

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.688
I've been
tracking and trailing

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:29.323
Bohman's digital
signature.

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:33.126
And although I haven't been able
to get an exact location...

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:37.531
I've been able to
narrow it down to this spot.

00:16:37.531 --> 00:16:39.300
That's deep in
the LINK VRAINS's

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.401
restricted area--
what's he doing there?

00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:42.736
Don't know.

00:16:42.803 --> 00:16:44.104
But when I combed
the area

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.006
to see if there were
any more clues...

00:16:46.006 --> 00:16:48.475
I found something that seemed
to be outta place...

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:51.978
Some fragmented bits and bytes
of a strange program.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.446
Take a look.

00:16:54.648 --> 00:16:56.182
Wow, that's, um...

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.152
I'm not really a straight
A student.

00:16:58.152 --> 00:16:59.853
That's way over my head.

00:17:01.889 --> 00:17:04.691
Though it isn't exactly
the same thing...

00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:07.428
It looks similar
to one of Ai's programs.

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.595
(both)
Huh?

00:17:08.896 --> 00:17:10.164
You're right!

00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:11.932
It's an Ignis
algorithm!

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:13.233
Whoa, for real?

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:15.536
Yes--
of a Wind Ignis.

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:18.538
So could that be where
the Wind Ignis is hiding out?

00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:21.208
Well, there's only one way
to know for sure.

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.743
Kolter, this is the
most promising lead we have.

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:26.913
We need to get to the Restricted
Area as soon as possible.

00:17:26.913 --> 00:17:28.982
We may not find
an Ignis or Bohman,

00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:30.917
but I'm sure
we'll find something.

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:39.659
Wait here please.

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.029
My pleasure, sir.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.265
(Zaizen)
Skye! Emma.

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.099
(Skye gasps)

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:50.503
Hey there, Akira.

00:17:51.238 --> 00:17:52.539
Sorry I'm late.

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:54.308
Don't worry about it.

00:17:54.308 --> 00:17:58.078
You know how much I enjoy
our secret little rendezvous.

00:17:58.178 --> 00:17:59.680
So what is it, Akira?

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.048
You sounded kinda nervous
before on the phone.

00:18:05.886 --> 00:18:09.890
(whooshing)

00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.794
<i>Yoo hoo!
Security bot up ahead.</i>

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:14.995
I see it.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.964
(electronic chirping)

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.638
(electronic chirping)

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.308
Status update, Ai.

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:29.943
How strong is our signal?

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:31.579
<i>Full bars!</i>

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.547
<i>Anything I'm seeing,
so is Kolter!</i>

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:37.417
(whooshing)

00:18:38.152 --> 00:18:40.420
Kolter...
How do we get there?

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:42.489
I'm workin' on it
right now, bud.

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:45.125
The route's chock
full of traps and dead ends.

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:46.927
It's never easy.

00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:47.627
Huh?

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.432
What's that?

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:54.100
It's a message from
Gore Gal!

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.237
Not a message--
it looks more like a map.

00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:59.773
For entering
the restricted area.

00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:01.676
Why would she help you?

00:19:01.676 --> 00:19:02.876
We have an agreement.

00:19:02.876 --> 00:19:06.113
Every ten times we help her,
she punches us a freebie.

00:19:06.113 --> 00:19:07.514
But that route
she mapped out

00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:10.017
still looks crazy
dangerous to me!

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.187
But it's looking like
that's the only way through.

00:19:13.187 --> 00:19:15.155
It also says there's
a portal at the end

00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:17.358
that even SOL Tech
doesn't know about.

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:19.626
Then that's
where we're going.

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:22.862
(Kolter)
Okay, but I can't
let you go emptyhanded.

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:25.332
What is this, Kolter?

00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:27.000
I took the liberty of
installing

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.769
Ghost Gal's map
into your Duel Disk

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:31.338
and also upgraded
the LVSS firmware.

00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:33.340
It now has a stealth
function

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.342
which will shield you
against basic traps,

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.145
but you still gotta watch out
for top of the line stuff.

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.281
I also added an emergency
log out program

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:44.351
to eject you out of LINK
VRAINS if you get into trouble.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.387
But remember this:
you can only use it one time.

00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:49.723
So make sure
it's the right time.

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.324
Yeah, got it.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.360
Well, good luck.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.394
Thanks.

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:57.731
(whooshing)

00:19:58.132 --> 00:20:00.167
Activating stealth
function.

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:01.468
(electronic screeching)

00:20:05.272 --> 00:20:09.276
(electronic blaring)

00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:15.216
We've made it inside...

00:20:15.316 --> 00:20:17.051
And so far
I don't see any traps

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:18.386
waiting to be sprung...

00:20:18.386 --> 00:20:20.620
Cuz you're looking
in the wrong direction.

00:20:20.687 --> 00:20:21.454
Huh?

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.791
Found you, Playmaker!

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.160
<i>(Ai)
Aww, glitch!</i>

00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.130
We have to move now,
Soulburner!

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:33.333
(Playmaker)
Step on it!
