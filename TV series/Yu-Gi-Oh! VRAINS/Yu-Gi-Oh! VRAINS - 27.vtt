Fear not.

I will accomplish
what you failed to do.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.818
I will capture the Ignis.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.455
That I swear!

Whoo-hoo!

Don't you mean
you did it?

No, I had it right
the first time.

You were not
completely useless.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.134
Roboppi's so flattered.

Thanks to Baira's antivirus,

all the Deleted are awake
and back to their daily grind.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.317
Yeah, it was
the perfect antidote!

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:59.220
Never hurts when the one
who created the virus

is the same one to cure it.

Hmm? What's wrong?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.793
All of our battles
up until now,

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:08.161
they've taken place
inside of LINK VRAINS.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.596
But in this latest incident,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.465
we had to face
the Knights of Hanoi

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.467
in the real world
instead of the virtual.

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.403
Yeah, risking
your secret identity.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:17.905
And if we don't
keep our guard up,

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:20.273
the Hanoi are gonna put
two and two together

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.108
and figure out
that you're Playmaker.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.911
Hmm.

Grr! This one's
not Playmaker either!

You gotta be
kidding, Yusaku!

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:38.325
If Playmaker
and Blue Angel

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.727
are fighting
the Knights of Hanoi,

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:42.129
we can't just stand by
and be spectators.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.296
And why not?

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.165
Because they need our help

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.000
saving the whole world
and everyone on it.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.103
They definitely don't.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.770
Oh yeah?
Why not?

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:51.938
Three reasons.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.641
One, with the antivirus,

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:56.944
duelists are no longer
being deleted.

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.714
Two, if they really
wanted anyone to help,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.947
they would ask for it.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:04.451
And three,
you lack the skills
to defeat the Hanoi.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:05.653
What?!

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.455
You actually don't think
I can outduel 'em?

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:08.889
That is correct, Shima.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.224
Why else would you ask me
to go along with you?

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:13.526
Aah!

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:17.230
I won't dignify that
with an answer! Ugh!

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:19.633
Still ain't one
to mince words, are ya?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.734
It's the truth.

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:28.008
(grumbling)

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.612
(thinking)
Yusaku may not believe
in my skills,

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.548
but I sure convinced
all of them.

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:37.351
Do you see this smile?

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.553
That, my friends,
is the smile of a duelist

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.021
who has never even
been beaten!

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.222
(all gasp)
That's right.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.691
I'm talking
hundreds of duels!

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:46.393
Hard fought ones!

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.994
And not even
a single loss!

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.897
(all)
Ohh!

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.132
They called me
the King of Games!

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.535
(gasping louder)

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:57.504
That is, in the toddlers
and tweens duel circuit.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.872
(all groan)

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:01.408
Ever beat someone
not a kid?

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.910
(chuckling nervously)
Well, uh...

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:05.279
Don't feel bad.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.748
We all gotta start
somewhere, I guess.

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.884
We welcome you
to the Duel Club!

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:11.519
Really?!
You mean it?!

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.388
Oh, you won't be sorry!

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.025
They could've laughed at me,
but they didn't...

00:04:18.092 --> 00:04:21.228
'cause they knew I had
natural talent

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:23.297
to be a champion.

00:04:23.397 --> 00:04:25.266
(pulsing)

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.202
Hmm?
Downloading new data.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:29.904
Huh?!

00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:33.207
I didn't okay
any new download.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.507
Where in the world of worlds

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.911
did this Cyberse Wizard
come from?!

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.414
Go, Cyberse Wizard!

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:42.950
This is Playmaker's card.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.085
But how?
Ohh!

00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:49.089
"Shima, this is Playmaker.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.192
"I'm giving you this card

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.927
"so that you could...

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:55.428
help me take on
the bad guys"?

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.868
Shima, can I
count on you?

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:03.169
You don't have
to ask me twice.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.640
This card...

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.975
It'll give me
the strength to do

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:09.477
whatever needs to be done.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.011
Oh!

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.614
Playmaker could've chosen
anyone, and he chose me!

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.951
Gotta say,
he's got great taste!

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.852
And I won't let him down.

00:05:18.952 --> 00:05:22.990
Playmaker,
your BFF is on his way!

00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:26.159
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.827
Here I come, P.M.!

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:37.805
Oh, wow!
Check out my avatar!

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.507
I'm really in LINK VRAINS!

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.275
And it feels so good!

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:43.911
Better than good!

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:45.179
It feels like...

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.980
I'm a...

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.916
superhero!

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.151
So think I'll try out

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.189
my super powers!

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.657
Oh, yeah,

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.527
(chuckling)

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:01.228
I'm unstoppable!

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:03.697
(yelping)

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.634
(groaning)

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.569
Okay, maybe not.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.806
But this is still awesome!
I'm awesome--

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.341
(duelist yelling)
Huh?

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:16.042
Unh!

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.414
Grr... Nope...

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.049
He's not Playmaker, either.

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:25.019
(grumbling)
(duelist yelling)

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.486
Unh!

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.223
Someone help!

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:32.560
(thinking)
The Knights of Hanoi are
hunting every duelist in sight

00:06:32.593 --> 00:06:35.096
to try and find Playmaker!

00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:37.898
(Knight)
Hey! You there!
what are you up to?

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:40.401
Uhh!
Ha! Let me guess.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.870
Heh heh!
You trick or treating?

00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.338
I'm not here for candy!

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:49.810
Shima, can I
count on you?

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:51.745
I'm here for you!

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:54.215
Playmaker personally
asked for my help

00:06:54.315 --> 00:06:55.716
to defeat you
Hanoi hooligans!

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:57.717
You're friends
with Playmaker?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:00.186
That's right.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.722
Here's proof!

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.157
That's a Cyberse card!

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.627
(Shima)
<i>Yeah, and only
Playmaker plays 'em!</i>

00:07:10.664 --> 00:07:13.300
So if you're looking
to find Playmaker,

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:14.901
I got news for ya!

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.805
You're gonna have to
get past his sidekick first!

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.773
So prepare...

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.576
to take on
The Brave Battler!

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.445
The only thing
brave about you

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.480
is that you're still
willing to dab in public.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.248
Huh?!

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.318
It's still super cool,
unlike you Hanoi!

00:07:31.418 --> 00:07:34.788
Aww man, he's not
scared at all.

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:39.326
I hope my cards talk
a better game than me!

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:41.328
(both)
Now let's duel!

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.634
(thinking)
Ohh! Oh no!

00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:50.303
My monsters' levels
are too high to summon!

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:53.774
This is the worst
starting hand possible!

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.144
Hmm... That brave bozo
has the lead

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:59.112
before the duel
even started!

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.849
(Shima, thinking)
No no no!

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.617
I can't play
any of these cards!

00:08:03.684 --> 00:08:05.652
I totally bricked my hand!

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:11.658
(both)
Huh?! Hmm!

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.627
Just the hand I wanted!

00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:16.029
Grr!

00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:18.498
(thinking)
Oh, well, just gonna have
to make the best of it.

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:19.833
It's my turn!

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.835
Heh!
By all means

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:23.670
So not flash!

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:25.505
I'll start things off
by activating

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.376
the spell card
Hand Destruction!

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:31.011
We both have to send
two cards in our hands

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:32.847
to our graveyards,
and then draw

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.182
two new cards from our decks
in their place.

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:38.285
New cards? Nice!

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:41.054
He thinks he's hurting me
but he's actually helping!

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:44.024
I shall get rid
of these monsters,

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.026
two Steelswarm Mantises.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.729
Now you must discard
two cards of your own.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.130
It's cool.

00:08:50.197 --> 00:08:53.199
I wasn't feelin' these
Green Baboons anyway.

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:56.637
Come on!

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.675
Don't brick,
don't brick,
don't brick!

00:09:01.742 --> 00:09:04.177
Ugh!
Aww!

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.612
(both)
Useless!

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:08.415
(thinking)
Wait, actually...

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.917
With these two
spell cards...

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:13.353
Yes... This could work!

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.423
(chuckling)
I drew the perfect cards!

00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:20.594
Heh! Can't be more
perfect than my cards!

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:24.031
Perfectly awful!
This is so not flash!

00:09:24.097 --> 00:09:25.432
Really?

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:29.236
I activate, the spell card
A Feather of the Phoenix!

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:31.705
I discard one card
from my hand,

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.275
and that lets me retrieve
one card in my graveyard

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:36.744
and return it
to the top of my deck.

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:39.446
I exchange
Steelswarm Mantis

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:41.915
and take back Hand Destruction
from the grave!

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:43.450
Next up, I activate

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.920
the spell card Soul Charge
from my hand.

00:09:45.953 --> 00:09:49.122
It lets me summon as many
monsters from my graveyard

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:52.759
as I want, as long as I pay
1,000 life points

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:55.128
for each one!

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:58.932
Rise up, my three
Steelswarm Mantises!

00:10:04.105 --> 00:10:06.774
Unh!

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:10.044
Your opponent is down
to 1,000 life points.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.411
Hmm!

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.048
Yeah, but he has, like,
three super powerful monsters

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:15.549
while I have zip.

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:18.018
But wait...
the Green Baboons
in my graveyard

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.187
have more attack points
than his monsters.

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:23.690
If I can resurrect even one,
I'll so win this!

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:26.360
I bet You're planning
on re-summoning a monkey

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:28.863
from your graveyard
aren't you, kid?

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:31.598
He's onto me!
I gotta bluff!

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:33.300
Yes. Yes, I am.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.068
I never was good
at bluffing.

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:37.070
Well, it's not
going to matter.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.073
Not after I tribute
my three Steelswarms

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:43.777
to summon this behemoth!

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:46.513
Descend...
Steelswarm Hercules!

00:10:50.718 --> 00:10:52.619
(roaring)

00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:56.089
Ugh!

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:58.892
(AI)
Steelswarm Hercules
has 3200 attack points.

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.128
Hmph! Like I'm scared.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.497
I'm so scared!

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.332
(knight)
Perhaps this will put
the fear in you.

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:08.335
By paying half
my life points,
Hercules destroys

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:10.337
all other cards
on the field
other than itself!

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.506
Say what?
That's right!

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:15.008
So no matter
how many monsters
you decide to summon,

00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:18.312
each and every one of them
will be destroyed
during my turn.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.947
This is gettin'
worse and worse.
Aww, man!

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.150
It's your turn, Halloween!

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.185
Not that there's anything
you can actually do.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.489
There's plenty I can do.
Like shake my fist at you!

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.857
I don't care if you don't
believe in me

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.692
as long as Playmaker does!

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:34.661
So I won't give up!

00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:38.666
My turn! Ohh!

00:11:38.699 --> 00:11:39.966
What's that?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.069
Heh! Just a gift.

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.505
(Shima, thinking)
And a nice one at that.

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:46.306
But Cyberse Wizard
is a strong card

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.943
only when it's used
in just the right way.

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.078
I don't know if I'm up
to the challenge.

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:52.813
(Playmaker)
You're up to the challenge.

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:56.016
Now, Shima... believe.

00:11:56.116 --> 00:11:57.518
And if you do...

00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:00.154
You will Win this battle.

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:01.555
(whispering)
I promise.

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:04.524
Really?
You promise?

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.395
Okay then.

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.364
That's just what I'll do.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.532
I'm gonna believe
in myself.

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:14.034
Thanks!
You're as smart

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.803
as ten Einsteins
squished together.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.906
When this is all over,
ya think we can hang?

00:12:19.006 --> 00:12:22.676
C'mon, kid, stop daydreaming
and make a move, will ya?

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.012
You bet I'll make a move!

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:28.081
I summon my Cyberse Wizard!

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.357
Huh? Hey!

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.527
You made it here
just in time!

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.061
You need to see this.

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.331
See what?
Huh?

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:46.567
Cyberse Wizard? How?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.402
I don't know...
Only you and Varis

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:51.505
have ever been able to
summon Cyberse monsters.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:54.408
But I guess this
"Brave Battler"
makes three.

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.343
I've never heard
of him before.

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:58.512
He's definitely heard
about us, though.

00:12:58.545 --> 00:12:59.913
How would you know?

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:02.083
'Cause this guy stole
Yusaku's card!

00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:03.951
No, mine's right here.

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:06.420
Hmm, that's weird.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:09.456
Whoa!
Its data's been stripped!

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.924
What do you mean?

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.727
I mean you have the card,
but not its digital core!

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:15.129
That's not good.

00:13:15.162 --> 00:13:17.898
Nope, and I have hunch
it's gonna get worse.

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:29.576
Are you finished?

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:33.080
Far from it.
But you're so gonna be!

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.782
I activate Cyberse Wizard's
special ability

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:37.784
to switch your
Steelswarm Hercules

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.820
from attack
to defense mode!

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.957
Go, Cyberse Algorithm!

00:13:44.058 --> 00:13:45.392
Ohh!

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:46.960
And I use the word
"defense" loosely

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.296
because your monster's
zero defense points

00:13:49.397 --> 00:13:51.932
isn't much in the way
of protection!

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:54.268
So that chump
won't save you!

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.369
Cyberse Wizard, attack!

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.509
And due to my
Cyberse Wizard's
special ability,

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:03.811
he can deal you damage

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.380
even if your monster's
in defense mode!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.847
Game over!

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:11.351
Unh!

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:14.488
When ya go and mess
with the Brave,

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.023
ya dig your own grave!

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:19.226
So flash!

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:21.528
He may have stolen
your card data,

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.030
but he did use it
to bring down

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.698
one of the
Knights of Hanoi.

00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:26.466
Yeah...
so does that make him

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.535
chaotic good
or lawful evil?

00:14:28.635 --> 00:14:30.471
Found my super
awesome stash

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:32.339
of role-playing
rulebooks, did ya?

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.375
He LARPs
as Kolter Footlonger,

00:14:34.475 --> 00:14:36.009
the Butcher of Beef.

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.878
Good for him, but I think
it's more important

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:40.347
for us to focus on finding
this Brave Battler.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.317
On it.

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.285
You're the bestest!

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:47.020
Thank you so much
for saving us!

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.355
We're fans!

00:14:48.455 --> 00:14:50.824
Heh!
Of course you are!

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.526
I mean,
how could you not be?

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.728
That was so awesome.

00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:58.064
'Cause saving lives
is what I do.

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.000
Have been
for my whole entire life!

00:15:00.034 --> 00:15:01.501
(both cheering)

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.870
Thank you.

00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:05.205
But now I must be going.

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:08.108
After all, there are more
battles for the Battler...

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:10.444
to battle!

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:12.746
(duelists)
Yeah, Battler!

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.414
Till next time!

00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:16.684
The Brave Battler
could be a lead

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.252
to finding Playmaker.

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.755
And lead
to finding the Ignis.

00:15:21.855 --> 00:15:25.359
Ahh... There you are.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:29.062
(Yusaku)
Shima is the Brave Battler?

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.263
No way!

00:15:30.363 --> 00:15:32.532
Doesn't he have
the dueling IQ of a rock?

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.268
It's all here.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.703
The data doesn't lie.

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:38.905
If we are able to uncover

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:41.542
his true identity
this quickly...

00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:43.677
so can the Knights
of Hanoi.

00:15:43.744 --> 00:15:46.413
This is by far
the flashest thing

00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:48.615
to happen in my entire life!

00:15:48.715 --> 00:15:51.452
Except that time I got
extra cheese on my nachos

00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:52.853
without even ordering it.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.088
I'm Playmaker's
bestest friend!

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:58.758
I can't believe my luck--
Well, you shouldn't.

00:16:02.362 --> 00:16:03.797
Nighty-night.

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:05.699
Unh!

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:18.144
(groaning)
Where am I?

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:22.349
Huh?!
Hey, hey, someone help me!

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:25.118
(Alec)
No one can hear you.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:26.787
Who is that?

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.589
Where are you?
Show yourself!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:31.124
(Alec)
I'll be the one
making the demands.

00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:33.660
Now then,
where is Playmaker?

00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:35.496
How in the world
would I know?

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:38.532
I mean, I'm a fan
but it's not like
I even know the guy!

00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:41.168
But you said you were
his sidekick

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:43.637
in your last duel
as the Brave Battler.

00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:44.972
Ohh!

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.940
Even if you won't talk.

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:49.843
I still can
make use of you.

00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:51.478
Huh?

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:54.748
(whimpering)
Hey, what are you doing?

00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:57.450
Stop it!
Come on, man, quit it!

00:16:57.484 --> 00:17:00.220
Oh, this is so,
so not flash!

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:06.326
(whimpering)
Hey, what are you doing?

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:09.029
Stop it!
Come on, man, quit it!

00:17:09.063 --> 00:17:12.399
Oh, this is so,
so, not flash!

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.868
Ahh!
Shima's back in LINK VRAINS!

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:17.071
And looks like
he's not alone.

00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:20.540
(Yusaku)
Zoom in.

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:24.178
Zapping someone unconscious
is a big no-no, you know!

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.546
Heh!
I've done much worse.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.017
I know you're watching,
Playmaker.

00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:33.487
My name is Faust.
Come and face me.

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:36.423
Or relieving your sidekick
of his Cyberse Wizard

00:17:36.523 --> 00:17:38.425
will be the least
of your worries.

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:39.893
Fat chance!

00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:42.696
Playmaker trusted me with that
card, so you can't have it!

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:45.398
He thinks I gave it to him?

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:47.634
We'll duel
for the card then.

00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:51.305
A duel?!
Uh... (whimpering)

00:17:51.372 --> 00:17:53.306
Whoa! You know,
at times like these

00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:55.542
I really think there's
just one thing to say,

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.544
and that one thing
is... help!

00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:00.547
<i>If you can hear me,
I've been snatched
against my will</i>

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:03.117
<i>and locked away in some
strange warehouse!</i>

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.552
<i>Although, I gotta admit...</i>

00:18:04.618 --> 00:18:05.920
Locked away
in a warehouse?

00:18:05.953 --> 00:18:08.321
That means
this Faust fella
must've found Shima

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.223
and locked him away
in real life!

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.625
Can you find him?

00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.793
They must still be somewhere
within the city limits.

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.462
I sure can try,

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:17.431
but it's going to take me
a little time.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:20.567
So how about you head
into LINK VRAINS
and save him?

00:18:20.634 --> 00:18:22.236
You got it.

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:24.772
Ohh!
Where's my Duel Disk?

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:29.977
Ahh!
I know I left it
right here.

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:31.611
(Ai)
<i>Heya, guys!</i>

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:34.114
Ohh! Now what?

00:18:34.148 --> 00:18:37.117
<i>You all look like
cockroaches from up here!</i>

00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:38.819
Ai, is that you?

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:40.487
<i>The one and only!</i>

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:43.791
<i>Wait, hold on, let me make
sure I get my good side.</i>

00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.726
<i>Ta-dah!</i>

00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:47.794
<i>Come to think of it,
both my sides look good!</i>

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.463
An Ai in the sky.

00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:51.065
Just what we need.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.634
<i>I reworked the Duel Disk
into a Duel Drone</i>

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.869
<i>so you can't lock me up
at home anymore.</i>

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:57.971
<i>And I might just not
come back!</i>

00:18:58.072 --> 00:18:59.773
You won't come back?

00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:01.675
I'm trying to think
of three reasons

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:03.811
why that would be bad,
but I cannot.

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:06.947
<i>Uh-huh, I know you're
crying on the inside.</i>

00:19:07.014 --> 00:19:08.815
Actually, you can
prove helpful.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:10.350
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.519
You can search
for Shima from above.

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:15.689
By flying around?
Den City is huge!

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:17.991
It'll be like finding
a needle in a haystack!

00:19:18.025 --> 00:19:19.993
Unless Ai knows
where to look.

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.029
<i>And it just so happens I do!</i>

00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:23.964
<i>Every card emits
a data signal.</i>

00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:25.666
It does.

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.835
But I don't know
if Cyberse Wizard's scent
is strong enough

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:29.770
for Ai to get a whiff
and hone in on it.

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.204
<i>Just 'cause
I don't have a schnozz</i>

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:33.674
<i>doesn't mean I can't
sniff things out! Hmph!</i>

00:19:33.707 --> 00:19:36.010
(Kolter)
You're being
a bit "scent-sitive".

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.378
<i>Fine, Kolter.</i>

00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:39.780
Besides, I already picked up
Cyberse Wizard's

00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:42.483
general direction
while Playmaker was yappin'.

00:19:42.516 --> 00:19:44.451
Okay, let's move!

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:45.719
(engine starts)

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:50.724
(Brave Battler)
Come on, instead
of Speed Dueling,

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:52.860
can't we maybe pick
another game?

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:54.961
Like hide-and-go-seek?

00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:59.633
Get on the duel board.

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:00.901
Rock, Scissors, Paper?

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.669
My, my!

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:05.372
For someone
that Playmaker trusts...

00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:07.775
you're quite the coward.

00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:09.476
(gasps)

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.012
You lack the skills
to defeat the Hanoi.

00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:15.349
We've all gotta start
somewhere I guess.

00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:17.384
(thinking)
But Playmaker believes in me,

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:19.353
so I gotta believe
in me too!

00:20:19.387 --> 00:20:22.056
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:24.325
Let's do this!

00:20:24.358 --> 00:20:28.028
Boy, you just can't escape
the traffic in this town!

00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:30.363
Hey, not so close!

00:20:30.464 --> 00:20:32.499
Where'd you learn to fly,
birdbrain?

00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:34.334
Hey!
It's another drone!

00:20:34.368 --> 00:20:36.370
Except it's got
one more rotor that me.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.006
Not that I'm jelly.
It's the thrust that counts.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.108
Oh!
(yelping)

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:43.510
Unh! Oof!

00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:46.780
Why build a building
all the way up here?

00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:48.349
(Yusaku)
Where are you, Ai?

00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:50.450
<i>Definitely not running into
any large buildings, heh heh!</i>

00:20:50.517 --> 00:20:52.185
Signal's getting
stronger.

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:54.655
Ai, rendezvous
at street level.

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:55.855
Ten-four!

00:20:55.956 --> 00:20:58.191
Ace pilot Ai coming in
for touchdown!

00:20:58.225 --> 00:20:59.826
Then again,
I'm not exactly sure

00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:01.261
how to touch down
in this thing.

00:21:01.294 --> 00:21:03.397
Forgot the landing gear!

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.366
(Yusaku)
So then use the gear
it does have.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.567
(Ai)
Oh yeah.

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:17.244
Okay, keep tracking
Shima's signal.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.945
Right!

00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:25.753
It's time...

00:21:25.786 --> 00:21:29.423
to link into the VRAINS!

00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:31.424
(thinking)
I'm coming, Shima.

00:21:34.862 --> 00:21:37.764
(theme music playing)
