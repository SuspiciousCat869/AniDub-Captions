00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.338
(Ai)
<i>Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...</i>

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.475
There's the grand prize--
SOL Technologies' core.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.478
The whole world's
info's in there.

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.780
(Playmaker)
Now I understand
why you're here.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:15.148
To stop me from
getting access.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.817
(Zaizen)
<i>Before you arrived,
I accessed the databank</i>

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.421
<i>and learned what happened
to you ten years ago.</i>

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:22.823
<i>Reliving that tragedy
isn't good for you.</i>

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.960
<i>So let me bring the Hanoi and
those in SOL Tech to justice.</i>

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.630
I'm willing to risk
everything to get
what I want.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.166
And that even includes
putting Ai on the line
and up for grabs.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.501
Yeah, wait! What?!

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.972
But if I win, I get direct
access to the databank.

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:39.072
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.011
You're not the only one
who suffered a decade ago.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.446
You see, Skye and I
didn't have

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.648
such a wonderful
childhood either.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.150
Which I know you
can relate to

00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:53.320
because of that...
incident.
(gasps)

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:57.457
What's this?
What incident does he mean?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.427
Let me handle this
so you don't have to.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.397
You want to fight our fight?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.666
(both)
This is not your battle!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.267
(Playmaker)
I Link Summon...

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:12.206
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.909
(Zaizen)
That's the monster
you used to defeat Varis,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.677
but you're going
to find, Playmaker,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.479
that I'm no Varis!

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.985
♪♪♪

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.078
♪♪♪

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.287
C'mon, Yusaku.
Win this!

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.790
Playmaker has
his best monster out.

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:37.291
Now the question is...

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:39.960
Can Akira
find a way to top it?

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:41.161
Because if he can't,

00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:44.398
his life points
are hitting rock bottom!

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:48.268
That monster may be tough,
until I cut it down to size!

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.938
Tindangle Hound!
Roar!

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.406
(roaring)

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.474
Blast away
1000 attack points

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:57.611
for every monster that
Firewall Dragon is linked to!

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.115
(groans)

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.284
The only thing worse than
losing those attack points

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:06.720
is that Hound's
halitosis! P-U!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.957
Zaizen! Your maneuver
will not go unpunished

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.659
as I activate the
spell card Link Hole!

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.796
For every Link 3 or higher
monster I have on my field,

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:18.232
this spell destroys
one of your monsters!

00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:20.234
And I just happen
to have two monsters

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:21.868
that meet
this requirement!

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:28.809
Link 3 Decode Talker
and Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:32.680
Tindangle Hound and
Tindangle Angel are destroyed!

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.883
No! Both of my monsters
are now gone!

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:38.185
Yup! With all your
monsters in the graveyard,

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.153
I'd say you're drowning
in doom!

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.824
While things are going
swimmingly for us! Ha ha ha!

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.560
Because Playmaker's dueling
with actual competence!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.696
Now that your Hound is gone,
so is its special ability,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.232
so my monsters regain
their attack points!

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.967
And your monsters

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:56.102
aren't the only ones
that are gone.

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.806
So is your trap,
Lemoine Point.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.110
(groans)

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.546
Strike Zaizen directly!

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.048
Decode Destruction!

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:16.523
(groans)

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.958
Akira, no!

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:22.196
You have taken damage
to your life points.
I know!

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:25.633
Ga-zam! One last
attack and Zaizen's
life points are finito!

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.269
Oh, that is not happening.

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:30.337
I activate the trap...

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.073
Tindangle Delaunay!

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.209
This trap card activates when
you receive battle damage

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.946
while having three Tindangle
monsters in your graveyard.

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:41.182
A must-have
in any Tindangle deck.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.250
Not only
does this trap card

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.918
destroy
your attacking monster,

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.353
but it also
allows me to summon

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.023
Tindangle Acute Cerberus
from my Extra Deck!

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:50.257
What?

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.593
Your Decode Talker
is silenced!

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:56.063
Aah! It went blooey!

00:04:56.097 --> 00:05:00.133
Now emerge...
Tindangle Acute Cerberus!

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:13.113
(groans) Oh, wait,
what am I scared of?

00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:15.949
It has no attack points.
And that's what worries me.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:19.185
Why? That pooch is
all bark and no bite!

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.655
How wrong you are.
It has plenty of bite!

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:24.692
(Zaizen's Ai)
When both Tindangle Hound
and Tindangle Angel

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:25.959
are in my graveyard,

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:30.597
Tindangle Acute Cerberus
gains 1500 from each.

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.167
(electronic beeping)

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.136
That's a big number!

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.073
Aww... That's what we get for
getting so full of ourselves!

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.176
(Playmaker)
It wasn't "we," Ai.
It was just you.

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:45.012
I know better than
underestimating any opponent.

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:49.282
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:51.652
It was a seesaw battle,
but now the elephant's

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.654
sitting on Akira's side
of the plank,

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.756
leaving Playmaker
hanging in the air.

00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.325
You may have fought
valiantly, Playmaker...

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.662
But ultimate victory...
remains in my grasp!

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.400
Acute Cerberus,
destroy Firewall Dragon!

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:09.302
Isometric Inferno!

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.179
(Zaizen)
Acute Cerberus,
destroy Firewall Dragon!

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:19.480
If this attack hits,

00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:21.881
our life points
will go up in flames!

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:23.384
I'm well aware.

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:27.087
So I activate this...
the trap Doppler
Phase Coating,

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:30.757
which I equip
onto Firewall Dragon!

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.228
Try to break through
all you want.

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:37.164
This coating
prevents my Dragon

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.100
from being destroyed
in battle!

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.535
But you still take damage.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.004
(groans)

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.706
(Zaizen)
And that's not
the end of the tale!

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.409
(Zaizen's Ai)
After Tindangle
Acute Cerberus attacks,

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.712
you can summon
one Tindangle Token.

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.482
Additionally, Tindangle Acute
Cerberus gains 500 attack points

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.884
for every Tindangle monster
linked to it.

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:03.457
That big number got bigger!

00:07:03.557 --> 00:07:05.626
I can do the math, too, Ai.

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.094
I then place
two cards facedown...

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.564
and end my turn.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.500
Okay. My turn! I draw!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.769
Stop there!
Before you continue,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.605
I activate my trap card,
Gergonne's End!

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:22.276
(Zaizen's Ai)
By equipping Gergonne's End
on a Tindangle monster,

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.312
that monster cannot be destroyed
in battle or by effects.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.048
Additionally, effects cannot
target said monster.

00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:32.453
This will protect
my Acute Cerberus
from anything you can do!

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:35.990
That takes care of my defense,
but on the offensive side,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.492
when all of Acute Cerberus's
links are filled,

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.894
I can send the linked
monsters to the graveyard

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.797
to deal you damage equal
to its attack points!

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.299
(Playmaker's Ai)
You kiddin' me?

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.968
That's like the perfect
offense and defense!

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.704
It's not fair!

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.606
Fair or not, this is
the reality we face.

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.275
Simply complaining
is pointless

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:55.943
and a waste of
everyone's time.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.378
Don't you get
philosophical on me!

00:07:58.445 --> 00:08:00.581
Besides, all of
Cerberus's links

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:02.383
must be filled to
activate his effect,

00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:04.185
but one arrow points
to my field.

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.387
And I don't intend to
summon a monster there.

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:09.857
Okay but still, you only
have 1500 life points left...

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.493
And Acute Cerberus is 1000
attack points stronger

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:13.828
than Firewall Dragon.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.530
If tuxboy there summons
another Tindangle,

00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:18.565
that mongrel will
gain 500 attack points

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.867
and we're dog chow!

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.503
Then it's my job
to not let that happen.

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:23.971
Alert Lancer!

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.273
This spell allows
my Firewall Dragon

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.374
to deal you damage

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:30.310
even if your monster
is in defense mode.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.180
Oh! I get it!
His Tindangle Token

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:34.648
has zero defense points,

00:08:34.682 --> 00:08:36.717
so he'll take the full
pummelin' and lose!

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:38.285
Ha ha!

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.453
(Playmaker)
Firewall Dragon attack!

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:50.864
Tempest Terahertz!

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:52.365
For the win!

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.270
I activate my trap card...

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:58.506
Morley's Shield!

00:08:58.606 --> 00:09:01.942
Once per turn, when you
battle my Tindangle monster,

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.577
I take no damage!

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:07.281
So go ahead and
destroy my Token!

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.051
My life points still remain
safe and sound, Playmaker!

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:13.754
I hate when they do stuff
that makes me look dumb!

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:16.189
But one less monster
means your dog

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:19.759
sheds 500 attack points,
so it's not all bad... sorta.

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:21.796
(Playmaker)
I end my turn.

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:24.731
You had a chance to win,
but you squandered it.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.367
And you won't
get a second chance!

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.375
And this card that I just
drew all but confirms it.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:38.745
I now activate the spell card,
Nagel's Protection!

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.882
As long as I have
this card on my field,

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.684
Tindangle monsters
in my Main Monster Zone

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.722
can't be destroyed in battle
or by your effects!

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:53.426
So your invincible monsters are
now, like, super invincible?

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:54.695
That's right!

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:58.932
Tindangle Acute Cerberus,
attack Firewall Dragon!

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.736
(roars)

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.240
Our monsters are
no pushovers either!

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.909
Firewall's equipped with
Doppler Phase Coating,

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.577
so it can't be destroyed!

00:10:10.678 --> 00:10:14.848
But your life points can be.
I activate Nagel's Protection!

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.718
(Zaizen's Ai)
Once per turn, when
a Tindangle monster battles,

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:20.020
Nagel's Protection
doubles the battle damage.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.222
How dare you!

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:24.424
(groans)

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:27.093
Once the battle's over,
Acute Cerberus

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:33.200
summons one Tindangle Token
next to its link.

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:37.671
And that restores Acute Cerberus
with 500 attack points.

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:40.607
My defense is impenetrable.

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:42.576
Nooooo!
No no no no no no no!

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.445
He built a wall behind
a wall behind a wall,

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.081
a whole haul of walls!

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:49.382
Morley's Shield?
No damage.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.085
Nagel's Protection? No
destroying monsters never.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:55.021
Back that up with getting
a Tindangle Token every turn

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:57.424
and that adds up to a
confounding conundrum

00:10:57.458 --> 00:11:01.162
because if he fills up
all of Acute Cerberus's
links with monsters,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:03.597
his trap Gergonne's End
is guaranteed to end us

00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:05.332
like a period
of a sentence!

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.934
I don't think you need to worry
about that happening,

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.304
because his Acute Cerberus
can attack

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:12.439
and eliminate all
my life points anyway.

00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:15.176
You wanna put some more
fear into that voice?

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:18.412
Because I find your lack
of concern concerning!

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.182
Why should I? It's not like that
would help me win the duel.

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:23.684
Are you even trying?

00:11:23.784 --> 00:11:25.485
You know what's gonna
happen if you lose?

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.488
Zaizen gets to
take me from you!

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:29.690
And I won't be around to
give you positive vibes,

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.325
you mindless meatbag!

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.860
If that's your idea of words
of encouragement, Ai,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.963
I'm more than willing
to help you pack.

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:39.466
(groans) So not cool! After
everything we went through?

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.635
The millions of times
I saved you?

00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:43.837
You'd abandon
your bestie like that?

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.473
Whoever said
we were besties?

00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:51.611
How can one noun, two verbs,
and two pronouns hurt so much?

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:54.815
I can't allow my emotions
to cloud my thinking.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:56.417
That will only
lead to mistakes

00:11:56.483 --> 00:11:58.585
during the crucial
juncture of this duel.

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:00.888
Well, you're doing
a good job of that!

00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:02.823
You're more of an Ai
than I!

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.425
Processing... Calculating...
Click clack click...

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:07.894
Win probability at 5%.

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:10.164
Actually, my odds
are less than that.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.331
(groans)

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.234
But.. despite that
being the case,

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:17.304
I am determined
to win this duel.

00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:21.041
And whatever I set
my mind to, I will accomplish.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:24.878
I spent a decade building
my deck just for this moment.

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:29.149
It all comes down
to this one draw...

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:33.587
But I believe in my deck!
I draw!

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:38.559
So tell me, Playmaker,
did your trust pay off?

00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:41.362
Well?

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:45.765
I place this card facedown.
And end my turn.

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:48.369
Clearly not the card
you were hoping for.

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:51.705
Because miracles
don't happen in real life.

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:54.041
So you'll lose this duel

00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:56.142
and lose
your one opportunity

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:58.412
to uncover the mysteries
of your past.

00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:00.680
But you have won
something in exchange.

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:04.985
Your freedom. The past
is a ball and chain.

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:07.621
It keeps you from
moving forward in life.

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:12.726
But now, at long last,
you will finally be able to.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.828
I know what they did
to you was horrendous.

00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:16.663
But I'll take care
of your problem.

00:13:16.764 --> 00:13:19.599
So go make new friends,
be adventurous.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.402
You can do anything

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:24.772
when you're no longer
consumed with revenge.

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:27.741
Your future is right
before your eyes.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.444
Right before our eyes?
I don't see anything.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:31.978
(Blue Angel)
So it's all peaches
and cream, huh?

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.079
(groans)

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.783
(Zaizen)
Skye?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.592
(Playmaker)
Blue Angel...

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:47.761
I've been listening to you two
jabbering about the past this

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:50.764
and past that, and the one
thing I really don't like,

00:13:50.798 --> 00:13:54.001
Akira, is my own brother
keeping secrets.

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.970
Playmaker, what my brother's
offering, to be honest,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.471
it doesn't sound bad.

00:13:58.572 --> 00:14:00.573
I mean, who wouldn't
want to be free,

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.877
Believe me, I know.
Ahem... Akira...

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.114
But listen, the fact that
you're fighting so hard

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.516
tells me that it's not
that easy for you.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.653
That your past is not
something that you
can just let go of.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.355
So Playmaker,
what happened?

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:19.326
Akira, you care to share?
Skye, I...

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.795
Ya know, half the folks here
already know what's up,

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.497
so it ain't much
of a spoiler to fill in

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.865
the rest of the gang,
right?

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:28.135
I mean, how interesting can
Playmaker's past be anyway?

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.671
Very well then, Skye...
I'll tell you what I know.

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:33.173
Story time!

00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.108
There was an incident

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:39.847
known among inner circles
as the "Lost Incident."

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.715
Six children went missing,

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:44.317
mysteriously vanishing
one-by-one.

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:47.287
Because a secret
organization took them.

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:48.489
Took them?

00:14:48.522 --> 00:14:52.459
And one of the six
children was Playmaker.

00:14:52.526 --> 00:14:56.163
You were?!
No way. I'm sorry.

00:14:56.197 --> 00:14:59.132
That would certainly
sour one's attitude.

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:01.134
Yusaku...

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.203
That's enough, Zaizen.

00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:05.572
If my story
is going to be told,

00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.841
I will be
the one to tell it.

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:10.577
Playmaker...

00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:13.080
It's true
that I was taken...

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:16.049
But that was only
the beginning of things.

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:22.256
Once I was, the next thing I
knew, I had been locked away.

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:24.591
(groans)

00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:28.028
Where am I?

00:15:28.095 --> 00:15:31.032
I found myself
alone in an empty room.

00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:32.966
Except for one thing.

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:36.670
A single piece of VR tech.

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:39.072
The headset
showed a duel field...

00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:42.609
where I was forced to duel.
And win.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.411
Because if I didn't...

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.913
(computer voice)
<i>You lose!</i>

00:15:45.946 --> 00:15:48.115
(groans)

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:50.751
I was punished
for my failure.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.753
♪♪♪

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.498
It was
a tedious existence...

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:06.700
(groans)

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.935
(eating)

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:10.471
Eat, sleep and duel.

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:12.906
That's all I was
permitted to do.

00:16:12.973 --> 00:16:17.110
Eat, sleep and duel.

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:19.579
(computer voice)
<i>You lose!</i>

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.516
And when I lost, the "eat"
portion went away.

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:25.619
So I had to improve
as a duelist to win.

00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:27.654
(groans)

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:30.023
Duel after duel
after duel,

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:32.526
hour after hour,
day after day...

00:16:32.626 --> 00:16:33.827
Wondering why I'm here,

00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:35.962
wondering why
life dealt me this hand,

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.297
wondering when this
would end,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.632
if it would
ever end at all...

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:40.300
Oh, man...

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.569
What a nightmare
it must have been.

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:46.306
(Playmaker)
<i>No, Blue Angel,
it was much worse.</i>

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.509
For, you see, nightmares
end when you wake up.

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:53.647
I never knew when this

00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:55.615
was going to end,
and then one day...

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:56.816
(groans)

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.387
it just... did.

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:10.564
(computer voice)
<i>Good, you never gave up.</i>

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:11.898
<i>You may go home now.</i>

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:13.500
(groans)

00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:18.371
(groans)
(door opens)

00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:31.084
(Zaizen)
You were rescued, but
the culprit was never found.

00:17:31.184 --> 00:17:33.987
In fact, the whole Lost
Incident was covered up,

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.556
so the public never
knew it even occurred.

00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:39.993
Do you happen to know
the identities of
the six children?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.898
No. For a crime such as this,
the state spared no expense

00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:45.432
at protecting
their identities.

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:48.502
The data files here
contained much information,

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.371
but not the names
of the children,

00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:54.040
so Playmaker, your true
identity's still a mystery.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.543
Phew! That was a close one.

00:17:56.577 --> 00:18:02.783
Zaizen... You said that those
rescuers saved me that day.

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:05.285
But I wasn't saved at all!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.955
There are three reasons
why I must learn

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:12.225
the motive behind
the Lost Incident.

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:15.162
One: I can only
move past my suffering

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:18.665
when I know why I had to
suffer in the first place.

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.501
<i>Two: To save those
who are still afflicted</i>

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.371
<i>from the ramifications
of what we had to endure.</i>

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:28.542
And three: When I was
about to give up back then,

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.911
one voice kept me going.

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:36.116
(voice)
Hey. Hey.
C'mon, you gotta get up.

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.551
I can't do it.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:39.119
You can
make it through this.

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:42.556
You just have to always
remember these three things...

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:46.059
One: If you give up now,
there won't be a next time.

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.663
Two: You can't win if you
don't believe you can win.

00:18:49.763 --> 00:18:52.132
And three: Just because
it's tough now

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:53.501
doesn't mean it
will always be.

00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:56.937
Who are you?
Where are you?

00:18:57.037 --> 00:19:00.140
(voice)
Three, that's all you need.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.976
Are you locked up too?

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:07.515
Just three simple reasons
can get you through anything.

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:09.483
Okay, three things.

00:19:09.516 --> 00:19:13.386
That's right.
Just don't give up hope.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.523
The reason I'm here today
is because of that voice.

00:19:16.623 --> 00:19:19.160
And whoever that was
was not among the rescued.

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:22.462
So if he's still captured,
I must rescue him!

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.865
Zaizen, you speak
of the Lost Incident

00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:27.868
as if it was something
that was ended a decade ago.

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:32.272
But for me,
it still hasn't ended!

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.208
I wrestle with
the past every day

00:19:35.309 --> 00:19:38.812
as I try to move
forward and start over.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.148
Many people did try
to help me readjust

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.183
back to a normal life.

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:47.855
My teachers and classmates
treated me no different,

00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:51.024
just another normal kid.

00:19:51.124 --> 00:19:52.292
Deep down inside though,

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:55.662
I was still struggling
through the pain...

00:19:57.464 --> 00:20:00.700
And this pain would only
grow as I grew older...

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.135
(groans)

00:20:02.169 --> 00:20:03.771
(computer voice)
<i>You lose!</i>

00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:06.539
(groans)

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.309
The nightmares would
come every night.

00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:10.377
It was if I was falling

00:20:10.478 --> 00:20:12.846
into a bottomless
chasm of despair...

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.549
but I realized that if
I didn't want to break,

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:17.817
I had to
climb out on my own.

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:20.688
Instead of
trying to avoid it,

00:20:20.788 --> 00:20:25.159
I decided to confront
the demons that haunt me.

00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:27.128
So I started to
investigate every detail

00:20:27.194 --> 00:20:28.696
about the Lost Incident,

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.497
looking for
any bit of information

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.500
that might prove useful,
no matter how insignificant.

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:37.438
Then one day I collected a
piece that was indeed useful.

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:39.273
I learned that
the Lost Incident

00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:41.541
went by another name:
The Hanoi Project.

00:20:41.642 --> 00:20:43.377
The Hanoi Project?

00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:45.879
So then are you saying
that the Knights of Hanoi

00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.815
had something to do
with the Lost Incident?

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:50.785
That's why I fight against
the Knights of Hanoi.

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:53.220
Circumstantial but logical.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.655
I see...

00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:56.523
But if that's the extent
of your knowledge,

00:20:56.623 --> 00:20:58.625
you're missing
one crucial detail.

00:20:58.692 --> 00:21:00.194
What do you mean?

00:21:00.294 --> 00:21:02.129
Within the database,

00:21:02.229 --> 00:21:04.131
I found the name
of the mastermind

00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:05.766
behind the Hanoi Project.

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:07.701
The name?
(gasps)

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:09.170
Mastermind?

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:11.071
