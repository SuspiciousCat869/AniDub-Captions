Let's Speed Duel!

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.277

Win this, Yusaku.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.312

Cracking Dragon!

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.019
(Ignis)
In a Speed Duel, the duel itself
is only part of the challenge.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.321
If you crash and burn
in this virtual world,

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.291
you'll actually suffer
in the real world too.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.659
I draw!

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.129
Cyberse Wizard!

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:29.462
(Zaizen)
A Cyberse monster?

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.498
They haven't been
seen in ages!

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:34.668
I thought we successfully
eliminated them all!

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.103
Wait!

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:37.637
What's that ahead?

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.773
(Ignis)
That's the eye of
the Data Storm!

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.444
And, boy, can it rip us
into bits and bytes!

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.579
(yelling)

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.947
(Ignis)
There are special monsters

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.916
that only live inside
the Data Storm.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.819
And the more
intense the Storm,

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.787
the stronger the monster!

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:54.955

00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.125

What?

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.366
Create the ultimate circuit!

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.536

we're no closer than
before to learning

who he is in
the real world.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.541
On the contrary, Spectre,

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:37.544
I believe that we are
honing in on Playmaker.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.413
And there are three reasons
why I am certain

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.414
it's only
a matter of time.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:45.219
One: Only a select few
duelists play Cyberse cards,

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.188
so we can narrow
our search.

00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:49.890
Two: We're improving
our search algorithms daily,

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.225
if not hourly.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.527
And three:
If all else fails,

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.228
he will come to me.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.765
To duel the hated leader
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.367
Quite observant, sir.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.303

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:05.405
our first meeting
will also be our last.

what we do know--</i>

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.525
<i>he's a winner!</i>

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.461
<i>The whole "man of mystery"
angle is genius!</i>

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.830
<i>It's absolutely
terrific marketing!</i>

<i>he's also a hunk!</i>

Well, then fly

Ya pick up any leads?

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.257
No, but I've picked up
plenty of viruses

I can't even get my

¡Hola!

Me llamo Playmaker!

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.071
Ignore those imposters,
I'm Playmaker!

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.740
They look more
like Playfakers to me.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.510
Especially the one
that's lo-res.

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:50.677
Hello!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.312
Buy a new
graphics card!

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:53.714
Kids these days.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:55.749
They should really ban
copy and paste.

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:01.288
This is wild stuff.

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:03.724
We can use the card data
you captured during your duel

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.893
to re-create an
actual card.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:06.960
I wonder what
other monsters

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.595
are inside the Data Storm.

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.497
Maybe you oughta
plan a return trip.

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:11.598
(Ignis)
Yeah!

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.333
Straight to the paparazzi!

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.802
They got your pic
plastered all over the net!

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:17.737
You may have erased
your login info--

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:19.472
smart, smart, smart
for a human--

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:22.309
but you can't
dodge screen caps, bub!

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.378
So you're an
expert then, are you?

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:26.413
(Ignis)
Oh, I know a thing or two.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.883
When you hide out in the net
for as long as I did,

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.751
you learn a lot of things.

00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:32.753
Like who leads
the Knights of Hanoi?

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:33.754
Maybe.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.155
Maybe not.

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.724
But I bet I'll think better
if you let me outta here.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:38.792
Doubt it.

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.095
All right then, if you're
not gonna share,

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:42.929
might as well
try Plan "B."

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:43.931
(Ignis)
Plan "B"?

00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:45.098
What's Plan "B"?

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.600
Flattery, bribery,
snacks?

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:47.734
Please say snacks!

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.303
I'm hacking right into
your source code.

00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:50.471
(Ignis)
Huh?!

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:51.938
But if you
poke the wrong portal,

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.908
I'll end up dumber than
a calculator!

00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:56.110

Uh, Kolter, can you
find a way to mute it?

With pleasure.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:06.020
Just an idea, but maybe we
should give "it" a name.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.489
You know, so you
won't you confuse "it"

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:10.291
with other "its."

a differing opinion?

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.068
(Bishop)
What is it, Zaizen?

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:31.505
I must strongly advise that we
keep LINK VRAINS operational.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:33.073
Despite the significant risks,

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:35.208
it is what's best
for our company.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.411
Do explain.

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:39.112
(Zaizen)
If we shut down the network,

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.182
Playmaker will have no way
to come to LINK VRAINS.

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:44.785
And if we can't
find Playmaker,

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.720
we will never
find the Ignis.

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:48.888
And no Ignis,
no Cyberse.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.057
And LINK VRAINS
is doomed anyway.

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.292
(Zaizen)
Correct.

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.628
It's a matter of when,
not if.

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.730
So, how confident
are you

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:58.899
that you will
capture Playmaker?

00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:00.967
Despite my limited knowledge,

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.036
I am quite sure that
I will succeed.

00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:04.438
I've already
formulated a plan

00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:06.207
which I'm ready to execute...

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:08.542
that is with your
permission of course.

00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:10.878
(Zaizen)
Playmaker despises
the Knights of Hanoi

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.446
almost as much as we do,

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:14.714

to our advantage.

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.116

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:17.184

As you wish.

00:10:18.752 --> 00:10:21.221
Rest assured,
I will find him

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:22.723

this training facility

come here for?

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.370
I'm here to offer you

And to show our

please accept this
with no strings attached.

That's a Duel Board

Your company must want
that AI program very badly.

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.894
Yes, we do.

00:13:13.928 --> 00:13:16.663
Though SOL Technologies

unforeseen circumstances

And it is only natural

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:24.705
that we would want our
property returned to us.

But alas, our efforts

00:13:26.574 --> 00:13:29.075
have attracted an
unsavory element.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.946
The Knights of Hanoi are
after the same AI program

00:13:32.046 --> 00:13:34.648

to take control of it.

fall into their hands,

destroyed.
