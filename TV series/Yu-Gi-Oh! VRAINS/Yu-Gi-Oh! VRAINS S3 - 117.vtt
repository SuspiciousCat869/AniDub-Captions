(labored breathing)

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:13.814
(labored breathing)

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.616
Soulburner...

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.783
You did it!

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.118
(labored breathing)

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.187
(Soulburner)
It's over.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.624
I can't believe it.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.793
Varis is out of the picture.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.595
Which means Playmaker
must now face me...

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.700
And I do believe this reunion
deserves a party.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:43.109
♪♪♪

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:38.265
(Soulburner)
Mom, Dad, Flame...

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.833
I did it.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:41.401
I won.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.370
(Varis)
So be it.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.078
You won because you were finally
able to embrace your past.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.813
Instead of running as fast
as you could from it.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:55.883
You're right.

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:57.884
And I have you to thank.

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.721
You taught me
that my past is a gift.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:01.889
Not a burden.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:02.823
Stop that.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:05.159
You know that I don't
do sentimental.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:08.061
Now savor this victory,
Soulburner.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.498
Because I vow
you'll never beat me again.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.334
Okay man, chill.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.202
Since I'm a man
of my word,

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.304
I'll honor the deal
that we made...

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.574
I'll let Playmaker settle
things with the Dark Ignis.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.310
But whatever "friendship"
you have with the program,

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.379
you should forget
because you're fighting

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.281
for the fate of humanity.

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.783
Good luck and farewell forever.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.585
Farwell forever?

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.253
Wait you're just
gonna leave?!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.621
That's right.

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.323
I won't trouble you again.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.725
Wait! Stop!

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.161
You can't do that!

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:42.162
(gasps)

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:44.798
You can't just
walk away!

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.134
This whole mess...

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.636
It's all because of you, Varis!

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.538
So you can't leave now
cuz that's like, like...

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.741
Like baking a double layer cake

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.110
but then taking off
with all of the frosting!

00:02:56.744 --> 00:02:59.112
That is an incomprehensible
metaphor.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.614
Okay.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.949
Maybe it is
but what I'm trying to say,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.885
what I'm trying
to get across here...

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.888
is that when this is all over

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.391
there are some family friends
I wanna see again.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.831
And since you created
this mess...

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:19.733
What, with the
Lost Incident happening

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.303
and the Knights of Hanoi
attacking LINK VRAINS...

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.371
Well, the very least
that you could do...

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:27.374
is stick around to make sure

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.377
that nothing like that
ever, ever happens again!

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.048
The thing is...

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.683
I know Playmaker and Ai
will work things out

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.052
and make everything
cool again.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.555
But afterwards there's gonna be
thieves and criminals

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.057
and hackers who're gonna
try to stir up trouble.

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:46.460
And this is where
you step in, Varis.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:49.230
To make sure all these bozos

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.364
aren't able to cause
any trouble.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.901
Compelling argument.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:54.801
Really?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.338
You've convinced me.

00:03:57.438 --> 00:03:59.539
I'll be here when you need me.

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.108
I'm glad.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.344
I think you'll like
being a good guy.

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:06.446
Don't go overboard.

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.583
But none of this
will matter unless...

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.351
you stop the Dark Ignis.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.796
Well, Playmaker,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.397
guess it's up
to you now.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.099
Seems that way.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.235
Now to bring an end
to this conflict.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:29.703
Hmmm.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.793
(dramatic music)

00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:05.639
(Kolter)
Well Teddy,
thanks for all your help.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.975
Your long journey's
finally over.

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.644
I'd say you've earned
some chill time.

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:12.846
Yeah, if I can
remember how to chill.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.682
Hey, by the way...

00:05:14.782 --> 00:05:16.283
You seen Yusaku?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.285
I haven't seen him
since he sped away.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:19.520
Yep.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.987
Just this afternoon.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:21.755
Yeah?

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:22.589
Tell me...

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.957
What'd you guys talk about?

00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:25.926
Um... Let's see...

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.364
So you're going?

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:32.533
Yeah...

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.834
Save me a taco
for when I get back.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.503
Hot dog.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.773
Really?
That's it?

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.275
We've already said everything
that needs to be said.

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:43.777
I guess so...

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.012
Sure hope he's ready.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:51.451
(dramatic music)

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:00.493
(Skye)
Yusaku, please save my brother.

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.070
(flash sound)

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.245
Roken...

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.750
That card should prove useful.

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:35.028
(rock music)

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:53.880
(cheerful music)

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:18.305
(suspenseful music)

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:31.618
(gasps)

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.587
(Ai)
Hey there, meatbag.

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.322
Long time no see!

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.057
Hello, Ai.

00:07:41.328 --> 00:07:43.963
So you dig the décor?
All done by moi...

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:47.001
Just for you,
of course, old pal!

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.301
I spruced up
the place

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:51.238
cuz that Zaizen was
no interior decorator.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:52.939
C'mon, I'll give ya a tour.

00:07:57.444 --> 00:07:59.079
(Yusaku)
Is this the factory floor?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.681
(Ai)
Yup.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.850
This is where all of
the SOLTiS are built.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.651
(clap fingers)

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.723
But I made a few tweaks
to SOL Tech's design.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:12.493
They're all you!

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.896
Exactly right
and aren't they gorgeous?

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.799
Instead of SOLtiS,
I call 'em SOLtAiS!

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.536
You took over SOL Tech
to make copies of yourself?

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.672
Yes indeed,
pal o' mine!

00:08:24.772 --> 00:08:27.841
I'm installing them
with programs based on my code.

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.142
Kind of like a backup.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.179
And like any backup,
they won't be perfect copies

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.716
but they'll still have 99%
of my sparkling personality

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:38.518
for each and every household
to enjoy!

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:40.453
You're creating
an army?

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:41.689
Oh come now...

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.790
When you say it
like that it sounds so...

00:08:44.558 --> 00:08:47.994
Well, so perfectly accurate
if I'm being honest with you.

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:50.398
The SOLtiS are already a hit.

00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:53.133
So my version is going
to fly off the shelves!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.701
No offense

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:56.970
but don't you think maybe you're
overestimating your appeal?

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:59.106
Not at all!

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.241
Underestimating is more like it!

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:04.177
And when there's more of me
than there are of you humans,

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.113
that's when the fun
will really begin...

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:09.216
Well, maybe not so much
for your kind

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.918
but definitely for mine!

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:13.387
Because once you humans
are outnumbered,

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:14.622
you'll be outmatched.

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:15.956
And when you're outmatched

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.891
that's when we'll make our move.

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.061
With one clean sweep,
we'll dust you all up!

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:24.865
Then the war's over!
Easy peasy cheesy breezy.

00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:26.032
So what do you say,

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.701
can I count on you
making an order

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.570
for this exquisite
product?!

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.773
They make great gifts too.
Maybe you should get a few.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:35.775
Do you really want to be
all alone in the world?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.112
But I won't be alone.

00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:40.047
There'll be plenty of SOLtAiS!

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:43.250
And who can I get
along better with than myself?

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:44.285
Stop it.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:46.219
You know that's no way to live!

00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:48.855
Let's just agree...

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:49.690
to disagree.

00:09:50.124 --> 00:09:51.291
Listen to me, Ai.

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:52.959
I know there are those
who don't believe

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:56.731
humans an AI's can coexist,
but they're wrong.

00:09:56.797 --> 00:09:59.266
We proved they were
by working together.

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.602
I used to feel the same way,

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:03.503
that's why we fought
together, right?

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:05.606
But I passed the point
of no return.

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.074
I already made
a bunch of SOLtAiS.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.278
And there's no refund on them.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.614
Can't let them go
to waste now, can I?

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.949
Yes, that's exactly
what you can do, Ai,

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:18.118
so how about you
quit making excuses

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:19.553
and just do it.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.588
Not happening.

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:23.290
See, the assembly line
is fully automated.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.792
SOLtAis will just keep
coming and coming...

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.027
So...

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:28.929
You're saying
they can't be stopped?

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:30.530
Nothing can be done?

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.866
Well, no,
not exactly.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.702
There is one way,

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:38.271
a final shutdown code I wrote
but thing is...

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:41.175
there's just one way
to trigger it.

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:42.442
Which is?

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.845
Someone has to beat me in a duel

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.914
as the code is tied to me.

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:51.952
I lose and my army of SOLtAis
and I will shutdown.

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:53.253
And you?

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:55.189
What do you mean, Ai,
that you'll be erased?!

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:59.125
Yeah, but I don't plan on it
because I like existing.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.328
But if any meatbag
is going to stop me,

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:02.930
I want it to be you.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.198
That's why I invited you here.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.467
Sorry to disappoint you

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.502
but I have no interest
in dueling you.

00:11:09.603 --> 00:11:11.171
We've been
through too much together.

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:14.074
Hey, yeah,
completely understand.

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:17.844
So guess that means
the end of humanity is certain!

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:19.479
There's no other way?

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:21.015
There isn't.

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:23.484
Either AIs survive
or humans do.

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:24.851
That's it, that's all.

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.588
That's the chips on the table.
Now, what's your choice?

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:30.157
Please Ai, surely there are
other options

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.525
that we can explore together.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.960
You keep using this word,
"together."

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.163
But haven't you
realized it yet?

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:39.300
That word simply no longer
applies to you and me.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.735
Yes, there was a time where
you and I worked well,

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.603
as you say, "together."

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.506
But that's now behind us
and there it will stay.

00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:48.642
Get it through your head,
Yusaku,

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:50.844
the band has broken up,
the cookie has crumbled,

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:52.846
the trees gone timber.

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:56.450
Your favorite pair of socks,
one's been lost in the wash!

00:11:56.851 --> 00:11:59.853
Okay, maybe that last four
were a stretch.

00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:03.323
But what isn't
a stretch is this:

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.493
Everything humanity
has been in the past

00:12:05.593 --> 00:12:07.160
and might be in the future...

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.163
all rests on your
shoulders right now.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:13.733
So now I ask you
one more time, Yusaku:

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.469
What's your choice?

00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:16.537
Put that way...

00:12:16.637 --> 00:12:19.073
There is no choice,
I must duel.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:21.341
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:23.076
So let's get on with it.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.512
Perfect.

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:26.880
(Both)
It's time for us
to link into the VRAINS!

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:37.224
(rock music)

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:42.195
(Both)
Duel!

00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:45.199
I will go first.

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.801
I summon GARBAGE COLLECTOR
in attack mode!

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:54.174
Next, I activate the spell
CYNET OPTIMIZATION!

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:58.078
It lets me summon FLAME BUFFERLO
from my hand in attack mode!

00:13:01.215 --> 00:13:03.250
Then due to GARBAGE
COLLECTOR's ability,

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:04.985
I can return a Cyberse monster

00:13:05.085 --> 00:13:07.120
that's on my field
back to my hand

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.324
in order to summon
another Cyberse from my deck

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.727
that has the exact same Level
as the monster I retrieved!

00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:17.163
So FLAME BUFFERLO
returns to my hand!

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:22.068
And SEA ARCHIVER
takes its place!

00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:26.473
Next up, FLAME BUFFERLO's
ability activates!

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:28.075
Whenever it leaves the field,

00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:30.544
I can discard
one Cyberse from my hand

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.579
to draw two cards from my deck.

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.717
Then I'll use both my monsters

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:39.452
to Link Summon
Link 2 SPLASH MAGE!

00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:43.657
I use my MAGE's
special ability...

00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:44.958
to revive a Cyberse

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:46.893
from my graveyard
in defense mode.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.330
So now return to my field,
SEA ARCHIVER!

00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:53.266
This allows me
to Link Summon again!

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:57.470
Link 3 DECODE TALKER!

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:07.681
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.719
DECODE TALKER...

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:14.721
That's the first Link Monster

00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:17.057
that me and you summoned
back in the day.

00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:18.191
Yeah...

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.126
It's pretty hard to believe

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:20.961
that those were
the simpler times.

00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:21.962
I remember...

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:25.399
Back when Kolter and I found
the Cyberse Deck,

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:26.633
we thought we were lucky,

00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:29.302
but now I know
it wasn't coincidence.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.838
It was alllll me.

00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:35.008
I couldn't fight against Varis
and the Knights of Hanoi

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:36.877
because they were
hunting me down.

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:39.513
But I knew I could
manipulate you

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.348
into fighting them for me.

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:42.149
So...

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.883
You left a trail of breadcrumbs

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.986
in just such a way
that would lead me

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.388
straight to the Cyberse Deck

00:14:47.488 --> 00:14:48.722
so I'd have the perfect weapon

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:50.857
to fight against the Hanoi
for you...

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.828
and fight against them I did

00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:57.464
without knowing you were
behind it the whole time.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.334
But is that the whole story?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.102
After the Lost Incident,

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:04.772
I was determined
to make the Hanoi pay.

00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:06.674
And when I got the Cyberse Deck

00:15:06.774 --> 00:15:10.210
I realized that I finally had
the power to stand up to them.

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.746
My existence was
no long on the brink.

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:14.248
I had cards
strong enough

00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:16.683
to take on the extreme dangers
I would be facing...

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.053
and none of that would have
been possible

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:20.854
had it not been for you, Ai.

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:21.855
True...

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:25.258
(Playmaker)
You claim you needed
my help to fight the Hanoi.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.361
But I disagree.
With all my heart.

00:15:28.862 --> 00:15:29.897
You see, Ai,

00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.265
I believe
that the opposite is true...

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.601
What I believe is this:

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:37.772
You wanted to help me fight
against the Knights of Hanoi.

00:15:37.872 --> 00:15:39.373
Help you?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.608
(Playmaker)
That's correct.

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:41.508
Now listen...

00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:43.410
I know you want
to paint yourself

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.512
as the master puppeteer
in all this...

00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:47.347
But I don't buy it.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.117
Bravo, for someone not known

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.219
for their colorful
imagination...

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.955
This is certainly
a wonderous work of fiction

00:15:55.088 --> 00:15:56.857
that you've managed
to come up with.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:00.027
But if you truly believe that
I didn't trick you into this,

00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:02.495
then I guess gullible
is your middle name!

00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:04.865
Of course, I suppose
that would make sense,

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.500
it would explain why you made

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.236
such an excellent puppet
for this puppeteer!

00:16:09.336 --> 00:16:10.737
(Playmaker)
Spin it however you like.

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:13.841
It's not a spin, Playmaker.

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:16.910
You're suggesting that
I wasn't watching you...

00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:18.746
That in fact...

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:21.415
All of this time,
I was watching over you?

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:24.417
It's no suggestion, Ai,
because it's fact.

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:25.920
You're wrong.

00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:30.690
And I'll prove it
by securing victory right here!

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:34.494
Now, old friend,

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:37.097
your former partner
will become...

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:39.500
your worst enemy!

00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:42.670
I summon PIKARI @IGNISTER!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.973
Thanks to PIKARI's ability
I can draw a spell from my deck.

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:49.510
IGNISTER A.I.LAND!

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:50.845
And now...

00:16:51.312 --> 00:16:54.648
I Link Summon Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:56.850
And I'll follow that up
with this!

00:16:56.984 --> 00:16:59.019
The Field Spell
IGNISTER A.I.LAND

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.721
summons DOYON @IGNISTER
from my hand!

00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:08.895
Then I activate DOYON's
special ability!

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:12.232
It lets me retrieve
PIKARI from my graveyard!

00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:14.401
Then I'll activate
another spell,

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.570
COMPROMA.I.SE!

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.238
Once per turn,

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:21.742
I can transform my @IGNISTER
into a spell card

00:17:21.842 --> 00:17:24.544
and move it
into my Spell &amp; Trap Zone.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.550
This means your
Main Monster Zone's empty again.

00:17:29.984 --> 00:17:31.051
(Ai)
And when it it's empty,

00:17:31.152 --> 00:17:33.520
IGNISTER A.I.LAND
summons PIKARI...

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.255
right back from my hand!

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:40.327
And then I use its ability

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:43.330
to draw a second IGNISTER
A.I.LAND from my deck

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.165
but that's only half of it.

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:46.567
Summoning PIKARI

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.902
triggered COMPROMA.I.SE's
second effect!

00:17:49.236 --> 00:17:50.337
Once per turn,

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.707
it moves an @IGNISTER that's
in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:55.743
back to my Main Monster Zone!

00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:58.578
So my DOYON is
once again a monster!

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:03.149
Now that I have three monsters,

00:18:03.283 --> 00:18:05.752
I have all I need
to Link Summon!

00:18:06.553 --> 00:18:08.556
It is time to unleash a monster

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:11.491
forged from the darkest
depths of the shadows,

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.760
striking fear
into all who witness

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.428
its majestic might!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.130
So here it is,

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:20.767
the one, the only, the awesome,

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:23.970
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:27.808
I activate IGNISTER A.I.LAND

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:32.812
to summon ACHICHI @IGNISTER
next to DARK TEMPLAR's link.

00:18:34.047 --> 00:18:36.817
And when a monster
is summoned next to its link,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.418
DARK TEMPLAR can revive

00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:40.821
other @IGNISTERS
from my graveyard...

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.156
to fill up the rest
of its links.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.630
With these three,
I will now create my circuit!

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:56.770
From the infernal blaze
that gave birth to the universe,

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.841
comes a monster that scorches
all who cross its path!

00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:05.045
Rise up Link 3 FIRE PHOENIX
@IGNISTER!

00:19:06.714 --> 00:19:07.948
But that's not all...

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:10.851
To prove how badly
I wanna win...

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:14.554
I'll play that which destroyed
the Cyberse!

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:15.722
(grunts)

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.457
Check it.

00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:20.694
It's the Link Spell that's
no friend to me or you!

00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:36.477
From my quiver of cards,
I play JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:19:36.544 --> 00:19:37.377
(grunts)

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:39.212
Ready, Playmaker?

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:40.547
Time to battle!

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:43.016
Are you sure
you want to do that?

00:19:43.116 --> 00:19:44.551
Due to CYNET's effect,

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.786
when you battle
my DECODE TALKER

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.321
you can't use...

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:51.391
your effects
or any of your abilities.

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:54.527
That means your
JUDGMENT ARROWS is useless.

00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:57.731
Looks like you were already
prepared for my strategy

00:19:57.831 --> 00:19:59.733
so it won't be smart to attack.

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:01.535
But oh well.

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.770
I'll attack anyway!

00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.639
Go, FIRE PHOENIX!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:06.373
Attack!

00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:10.377
That attack won't work!

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:11.711
Cuz I have this:

00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:13.013
My trap CODE HACK!

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:16.950
Once per turn,
when my DECODE TALKER battles

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.386
This trap can activate!

00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:22.123
It drops your monster's
attack points to zero

00:20:22.223 --> 00:20:23.990
for the remainder of this turn!

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:32.066
Luckily for you, in exchange,

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:34.468
your monster can't be
destroyed from this battle,

00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:36.002
and you take no damage.

00:20:36.503 --> 00:20:39.006
You may have stopped
one of my attacks,

00:20:39.106 --> 00:20:41.375
but luckily I still
have another!

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:44.311
DARK TEMPLAR!
Put your sword to use!

00:20:44.812 --> 00:20:46.780
And attack DECODE TALKER!

00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:49.984
My DARK TEMPLAR
and your DECODE TALKER

00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:52.186
have the same number
of attack points.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.888
But DARK TEMPLAR
can't be destroyed

00:20:55.022 --> 00:20:56.824
by a monster
with equal strength,

00:20:56.891 --> 00:20:59.893
so only your monster's
role is getting cut!

00:21:02.763 --> 00:21:04.131
And just like that...

00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:06.700
Round 1 is now
coming to a close.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.437
And since me and monsters
are done attacking,

00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:12.539
CODE HACK's effect
now shuts down.

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:16.109
And PHOENIX's attack points
rise from the ashes...

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.112
Back to 2300.

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.915
I place one card facedown
and that ends my turn.

00:21:22.416 --> 00:21:25.252
Let's recap shall we?
We each had a turn.

00:21:25.352 --> 00:21:26.754
We each played
some cards.

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:29.757
But now I have two monsters
and you have none.

00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:32.593
That tells me that you'd
better up you game.

00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:35.128
Or humanity is going down.

00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:36.763
Ai...

00:21:44.004 --> 00:21:49.009
