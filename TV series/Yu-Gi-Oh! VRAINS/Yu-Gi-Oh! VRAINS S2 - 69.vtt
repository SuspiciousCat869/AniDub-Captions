00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.070
(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!VRAINS..

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:07.941
(Ai)
Where've you been, Lightning?

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.644
You couldn't hit me
up to tell me you're alive?

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.113
No, I couldn't
risk it.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:17.284
Windy and I intend to
rebuild the Cyberse.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:20.020
And we want you
to help us.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.355
With one difference.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.091
We have decided to
eliminate the humans,

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.026
so that they
cannot threaten us.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.295
Are you serious?

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.697
Humans want to destroy us,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.934
so we want to destroy
the humans.

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.235
It's nice and clean.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.238
(Ai)
How about not fighting
each other at all!

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.806
You know, trying
to live together in peace?

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:43.310
Even your coexistence with
Playmaker will not last.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.347
Can you honestly say you're
happier with him than with us?

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.249
(Playmaker)
Why does he have to choose?

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.452
Playmaker!

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:53.420
This world is big enough
for all of us,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.691
both humans and Ignis, to live
together in harmony.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:59.092
There are no sides.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.161
And you can't
force me to choose.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.864
So the only decision I'm makin'
is gettin' outta here.

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:05.432
Let's go, Playmaker.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.503
(Lightning)
You know, we can't allow you

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:12.239
to leave after you've heard
our master plan.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:13.673
(both)
Huh?

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.176
(both scream)

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:20.680
You.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:21.749
Hah!

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.149
(Playmaker)
Varis!

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.519
(Varis)
I found you.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.657
And you should know,
I'm not the only one here.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:33.094
Now at my hands, your
very existence

00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:35.328
is coming to an end.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:44.565
Varis!

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.399
Are you here
to help us?

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.068
Of course not.

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.137
You see I only came
here to do one thing.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.307
And that's to
destroy the Ignis.

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:54.808
Quite the introduction.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.878
Then allow me to introduce
myself in return.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:59.446
Watch yourself Varis!

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:02.449
(blast)

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.654
(electric spark

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:09.690
Hmm, seems he was ready
for your lightning, Lightning.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.792
Didn't even faze or
daze him at all.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.994
Unlike some other
fool that I know...

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.563
I came here prepared
knowing that you'd try

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.998
something underhanded.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:20.701
Ah, is he talking
about me?

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.269
Who else
could it be?

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.604
(Windy)
I'm surprised you made it here.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:25.772
You shouldn't be.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:28.108
The Hanoi have eyes
all over the network.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:31.512
You can hide from us, but
you can't hide from us for.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.713
No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.048
I meant that you made it here
past my security detail.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.219
Since I had Echo standing guard
to ward off all intruders.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.987
Your so-called security's
not good enough

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:42.690
to guard an empty piggy bank.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.058
My team's mopping
them up as we speak.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:51.631
And now my MOTOR WORM SPREADER
QUEEN attacks you directly!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.138
I summon... DARK MUMMY
SURGICAL FORCEPS!

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:00.040
Dissect ‘em!

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.942
Since you're a program,

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.211
you have no DNA
for me to analyze.

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.113
So there's nothing to stop me
from deleting you completely!

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:08.415
(blasting)

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:12.185
Now bloom!
SUNAVALON DRYANOME!

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.721
(chuckles)

00:04:14.088 --> 00:04:16.123
It's been a while since
I was in a fight.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.625
I forgot how much
I've enjoyed it.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.795
(Varis)
I will carry out my
father's wishes

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.465
and undo his greatest
mistake by erasing the Ignis.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.935
You have it backwards,
my friend.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:31.271
If there's any mistake,
it is you humans.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.239
That's enough!

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.242
I didn't come all this way
to have a philosophical debate

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.777
with a computer program.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.946
You were gifted a whole
planet and all you do

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.782
is destroy everything you touch.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.518
You can say the only good thing

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:47.053
humans ever created
was us Ignis.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.089
And he wants to
destroy that too.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.458
Shame, shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.960
But it needn't be.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.430
We don't need to fight we can
coexist in peace.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.132
I would find it
more comforting

00:04:58.132 --> 00:04:59.933
to see them in pieces.

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:02.903
Don't you realize that
your actions are only proving

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.471
that the Ignis are correct?

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:05.572
Hmm.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:06.673
(giggles)

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.743
The Ignis want to eliminate us
because they believe that

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.613
we will do everything possible
to eliminate them first.

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:14.315
But if we choose not
to fight then

00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:16.016
all of this can
come to an end.

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.319
And what, allow them to attack
us when our guard is down?

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.522
Don't be so naive.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:22.823
I'm not.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.159
It all comes down
to a matter of trust.

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.295
But that trust must be present
on both sides Varis.

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.629
Trust the Ignis?

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.699
Are you completely out
of your mind Playmaker?

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.700
(grunts)

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.671
I'm so curious to discover
what makes you think the Ignis

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.806
can actually be trusted?

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:43.177
Look at the position you'e
in they trapped you.

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.345
And if I didn't show up
when I did, they'd have

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.981
annihilated you by now.

00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:48.682
And you trust them?

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.618
I know this
looks bad,

00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:52.152
and I guess it is.

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:55.022
The only thing I trust
about the Ignis is that

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:57.858
they'll do whatever it
takes to destroy us.

00:05:57.858 --> 00:06:01.095
And they can trust me to do
the same back to them.

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:04.731
No one believes in coexistene
except for you, Playmaker.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.902
Not me, and certainly
not the Ignis.

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:10.471
So just stay out of this
and enjoy the show

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:11.404
from your bubble.

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:15.743
If you don't mind,

00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:17.878
I'd like to be the one
to duel this Hanoi.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.646
But if you do mind,
we can flip a coin

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:21.081
or pick a number
between one and pi.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.048
Keep it sporting.

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.018
It's fine, Windy.

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.488
Okay, but don't be upset that
you'll never get a chance

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.756
to duel our biggest antagonist
because when I'm finished

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.925
with him, he's toast.
Poof. Gone.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.195
Whatever, it doesn't matter
who I beat first.

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:37.932
Now, let's get this
duel started!

00:06:37.932 --> 00:06:39.600
Real quick though,
before you get

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.902
to bashin' and thrashin' any
chance you'd rethink

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:43.637
poppin' these bubbles for us?

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.071
And let you out?

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.073
Why would I ever
want to do that?

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:48.809
But, um..

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.411
(Varis)
I'm here to destroy all the
Ignis and the last time

00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:52.879
I checked, you're an Ignis.

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.649
But I'm not the Ignis that
wants to end humanity!

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:58.085
That's gotta buy me
an extra credit or two!

00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.687
Oh c'mooon!

00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.789
Alright then how about
I destroy you last.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.291
Ahh?

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:08.261
Varis listen to me you
don't need to do this.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.632
Playmaker, I've said it
before and I'll say it again.

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:14.435
You're not built to make the
tough decisions.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:17.204
When things get tough,
you do nothing,

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:21.475
hoping for a peaceful resolution
that will never come.

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:22.576
You're wrong.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:25.545
Sometimes doing nothing is the
toughest decision of them all.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:26.480
(scoffs)

00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:29.149
Then keep doing that because
you're doing it...

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.617
oh so very well.

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:33.787
And if you're still worried
about coexisting with the Ignis,

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:36.389
I'll alleviate those
concerns for you.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.992
Because you won't have
to worry about coexistence

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:40.895
if I destroy them all..

00:07:41.162 --> 00:07:44.331
and there's no one left
to coexist with.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.166
Why are both sides
logically coming

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.435
to the worst
logical conclusion?

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.770
(Kotler)
I don't like this.

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.241
We haven't heard a single
peep from Playmaker.

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:56.777
He said he'd log out
if he ran into trouble.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:59.213
The search could just be
taking some time.

00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:01.215
(Flame)
Too much time
if you ask me.

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.350
I've thought of over six
million things that

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.718
could be going wrong.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.888
And I've only been thinking
for a microsecond.

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:10.524
Yeah, I'd feel a whole lot less
worried if you can

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.125
go there and take a look see.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.829
Teddy, are you
down for that?

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:15.996
Hmm.

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.999
Cool, to help you out I designed
an upgrade for your Duel Disk.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.336
This program can temporarily
block off any shady algorithms,

00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:24.204
including those of the Ignis.

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:26.373
Not that I'm worried about them

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.508
but you can never be too
careful.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.817
I also took some time and
upgraded the video transmitter.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:40.053
Hopefully this new tech will
break through any interference

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:43.290
so that I can see what you see
and help provide backup.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:44.558
Right. Got it.

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:48.028
Well then Teddy...
be careful out there.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:57.804
It's time to link
into the VRAINS!

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:29.236
(Flame)
What happened here?

00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.339
(Kotler)
This doesn't look good.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:34.941
Any sign of
Playmaker or Ai?

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.877
No but I'll keep looking.

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:41.348
(Flame)
Who or what could've
done such a thing?

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:43.884
Add that to the list
of mysteries Flame.

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:50.591
Aww glitch!

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.025
The duel's really
gonna start!

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.595
We gotta do
something Playmaker!

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.032
What exactly can we do when
we're trapped in here?

00:09:58.465 --> 00:09:59.867
Now what to do, what to do?

00:09:59.867 --> 00:10:02.236
Should I defeat you quickly
to end your misery or slowly

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:04.104
to savor your suffering?

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:05.706
I don't know.

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:07.607
Because neither option
will happen.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.348
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:18.953
(Windy)
I can't wait,
wait, wait to see

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:21.054
how the big
bad boogeyman duels.

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.456
Then you're lucky you
don't have to wait for long.

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.959
It's my turn!

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:26.627
I'll start by activating

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:29.396
my Field Spell BOOT
SECTOR LAUNCH.

00:10:29.897 --> 00:10:33.701
It allows me to summon up to two
ROKKET monsters from my hand.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.569
ANESTHROKKET DRAGON

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.205
and MAGNAROKKET DRAGON.

00:10:38.773 --> 00:10:39.873
(computer chirping)

00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:42.008
In addition, BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.111
gives all of my ROKKET monsters

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.880
300 extra attack
and defense points.

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.248
(timer beeping)

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:51.218
Varis has all he needs
to Link Summon!

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:52.520
That's right!

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.621
So that's exactly
what I'm going to do!

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:59.126
I set ANESTHROKKET DRAGON
and MAGNAROKKET DRAGON

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.694
in the Link Arrows!

00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:01.461
(laser shots)

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.165
I Link Summon!

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.766
Link 2 DILLINGEROUS DRAGON!

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:10.971
(computer chirping)

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.174
He's never ever summoned
that Link Monster before.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.275
Interesting.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:19.279
Next, I place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.516
I'm flattered that you mixed
up your strategies just for me.

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:24.017
I said flattered not impressed.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.419
Because those opening moves
may be new

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.987
but they're basic
at best.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:30.757
Then it should be no problem
for you to do one better.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.626
Yes, clearly.

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:33.961
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:35.262
I draw.

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.031
When you have a monster
on your side of the field,

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:40.534
I'm allowed to summon STORMRIDER
GRIFFORE from my hand.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.769
(computer chirping)

00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.173
And how is that
move not basic?

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:47.174
What you call basic,

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:49.076
I call step one
of my creative process.

00:11:49.076 --> 00:11:51.244
Which leads to step two:
When you have spell

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:53.580
or trap cards in play,
I can also summon

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.749
STORMRIDER HIPPOGRIFF
from my hand.

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.919
And if I have two monsters,
I can cyclone my circuit!

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.820
I set
STORMRIDERS GRIFFORE

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.890
and HIPPOGRIFF
in the Link Arrows!

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.561
I Link Summon!

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:12.198
Link 2
STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER!

00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:13.400
(computer chirping)

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.341
Windy's Link Monster has
more attack points than Varis's!

00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:23.010
Next on my agenda
I activate the Field Spell

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.012
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE!

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:27.882
It gives every STORMRIDER on the
field not one, not two,

00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:31.385
but 300 attack points and that
increases my monster's attack

00:12:31.385 --> 00:12:32.686
point advantage over yours.

00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:35.155
And I follow that up by
summoning another STORMRIDER!

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:37.324
STORMRIDER HARPIARM!

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:39.493
And since it's a STORMRIDER,
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:42.396
raises its attack
points by 300 also,

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:43.431
which I'm sure you
remember since

00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:45.699
I did the same move
eight seconds ago.

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:47.901
But for a new move, I activate
STORMRIDERSHIP

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.970
ROCKBUSTER'S special ability.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.906
When I have no spell or trap
cards in play,

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:54.875
if I summon a monster next to
ROCKBUSTER's link which I did.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:57.410
I can destroy two of your spell
or trap cards.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.812
Meaning those two right there.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:12:59.813
Right in front of my eyes.

00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.782
Yes. Those two.
Right there. Those ones.

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:02.883
Say what?

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:04.117
Judging by your poker face,

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.319
it seems you didn't
want that to happen.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:09.456
(blasting)

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:11.491
My, oh my!

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.326
One of the cards was
MAGIC CYLINDER!

00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:14.328
That would've wrecked me!

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:15.996
Emphasis on would've.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:19.165
MAGIC CYLINDER not only stops
a monster's attack,

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.202
but it deals damage equal
to that monster's attack points.

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:26.706
So Varis was going to use
Windy's own monster against him.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.409
I know it's
early in the duel,

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:30.544
but Windy's totally
outplaying Varis.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:33.380
Like Beethoven on
the piano but better.

00:13:33.414 --> 00:13:34.648
You're right.

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:36.483
But things can
change drastically

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.985
over the course
of a duel.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.320
They can, they can.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.621
They won't.
But they can.

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:42.389
I get the excitement of the
come-from-behind victory,

00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:43.657
but you know why
you get excited?

00:13:43.657 --> 00:13:45.825
Because it never happens.

00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:50.330
But who do I want to win
this duel anyway?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.399
If Windy wins,
the next thing he'll do

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:55.869
is storm up a Data Storm
to knock me into bits and bytes.

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.871
But if Varis wins this duel,

00:13:57.871 --> 00:13:59.806
I know he's gonna frag me too,

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:02.042
sure I might be last but still.

00:14:02.276 --> 00:14:04.678
So then who am I
supposed to root for,

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:08.148
when a bad guy fights a bad guy
and they both wanna destroy

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:09.549
the good guy?

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:13.553
Just accept the fact that no
matter who wins we lose.

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:14.888
I don't wanna!

00:14:14.888 --> 00:14:17.691
I activate my trap
REVERSE ENGINEERING

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:19.659
the other trap card
you destroyed.

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:20.527
What?

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.563
(Varis)
By banishing it
from the graveyard,

00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:25.232
REVERSE ENGINEERING's
effect activates,

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:29.002
returning a trap card that you
just destroyed back to my field.

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:32.106
And I'm also allowed to
use that trap card

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:34.007
this turn if I so desire.

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:35.676
You see..

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:38.845
You can't get rid of my MAGIC
CYLINDER that easily!

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:39.679
Hah..

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.848
Whoa! Plot twist!

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.519
Ah, so Varis had
that other trap card ready

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.854
because he anticipated that

00:14:46.854 --> 00:14:49.556
Windy would destroy his
MAGIC CYLINDER.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.225
They're both countering
their counters to their counters

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:53.727
to their counters!

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.128
(Varis)
What's wrong?

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.230
Not so eager to attack anymore?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.233
(Windy)
Oh I'm eager
I'm just not foolish.

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:02.069
I'm eager to attack
not eager about taking damage.

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:04.872
Well you're going to have
to choose between the two.

00:15:05.172 --> 00:15:07.274
Because I'm forcing you
to attack or suffer

00:15:07.274 --> 00:15:08.609
the consequences.

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:09.777
Oh really?

00:15:10.144 --> 00:15:12.680
(Varis)
If your monster doesn't attack
before the end of your turn,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.949
DILLINGEROUS DRAGON's
special ability

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:17.017
automatically destroys it,

00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:18.718
and you take damage equal

00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:20.921
to your monster's attack points.

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.923
Now that's... just rude.

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.591
So if Windy
chooses to attack,

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.961
MAGIC CYLINDER
will deal him damage.

00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:28.028
But if he doesn't attack,

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:30.130
DILLINGEROUS DRAGON
will deal him damage

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.631
and destroy his monster.

00:15:31.631 --> 00:15:33.033
Both scenarios are lose-lose,

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.436
but one's more lose-lose
than the other.

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:38.939
The most logical option
is to attack, Windy.

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:40.907
But it's up to you.

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:41.608
Make your pick.

00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.343
Attack or don't attack.

00:15:43.343 --> 00:15:45.779
It makes no difference to me.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:47.514
But it does for me,
oh yes it does,

00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:49.116
so of course I'll attack.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:52.953
STORMRIDERSHIP ROCKBUSTER!
Attack DILLINGEROUS DRAGON!

00:15:54.688 --> 00:15:55.856
Very well then.

00:15:55.856 --> 00:15:58.258
My MAGIC CYLINDER
negates that attack,

00:15:58.258 --> 00:16:01.929
and you take damage equal
to ROCKBUSTER's attack points!

00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:04.931
Windy's losin' 2300 life points!

00:16:04.998 --> 00:16:06.433
No no, no I'm not.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.669
Not since I have
STORMRIDER HARPIARM.

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:11.438
When you activate a trap card,
I can switch HARPIARM

00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:13.340
to defense mode
to destroy that trap.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.010
So all your work, all that toil
just gone in a breeze.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.578
(blasting)

00:16:19.012 --> 00:16:19.346
(grunts)

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:23.083
Now let's see what you have
left to protect your DRAGON.

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:24.951
Oh, nothing.

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:26.453
(bird screeching)

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:29.356
(blasting)

00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.458
(timer beeping)
(electric whirring )

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:33.193
With that I end my turn.

00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.262
And if your next turn
isn't better than your last,

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.797
it will be your last.

00:16:36.864 --> 00:16:39.800
I was 100% sure that
Windy was gonna take damage,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.269
but Varis took
the damage instead.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.670
100%, really Ai?

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.905
You were only off
by about,

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.173
hmm a 100%.

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:47.908
Is this some new math
I don't know about

00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:49.810
where you don't do calculations
with facts and evidence

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.678
and proof but with feelings?

00:16:51.812 --> 00:16:54.181
As if a program such
as yourself would know

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.016
anything about feelings.

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:59.353
But if there's one thing
that I'll make you feel,

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:02.423
it's the power of my
next move! I draw!

00:17:02.423 --> 00:17:05.326
My field spell BOOT SECTOR
LAUNCH activates,

00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:07.761
allowing me to bring back
two ROKKET monsters

00:17:07.761 --> 00:17:09.163
from my graveyard!

00:17:09.163 --> 00:17:11.365
Rise up, ANESTHROKKET DRAGON

00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:13.600
and my MAGNAROKKET DRAGON!
(timer beeps)

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:16.403
And when I resurrect
a ROKKET monster,

00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:19.005
I'm also allowed to resurrect
DILLINGEROUS

00:17:19.005 --> 00:17:20.641
DRAGON from
my graveyard.

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.544
And with this
I now have three monsters

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:24.678
on my field!

00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:26.513
(computer chirping)

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:30.750
And with them
I manifest my circuit!

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:34.388
The summoning conditions are
three or more Effect Monsters!

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:37.724
So I set ANESTHROKKET DRAGON,
MAGNAROKKET DRAGON

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.227
and DILLINGEROUS DRAGON
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.829
And I Link the circuit!

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.500
I link Summon!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.868
Link 4!

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.803
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:17:49.803 --> 00:17:51.404
(electric whirring)

00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:57.644
(computer chirping)

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:01.949
(Varis)
I Link Summon!

00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:05.085
Link 4.
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:18:05.152 --> 00:18:05.886
(computer chirping)

00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:08.322
And this is one monster

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:09.756
that you can't counter!

00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:12.759
Au contraire, that's French
for nuh uh uh you're wrong.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.995
BORRELOAD DRAGON
is a Link 4 monster

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:17.397
which is exactly what I
hoped you would summon.

00:18:17.497 --> 00:18:18.565
What?

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:19.800
(Windy)
What I'm saying, old dog,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.636
is you have no new tricks
so I can predict your moves.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.138
And that means
I can counter them!

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:27.408
When you summon a Link Monster
that's Link 3 or higher,

00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:30.578
I can activate STORMRIDERSHIP
ROCKBUSTER's special ability!

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:33.547
My avian associate steals
one of your trap cards

00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:36.217
from your graveyard and places
it on my side of the field

00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:38.652
so that I can use your
very own trap against you.

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:39.386
(startles)

00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:43.457
I'm losing count of how many
counters Windy countered with.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.660
(Windy)
The trap I'm taking is
MAGIC CYLINDER of course.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.794
(grunts)

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:50.964
So now you'll be the one
who takes damage if you attack.

00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:53.266
And to think, you wouldn't
be in this position

00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:55.469
if you hadn't made the
exact moves that you made.

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:58.472
One mistake after another,
after another, after another.

00:18:58.472 --> 00:18:59.906
You think?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.308
Come again?

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:04.878
(Varis)
BORRELOAD DRAGON
has a special ability

00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:08.548
that lowers a monster's attack
and defense points by 500.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.350
Who cares?

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:13.354
You should, because when
BORRELOAD ‘s ability activates,

00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:15.555
you can't use any
effects against it.

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:17.324
How's that helpful?

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:18.726
Because of timing.

00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:20.961
If Varis uses that ability
right when BORRELOAD

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:24.064
DRAGON attacks, then Windy
will be unable to use

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:25.732
MAGIC CYLINDER against it.

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:28.936
You kept claiming to have
the upper hand,

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:32.873
but in reality, you've just been
playing directly into my hands.

00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:35.142
So, I'm done for?

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:38.646
Clearly, I am bringing this duel
to an end along

00:19:38.646 --> 00:19:40.647
with your very existence!

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.117
(chuckles)

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:45.385
(sighs)

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.186
(laughs)

00:19:46.186 --> 00:19:47.387
I can't hold it in anymore.

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:48.388
I was trying but I just can't!

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:50.223
Because you're so clueless!

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:53.627
You can't win because I have
STORMRIDER TURBULENCE's effect!

00:19:53.627 --> 00:19:55.696
If your Link Monster
has more Link Arrows

00:19:55.696 --> 00:19:58.064
than my ROCKBUSTER
which it does 4 to 2

00:19:58.064 --> 00:20:00.067
your monster's special
abilities are negated

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:02.202
until your next turn!

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.875
And STORMRIDER TURBULENCE
has another effect!

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:10.477
If I have a STORMRIDER
in the Extra Monster Zone

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:12.046
which I wouldn't bring
up if I didn't,

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:14.648
you're required to attack
that STORMRIDER!

00:20:15.148 --> 00:20:17.952
That means BORRELOAD DRAGON
has to attack!

00:20:18.052 --> 00:20:20.320
And Windy can activate
MAGIC CYLINDER

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.023
to redirect the damage
back to Varis.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:24.725
(Windy)
Yeeeesss.

00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.693
3000 points worth of damage.

00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:27.961
Now carry on, carry on.

00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.363
We're all waiting for you
to smack your own life points.

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:32.332
So be it.

00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:36.036
I have no choice but to attack
with my BORRELOAD DRAGON.

00:20:37.638 --> 00:20:41.007
(mechanical whirring)

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.645
And I have no choice but to
activate my trap card

00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:47.781
MAGIC CYLINDER to send your
blast back to you!

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:56.823
(blasting)

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:01.695
(electric whirring)
(timer beeping)

00:21:02.263 --> 00:21:05.031
He's down to 300 life points!

00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:05.900
(grunts)

00:21:06.734 --> 00:21:09.270
You're so lackluster
for all the bluster you muster.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.839
What did you say about
destroying all the Ignis?

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.741
The only thing you're good at
is destroying yourself!

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.077
(Varis)
Is that what your
calculations tell you,

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:19.112
you program?

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.614
I'm going to teach you that

00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:24.584
I'm not one that can be
solved by a mere equation.
