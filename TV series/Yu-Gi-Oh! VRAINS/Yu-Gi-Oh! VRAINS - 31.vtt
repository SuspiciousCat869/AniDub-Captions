(AI)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.340
Who knew LINK VRAINS
had its own sewer system?

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.777
It's how they dispose
of corrupted data.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.012
This path leads to
a processing center

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.348
where old data
is deleted.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.316
I'm afraid we'll
have to split up.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.467
(AI)
<i>Faster, Playmaker, faster!</i>

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.403
I know!

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:38.738
So this is what
my fireflies detected.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.509
Just a tad bigger than
the usual treasures I find.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.344
Fireflies, analyze that blob.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.415
No way.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.784
These energy readings
are off the charts.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.354
As if this blob is absorbing
all the data energy

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:54.955
that's flowing into this room!

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:58.124
Return to me, fireflies!

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.862
(Varis)
You should have never
come here, Ghost Gal.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.330
Varis.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.500
I'm afraid I can't allow
you to leave

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.668
after you've seen
what's going on here.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.504
I don't need your
permission... Later!

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.508
(Varis)
Shutting all corridors.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.978
But I can still log out.
(beeping)

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.548
Not if I jam the signal,
Ghost Gal.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.251
It's time to Speed Duel!
It's time to speed duel.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:36.363
♪♪♪

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.624
Looks like that sewer monster
is still locked on our tail.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.262
(AI)
<i>Even without a nose,
I can tell this stinks!</i>

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:43.930
(growls)

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.237
If I want to get
outta here

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.907
with my trove of data
and in one piece,

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.909
I gotta defeat Varis.

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.943
It won't be easy, but hey,

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.745
that's the dangers
of this job.

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.383
I'll make the first move.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.854
I draw!

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:10.457
And I shall begin by summoning
my Gateway Dragon.

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:15.029
(roaring)

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.531
Then Gateway Dragon's
special ability allows me

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.833
to summon another
dragon from my hand

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.469
as long as its Level
is 4 or less.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:24.704
Now take to the field,
Sniffer Dragon.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.811
And this dragon
has an ability of its own.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.849
It sniffs out another
Sniffer Dragon from my deck.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.685
Yeah, yeah, I've seen
this all before.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.354
I saw you use this
combo against Playmaker.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:43.957
Yes, you have, haven't you.
Good memory.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.894
Thanks, so your old school
strats won't work on me, hon.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:51.965
Oh, I'm not quite
so sure about that
as you will see.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.234
Observing my tactics
is one thing.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.370
Confronting them is another.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.640
And I don't have to point out
how devastating I can be.

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:03.177
I send Background Dragon
from my hand to the graveyard,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.345
which lets me summon
Defrag Dragon.

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.053
Hmpf.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.556
And now's the time
to manifest my circuit.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:21.594
The summoning
conditions require me

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:24.598
to have two Level 2
or lower Dragons.

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.734
Therefore I set
my Gateway Dragon

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.704
and Sniffer Dragon
in the Link Arrows.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:35.675
I Link Summon.
Link 2 Twin Triangle Dragon!

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.852
You think you can win using
the same monsters as last time?

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.521
Should I be offended
or super offended?

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:50.724
(Varis)
If my strategy isn't broken,
why fix it?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.394
By paying 500 life points,
I can bring a monster back

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.398
from my graveyard and summon it
next to Twin Triangle's link.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:01.001
Such as my Background Dragon.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.274
And with
these three,

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.743
I have all that
I need to Link
Summon again.

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.278
But you already
know that.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:14.781
Obviously.
Along with which Link Monster.

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:16.850
Then I won't keep you waiting.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.952
Authorizing the Link Arrows.

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.456
In order to Link Summon,

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:26.327
I require at least
two or more monsters.

00:05:26.427 --> 00:05:29.530
I set Defrag Dragon,
Background Dragon,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.967
and Twin Triangle Dragon
in the Link Arrows.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.906
I Link Summon.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.010
Behold the power of Link 4
Topologic Bomber Dragon.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:54.488
That's a mighty big monster.
No wonder you're always mad.

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:57.124
Your pet food bill
must be off the charts.

00:05:57.191 --> 00:06:01.394
You blabber when
you're scared.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.697
(Ghost Gal)
Topologic Bomber Dragon
had Playmaker

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.699
on the ropes
during their last duel.

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.567
He had to use all
his resources and a half

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.670
just to pull out a draw.

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.838
It's one of the most,
if not <i>the</i> most,

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.841
powerful monsters in the game.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.677
But Varis made
one major mistake.

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:18.245
I knew he'd summon
this dragon.

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:21.715
And if you give me time to
prepare, I can handle anything.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.585
Go, Topologic Bomber Dragon.

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:26.687
Destroy Altergeist Marionetter!

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:29.856
Decimation Destruction!

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.597
(Varis)
Destroy Altergeist Marionetter!

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.367
Decimation Destruction!

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.302
Sorry, toots,
but when you attack me

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.338
while I have an Altergeist
on my field, I can summon

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.142
Altergeist Kunquery from
my hand to block your attack!

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:52.812
Nice.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.483
And while Kunquery's
on my field,

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:59.319
your Bomber Dragon's special
abilities are all negated!

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:04.291
So looks like your Bomber wasn't
the bomb, but just a big bomb.

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.927
Wordplay will not
win you this duel.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.962
Well, if you think
I'm gonna lose anyway,

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:11.898
why don't you be a peach
and share what you're up to?

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.735
I'm assuming you didn't put that
sphere here by mistake.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.303
So what is that thing?

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.573
And why is it storing up
tons of energy?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.409
Huh, I guess you could
say it's a seed

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:25.079
to a new beginning for humanity.

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:28.915
(Ghost Gal)
Ugh! That's your answer Varis?
Come on...

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.951
You know what I hate?
When people don't give

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:34.254
a straight answer and try
to be all metaphorical.

00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:36.423
Like, you think that
makes you mysterious?

00:07:36.457 --> 00:07:39.259
It makes you a tool.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.895
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.930
I summon Altergeist Silquitous!

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.405
Then I activate my trap
Altergeist Protocol so that you

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:54.975
can't stop Silquitous from
using her special ability.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.611
If I return one Altergeist
to my hand,

00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:01.314
Silquitous forces one of your
monsters to return to your hand.

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:04.018
So by retrieving
my Altergeist Protocol,

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:08.722
Topologic Bomber Dragon
is sent packing.

00:08:08.822 --> 00:08:10.791
No!
Since Link Monsters

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.560
can't return to the hand,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.564
Topologic Bomber Dragon
must return to my
Extra Deck instead.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.034
By getting rid of your
one and only monster,

00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:23.604
your life points
are wide open for attack!

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:27.174
And an unsecured target is music
to a hacker's ears.

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.342
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.048
The summoning conditions
require two Altergeists.

00:08:35.148 --> 00:08:37.851
So I set Altergeist Kunquery
and Silquitous!

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:41.789
I Link Summon.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:44.791
Link 2 Altergeist Kidolga!

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:51.899
But this monster's
just a stepping stone,

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.001
because I'll use it
to Link Summon again!

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:01.275
I require at least
two Altergeists,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:06.246
so I set Altergeist Marionetter
and Kidolga in the Link Arrows!

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:07.948
Link the circuit!

00:09:10.684 --> 00:09:12.086
I Link Summon!

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:16.056
Link 3 Altergeist Primebanshee!

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:23.463
But she won't be the only
monster on my field.

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:27.133
I activate
Altergeist Manifestation.

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:31.371
This trap revives one of my
Altergeists from my graveyard.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:34.074
Now which one should
I bring back to life?

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:36.510
Marionetter
has more attack points.

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:39.546
But I think I'll go with
my Altergeist Kidolga.

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:46.587
Next, I place
two cards facedown.

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.688
What?
You chose the monster

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:50.891
that has the fewer
attack points?

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.761
You can cool it
with that fake surprise.

00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:54.894
Attack points are a big thing,

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.897
but you know
they're not everything.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.799
Just like I know that
facedown card of yours

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:01.101
is meant to scare me
off from attacking.

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:04.839
But I don't play scared.
Here I go!

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:09.109
Altergeist Primebanshee!
Attack Varis directly!

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:10.744
Tentacle Lash!

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:20.854
Ha! I knew it.

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:22.590
Your facedown card's a bluff.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.224
It can't stop my attacks.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:27.460
And since my Primebanshee
dealt you damage,

00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:30.030
Kidolga's special ability
kicks in,

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:33.567
letting me resurrect a Link
Monster from your graveyard

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:37.037
and summon it next
to Kidolga's link.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.705
So I think I'll help myself

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:42.343
to your Twin Triangle Dragon.

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:44.878
So that's why you
summoned your Kidolga.

00:10:44.912 --> 00:10:46.546
(Ghost Gal)
You're catching up.

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.254
Kidolga, why don't you
go say hello to Varis?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.863
(Ghost Gal's AI)
<i>Varis is down to 400
life points.</i>

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.866
That means with
one final attack, he's done.

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:07.668
Varis, how do you
think it'll feel

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.770
to lose against
your own monster?

00:11:09.803 --> 00:11:13.106
You know what?
You don't have to imagine, go!

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.810
GG, hon.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.812
Hardly.
(gasps)

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:20.748
You deluded fool.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:22.016
You tricked yourself
into thinking

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:24.284
that you actually
had a chance to win.

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:39.266
Hey, buddy,
you're getting close

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.602
to the source of the signal.

00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.303
Super close.

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.171
(AI)
<i>Good, book it,
we're almost there!</i>

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:52.446
It's a dead end.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.314
(AI)
<i>Kolter!</i>

00:12:06.394 --> 00:12:08.595
<i>Ha-ha! Lights out!</i>

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:10.831
<i>But how can a flashlight
zap a monster?</i>

00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:14.034
(Playmaker)
I don't know, but the light
came from down there.

00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:17.003
So, we must be above
the anomaly.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.305
Let's go.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.047
There it is.

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:30.584
<i>Yeah... But there what is?</i>

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.361
We can't get in!

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.201
<i>Varis!</i>
And Ghost Gal.

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.370
Why is she dueling him?

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.838
You wiped out all my monsters?

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.707
But if you had
a trap that powerful,

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.042
why didn't you use it earlier

00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:57.645
so you wouldn't
take major damage?

00:12:57.678 --> 00:12:58.712
Unless...

00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:02.583
You wanted
to take the damage

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.152
so that you could
activate your Skill.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:08.155
Finally, you're
catching on,
though a bit late.

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:10.757
I can only activate
my Skill Storm Access

00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:13.760
when I have 1000
or fewer life points.

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:16.096
Ugh! I've played
right into his hands.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.498
But it doesn't mean
I can't play out of them.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:23.437
When Primebanshee is destroyed,
I can retrieve

00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:26.807
an Altergeist from my graveyard
and add it to my hand.

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:29.643
Such as my Altergeist
Marionetter.

00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:37.584
If I can get his life points
back above a thousand,

00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.420
he won't be able
to use his Skill.

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:41.554
It's my only shot.

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:45.125
I activate my Skill,
Secret Cure!

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:48.495
I draw cards from my deck
until I get a monster card,

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:50.597
and then
we both gain life points

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:53.801
equal to that monster's
attack points.

00:13:53.901 --> 00:13:55.402
Interesting.

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:58.739
But can you draw one with
more than 600 attack points?

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:01.174
(Ghost Gal)
I'm betting on it.

00:14:01.274 --> 00:14:03.143
Ugh...

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:06.179
Altergeist Lunquery
has zero attack points.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.815
This didn't help at all.

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:10.117
Well, looks like you failed.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.652
And if you don't
even have luck,

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.021
then you truly have nothing.

00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:17.557
It's now my turn.

00:14:17.658 --> 00:14:19.193
You're wrong, Varis.

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:21.995
I may not have much,
but it's more than enough.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.297
My trap card Altergeist Protocol

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:25.966
prevents you from negating

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.902
my monsters' special abilities.

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:30.704
Plus, if you try to use
a special ability of your own,

00:14:30.805 --> 00:14:33.107
I can send an Altergeist
to my graveyard

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.309
to stop it from activating.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.478
And with Kunquery in my hand,

00:14:37.545 --> 00:14:39.346
I can use its special ability

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:40.814
to stop any of his attacks.

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:44.050
And as backup,
I can resurrect my Silquitous

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.887
and kick any monster
he summons off his field.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:48.321
With all these protections,

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.657
I'll definitely
survive this turn.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:54.194
You seem prepared
for all possibilities.

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:55.829
Except for this one.

00:14:55.863 --> 00:14:58.165
I activate
a trap card from my hand.

00:14:58.199 --> 00:14:59.866
What?
That's illegal.

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:02.769
Seems it's not.
By paying half my life points,

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.105
I'm allowed to play it.

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:07.708
My trap card
Red Reboot shuts down

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:11.879
Altergeist Protocol's effects
and renders it useless.

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.381
But in exchange, you're allowed
to take a trap card

00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:17.451
from your deck and place it
facedown on your field.

00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:21.088
Not that it'll help.
This card has one last effect.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:24.058
You can't activate
any trap cards this turn.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:28.629
Hmpf, but if I make it to my
next turn, I can activate it.

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:32.132
And this'll
guarantee me the win.

00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:34.401
I'm not saying that
you didn't pick up my plans,

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:36.370
but I still stacked
enough defenses

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:39.439
to take anything
you dish out this turn.

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.375
I find it
incredibly amusing

00:15:41.442 --> 00:15:44.544
that you still think you
have a sliver of hope.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:46.246
Hope abandoned you
the very moment

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:49.049
you decided
to duel against me.

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:52.853
I activate Background Dragon's
special ability.

00:15:52.887 --> 00:15:54.288
Background Dragon?

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:56.390
When I have no monsters
on my field,

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:57.858
I can not only resummon

00:15:57.892 --> 00:15:59.893
Background Dragon
from my graveyard

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.295
but another dragon
from my hand.

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.297
Resurrect, Background Dragon.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:12.939
And I summon this.
Sniffer Dragon.

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:17.144
But two dragons alone
aren't enough to satisfy

00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:19.946
what I have in store for you,
Ghost Gal.

00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:23.450
Thankfully, when I successfully
summon Sniffer Dragon,

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:26.286
I can add another
Sniffer Dragon to my hand.

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:28.688
Which I will also now summon.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:33.961
Now watch Ghost Gal.

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:37.430
Watch, as I churn this breeze
into a full-fledged Data Storm.

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:44.838
These winds rage for me
and me alone.

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:49.609
Drown in my destruction.

00:17:03.591 --> 00:17:05.425
I activate my Skill.

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:17.537
Storm Access.

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:21.341
It's perfect.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.344
What?

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:26.813
Now bear witness

00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:29.516
as I manifest
my circuit once again.

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:33.019
Authorizing Link Arrows.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:36.690
I'm required to set only
two of my monsters.

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:38.325
But I will be setting all three

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:40.427
of my monsters
in the Link Arrows.

00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:43.096
I link the circuit
for the final time.

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:53.006
I Link Summon...
Link 3 Topologic Trisbaena.

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.617
Varis upped his deck.

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:06.654
(Varis)
But this is only the start.
By banishing three copies

00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:08.823
of the same monster
from my graveyard,

00:18:08.923 --> 00:18:11.892
I can now bring
Defrag Dragon back to life

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.761
to rejoin me in this duel.

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:17.898
I banish my three
Sniffer Dragons.

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:20.600
Welcome back, Defrag Dragon.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:22.770
And since I summoned
Defrag Dragon

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.940
next to Trisbaena's link,
I triggered its special ability.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.978
It banishes Defrag Dragon and
all of our spell and trap cards,

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:34.715
dealing you 500 points
of damage per card.

00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:36.783
Exile's Retribution!

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.425
And next, Topologic Trisbaena

00:18:44.492 --> 00:18:47.761
will now attack
your life points directly.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.095
This duel is over.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:57.571
Dire Destruction!

00:19:10.317 --> 00:19:11.484
(both gasp)

00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:17.023
Ahh!

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.864
Are you okay?
Ghost Gal!

00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:27.401
Playmaker? How embarrassing.

00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:30.671
The one spectator to see me lose
had to be you.

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:34.542
Just hold on.
I'll get you out!

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:37.144
There's no time.

00:19:37.211 --> 00:19:38.211
Take this.

00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:40.114
It's the data I gathered

00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:43.216
by analyzing the sphere.

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:55.996
I'm sure it's the key
to the Hanoi's master plan

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:58.465
and worth a valuable penny.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:02.302
I'm only giving it to you
for free because, uh...

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.873
well, I won't be
around to spend it.

00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:07.774
Don't say that.

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:09.676
Too late.

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:16.350
No! No, Ghost Gal!

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.519
One last thing: If you duel
Varis, be careful.

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:20.988
Even more than before.

00:20:21.054 --> 00:20:22.556
He now has a card that--

00:20:24.124 --> 00:20:25.725
This can't be happening.

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:30.964
<i>That blob absorbed
her data!</i>

00:20:32.566 --> 00:20:34.801
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Playmaker?

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:36.203
How could you?

00:20:36.303 --> 00:20:37.938
This is low
even for you.

00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.975
Her data is going to help usher
in a new era of peace.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.278
You should be thanking me.

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:46.847
I've had enough
of your games, Varis.

00:20:46.947 --> 00:20:49.650
But the games have
only just started.

00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:53.487
And the only way for you
to win is to defeat me.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.156
Begin, the Tower of Hanoi!

00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.263
Wait! Get back here!

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.900
Varis, you coward!

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:10.504
<i>Um, Playmaker, instead of
getting him to come back here,</i>

00:21:10.538 --> 00:21:13.340
<i>how about instead
we get outta here?!</i>

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:14.575
Not now Ai.

00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.877
<i>But-but-but your noodle arms
are too weak</i>

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.546
<i>to tear apart this fence!</i>

00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:24.351
<i>Since when do I have
to be the responsible one?!</i>

00:21:24.385 --> 00:21:26.720
<i>Activate emergency log out!</i>

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:33.227
Ach, whoever said no news
is good news wasn't a reporter.

00:21:33.294 --> 00:21:37.197
Hold the press, what's this?!

00:21:42.936 --> 00:21:45.539
W-W-What?
There's a story breaking

00:21:45.572 --> 00:21:47.841
right before our very eyes!

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:53.880
Well now, that went
from zero to a hundred.

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:56.450
Kolter!

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.419
I know.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:00.453
Varis, what have you done?

00:22:26.747 --> 00:22:31.651
♪♪♪
