WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.970
(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS..

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:08.108
(Flame)
Windy...

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.478
I'm surprised you'd choose
to duel us instead of Varis.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.681
I know you haven't forgotten
that he defeated you.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.316
Oh, he'll get his.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.018
But Lightning's strategy
is to defeat

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.587
the weakest duelists first.

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:20.754
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.324
I Link Summon!

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.529
Link 3 Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.030
(Windy)
Now Bahamaut Bomber,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.965
attack Salamangreat
Heatleo!

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:35.002
Blow out its flames
with a huge gust of wiiind!

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.136
Argh!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.406
(Windy)
It's your turn, Flameburner,
see what I did there?

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.309
And I can say quite certainly
that it will be your last.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.345
(Blue Maiden)
This isn't looking good
for Soulburner.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.848
He's down to his last
600 life points.

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:55.749
And to make
matters worse,

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.485
he has no monsters
on his field

00:01:57.485 --> 00:02:00.020
while Windy still
has his Bahamut Bomber.

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:00.921
(sniffing)

00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.756
Do I smell
duck a l'orange?

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.625
'Cause I say their goose
is cooked.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.395
I wouldn't count Soulburner
and Flame out just yet, Ai.

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.499
C'mon guys,
don't let me down.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.100
It's my turn!

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:15.735
I draw!

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.237
And I'll kick it off

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:19.973
by activating Salamangreat
Performance!

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.477
When I have fewer life
points than my opponent

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.913
and I have a Salamangreat
in my graveyard,

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.081
this spell lets me
snag another copy

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.883
of that monster from my deck.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.753
So I get
Salamangreat Fowl!

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:35.589
Next, I activate
Salamangreat Mole's

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:36.724
special ability!

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:38.725
By banishing it
from my graveyard,

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:42.229
I can return five other
Salamangreat cards to my deck,

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.164
and then draw two cards!

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.233
Then I activate

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.268
my Equip Spell Rising Fire!

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.038
When I have no monsters
on my field

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:53.541
I can equip this card
on a Fire monster

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.742
in my graveyard
to resummon it!

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.079
Rise up, Salamangreat
Heatleo!

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:03.516
Plus, Rising Fire
gives it 500 attack points!

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.987
Not bad, not bad,
not great but not bad.

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:10.157
Because I have my Field Spell
Stormrider Blast.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.225
When there's only a single
Stormrider Link Monster

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.194
on my field, there it is
on my upper right, upper left,

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.663
for you, if your monster has
equal or fewer links,

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.966
meaning 3 or less,
it loses its special abilities.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.937
So Heatleo's abilities are
poof up in smoke.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.776
Without its abilities,
Heatleo's not nearly as strong

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.944
as it can be.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.980
Not to mention it has
fewer attack points

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.515
than Bahamut Bomber.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.149
(Ai)
It was bad before,

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.285
but good thing Soulburner
made all those moves

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.687
to put himself
in a worse position!

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.289
I activate

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:44.958
my Spell
Salamangreat Sparks!

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.561
This spell has two effects:

00:03:47.862 --> 00:03:51.164
First, if the monster equipped
with this card is destroyed,

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.334
I can summon two Salamangreat
Tokens in defense mode

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.836
to either of our fields.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.438
And second, when the equipped
monster battles,

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.740
its attack points become
exactly the same

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.109
as the monster it's fighting.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.612
Ah, that'll allow Heatleo
to destroy my monster,

00:04:04.612 --> 00:04:05.879
in theory.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.248
But in reality I'll use
Bahamut Bomber's special ability

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.783
to destroy that Equip Spell.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.351
No, you won't.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.956
Not if I go and equip the spell
on your Bahamut Bomber!

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:16.723
What?

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:21.261
Huh? He equipped it on
Windy's monster?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.395
That's smart.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.299
If he now destroys
Salamangreat Sparks,

00:04:25.299 --> 00:04:27.868
Soulburner can summon
Tokens on Windy's field

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.203
and negate Stormrider
Blast's effect.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.572
And now...

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.741
I think I'll go and activate
another Equip Spell!

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:35.675
(grunts)

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.377
Salamangreat Claw!

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:40.381
By equipping it
on my Heatleo,

00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:42.849
it can no longer
be destroyed in battle!

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.720
Now when our monsters
fight head-to-head,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.455
only yours will be destroyed.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.190
Wrong, Flame!

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:51.725
Wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong!

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:53.460
I may not be able
to get get rid of

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.695
the other Equip Spell,
but I can get rid of this one!

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:57.932
I activate Bahamut Bomber's
special ability

00:04:57.932 --> 00:04:59.599
to destroy
Salamangreat Claw

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.736
and deal you 500 points
of damage for dessert!

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:06.740
(grunts)

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.847
You only have a measly
100 life points left.

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:17.250
Even a no-eyed clam can see
that this game is over.

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:18.753
Oh, is that so?

00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:22.623
Then you better get that clam
a pair of glasses!

00:05:22.623 --> 00:05:23.290
Huh?

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.359
Yeah, I went fishing
for that one.

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:27.661
But this'll get me
back on track!

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.332
By summoning
Salamangreat Falco,

00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:34.200
I can also automatically
summon Salamangreat Fowl

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.168
from my hand!

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.940
Now it's time...
to blaze my circuit!

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.641
Ha!

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.809
The summoning condition
requires

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.078
one Level 4
or lower Cyberse!

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.281
I Link Summon!

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:50.483
Link 1 Salamangreat
Balelynx!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.820
But due to Stormrider
Blast's effect,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.957
it loses its special abilities,
meaning its defanged!

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.561
(Soulburner)
Then how's this?

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:05.366
I activate my Falco's ability
to retrieve Salamangreat Claw

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:07.501
and place it
facedown on my field.

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:10.137
And even though
you managed to negate

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:11.571
my Balelynx's abilities,

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.641
that won't matter
when I use it

00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.676
and Salamangreat Fowl
to Link Summon again!

00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:19.180
I Link Summon!

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.983
Link 2 Salamangreat
Sunlight Wolf!

00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:23.884
(growls)

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.522
Well Stormrider Blast's effect
negates your canine

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.090
just as it did your feline!

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:32.893
(grunts)

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.661
While you keep doing that,

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.864
I'll do something different
to up my game!

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:37.598
Ha!

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:40.534
I activate Salamangreat
Sanctuary

00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:42.736
to Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:44.871
This lets me bring back...

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:48.842
Link 3 Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.014
Stormrider Blast will negate
its abilities like all the rest!

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.515
So what?

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.984
I have a card that
makes it a non factor!

00:06:58.185 --> 00:06:59.853
Salamangreat Claw!

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.756
When Heatleo is equipped
with this card,

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.424
it can't be destroyed
in battle.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.960
And even better,
Heatleo is allowed to attack

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.162
once for every link
that it has.

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.731
Since Heatleo
has three links,

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:15.402
it's allowed to attack up
to three times in a single turn.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.405
Three times?
Oh, nooo...

00:07:18.405 --> 00:07:20.407
is what I'd be saying
if my monster didn't have

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.042
more attack points
than yours.

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.244
That is true,
but also irrelevant.

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.446
Due to Salamangreat
Sparks's effect,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.049
Bahamut Bomber's attack
points become the same

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:30.750
as Heatleo's during battle.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.055
Except our monster can't
be destroyed while yours can.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:37.091
Aww, wait, wait, time out,
pause for a sec.

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.992
Uh-uh. No chance.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.128
Salamangreat
Heatleo, attack now!

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.271
By destroying
Bahamut Bomber,

00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.074
Salamangreat Sparks
is also destroyed.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.942
This can't be happening!

00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:57.911
When Salamangreat Sparks
is destroyed,

00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:00.780
it summons two Salamangreat
Tokens on your field

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.848
in defense mode!

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:04.785
And those Tokens
have 0 defense points!

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.654
Oh, and one more thing...

00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.323
When Heatleo attacks
a monster in defense mode,

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.393
it can still deal you damage!

00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:15.329
That's 2300 points
of damage per attack.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:18.365
Times that by two
and that equals firecrackers!

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:20.000
Now for my second attack!

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:22.803
Ohh, nooo, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:24.305
please, please, please,
please, please!

00:08:24.305 --> 00:08:26.473
It's a bit too late
for that, Windy.

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.141
You got that right.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:30.777
Heatleo, attack his
Token!

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:34.147
(screams)

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:39.319
Yeah! One last attack
and the show's ova!

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:46.059
Now Heatleo, attack the last
Token and end this duel!

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.863
(shrieking)

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.665
Just kidding.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.666
(gasps)

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.235
You see, what you see
in my hand,

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:56.303
well, Echo's hand,
to be precise, as he is me

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.539
and I am him, so his hand
is mine and my hand is his,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.474
is Stormrider Gulldiver.

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:02.042
By sending this card
to the graveyard,

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.543
the damage I take
is cut in half

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.945
and you're no longer
allowed to battle

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.213
for the rest of this turn.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:07.380
No way!

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:13.220
(laughs)

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.422
Looks like this clock
is still tickin'.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:16.590
Hmm.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.725
This isn't good, Soulburner.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:19.793
Why?

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:22.697
We got him down
to 550 life points--

00:09:22.697 --> 00:09:24.064
(gasps) Oh, wait...

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.099
Can he now use his Skill?

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.734
Can I?

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.770
Well let's do a refresher
on the requirements, shall we?

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.839
I must, one: have less
than 1000 life points

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.106
in two: a Speed Duel.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.175
Do I have less than
a 1000 life points? Check.

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:36.777
Is this a Speed Duel?
No check.

00:09:36.777 --> 00:09:38.612
But you're still
not off the hook!

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:39.613
(grunts)

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.715
Since I am naturally one
with the wind,

00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:44.418
I can conjure up a Data Storm
outside of a Speed Duel,

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:45.686
so check, check, check.

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.555
(chuckles) ♪ I thought of
everything ♪♪♪

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:48.722
(humming)

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.457
Aww, glitch!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.359
(Windy)
Fuuurthermore,

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:54.895
by banishing Gulldiver
from my graveyard,

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:56.930
I can resummon
Bahamut Bomber

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.532
by cutting its attack
points in half

00:09:58.532 --> 00:10:00.600
and negating
its special abilities.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.272
Further furthermore,
my Stormrider Blast

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:08.342
raises its attack points
by 400, plus another 300

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:10.044
for every Field Spell
in my graveyard

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:12.612
for a total of 700
additional attack points.

00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:16.217
Any ideas?

00:10:16.217 --> 00:10:16.950
Yeah!

00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:18.786
I play...

00:10:18.786 --> 00:10:21.187
the spell card
Salamangreat Sublimation!

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.456
By tributing Sunlight Wolf,

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.727
I regain life points
equal to its attack points!

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.364
Then I draw one card
from my deck!

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.867
Next I'm gonna play this--

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:34.901
(Flame)
Wait, Soulburner.

00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.572
We must be careful
about which cards to play,

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:41.341
not to mention when
to play those cards.

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.444
And judging by Windy's
past moves,

00:10:43.544 --> 00:10:45.445
now is not the right time.

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:47.581
Ah, you worry too much.

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.349
You don't worry enough.

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:50.116
(Soulburner)
What?

00:10:54.288 --> 00:10:55.121
Fine.

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:56.724
Do whatever you like.

00:10:57.057 --> 00:11:00.093
I'll play this facedown...
and end my turn.

00:11:00.427 --> 00:11:03.297
Oh! I can't believe it!
You actually played it!

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:04.632
You should've listened
to Flame!

00:11:04.632 --> 00:11:06.466
But nooo, you'd rather
make a mistake.

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:09.636
That's why human partners
are the absolute worst!

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:12.572
And now it will
cost you everything!

00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:17.177
(Windy)
It's my turn!

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.679
Echo, if you will do
the honors?

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:21.482
First, my banished
Stormrider Stolastorm

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:23.416
returns from its vacation.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.587
And due to my Field Spell
Stormrider Blast's effect,

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:28.788
it gains 700 attack points!

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.327
But those are just
the appetizers

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.628
for the main course!

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:40.134
I'll use my Skill to snatch up
a brand new Link Monster

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:41.201
from the Data Storm.

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.736
And let me remind you,

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.438
I could've never done this
without your help, Soulburner.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.273
Thanks for being such a fool.

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.409
Storm Access!

00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:56.750
I hope you realize that although
you're not breaking the rules,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.486
you're bending them severely.

00:11:58.586 --> 00:12:00.453
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.690
Because if you're not cheating,
you're not trying.

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:05.525
Now allow me to show you
the new monster that I obtained!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.331
The summoning conditions
require at least two

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:11.699
Stormrider Link Monsters.

00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:15.136
So I set Stormrider Bahamut
Bomber and Stolastorm

00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:16.336
in the Link Arrows!

00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.040
If he's willing to get rid of
Bahamut Bomber,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.575
then this is gonna be rough.

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:23.577
You don't know
the half of it!

00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:25.011
I Link Summon!

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:30.517
Link 4 Stormrider Flagship
Custom Bahamut Bomber!

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:35.855
And Stormrider Blast's effect
makes it even stronger!

00:12:37.324 --> 00:12:39.927
That's a whole lotta
of attack points, Flame.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.497
And we still don't know
what abilities it may have.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.867
Then allow me to introduce you
to one of them.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.370
And here's a fun fact,
you won't like it.

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.339
When I have zero cards
in my Spell &amp; Trap Zone,

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:54.341
I can transform
one of your monsters

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.143
into a worthless spell card

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.411
and scoot it to the back
of your field.

00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:02.582
Aww, man!

00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:04.785
And since Salamangreat
Claw can only equip

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.888
on to monsters, not spells,
it's destroyed!

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.258
I told you
you wouldn't like it.

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:12.659
I did, I did.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:14.962
And if you didn't like that,
you definitely won't like this.

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:17.998
Custom Bahamut Bomber's
second ability destroys

00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:19.266
all your spell
and trap cards,

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:21.902
and you take 500 points
of damage for each one.

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:23.570
So your Heatleo? Gone!

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.973
That card Flame told you
not to play? Gone!

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:27.908
A thousand of your
life points?

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:29.643
Gone, gone, gone!

00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:32.612
And to think this wouldn't have
happened if your teamwork worked

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:35.815
but it didn't, so your cards
are going bye byeee!

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:40.654
(grunts)

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:45.726
And with that, you have
nothing on your field!

00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:47.261
Do you now agree that

00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:49.329
we shouldn't have played
that card?

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:50.163
Yes.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.333
Oh, now you listen to him
when it's much too late.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.202
All because you're
too arrogant to snack

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:56.469
on a slice of humble pie.

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:58.639
You should've recognized
from the start that the Ignis

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:01.608
are always right and humans
are always wrong.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.310
Because the Ignis
are flawless--

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.678
well, certain Ignis
are flawless.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.513
I can't speak for the defects
who'd choose to team with,

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:07.548
ugh, humans.

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:08.648
Hey!

00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.283
Why you gotta
drag me into this?

00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:13.653
Now I can't say
this duel was fun,

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:15.989
but I can say
this duel is done!

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:18.058
Custom Bahamut Bomber,
attack!

00:14:21.495 --> 00:14:23.864
Ha, I'm blowing out
your flickering flame

00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:25.665
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:27.334
Are you sure about that?

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:28.135
Huh?

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.371
I activate my trap card!

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:33.874
A trap? What trap?
I don't see a trap.

00:14:34.008 --> 00:14:37.811
Try thinking of a location
other than the field, Windy.

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:40.514
Field? No.
Deck? No.

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:42.149
Hand? No.
Graveyard?

00:14:42.149 --> 00:14:43.350
(gasps) Graveyard!

00:14:43.617 --> 00:14:45.352
That's right, Windy,
the graveyard.

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:47.955
I banish my trap
Salamangreat Ascetic

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.490
from my graveyard
to activate its effect!

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.395
It returns a Salamangreat
Link Monster to my Extra Deck

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:56.329
and it also resurrects
a different

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:59.566
Salamangreat monster to
my field in defense mode.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.402
Take wing,
Salamangreat Falco!

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.873
Salamangreat Ascetic is
the facedown card

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.275
we played earlier,

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:11.211
but to use its full effect,
we needed you to destroy it

00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.113
and send it
to the graveyard.

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:15.382
So me and Flame
did a little acting,

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:18.752
like we had a disagreement
that led to a mistake and voila.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.253
Hook line and sinker.

00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:22.189
So you tricked me?

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:23.724
(grunts) But it changes
nothing!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:27.260
Custom Bahamut Bomber, attack
and eliminate their Falco!

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.600
When my monster's about
to be destroyed in battle,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.736
I can banish Salamangreat
Balelynx from my graveyard

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:37.370
to take the hit instead!

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.575
(grunts)

00:15:41.575 --> 00:15:43.744
Would... you... two...
just stop trying!

00:15:43.744 --> 00:15:46.047
It's annoying and frustrating
and annoying!

00:15:46.414 --> 00:15:48.415
Looks like we're
getting to him, Flame.

00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:51.385
Oh, no no no no no no no,
you're not.

00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:53.554
Do I need to remind you,
I guess I do,

00:15:53.554 --> 00:15:56.056
that I still have
the strongest monster in play?

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.925
A monster that you're forced
to attack due to

00:15:57.925 --> 00:15:59.226
Stormrider Blast's effect?

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.961
So you did manage
to get another turn,

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:02.629
but that turn will be
your last.

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:05.699
Soulburner,
he does have a point.

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.401
So, are you worried, bud?

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:11.339
No, not at all.
Because I believe in you.

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:12.807
I believe in you too.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.810
It all comes down
to this final draw, Flame.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.345
So let's make sure
it's a good one!

00:16:20.447 --> 00:16:21.481
Here goes!

00:16:21.648 --> 00:16:23.617
I drawww!

00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:29.489
Here goes!

00:16:29.957 --> 00:16:31.758
I drawww!

00:16:36.263 --> 00:16:37.031
Perfect!

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:39.366
I summon Salamangreat
Gazelle!

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:44.971
When this monster is summoned,

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.641
its special ability
lets me send a different

00:16:47.641 --> 00:16:50.243
Salamangreat in my deck
to the graveyard.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.446
So I send
Salamangreat Spiny!

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:56.684
But Spinny has
its own special ability!

00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:59.820
When there's a Salamangreat
monster on my field,

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.322
I can resurrect it
from my graveyard!

00:17:05.593 --> 00:17:06.360
That's it?

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.094
Of all the creatures
in the universe,

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:11.331
I'm supposed to be scared
of a deer and an armadillo?

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:14.534
Don't you know you should never
judge a book by its cover?

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.471
'Cause you're now about to learn
what they can really do!

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:22.042
I overlay Level 3 Salamangreat
Gazelle and Salamangreat Spinny!

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:23.176
Overlay?

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:25.579
With these two monsters,

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:28.181
I'll now build
the Overlay Network!

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.002
Windy, watch and weep!

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:52.239
This wild steed blazes
through the tundra

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:54.374
to torch every illusion!

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.043
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.145
Rank 3

00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:01.314
Salamangreat Miragestallio!

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.485
Next, I activate
its special ability!

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:08.088
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:12.759
Miragestallio summons
a Salamangreat from my deck!

00:18:13.794 --> 00:18:16.463
Here comes Salamangreat
Beat Bison!

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:21.434
And Beat Bison has its own
special ability!

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:24.070
For every faceup card
you have on your field,

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.439
I can return a Fire
Attribute Link Monster

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.776
in my graveyard
to my Extra Deck!

00:18:28.976 --> 00:18:30.744
But that's not all, Windy,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.380
I also get to negate
the effects and abilities

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.648
of your faceup cards!

00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:37.918
So I return two
Heatleos to my Extra Deck

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:41.421
and negate Custom Bahamut Bomber
and Stormrider Blast's

00:18:41.421 --> 00:18:43.757
effects and abilities,
so your high flyers

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.258
won't be flying so high.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.666
Next, I'll follow that up
by blazing my circuit!

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:55.903
I set Miragestallio,
Falco, and Beat Bison

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:57.470
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.239
I Link Summon!

00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:00.507
Link 3

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.976
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:06.380
When I use Miragestallio
to Link Summon,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.482
its special ability activates

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:11.718
and returns one monster
on your field to your hand.

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:15.689
So your Custom Bahamut Bomber
is gallopin' on outta here!

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:16.724
What?

00:19:17.024 --> 00:19:18.626
(grunts) I don't think so!

00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:20.961
Not when I have
Stormrider Tubieloof!

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:22.496
By discarding this card
from my hand,

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.665
it negates your monster's
special ability!

00:19:24.832 --> 00:19:28.001
So my Custom Bahamut Bomber
is staying right where it is!

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:30.337
And I'm staying right here
as well because I'm the one

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:33.173
who'll blow your flame out,
not the other way around!

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.708
Listen Windy,

00:19:34.708 --> 00:19:36.877
I know that the wind
can blow a flame out.

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:39.646
But the wind can also
fan the flames

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.181
into a raging inferno!

00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:45.052
I activate Salamangreat
Sanctuary's effect!

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.487
Reincarnation Link Summon!

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:51.658
Rise again from
the valley of flames!

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:54.461
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:57.864
When Heatleo
is reincarnated,

00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.966
it can make your monster's
attack points become

00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:01.969
the same as one that's
in my graveyard!

00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:05.272
And my Spinny only has
a thousand attack points!

00:20:05.806 --> 00:20:07.942
Don't do it, don't do it,
don't do it!

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.943
Flame Possession!

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.549
Nooo!

00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:19.186
You did it, you did it,
you did it!

00:20:19.453 --> 00:20:21.488
Windy, you saw teamwork
as a negative

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:22.790
instead of a positive.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.492
But only by working together
could Soulburner and I

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:27.394
steer the duel
in our favor and--

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:29.963
Just attack me so I don't have
to listen to Flame anymore!

00:20:29.963 --> 00:20:30.731
Sure.

00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:32.500
Alright, Heatleo!

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:35.770
Attack and destroy Custom
Bahamut Bomber!

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.338
Inferno Strike!

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:51.618
(screams)

00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:54.154
(grunts)

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.225
I had this duel.
I had it!

00:20:58.225 --> 00:20:59.626
Where did I go wrong?

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.562
Was it when I played
my Field Spell or

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:02.630
when I Link Summoned?

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.065
No, it was long before then.

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:07.701
It was the moment
you eliminated your partner.

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:10.037
What? That useless
human being?

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.371
In a true partnership,

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.073
you not only fight
for yourself,

00:21:13.073 --> 00:21:14.708
but for your partner as well.

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.243
And that goes both ways.

00:21:16.243 --> 00:21:18.512
Since we do not want
to let each other down,

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:20.414
we fight harder
than we would alone,

00:21:20.414 --> 00:21:22.516
overcoming our limits
to reach heights

00:21:22.516 --> 00:21:24.384
we thought were
once impossible.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:26.587
So once you got rid
of your partner,

00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:29.389
you could say you got
rid of yourself.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.258
(grunts)

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.127
No, no, no, no,
this can't be happening!

00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:34.461
It was a fluke!
A fluke!

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:36.397
I shouldn't have lost!
You just got lucky!

00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:38.232
Lightning! Save me!

00:21:38.232 --> 00:21:40.734
Lightning!

00:21:43.603 --> 00:21:45.872
I thought Windy would
perform better.

00:21:46.273 --> 00:21:47.040
Oh, well.

00:21:47.507 --> 00:21:49.343
(screams)

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.712
Windy, I'll hold on
to your data

00:21:51.712 --> 00:21:53.780
so that you won't be
permanently erased.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.249
No, no, no, no!

00:21:56.516 --> 00:21:57.618
Nooo!

00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:00.487
I would rather be erased
than have to live inside you!

00:22:00.754 --> 00:22:03.857
(screams)

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:10.130
You sure you wanna
carry him around?

00:22:11.198 --> 00:22:12.198
Of course.

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:14.434
Whether friend or foe,

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:17.170
every life is precious.
