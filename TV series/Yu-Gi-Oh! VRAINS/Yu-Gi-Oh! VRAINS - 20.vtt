00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.771
(Ai)
Previously on
"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:07.741
There was an incident
known among inner circles

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.010
<i>as the "Lost Incident."</i>

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.778
Six children
went missing

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.081
because a secret
organization took them.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.417
And one of the six children
was Playmaker.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.120
It's true that I was taken.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.656
I found myself alone
in an empty room,

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.792
except for one thing.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:27.194
A single piece of VR tech.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.263
I was forced to duel and win.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:35.136
Because if I didn't...
I was punished for my failure.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:37.671
I never knew when this
was going to end,

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.909
and then, one day,
it just... did.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.512
(Zaizen)
You were rescued,
but the culprit was never found.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.315
In fact, the whole
Lost Incident was covered up.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.984
(Ghost Girl)
Your true identity's
still a mystery.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.854
I learned that the Lost Incident
went by another name--

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.022
The Hanoi Project.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.758
Within the database,
I found the name

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.494
of the mastermind behind
the Hanoi Project.

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.563
The name?
(both gasp)

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.031
Mastermind?

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.899
Who is it?

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.472

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.881
You know who started
the Lost Incident?

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:30.383
Tell me who it is!

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.921
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.823
I never should have
said anything.

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:36.991
Just look at you.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.592
I can see it
in your eyes.

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:40.427
You're thirsting
for revenge.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:42.630
That's exactly what
I did not want.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.298
I know you can't forget
about the Lost Incident,

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.768
but you don't have to let
those memories haunt you.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.803
You can bring them
to an end.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:51.272
Aww, geez.

00:02:51.272 --> 00:02:53.373
You know those people
who offer you a cookie

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.609
and then call you a glutton
for taking it?

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.777
This guy!

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.712
I agree, Ai.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.314
Ya do!?
Of course ya do!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.984
Does that mean we're
BFFs again? Ooh!

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:08.188
If that's how you feel,
then you leave me no choice.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.457
As if you ever had
a choice.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:13.360
Perhaps you're right,
Playmaker.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.028
Perhaps you're right.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.831
But remember, you did!

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.901
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.170
You will not survive
this turn!

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.373
In fact, you will not
survive this attack!

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:29.176
Go, Tindangle Acute Cerberus!

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:32.179
(energy crackling and whirring)

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.346
(booming)

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.518
Well, this battle was
a long time coming,

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.519
but a short time ending.

00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:43.357
All your life points are gone!

00:03:43.357 --> 00:03:45.191
(Ai screaming)
That's it!

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.994
We're toast,
and I mean the icky,

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.195
burnt kind of toast
that tastes like charcoal!

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:50.664
(Playmaker)
Stop panicking.
Why?

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:51.965
You plannin'
on taking over?

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.669
I activate my spell,
Cynet Backdoor!

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.005
By banishing one Cyberse monster
from my field,

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.575
I can add another Cyberse
from my deck to my hand

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.178
as long as it has
fewer attack points.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:07.848
What's more, the Cyberse monster
I banish returns

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.016
straight to my field
on my very next turn

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.520
and it can then attack you
directly, Zaizen.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.454
I banish Firewall Dragon!

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.528
And then I'll add
this Draconnet to my hand.

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:23.964
You're just spinning
in circles!

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.767
None of those moves will
stop his mutt's attack!

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:28.735
That's where
you're wrong.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.770
By getting rid
of Firewall Dragon,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.407
Doppler Phase Coating
also goes to the graveyard

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:35.009
and activates its effect,

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.678
and automatically ends
the battle.

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:39.914
So this duel isn't over.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:42.082
What?

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.085
He's safe! Heh!
I was never worried.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:46.853
Grr!

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:47.921
(Ai)
Remember when you said

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:49.423
we wouldn't survive
this turn?

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:50.791
I sure do!

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.527
Well, this turn
is not over yet!

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.397
After the battle,
my Tindangle Acute Cerberus

00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:59.766
activates its special ability
to summon one Tindangle Token.

(Ai chuckling)

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.283
He pumped up his monster
for nothin'.

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:17.985
He forgot
that our Firewall Dragon

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.689
can attack him directly
with or without his monster!

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.658
I forgot nothing.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.661
When I said I'd win,
it wasn't a boast.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:28.996
It was a promise.

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.498

By moving his monster

Akira can easily summon
another monster next turn

to fill up the Links
and activate Gergonne's End.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.230
And that equals an automatic
"the end" for Playmaker.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.565
I don't know how Playmaker's
gonna get out of this,

No!

Well, that's over.

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:57.918
I'm no fan of Zaizen,

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.955
but at least I'll be rid
of that Playmaker!

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.322
(laughing)

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.224
Wait!
That's not all!

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:06.093
I'm sure the board
wouldn't want it to leak

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.295
that they're hiding info
about the Lost Incident

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:09.730
in their databank.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.631
So, if I secure the data
from Zaizen,

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.833
they'll offer me the world
to keep my mouth shut!

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.570
Maybe I'm a fan of yours
after all!

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.573
I can't deny the fact
that you have me cornered,

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:21.074
but you made one mistake.

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:23.410
Oh, really, now?
What mistake?

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.447
You can't attack me,
and you only have one turn left.

00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:29.416
That's right.
That's your mistake, Zaizen.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.617
Ohh!

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.320
You left me
with one last turn!

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.955
And?

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.090
And I can transform
one turn

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.326
into infinite possibilities!

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:42.062
I draw!

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:45.299
Due to the effect
of my spell Cynet Backdoor,

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.702
the monster I banished
last turn returns to my field.

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:52.572
Rise, Firewall Dragon!

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:55.542
(roaring)

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:58.078
Next, I shall summon
Draconnet!

00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:03.350
And when I summon
this monster,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.952
its special ability activates

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.055
and allows me to summon
another monster

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.857
from my hand or deck
in defense mode

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:12.125
as long as its Level
is 2 or lower!

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.227
Fitting those conditions
absolutely perfectly

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:15.562
is my Bitron!

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:21.502
And I shall use it
to Link Summon!

00:08:21.502 --> 00:08:24.037
Go!

00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:26.506
I set Bitron
in the Link Arrow!

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:31.345
I Link Summon!

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.314
Link 1... Link Spider!

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:39.452
Hmph!
Since you can't attack,

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.288
summoning a monster
is futile.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:43.723
You'd be right if this
was all I did.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.861
But I activate Link Spider's
special ability,

00:08:46.861 --> 00:08:49.229
allowing me to summon
a monster from my hand

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.498
next to its Link!

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.601
Now take to the field,
Digitron!

00:08:57.171 --> 00:09:00.374
And with it,
I can Link Summon again!

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:01.942
Ha!

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:04.210
What's this?
Another Link Summon?

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.180
The summoning conditions
require two Cyberse monsters,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.117
so I set Digitron
and Draconnet

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:13.420
in the Link Arrows.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.888
I Link Summon!

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.891
Link 2,
Recovery Sorcerer!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.761
And for a third time,

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.265
I'm going
to Link Summon again!

00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:27.200
You can Link Summon
a hundred times
if you want to!

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.069
No matter how many
monsters you have,

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.172
they can't attack
as long as I have
Euler's Circuit in play!

00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:34.742
Duh! Like we didn't
know that?

00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:36.243
But I like how you said it
with conviction,

00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:39.513
with all that power
in your voice, ooh!

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:41.181
Create the circuit!

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.750
The summoning conditions

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.552
require one
Cyberse Link Monster,

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:48.388
so I set Link Spider
in the Link Arrow!

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.190
I Link Summon!

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.459
Link 1 Secure Gardna!

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:55.395
And then I can summon it
to a specific place

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:56.963
on the field...
right there!

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.703
Whoa whoa whoa!

00:10:02.703 --> 00:10:04.604
That's next
to Acute Cerberus's Link!

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.873
That's the one place
you don't summon it to!

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:09.276
If you fill up all its Links,
that means his trap's

00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:10.944
gonna go...
(guitar string pops)

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.080
and the damage...
(tin can rattling)

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.416
and our life points
are gonna go...
(descending whistle, thud)

00:10:15.416 --> 00:10:16.917
(Zaizen)
Or allow me to translate!

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:20.755
It means you activated
my Gergonne's End!

00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:22.390
Since you filled up

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.091
all of Tindangle Acute
Cerberus's Links,

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.595
I can deal you damage
equal to its attack points

00:10:27.595 --> 00:10:29.296
by destroying
Gergonne's End

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:32.099
and the three monsters
it's linked to!

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:34.601
So I destroy
my two Tindangle Tokens,

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:37.404
Secure Gardna
and Gergonne's End,

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:40.107
to deal you 3000 points
of damage!

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:44.044
Which is much more
than you have left!

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:47.247
Go! Finish him!

00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.963
It's really over!

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.432
Playmaker lost.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.734
You dueled well,

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:11.405
but you never
stood a chance.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:13.640
(Playmaker)
Is that so?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.575
(both gasp)

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.250
Ta-dah!
And not a scratch on me!

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.985
But... how?!

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:27.487
My Gergonne's End
should have finished you!

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:30.757
It should have,
but obviously it didn't!

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:33.493
For you see, my Secure
Gardna's special ability

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:35.262
shields me from
the effects of your trap

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.498
for the duration
of this turn, Zaizen,

00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:40.467
which means I did not
take any damage.

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:43.137
So you caused
my trap to misfire!

00:11:43.137 --> 00:11:47.441
(laughing)
You took the "L" on this one!

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:49.176
We sure outsmarted him
with this move,

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:50.477
didn't we, Playmaker?

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:51.612
Or come to think of it,

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.680
we outsmarted you
all duel long!

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.083
But it's all love, baby!
We're aweso--

00:11:56.083 --> 00:11:58.319
Why do you continue
to say "we?"

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:01.054
I don't happen to recall
you helping in the least, Ai.

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:04.725
(screaming)
So mean.

00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.227
If you're done, I'd like
to get back to this duel.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.196
Oh, I'm done.

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:11.398
Since you lost
two Tindangle monsters,

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.268
your Acute Cerberus loses
1,000 attack points.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:16.537
But what's more important
is that since you have

00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:18.238
fewer than three Tindangles,

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.207
Euler's Circuit's effect
deactivates,

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:23.978
allowing me to attack
once again.

00:12:23.978 --> 00:12:26.180
Playmaker, you don't
think I'm helpful?

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.547
Well, here's helpful!

00:12:27.547 --> 00:12:30.350
If you attack him directly
with Firewall Dragon,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.419
you'll get the win
and give him the brush off!

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.656
Grr!
Well, I have
a different move in mind!

00:12:35.656 --> 00:12:39.192
I activate Recovery Sorcerer's
special ability

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.228
to bring back
my Cyberse Link Monster

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:42.863
that was destroyed
this turn!

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:44.998
Return, Secure Gardna!

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:47.167
(Ai)
B-- But why, Playmaker?

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.470
You coulda won
without doing that!

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.372
You're being difficult
on purpose!

00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:53.040
I always have a purpose,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.975
but being difficult
is not one of them.

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.643
Um, okay.

00:12:56.643 --> 00:12:59.246
I activate
Firewall's ability!

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:02.649
For every monster
that's co-linked to this card,

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:05.252
Firewall Dragon can return
a monster on the field

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:08.088
or in the graveyard
back to our hands.

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.762
Since two monsters are
co-linked to Firewall Dragon,

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:18.666
Zaizen, I send Tindangle Hound
and Tindangle Angel

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:21.001
from your graveyard
back to your hand.

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:27.608
While Tindangle Hound
and Tindangle Angel

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:29.944
were in your graveyard,
your Acute Cerebus

00:13:29.944 --> 00:13:32.813
gained 1,500 attack points
from each of them.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.614
But now that they're back
in your hand,

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.450
Cerebus's attack points
drop to zero!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.724
Oh!
Attack!

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:48.094
Firewall Dragon, destroy
Tindangle Acute Cerberus!

00:13:52.967 --> 00:13:55.435
Tempest Terahurtz!!

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.114
(Playmaker)
Firewall Dragon, destroy
Tindangle Acute Cerberus!

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:09.683
Tempest Terahurtz!

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.228
Ohh!
Unh!

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.830
Akira!

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.832
Are you okay?

00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:27.301
I'll be fine.

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:31.305
Well, well, well!
Impressive, Playmaker.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.007
I guess no one can stop you

00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:35.042
when you put your mind
to it.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:38.546
Whether it's
for your own good or not.

00:14:38.546 --> 00:14:41.215
I'm taking the data.

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:42.682
Ohh.

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:53.293
Ai, can you access it?

00:14:53.293 --> 00:14:55.028
Who you think
you're talkin' to?

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:57.698
If there's data to eat,
call me a turkey!

00:14:57.698 --> 00:14:59.032
Get it?
Gobble gobble?

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:00.501
Just go!

00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.702
Okay!
I thought that was good.

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.875
(Ai roaring)

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:17.384
(Ai burps)

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:20.688
Whew!
I am stuffed!

00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:22.756
Couldn't eat another byte!

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:26.927
But whatever you're lookin' for
is in my jelly belly now.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.801
Playmaker, wait!

00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:36.070
You could've attacked
with Firewall Dragon

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:37.938
much earlier
in the duel to win.

00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:39.407
So why didn't you?

00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:42.743
To extend my torment?

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:44.111
If I attacked earlier,

00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:46.080
I couldn't revive
your Tindangle Angel

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.414
and Tindangle Hound.

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:48.549
Akira!

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:51.385
They protected each other,
like you two do.

00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:54.455
Cards like that don't deserve
to rest in the graveyard,

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:56.857
among the cold
and the dark.

00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:58.425
And neither do you.

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:00.828
But I promise you will
if you ever decide

00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:02.963
to interfere with me again.

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:05.865
Let's hope
that day never comes...

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:07.467
for your sake.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:13.840
(Ai)
You could've just said
you were stylin' on him.

00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:18.913
(Ghost Girl)
Well, that was fun.

00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:20.781
But this girl's gotta run.

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.351
See ya round the network!
(giggling)

00:16:26.753 --> 00:16:30.324
Despite my best, I just
couldn't get through to him.

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:32.960
You're wrong.
I don't think
that's true, Akira.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.095
Huh?
Don't sell yourself short.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.997
You want him to change,

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.599
but he has to want
to change, too.

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:41.001
He thought
he was all alone,

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.436
but now he knows
that there are others

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:43.770
looking out for him too,

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.606
like how you
look out for me.

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:49.142
Right, Akira?

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.077
That's right.

00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:57.985
(groaning)
Zaizen failed like a failure!

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:00.487
What will I do now!?

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.189
When SOL Tech's board learns

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:05.425
that Playmaker stole
their data under my watch,

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:08.895
oh, there's no chance I can
keep this private office.

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:11.532
I'll be lucky to share
a cubicle with the lowlies!

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:14.000
I must keep this quiet!

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.869
No one will hear
about this!

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.905
No one!
Super secret, super quiet!

00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:20.507
He's awfully loud
for being quiet.

00:17:20.507 --> 00:17:23.009
Like, yeah, right?

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:25.812
Guess he can't hear himself
with all that screaming.

00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:30.551
(Emma)
Playmaker's not the only one

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.386
who got a copy of the data.

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:34.221
I wonder if I can start
a bidding war?

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.522
(chuckling)

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.064
(exhales wearily)

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.433
(Kolter)
You look like
you could use

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.502
a serious vacay.
Huh?

00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:50.403
I retrieved the data.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:51.706
That's my man!

00:17:51.706 --> 00:17:53.974
And he couldn't
have done it without me!

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:56.377
Yeah, you weren't
so awful.

00:17:56.377 --> 00:18:00.080
Backhanded compliment?
I'll take it! Woo-hoo!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.148
All right, then, Kolter.

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:04.651
Dive in and hack
the data out of Ai.

00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.920
I'm on it.
Huh?!

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.891
How would you like it
if I hacked into you, meatbag?

00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.827
I wouldn't...
but I like hacking you.

00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:17.598
Empathy of a mollusk!

00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:21.134
(Kolter)
Now let's see what was
worth all the trouble.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.074
Hey, Kolter,
check it out!

00:18:27.074 --> 00:18:31.211
Dr. Kogami, Director
of the Hanoi Project.

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:34.248
Looks like we hit
the jackpot, Yusaku.

00:18:34.248 --> 00:18:37.551
So this is the individual
who made me suffer.

00:18:37.551 --> 00:18:39.919
(Ai)
I'll pull up
the related files!

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.957
It says here...
that Dr. Kogami was

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:46.326
a top research scientist
working for SOL Technologies.

00:18:46.326 --> 00:18:49.630
No wonder SOL Tech wanted
to keep this hush hush.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.799
What else
does his file say?

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:53.667
If Kogami's the director,
he must've had

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.735
an entire staff
working for him.

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:57.437
There's not
a single data drop

00:18:57.437 --> 00:19:00.374
of anyone else being
involved or assisting him.

00:19:00.374 --> 00:19:02.343
In fact, says here,
the Hanoi Project

00:19:02.343 --> 00:19:05.179
was his secret pet project,
so he worked alone.

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:09.216
Alone? For a project
of this magnitude?

00:19:09.216 --> 00:19:11.352
Sounds fishy to me.

00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:14.688
Fishy or not, that's
not really important.

00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:16.723
What's important is
that it happened,

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:18.058
it was allowed to happen,

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:20.361
and no one knew about it
until someone found out

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:22.496
what he was doing
and alerted the company.

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.665
Yeah, you'd think
they would've known.

00:19:24.665 --> 00:19:26.567
I mean,
the electricity bills alone

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:27.668
woulda been off the charts!

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.169
Does it say
what the purpose

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:30.971
of the secret
project was?

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.940
Nope, it doesn't,
not at all.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.841
That's all
the info that's here.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.677
There has to be
more, Kolter.

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:39.346
I'm tellin' ya man,
that's everything--

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:41.849
Ahh!
Whoa, what is this?

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.618
Huh? Huh!
No way!

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:46.520
What? What? What?!

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.690
It says Dr. Kogami
retired seven years ago.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.026
As in "retired retired",
if you get my drift.

00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:12.513
(Varis)
This is where
we will institute

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:14.949
the next phase
of our plan.

00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:17.017
Very good.

00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:20.321
This seed will blossom
into a new beginning.

00:20:20.321 --> 00:20:22.856
A world without
Link VRAINS--

00:20:22.856 --> 00:20:26.627
No, a world rid
of the entire digital network!

00:20:26.627 --> 00:20:29.696
And not even the shackles
of the great beyond

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:32.732
will prevent me from being
able to achieve this dream.

00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:45.979
