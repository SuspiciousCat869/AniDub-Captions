WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.271
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.139
(Blue Maiden)
Ever since we were kids,

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.976
Akira had to look after me
cuz I was the lil' sister.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.111
So never in a million years

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.947
could I have imagined that
we'd be fighting side-by-side.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:15.582
And now,

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.451
I'm the one who's
gonna protect him,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.152
just like he protected me!

00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.654
Time to battle!

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.322
MARINCESS GREAT BUBBLE REEF,

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.858
attack his WATER
LEVIATHAN @IGNISTER

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.159
and end this duel!

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.162
Oh yeah?

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.498
WATER LEVIATHAN's
special ability

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.166
cuts your monster's
attack points in half!

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.403
You should've
never attacked, Blue.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.072
Fire back, WATER LEVIATHAN!

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.109
(screaming)

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.778
Akira...

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.314
Skye... take...
my hand.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.982
(grunting)

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:51.918
No...

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.087
Akira...

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.324
(Ai)
Now Zaizen's code key is mine.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.729
Wait up, Ai!

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.097
This isn't cool!

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.664
You're not a bad guy!

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:05.766
You're wrong.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.000
It is.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.035
(gasps)

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.905
The Dark Ignis has
shown its true colors.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:15.008
And I'll be the one
to fade it to black!

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:16.509
(laughs)

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:18.812
Good luck
with that.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.647
Later, Playmaker.

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.649
Ai...

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.517
Akira...

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.695
♪♪♪

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:44.798
(gasps)

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.000
(all gasp)

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:50.537
Hey, guys...

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.516
If I didn't know better,
I'd think he was sleeping.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.651
(Yusaku)
We'll find a way
to wake him up, Skye.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:06.954
After all, we've done it before.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.222
I know.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.658
Thanks for trying
to cheer me up, Yusaku.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.193
(Theodore)
And you should try your best
to not give up hope.

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.029
Since Ai did this he can fix it.

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:18.398
Let's go.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.467
You're gonna search for Ai?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.169
Yeah.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.837
Wait, does that mean

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.672
you know where he is?

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:26.940
I don't.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:28.608
But it's not like we don't
have any leads

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.709
on where he
might be

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:32.112
cuz now that he has
SOL Tech's code keys,

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:34.147
the company is
under his control.

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.851
So starting there feels right.

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.618
Hopefully we're not wrong.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.232
With these two code keys,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.635
all of SOL Tech is now mine!

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.910
(sighs)

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:19.126
(Soltis)
ID verification complete.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.563
Employee number SOL-80803:

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.064
Director Hayami.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.433
Security Access Level Three.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.668
Permission granted
to enter facility.

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:32.906
Gee.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.941
Since when did
security get so tight?

00:04:41.415 --> 00:04:42.949
Uh... hello?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.918
Hellooo...?

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.219
This is weird.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.055
Where is everyone?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.923
(Operator)
Director,
why are you still here?

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.793
Haven't you read the email yet?

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.694
What email?

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.030
We're all kind
of stunned,

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:58.899
but SOL Tech is
givin' us all

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.535
three-years o' paid
vacation time!

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.236
Plus an all-expenses
paid trip

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.906
around the world not just
once, but twice!

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:08.242
The Soltis will do
all our work till we get back!

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.177
Doesn't this
sound suspicious?

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:12.646
Well, I say
when the sun is shining,

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:14.748
don't go looking
for the clouds!

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.016
Enjoy your vacay.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.684
See ya
on the beach!

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:18.652
(gasps)

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.856
This isn't good at all!

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.990
Not the teeny-tiniest bit.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:28.862
(Avatar)
Fireworks are the best!

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:29.930
Yeah!

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:35.102
Woo-hoo!

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.138
LINK VRAINS is back in business!

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:41.575
Now that Ai has
reopened LINK VRAINS,

00:05:42.276 --> 00:05:43.811
crowds are flooding in.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:44.912
I gotta admit

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:47.247
I'm not the least bit
surprised about that.

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.949
Duelists have been
chompin' at the bit

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.984
to get back in
since it shut down.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.820
But why would Ai
reopen LINK VRAINS?

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.856
(Kolter)
Huh.

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:57.958
Varis sent us a message.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.928
He says he want to see
you and Soulburner.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:03.697
I wonder if he wants
to talk about Ai?

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:04.931
Good question.

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:06.233
Let's find out.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.407
Why did you ask
to meet, Varis?

00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.041
You know why.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.076
(Soulburner)
Wild guess,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.878
is it about an Ignis
we all know?

00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:21.181
The Dark Ignis has begun
its war on humanity.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:22.717
What's that?

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.218
That's a tad over-dramatic,
don't ya think?

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:28.589
Today it used its code keys
to take over SOL Tech,

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.557
removing every
human employee

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.759
so that no one
would find out.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:35.429
Only those mindless
Soltis are left,

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:38.232
and they're under the control
of the Dark Ignis.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:41.268
(Soulburner)
If taking over SOL Tech
is Step 1,

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.471
then why is reopening
LINK VRAINS to everyone Step 2?

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.840
Unless, that is...

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:49.076
he's planning to pull a Bohman

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.411
and he's gonna absorb
the duelists there!

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:54.181
I don't think Ai's
the type who would do that.

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:57.718
What you think doesn't matter,
what matters is the truth.

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.954
And the truth points
to one inescapable conclusion:

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.791
The Dark Ignis
is evil.

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:05.459
I disagree.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.661
Either way we have
to find him.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.898
(Varis)
The Dark Ignis
is impossible to find now.

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:13.968
When it gained access
to SOL Tech's supercomputers,

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.703
it was able to encrypt
its traffic perfectly,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.939
making it impossible to trace.

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:21.442
I wouldn't be so sure
of that if I were you.

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:24.444
I think we're supposed
to go to LINK VRAINS.

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:27.114
Ai said he and I
would meet up again.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.783
So I think he'd leave
a trail for me to find.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.585
And that's why Ai
reopened LINK VRAINS.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:36.323
If so, then I too can follow
that trail to hunt it down.

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:38.091
I won't let you hurt him.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.794
You will not be able to stop me.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.430
We'll see about that, Varis.

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.632
This is getting us nowhere fast.

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.267
C'mon,

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.403
let's check out LINK VRAINS
and settle the rest later.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.470
Sure.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:02.983
Master Varis,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.852
shall I accompany you
in your search for the Ignis?

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.487
That won't be
necessary.

00:08:07.554 --> 00:08:09.823
In fact, I don't
need you anymore.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.991
You're free to go.

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:13.794
Free to go where,
Master?

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:16.163
You designed me to fight
against the Ignis,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.131
and that is all
I know to do.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.501
That's far from true.

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.836
That's what I primarily
programmed you to do,

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.772
but I gave you
intelligence.

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.940
So use it and live
your life.

00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:28.642
And do what?

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:31.379
That's for you to go
and figure out.

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:34.648
What you are asking
of me is very difficult.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:36.950
And it will only get tougher.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.553
Having to make
your own decisions all the time

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:41.322
can be a burden.

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:43.523
It comes with the territory.

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:50.497
See you around, Pandor.

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:55.135
If we split up,
we can cover more ground.

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:56.803
Gotcha!

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:06.112
(Roboppi)
I Link Summon!

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:09.349
Link 1 APPLIANCER
LAUNDRY DRAGON!

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.221
It summoned a new
Link Monster.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.923
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.793
Then your feelings
are right on the money.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:22.596
Get set, Roboppi!

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.732
I'm using my Skill!
Secret Cure!

00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:25.966
We both gain life points

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.569
equal to the attack points
of the monster I draw!

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:30.403
'Kay!
Here I go!

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.743
I drew ALTERGEIST MARIONETTER.

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.579
So we both get 1600 life points.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.617
I gotta admit
that was a smart move.

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:45.252
But I also gotta admit

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.721
that it's not gonna be
good enough to save ya!

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.356
No!

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.391
You don't have enough
life points to survive this!

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:52.692
Yup, that's correct!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.928
She's all washed up!

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:00.100
(gasps)

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:01.902
(The Sheperd)
Watch out!

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:07.775
Amazing!

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:08.909
I beat them!

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.712
I swept The Shepherd
an' Gore Gal!

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.282
An' now my rank's gonna
rocket way, way, way up!

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:16.683
An' every time I win,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.954
I'll keep growin' smarter
an' stronger, too!

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:22.789
Till I'm the best
in the universe!

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.761
(gasps)

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.230
That was so weird...

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.633
I saw pictures
in my head.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:35.502
Yeah... that's cause
you were dreamin'.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:37.537
What's dreaming,
Master?

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.741
It's seeing weird
pictures in your head.

00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:42.376
And that's
very good news

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:44.678
because it means you're
getting smarter.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.680
Wow, seriously?

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:47.381
Yeah.

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.249
So what did you
dream about?

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.452
Uh, lemme
think...

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:55.355
I remember being in space
an' I was floating around...

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:56.456
(gasps)

00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.292
An' then I felt
as powerful as a star

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:01.162
an' started glowing like one!

00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:02.128
You did?

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.932
But wait,
my dream got even cooler.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.835
'Cuz then I became a star!

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.070
And like melted
with the universe!

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:11.472
Oh really now!

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:13.307
Incredible!

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:14.241
Huh?

00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:15.943
That wasn't just a dream.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.677
It was a prophecy!

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.113
Back up.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.480
What's a prophecy?

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:21.848
Oh!

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.651
A prophecy, young one,

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:28.656
is when weird pictures
in your head reveal your future.

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.824
Your dream of becoming a star

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:33.660
has revealed
an extraordinary destiny:

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.163
One day you shall rule
over the whole universe!

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.502
For real, Master?

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.673
Am I gonna be strong
and smart enough

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:47.140
to rule over the universe?

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:48.608
Indeed.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.277
You will be more powerful

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:53.113
than a hundred packs
of pachyderms.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.816
The great and wise
Ai-stradamus has spoken!

00:11:57.651 --> 00:11:58.452
Whoa!

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:59.819
So cool!

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:01.555
That means...

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.690
I'll be stronger
than you, right?

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.425
Umm...

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.661
Yes, I guess...

00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:09.596
Yeaaaaaah!

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.898
That makes me
your Master!

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:15.135
And from now on, you
will be my apprentice!

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:17.370
Whoa, hold
your horses there, champ!

00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:18.238
Guess from now on,

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:20.341
I'll be the one
bossin' you around!

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:22.476
Nah... way too soon...

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.511
Why's it too soon?

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:25.345
Because.

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:26.747
Because...?

00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:29.717
Because trying to become
a master faster

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.319
would lead
to a master disaster!

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.556
But the prophecy means
I'm gonna be super strong.

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:38.558
That's true, but you still
have a long way to go.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.061
Then how am I gonna
get there, Master?

00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:43.030
(clears throat)

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.698
Before ruling
the universe,

00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:47.834
you must first learn
to rule something smaller.

00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:49.536
Cool, when do
I start?

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:52.540
We can begin the next phase
in your training right away,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.708
if you think
you're ready.

00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:56.377
I'm ready alright!

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.212
Good, 'cuz I built you this!

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:03.383
It's your own personal kingdom,
right here in LINK VRAINS!

00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:06.220
A kingdom
just for me?

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:08.288
All new top to bottom!

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:10.957
It even comes
with a 90-day warranty.

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.126
But don't go breakin'
anything on purpose.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.762
Oh boy!

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:16.429
I have my own kingdom!

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:19.332
I can't wait to go there
and start rulin' over it!

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.634
One more thing.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.136
I gotcha
somethin' else.
Huh?

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:24.371
A lil' housewarming gift.

00:13:25.206 --> 00:13:26.540
Oh.

00:13:26.606 --> 00:13:28.609
What is it? What is it?!

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:30.610
Oh just a thing.

00:13:31.244 --> 00:13:33.480
Now go take a little spin
around your kingdom!

00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:34.614
Enjoy yourself!

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:36.383
Right!

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.984
Oh thank you,
Master!

00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:40.988
But wait, my new kingdom
is inside LINK VRAINS.

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:42.323
If Playmaker
finds it,

00:13:42.456 --> 00:13:45.292
he'll pro'bly try an' take it
away from me, right?

00:13:45.393 --> 00:13:46.593
Then what happens?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.464
As the King, your top job
is to defend your territory.

00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:52.098
If any invaders
show up,

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.101
it's your duty
to protect it from them.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.969
I'll beat 'em
like a rug, Master!

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:57.237
I gotta go
rule now!

00:13:58.872 --> 00:13:59.272
(thud)

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:05.278
(screams)

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:18.725
Good bye, Roboppi.
And good luck.

00:14:20.528 --> 00:14:22.529
Where could my kingdom be?

00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:24.698
Oh!

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:27.000
There it is, there!

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.007
(laughs)

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:35.041
Yay!

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.343
Woo!

00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:37.845
Roboppi is happy!

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:39.013
(laughs)

00:14:39.213 --> 00:14:39.847
Oh.

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:40.614
Ah?

00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:42.817
Roboppi feels eyes on Roboppi.

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:44.718
(All)
Happy... happy...

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.487
(All)
Happy... happy...

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.289
(Roboppi)
Hey! Do you appliances
live here?

00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:51.458
(All)
We do! We do! We do!

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:53.827
Awesome, guys,

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:56.496
and do you know that
I'm gonna be your new ruler?

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.900
(All)
We do! We do!
We do! We do!

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.169
Then I order all of you
to have fun!

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:06.406
(All)
We do! We do! We do!

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.253
(sighs)

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:24.224
Was that island there before?

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:26.426
Better go check it out!

00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:32.098
(gasping)

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:33.233
(gasping)

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:34.034
Huh?

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.941
Hey, guys, what's the matter?

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:41.942
C'mon out!

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.444
Huh?

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:46.913
Hi there, Soulburner!

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.248
Roboppi,

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:50.917
what're you doing
on this tiny little island?

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.120
Tiny little island?

00:15:53.254 --> 00:15:56.123
This is my kingdom
an' I'm the ruler!

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:58.592
Wait, you rule
this place?

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:01.128
This place is only for
helpful appliances

00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:02.997
and since you're not
a helpful appliance,

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.764
you don't
belong here.

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:08.269
No trespassers allowed,
so go away, Soulburner!

00:16:08.636 --> 00:16:09.970
Sure, no prob.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.473
I'll just leave ya to play
on your playground,

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:14.775
but first I need
to track down Ai.

00:16:14.842 --> 00:16:15.909
Now, where is he?

00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:17.444
I'm the ruler
of this place

00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:19.613
and I'm not gonna answer
any of your questions!

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.482
(Soulburner)
We're not gonna hurt him,

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.117
we just wanna find out
why he's doin' all this.

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.420
(Roboppi)
Sounds like your problem,
not my problem.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.188
But my problem is you!

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:29.823
Ai told me
that in order to learn

00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:31.091
how to rule the universe,

00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:34.328
I have to start by defeating
invaders like you first!

00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:36.430
You ruling the universe?

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.330
Yeah, right!

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:40.834
You can believe me or not,
but it's a fact.

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.903
My Master said
that that is my prophecy,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.607
which is when the weird pictures
in my head tell my future!

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.009
And they said I have
been chosen to rule!

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.477
N' just
so y' know,

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:53.147
I keep growing stronger
and smarter all the time!

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:54.481
So, you better
leave now

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:55.816
or as the ruler
of this place

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:57.785
it's my job
to force you to leave!

00:16:58.152 --> 00:17:00.287
I'm not leaving, Roboppi,

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:03.057
not until you tell me
where Ai is hiding out, got it?

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:06.059
Then I'll do
what a ruler's gotta do,

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.227
let's duel!

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.397
You sure?

00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:12.399
Yeah, and if you beat me,

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:15.235
I'll tell you exactly where
you can find my Master.

00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:17.171
You're on.

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:18.838
I'm ready when you are.

00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.042
Great!

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:23.076
I'm all set!

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:24.711
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:28.549
(Kolter)
Playmaker!

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:30.750
Soulburner found Roboppi.

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.986
I'm sending you
the coordinates now.

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:44.565
So Roboppi's facing
that hothead Burnsie.

00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:46.066
This should be fun.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:49.469
Roboppi already took down
Gore Gal and The Shepherd,

00:17:49.536 --> 00:17:52.506
but Soulburner will be
his biggest test yet.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.407
Let's see if he's up for it.

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.143
I'm goin' first!

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.711
So check this out!

00:17:58.211 --> 00:17:59.680
To start off...

00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:02.616
I activate
this nifty field spell...

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:05.719
APPLIANCER ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD!

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.463
(All)
Wow!

00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:18.465
(All)
Wow!

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.934
When I activate this card,

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:23.270
I get to add
one APPLIANCER spell card

00:18:23.404 --> 00:18:25.238
that's in my deck to my hand.

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:30.777
Then I summon the electric
APPLIANCER SOCKETROLL!

00:18:33.647 --> 00:18:34.881
And this summon triggers

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:37.951
APPLIANCER COPYBOKKLE's
special ability!

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:41.121
When I have an APPLIANCER
on my field,

00:18:41.254 --> 00:18:43.924
like the one that's floatin'
right in front of me,

00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:47.394
I can summon COPYBOKKLE
straight from my hand.

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:50.264
And I say the more, the merrier!

00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:52.566
Come on out and join the party!

00:18:56.103 --> 00:18:59.273
My COPYBOKKLE is also
a master of disguise,

00:18:59.373 --> 00:19:02.209
so it can transform
into other another monster!

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:03.644
Watch this!

00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:05.512
I bet you can't
tell the difference!

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:11.351
And when I have
two SOCKETROLLS in play,

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:14.721
I get to summon a third
SOCKETROLL from my deck!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.558
Here it goes!

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:23.530
And with them,
I can Plug-In my circuit!

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:29.670
I Link Summon!

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:33.039
Link 2 APPLIANCER CELTOPUS!

00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:38.879
Then I'll use my last SOCKETROLL
to Link Summon

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:42.716
Link 1 APPLIANCER PROPELION!

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.825
And now the effect
of my Field Spell

00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:53.860
APPLIANCER ELECTRILYRICAL WORLD
activates!

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:06.206
Then once per turn...

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.609
after summoning
an APPLIANCER Link Monster,

00:20:08.676 --> 00:20:10.143
I can do this:

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.779
Get an APPLIANCER
from my graveyard!

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.214
And so I will!

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:17.684
Next up,
I play APPLIANCER REUSE!

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:18.685
Oh yeah!

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:24.324
Then instead of leaving
my APPLIANCER in the trash can,

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.159
I can use it again!

00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:30.530
I now resurrect
APPLIANCER SOCKETROLL!

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:33.567
And I'll use it
to Link Summon again!

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.771
The devourer of dust!

00:20:39.206 --> 00:20:42.275
Link 1 APPLIANCER VACCULEPHANT!

00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:51.118
Due to APPLIANCER REUSE's
additional effect,

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:52.819
when SOCKETROLL
leaves the field,

00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:55.789
it goes back to my deck
instead of the graveyard.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:01.628
Now I'll place
two cards facedown

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:03.196
and end my turn.

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:06.399
(Soulburner)
Man...

00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:07.935
He already summoned
three monsters

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:09.569
on his very first turn?

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:10.837
Huh!

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.574
I may not rule the universe yet,

00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:16.076
but so far,
I'm rulin' this duel!

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:20.280
(laughs)

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:34.461
