00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:05.272
Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.841
I found you Ignis.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.178
Be gone.

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:12.079
No!

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.413
(blasting)

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.748
Leave her alone!

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.684
Let's go!

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:18.919
Come on!

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.489
(Shephard)
You made a big mistake.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.326
No one has ever
escaped the Shepherd.

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:29.829
Ghost girl, get out of my way.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:35.835
You dare to trap me!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.908
That worked perfectly,
by the way I'm Blue girl.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:42.910
I owe you my life Blue girl,

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.278
or should I say. Sky

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.446
Huh?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.249
You actually helped
me ten years ago

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:53.620
or, to be more accurate, you
helped me by helping a girl

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.855
named Miyu.

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:56.423
Miyu?

00:00:56.423 --> 00:01:01.328
I'm her Ignis, and Miyu was
a victim of the lost incident

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.529
Is she okay?

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.564
Lightning infected
her with a virus,

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.167
putting her into a deep sleep.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.969
Why are you helping the Ignis?

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.539
You have no stakes
in this fight.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.141
Yeah I know,
but listen up,

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:15.743
if you're
on the wrong track

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.912
I kinda think it's
my responsibility

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:21.982
to put you back on the right
track, you are my big bro.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.351
Since you won't stop
getting in my way,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.855
I'll force you to
with a delicient duel.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.656
Let's do this Shepherd!

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.261
(upbeat dramatic music)

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.587
(Both)
Lets speed duel!

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.257
I'm going first

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.594
and I summon Drone
Corporal in attack mode.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.764
(drone beeping)

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:49.203
next, I'll place this card
face down and end my turn.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:52.039
You know, you had me
pretty fooled for a while.

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:55.743
(Emma)
I didn't know who you were
under that mask until.

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:57.144
Move, Emma.

00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:00.447
Until you called me Emma
instead of Ghost girl.

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:02.649
How did you know my real name?

00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:08.321
Well, I needed to know,
so I got to Sluthing.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:11.525
Pinned up a few contacts,
worked a few back channels,

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.527
hacked a dew databases, you know

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.729
a typical Saturday night for me,

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.230
And lo and behold,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.535
I uncovered the Shepherd's
identity: Kenneth Drayden.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.805
Also known as my half brother.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.642
So, were you ever going to
tell me the truth about us

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.477
big bro

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.011
Stop calling me that,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.381
you're not my sister
and you never will be.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.382
Ugh

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.118
You have no idea what
I have to live through,

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.787
our father, no, let
me take that back,

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:44.658
your father was
never there for me

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.993
the way he was there for you.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.798
(laughing)

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.805
That's not true.

00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:01.342
Enough, I'm not here to
chat, I'm here to duel.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.677
Ugh, fine,

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:05.579
I draw!

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:10.217
I'll start by activating my
trap card Infinite Impermanence.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.187
When I have no
cards on my field,

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.923
your monster loses all
its special abilities

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.457
until the end of the turn.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.061
Meaning I'm shutting
down your drone.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.763
You're shutting down nothing,

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:26.767
Drone Corporal has a special
ability that negates your trap

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.003
so you just wasted a card.

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.204
It may look that
way but you're wrong,

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.040
because when I
activate a trap card,

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:36.910
I'm allowed to summon Altergeist
Multifaker from my hand.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.779
Um, how sneaky.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:42.916
And my Multifaker has a
special ability of its own,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.285
it lets me summon
Altergeist Meluseek

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.621
from my deck in defence mode.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:52.692
I'll follow that up by summoning
Altergeist Marionetter,

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:58.065
and my Marionetter's
special ability activates

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.233
letting me take a
trap card from my deck

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:03.170
and place it face
down on my field.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.838
And it's not just any trap,

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.407
it's one I can
activate immediately.

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.444
What? A trap like
that doesn't exist.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:14.414
It does now, I activate
Altergeist Haunted Rock,

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.852
it sends an Altergeist in
my hand to the graveyard.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.254
I'm creating a circuit

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.124
that links the known
with the unknown.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:28.828
I set Altergeist Multifaker and
Meluseek in the link arrows.

00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.864
I link summon

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:33.934
Link 2 Altergeist Hexstia!

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.304
(groaning)

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.740
Since I sent my Meluseek
to the graveyard

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:44.278
in order to link summon, its
special ability activates,

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.948
which lets me get an Altergeist
monster from my deck.

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:50.283
Next step, Hexstia
uses its ability

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.620
to gain the attack points of
the Altergiest its linked to:

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.755
All 1600 of them.

00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:01.528
But I'm not done yet, cause
I still have my Marionetter.

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:05.899
It can send an Altergeist card
on my field to the graveyard

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:09.403
and then in exchange it
resurrects an Altergeist monster

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.673
straight to my field
like my tuner monster

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.342
Altergeist Fifinellag.

00:06:17.344 --> 00:06:21.382
And having a tuner means
I can synchro summon!

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:26.920
My level 2 Fifinellag tunes
with my level 4 Marionetter.

00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:34.361
Legendary spirits awake!

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:38.832
Rise from your eternal
slumber, break the barrier!

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.334
(laser sound)

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:41.468
This can't be.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:48.308
I synchro summon,
enter this existence

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.744
Altergiest Dragvirion!

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.979
(roaring)

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:00.721
I synchro summon,
enter this existence

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:03.224
Altergiest Dragvirion!

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:05.559
(roaring)

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.628
By summoning Dragvirion,

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:10.564
Hexstia is now linked
to a stronger monster,

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:13.000
so its own attack points rise.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:17.971
But only temporarily, I
activate my trap Capture Drone.

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:21.408
It negates your linked
monster special abilities

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.745
so its attack point will
drop right back down

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.713
Well I'm not cool with that,

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:29.984
I'll activate Hexstia's
additional ability

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.254
by tributing the Altergeist
next to its link,

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:36.923
it destroys your
Capture Drone. Bye bye.

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.660
But since Hexstia is no
longer linked to a monster,

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:44.131
its attack points drop,
just like you wanted.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.468
So not only did Hexstia
loses attack points,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:49.603
but you also lost
your synchro monster

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.773
which wouldn't be if you
just left my trap alone.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.042
I guess so,
but I didn't feel

00:07:55.042 --> 00:07:57.478
like letting you do
whatever you want,

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.814
and to quote you, this
lose is only temporary

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:04.284
because when I tribute
Dragvirion, its special ability

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:07.153
re-summons it back to my field,

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.858
and since I summoned it
next to Hexstia's link,

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:15.128
its attack points
leap back up to 3700.

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:17.698
See? I didn't waste anything,

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:20.734
while you wasted a
trap card, Shepherd.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.169
Ugh

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:26.540
Here it goes, Dragvirion
attack Drone Corporal!

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:29.709
(explosion)

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.146
with that drone out of the way,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.115
Shepherd has nothing on
his field to defend with

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:38.819
so when my Hexstia attacks
he'll run out of life points.

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.287
It was nice catching up

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.488
but I'm gonna have to cut

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:43.524
this little family
reunion of ours short.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:45.893
Hexstia, finish him!

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:50.130
Not so fast, I have
Drone Asteroid in my hand,

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:53.500
I can send this card to the
graveyard to stop your attack

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.203
so this duel isn't over.

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:59.639
I also get to
summon a drone token

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.676
for each monster on your field,

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:04.177
so I can summon two.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:10.250
Well now, I guess you missed
me a lot more than I thought.

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:13.254
Appears you don't want
this reunion to end.

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:16.022
You're right, I don't.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:16.957
Uh?

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.426
At least not with my defeat,

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:22.028
but it's a problem I
can remedy like this.

00:09:23.464 --> 00:09:26.900
Hey check this out, Ling
Freinsen's security cams

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:29.069
picked this up half an hour ago.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.840
Why is the Shepherd
chasing after Blue Gal?

00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:36.076
Because of this.

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:40.514
Aqua!

00:09:40.514 --> 00:09:42.849
Why does Blue
girl have an Ignis?

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:46.854
(Flame)
I think the more accurate
question is: how do we help her?

00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.923
Yeah, we can't let her
get zapped like Earth.

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:53.193
(upbeat music)

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:56.196
It's time to link
it to the Vrains!

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.170
(suspenseful music)

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:12.279
(Aqua)
I sense that
you're troubled Sky.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.547
Is everything okay?

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.350
It's about Miyu.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.418
(laughing)

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.022
It's just, I didn't know she
was in the Lost incident.

00:10:22.022 --> 00:10:23.858
I can't stop thinking
about how horrible

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:25.593
it must have been for her,

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:27.895
and how I couldn't
do anything to help.

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:30.130
But you did help, Sky,

00:10:30.197 --> 00:10:33.567
because you were
always in her heart.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.371
Miyu was never the best dualist

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:40.040
so she lost more than
her fair share of duals.

00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:42.910
And losing only made
the situation worse.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.878
It was so hard that
it would break even

00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:48.515
the strongest of spirits
but it never broke her,

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:50.184
because in that empty room,

00:10:50.184 --> 00:10:53.687
she still had one thing
that she could hold on to.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.089
And what was that?

00:10:55.122 --> 00:10:56.523
(Aqua)
It was hope.

00:10:56.557 --> 00:10:59.092
Hope that she would see
her best friend again.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.530
You, Sky, because you've
always inspired her.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.764
What!?

00:11:03.797 --> 00:11:05.799
But she's the one
who inspired me.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.901
See, for the longest time

00:11:07.935 --> 00:11:10.303
it was just me and my brother.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.906
Because we were
constantly on the move,

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:16.010
after a few cities I just
stopped trying to make friends

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:19.179
because it hurt too much
to keep saying goodbye.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:21.615
and before I knew
it I was all alone.

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:23.984
Until Miyu came along.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.754
She taught me that it
may hurt to say goodbye

00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:27.988
(laughing)

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.789
but it hurts more if
you never say hello.

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:33.193
And you taught
Miyu to be brave,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.263
especially in the most
difficult of times.

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:39.800
And as her Ignis, you
taught me that as well.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.803
So I will be brave and
stop Lightning's plan

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.105
to eliminate mankind.

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:46.573
You mind if I join you?

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:48.808
I would love your help

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:51.178
and I'm sure Miyu would as well.

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:52.513
(Shephard) It's my turn.

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.747
I draw.

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:56.650
I'll start by summoning
my Drone Carrier.

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:59.086
(whooshing)

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:02.889
And by doing so, I can
now forge my Circuit.

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:06.493
The summoning conditions
require two or more drones.

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:10.398
So, I set my Drone Carrier
and my two Drone Tokens

00:12:10.431 --> 00:12:12.099
and the Link Arrows.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.971
I linked summon Link Three
Battle Drone General!

00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:21.641
(aircraft engine revving }

00:12:21.675 --> 00:12:23.910
Battle Drone General
special ability

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:26.580
can revive a drone
from my graveyard

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:28.816
and summon it next to its link.

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:32.319
So my drone carrier
is back in action.

00:12:32.353 --> 00:12:34.254
(electric buzzing)

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:37.658
Then, my drone carriers
own ability activates

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:39.893
when its re-summoned
from the graveyard.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.862
I can resurrect another
drone from my graveyard.

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:44.197
Drone Corporal!

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.366
(electric buzzing)

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.635
Now that I've rebuilt my army,

00:12:48.669 --> 00:12:51.405
a million options
open before me.

00:12:51.472 --> 00:12:54.642
First, Battle Drone General
gives one of my drones

00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:57.178
the ability to
attack you directly.

00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.646
So, your life points
are no longer safe

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.549
from my drone carrier.

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:04.318
And whenever, my monster
attacks you directly,

00:13:04.385 --> 00:13:07.955
Battle Drone General can
tribute the monster to deal you

00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.558
damage equal to
its attack points.

00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:12.760
So, it's like taking
double the damage!

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.928
(Shephard)
It's much worse than that!

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:18.399
Attack Ghost Gal
directly, Drone Corporal!

00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:20.801
What, not Drone Carrier?

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:24.271
No, Drone Corporal has an
ability that lets it attack you

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.941
directly by cutting the
damage you take in half.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:31.378
But the you take when I
tribute it won't cut in half.

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.881
So, I'm dealing you
more overall damage

00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:35.382
than with my carrier.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:38.619
You know, I can hear
the smirk behind your mask

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:41.055
but I don't think
it's gonna last.

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.557
Because I can make
some moves as well.

00:13:43.557 --> 00:13:46.059
When you attack me
with your monster,

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:48.595
I'm allowed to summon
Altergeist Kunquery

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:50.731
and automatically
stop that attack.

00:13:50.764 --> 00:13:52.165
(Shephard)
What?

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:54.835
You heard me, an
Altergeist Kunquery

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.204
can also negate the
special abilities of one

00:13:57.204 --> 00:13:58.705
of your monsters,

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:02.109
so Battle Drone General's
abilities are grounded.

00:14:02.109 --> 00:14:03.844
(wooshing)

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:07.280
And your Drone Carrier can't
attack me directly anymore.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.783
(Shephard)
I was never
going to do that

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:10.017
in the first place.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.551
(gasping)

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:16.457
It's called misdirection,
I activate Drone Force Tuning.

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:19.293
If my drones didn't
deal you any damage

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:20.794
during battle this turn,

00:14:20.827 --> 00:14:24.298
I can use them to
synchro-summon immediately.

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:25.800
So you wanna synchro-summon

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:27.634
just like I did before, huh?

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.836
And you say we're not related.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.038
(upbeat music)

00:14:31.104 --> 00:14:32.439
But where I succeeded,
you're gonna fail.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:35.442
Because I have Altergeist
Hexstia's ability,

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:38.378
by destroying an altergeists
next to its link.

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:39.613
(wooshing)

00:14:39.613 --> 00:14:41.448
Your trap drone force
tuning is negated

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:42.950
and also destroyed.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.985
(Shephard)
It would be if
it wasn't for the fact that

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:48.555
drone force tuning is immune
to your special abilities.

00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:50.858
Since Hexstia's no longer
linked with a monster

00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:53.460
to power it up, its
attack points drop.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.495
(animated electric buzzing)

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:58.799
But since the monster I
got rid of was Dragvirion,

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:02.770
it re-summons itself from
the graveyard like last time.

00:15:02.837 --> 00:15:04.338
(electric buzzing)

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:08.508
And Hexstia's attack points
jump right back up to 3700.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:09.910
So no harm, no foul.

00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:13.046
(Shephard)
Oh, you're so wrong.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.717
Failing to stop my
synchro-summon will cost you.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.352
(grunting)

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.853
(explosion)

00:15:19.887 --> 00:15:20.787
(electric buzzing)

00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:22.556
My level two Drone Carrier two

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.025
with my level four
Drone Corporal!

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:28.696
Watch as I construct a
halo that rains a shower

00:15:28.696 --> 00:15:31.732
of fiery destruction
onto any target.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:36.736
I synchro-summoned Command
Drone Double Sniper!

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:38.371
(electric buzzing)

00:15:40.774 --> 00:15:45.212
I synchro summoned Command
Drone Double Sniper!

00:15:45.246 --> 00:15:47.381
(electric buzzing)

00:15:47.415 --> 00:15:52.285
Now Battle Drone General, attack
and destroy her Dragvirion.

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:54.421
If he destroys my Dragvirion,

00:15:54.455 --> 00:15:57.024
my Hexstia's gonna lose a
whole lot of attack points.

00:15:57.058 --> 00:15:58.926
And that'll crush
me in the long run.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.761
I have stop this attack.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:03.963
I activate Dragvirion's
special ability,

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:07.768
by returning Altergeist Kunquery
from my field to my hand.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.604
Your Battle Drone General's
attack is negated.

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:12.973
(whooshing)

00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:20.948
But since Kunquery's
no longer in play,

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.818
your Battle Drone General now
regains its special abilities.

00:16:24.852 --> 00:16:26.654
(Shephard)
Ah, how nice of you.

00:16:26.687 --> 00:16:29.423
You saved one monster
in exchange for another

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:30.991
that was holding me back.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:33.593
But that's not all
you've done to help me.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.428
Whenever you negate my attack,

00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:39.599
my Command Drone Double
Sniper gets one drone counter.

00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:43.904
And now, I activate
my skill, Drone Force!

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:45.572
That's just great.

00:16:45.606 --> 00:16:48.242
(Shephard)
One of your monsters loses
200 attack points,

00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:52.078
for each drone in my graveyard
until the end of the turn,

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:55.249
with my Link Monster
gains 200 attack points

00:16:55.282 --> 00:16:57.150
from each of those drones.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.753
Since you have five
drones in your graveyard,

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:03.657
my monster will lose,
1,000 of its attack points.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:05.326
(whooshing)

00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:07.561
(beeping)

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:09.496
(Shephard)
And my Battle Drone General

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.231
gains a thousand attack points.

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:13.033
(electric buzzing)

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.669
Now that your
Dragvirion is weaker,

00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:18.171
my double sniper can destroy it.

00:17:18.205 --> 00:17:20.507
But can doesn't mean you will,

00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.143
because I can negate
that attack by summoning

00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:26.479
Altergeist Kunquery,
in defence mode.

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.850
You should have worked
on your grammar.

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:31.819
(Shephard)
But by stopping my attack,

00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:34.354
my double sniper gets
another drone counter.

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.822
(soft metal grinding)

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.425
But now that I have
Kunquery back on my field,

00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.727
your Battle Drone General
loses its abilities.

00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:44.164
(Shephard)
Wrong, when double
sniper has two counters,

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:47.734
it can negate your Kunquery's
abilities and destroy it.

00:17:47.801 --> 00:17:49.035
Did I say, can?

00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:50.471
I meant it will.

00:17:50.471 --> 00:17:51.539
(booming)

00:17:51.572 --> 00:17:53.140
(Ghost Gal grunting)

00:17:53.174 --> 00:17:56.310
And as you've noticed,
you also take 1,000

00:17:56.344 --> 00:17:57.678
points of damage.

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:59.913
But Double Sniper
can do even more

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.383
when it has Drone
Counters on it.

00:18:02.383 --> 00:18:04.985
It not only gains the
ability to attack again,

00:18:05.052 --> 00:18:07.921
but it can also attack
you directly by lowering

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:10.090
the damage you take to a 1,000.

00:18:10.124 --> 00:18:14.061
(loud booming)
(screaming)

00:18:14.061 --> 00:18:15.462
And since I stopped you

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.831
from negating my
general's abilities,

00:18:17.898 --> 00:18:21.101
I can now use it to
tribute my Double Sniper

00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:24.205
and deal you damage equal
to its attack points.

00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:25.372
All 2,000!

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:26.540
(screaming)

00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:29.276
Which is exactly
what you have left.

00:18:30.311 --> 00:18:32.545
You lost, Ghost Gal!

00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:34.715
And since this was
a deletion duel,

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:37.618
I'm erasing your
account permanently,

00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:40.754
so that you can never log
in to LINK VRAINS again.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.990
(grunting)

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:45.793
(Ghost Gal)
Fine, a deal is a deal.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:47.227
But before you erase me,

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:48.895
can I share something with you?

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:50.597
(Shephard)
No, I don't even care

00:18:50.631 --> 00:18:52.733
to share the same
genes with you.

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:55.703
Sheesh, can you just
be chill for half a sec?

00:18:55.736 --> 00:18:56.970
(Shephard)
What?

00:18:57.037 --> 00:19:00.440
Our Dad, he got
really sick last year,

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:03.444
and well, in his final days,

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.979
he talked to me about
a lot of things.

00:19:06.013 --> 00:19:08.282
And he talked a lot about you.

00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:12.820
Emma, my one true regret
is that I never made a better

00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:15.889
effort to get to
know my Kenneth.

00:19:16.657 --> 00:19:19.126
To let him know that
I was proud of the man

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.694
he grew up to be.

00:19:20.728 --> 00:19:23.463
Can you promise me
to look after him?

00:19:24.531 --> 00:19:27.234
I swore to him that
day that I always would.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.970
(Shephard)
You think that story fixes
everything?

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.472
No, of course not.

00:19:31.505 --> 00:19:33.607
I just thought you'd
like to know, that's it.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.510
Now, c'mon hurry
up and delete me.

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:39.046
I got a dinner
reservation waiting.

00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:42.850
(suspenseful music)

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:43.851
Huh?

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:47.154
(suspenseful music)

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.023
(whooshing)

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:52.058
(suspenseful music)

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:57.564
(Soulburner)
Hey, ghost gal!

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.503
(Playmaker)
Did you see the shepherd
around here?

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.438
You just missed him.

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:05.672
Which way did he go?

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:08.142
'Cause he's on the hunt
for Blue Gal and Aqua.

00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:10.510
(Ai)
And we must do
what we can to help them.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.145
(Blue Gal)
We're fine guys.

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:14.781
(upbeat music)

00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.617
Aqua!

00:20:17.617 --> 00:20:19.787
(Aqua)
Ai, it's
great to see you!

00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:21.355
(Ai)
It's great to be seen.

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.690
(laughing)

00:20:23.724 --> 00:20:25.626
(Flame)
And what our
friend means to say is,

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:27.294
we're glad you're safe.

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:29.029
(Ai)
That's what I said Flame,

00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:31.799
just in fewer words because
I'm super efficient.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.167
You know, like, super,
super efficient.

00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.669
Now, that's a lot more words.

00:20:35.703 --> 00:20:38.439
Anyway, what are you doing
in Blue Gal's duel disc?

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:41.042
Sky, I know that
we can save everyone.

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:43.143
Both human and Ignis.

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:44.445
Then let's do it.

00:20:44.445 --> 00:20:46.313
Because if we don't
all come together,

00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:47.948
we'll all fall apart.

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:50.951
And that's not a world
I want to live in.

00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:53.286
(swooshing)

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:58.626
(upbeat music)

00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:01.861
With Aqua by my side,
I can upgrade my game.

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:03.897
(gasping)

00:21:03.931 --> 00:21:06.466
(upbeat music)

00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:10.904
So say goodbye to Blue Gal
and hello to Blue Maiden.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.272
Wow!

00:21:12.339 --> 00:21:13.440
Nice upgrade.

00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:16.042
It's been a long time since

00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:18.078
we fought as a team, Playmaker.

00:21:18.112 --> 00:21:19.112
I agree.

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:20.848
Let's make the most of it.

00:21:20.848 --> 00:21:24.217
Look at them, like,
they're one big happy family.

00:21:24.684 --> 00:21:25.886
Must be nice.

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.357
Let's fight together
to stop this war.

00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:31.192
(Ai)
Yeah!

00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:33.727
And save Jin from
Lightning's control.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.862
And save Miyu as well.

00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:36.730
(Aqua)
Right!

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.466
(Flame)
And let us not
forget to rebuild the Cyberse.

00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:41.568
That's on top of the list.

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:44.371
Let's go!
(Ai)
Yeah!

00:21:44.371 --> 00:21:46.439
(loud banging)
