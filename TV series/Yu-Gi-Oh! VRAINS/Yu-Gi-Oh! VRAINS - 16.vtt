Here are the schematics
Ghost Gal gave us

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.606
to SOL Technologies'
mainframe.

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.675
And the databank
with all the tasty info

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.811
is smack dab in the center.

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:13.847
(Yusaku)
It looks like a labyrinth.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.283
Yeah, it would take
weeks to months

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.451
to find the correct route.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.619
That is if Ghost Gal

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.788
didn't already
map it out for us.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:24.924
(beeping)

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:27.028
Well this shouldn't be
too difficult.

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:28.595
Aww, you jinxed it!

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.097
Now they're gonna
line it with traps

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.466
that'll melt the salsa
off a taco!

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.767
Yeah, maybe.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:34.835
I'll send in my probes

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.603
to do some
preliminary checks.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.105
And I'll stay here
where it's safe.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.606
Not that being
around Yusaku

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.408
is any guarantee
of that, of course.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:44.144
Should be done by the time
you're finished with school.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.146
And until then...

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.649
You'll have a chance
to see how Skye's doing.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.817
Yea, right.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.819

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.653

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.444
Perhaps the one who claims
to have the wherewithal

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.147
to know it all would know
of Skye's whereabouts.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.783
Nah, I haven't seen her.
No one has.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.885
She hasn't been
to school for days.

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:34.621
Seems Miss Perfect
is playing hooky.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.123

Smart as she is, though,
she won't miss a beat.

But, like, who am I
gonna copy off of now?

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.498
Speaking of, you do
last night's homework?

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.301
Where'd he go?
(grunting)

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.775
According to the logs,
Skye hasn't shown up

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.443
in LINK VRAINS either.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.145

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:03.483

can get close to her.

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.888
Must be a real hoot
to hang out with.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.524
(Yusaku)
Skye almost didn't wake up.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.493
I can't blame him
for overreacting.

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:13.794
I can!

True, but I find that logic

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.666

to familial relationships.

Apologies, Skye.

Akira ordered you
to remain at home

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.351
for an unspecified duration.

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.553

I wanted Akira to change

and he did.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.669
Except he became worse.

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:01.842
Well, he can't lock an angel
in this cage forever.

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.744
(beep and whoosh)

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:07.281
It's one thing to hack
into my company's mainframe.

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:10.217
It's another to give
Playmaker access to it.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.720
You've caused
irrevocable harm.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.189
You oughta relax before
you pop that vein.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.192
Akira, I know you should
never, ever trust me,

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.694
but trust me.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.463
(Akira)
Do you even listen
to yourself?

00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:24.264
What do we both want?

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.434
We want to know what happened
a decade ago to Playmaker.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.571
And that info's locked tight
in SOL Tech's databank.

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:32.339
I couldn't get past
the security,

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.907
and I don't think
it would look good

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.376
if you tried hacking
your own company.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.079
So let's give
Playmaker a chance.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:41.282
And if he triggers
the alarms, great!

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:43.450
Security will be busy
chasing him down

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.286
while we infiltrate
the databank ourselves.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.021
I say it's a win-win.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.925
So you had this all
figured out from the start.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.592
In fact,
I wouldn't be surprised

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.461
if you lost
to Playmaker on purpose.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.930
You can believe
whatever you want.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.465
Very well then.

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.400
We'll try it your way.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.903
Not that I have a choice,
but if it leads to learning

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.639
how SOL Technologies was
involved with Playmaker,

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.276
this is one time
when the ends may
justify the means.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:12.479
But don't make a habit
of this, Ghost Gal.

You wanna talk?

Because I see a role
for you in this too,

00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:28.662

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:17.691
and whoever's manning
SOL Technologies'
security feeds.

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.194
(Ai chuckling
Playmaker, you look like

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.762
you devolved into a lemur
with that tail.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.898
Or maybe it isn't a tail
and you haven't gotten

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.100
enough Fiber optic
in your coding!

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.704
Stay focused!
Ugh... fine.

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:32.239
Okay, Yusaku.

00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:34.874
Level off
in 5... 4...

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:37.844
3.. 2... mark!

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.516
When you hit a wall,
you're gonna turn right.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:45.118
This is the last
section of fraggers.

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.787
Once you're past them,
you can take a breather.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.362
Take the third left
and you're in the clear.

00:10:05.906 --> 00:10:07.607
Huh? What's that?!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.377
That wasn't
here before!

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:13.079
(Playmaker, thinking)
SOL Tech upgraded
their security.

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:14.848
But there's
no turning back now.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.583
Hold tight, guys!

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:19.386
I've just sent you
countermeasures!

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:22.256
(Kuriboh squeals)

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:24.124
Break hard right
and lose 'em now!

00:10:28.229 --> 00:10:31.198
(Ai)
You didn't lose 'em.
You found more!

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:33.133
(Ai yelping)

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:37.838
(Kuriboh squeals)

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.341
Just rapid fire
those Kuribohs next time!

00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:43.043
Can't! You only have
one Kuriboh left!

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.013
You really are
the worst programmer!

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:48.915
♪♪♪

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:01.328
Phew... Aww, glitch!

00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:07.667
(Kuriboh squeals)

00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:13.440
Way to break
through, Yusaku!

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:18.979
You're in the clear,
and I mean it this time.

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:22.482
You're almost
out of Area "A".

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:24.485
And that's A-okay!

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:27.487
After those rough patches,
it'll now be a breeze--

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:29.623
What-- Ahh!
That's no breeze!

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:31.124
That's a Data Storm!

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:40.000
How can there be
a Data Storm in here?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.501
That's the wrong question.

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:44.471
The question is,
how do we get past it?

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:48.441
Ohh!

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:54.581
The tether's severed!

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.982
Oh no!

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.186
(Playmaker straining)

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:09.997
(alarm blaring)

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.698
What?!
What's the alarm?

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:13.867
Sir, it seem
someone is hacking

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.236
into our company's
databank!

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:16.403
No!

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.704
(Operator A)
<i>I'll put it
on screen!</i>

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:20.340
It-- It can't be.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.975
That-- That's Playmaker!

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.913
(thinking)
There you are,
Playmaker.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.819
(thinking)
He's getting through
where I couldn't.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.055
He dare invade
my systems?

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:37.825
(growling and grunting)

00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.060
I will teach
that insipid intruder

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.829
to dare snoop
in my backyard!

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:44.164
Launch my AIs immediately!

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:50.871
We have guests.

00:12:50.871 --> 00:12:53.707
Unauthorized
entity detected.

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:56.710
Mark for deletion.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.313
It doesn't look like
I'll be able to evade them.

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.781
Initiate Speed Duel.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.785
What?! Two-on-one?
That's not fair!

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.486
Who programmed
you AIs to cheat?

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:08.755
Looks like you
were correct, Emma.

00:13:08.755 --> 00:13:12.626
It seems Playmaker
will serve as a useful
distraction for us.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:15.763
Told ya so, Akira.
(laughing)

00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:17.664
You good to go?
Yes.

00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:20.500
(both)
Let's link into the VRAINS!

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.404
(Ai)
C'mon, you two!
Play fair!

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.740
You're giving
AIs like me a bad name!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.775
Oh, I don't think
that's their fault.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.414
They're trying
to cut us off!

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:35.415
Step on it!

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.658
(Kitamura)
C'mon, c'mon!

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.760
Don't let Playmaker escape!

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.930
Oh, how could this happen
the first week on the job?

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.099
Seek optimal routes.
Surround and apprehend.

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:58.038
If the board discovers
that I let Playmaker

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:00.274
into SOL Technologies'
mainframe,

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:03.043
I'll have to move back in
with my mother!

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:06.213
(whimpers)

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:08.148
Ugh!

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:09.683
But wait...

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:13.186
If I defeat Playmaker...
Yes!

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.356
I'll transform this liability
into reliability!

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:19.126
I'll not only be the one
who captured that elusive Ignis,

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.028
but I'll also be the one
who programmed

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:23.063
the greatest AI duelists
in existence!

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.531
That's right!

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:27.968
Then comes the glory!
And a gold car!

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:29.436
For my gold garage!

00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:34.441
Mind movin'
outta the way?

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:35.775
Yeah, I'm talking
to you!

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:38.179
Move that
chartreuse caboose!

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:41.381
I doubt talking to it
will change its mind.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.851
Initiate Duel Mode.

00:14:43.851 --> 00:14:47.621
(Operator A)
<i>Chief Kitamura, the duel
is about to begin!</i>

00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.457
Listen up, children!

00:14:49.457 --> 00:14:51.992
If you lose this duel,
you're all fired!

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:55.062
But I know my AIs are
far superior to Playmaker.

00:14:55.062 --> 00:14:58.031
Time to Speed Duel!
Speed Duel!

00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:01.268
Proceeding first.
Selection.

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:03.570
Pay 500 life points.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.772
Summon Tentacluster
Darkwhip.

00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:12.078
Next optimal action.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.748
Activate
Machine Duplication.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:18.919
Action result: Summon
two Tentacluster Darkwhips

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.554
from deck.

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:23.690
(Kitamura)
My AI has everything
it needs to Link Summon!

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:31.231
Materializing circuit.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:34.768
Summoning conditions:
three Tentacluster monsters.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.237
Response: set three
Tentacluster Darkwhips

00:15:37.237 --> 00:15:41.742
in link arrows.

00:15:41.742 --> 00:15:43.777
Link Summon complete.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:47.280
Action result: Link 3
Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:15:48.916 --> 00:15:50.017
Yes!

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.885
That was the first-ever
Link Summon

00:15:51.885 --> 00:15:54.555
successfully performed
by an AI!

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:57.391
And it was my AI!
All mine!

00:15:57.391 --> 00:16:00.593
Funneling permutations
to optimal action.

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:04.431
Special ability
of Tentacluster Nautilus
prioritized.

00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:06.100
Summon Tentacluster
Drillworm

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.071
next to link
of Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:11.471
New optimal action:

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.307
Proceed with summon of second
Tentacluster Drillworm.

00:16:16.844 --> 00:16:18.812
By combining my genius

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:21.248
with the AI's
raw computing power,

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:23.617
Playmaker stands no chance!

00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:30.457
Analyze duel state.
Optimal action:

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:32.993
Special ability
of Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:36.163
Destroy monsters
next to its links.

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:38.466
Consequence:
Trigger special ability

00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:40.968
of Tentacluster Drillworm.

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:42.636
Consequence:
Opponent discards

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:45.405
random card from hand.

00:16:45.405 --> 00:16:48.609
Additional: If discarded card
is monster card,

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:51.178
one extra card
discarded from hand.

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.647
Confirmation:
Monster card discarded.

00:16:53.647 --> 00:16:56.116
Consequence:
Discard extra card.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:58.018
It wants to
destroy my hand.

00:16:58.018 --> 00:16:59.586
(Ai)
Not a bad strategy.

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:00.921
Wish it wasn't used
against us!

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.723
Well, for the first time
we agree, Ai.

00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:05.892
That's not true.
Is it?

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:09.997
Prior action: Destroyed
second Tentacluster Drillworm.

00:17:09.997 --> 00:17:13.934
Consequence: Opponent
discards additional
random card from hand.

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:16.337
Confirmation:
Monster card discarded.

00:17:16.337 --> 00:17:19.340
Consequence:
Discard extra card.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.042
Action: End turn.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.544
(Ai)
Good job, Playmaker.

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.212
You managed to lose
your entire hand

00:17:25.212 --> 00:17:27.214
before you even took
your first turn.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:28.983
So we can now agree
on a second thing.

00:17:28.983 --> 00:17:30.717
You're getting
your keister kicked

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.552
by a bunch
of zeroes and ones!

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.921
(Playmaker)
Well, I know someone
who's more zeroes than ones.

00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:38.692
It's my turn!
I draw!

00:17:48.502 --> 00:17:51.204
Thanks for keeping
the cats away.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:54.374
It makes things so much
easier for us to play.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.380
Action: Banish Tentacluster
Drillworm from graveyard.

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:05.452
Consequence:
Opponent discards

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:08.222
random card from hand.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:09.223
Ahh!

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:10.724
Additional consequence:

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:14.327
Re-summon Tentacluster
Drillworm from graveyard.

00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:18.499
Are your cards
made out of butter?

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:22.436
Is that why you can't
hold on to 'em?

00:18:22.436 --> 00:18:24.771
(chuckling)

00:18:27.308 --> 00:18:29.610
There's nothing you can do,
Playmaker!

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.444
You're outskilled
and outwitted!

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:37.117
Unh!
(Ai yelping)

00:18:40.454 --> 00:18:42.156
Who taught ya to drive?

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:45.959
Well, I can beat Playmaker
fair and square,

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.828
or I can also knock him
off his board

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:49.830
and wash him away
in the data stream.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.933
Either way, the end result
is a victory for me.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:55.803
And with that victory
I shall reap the rewards.

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:58.906
First will come the riches,
then the fame,

00:18:58.906 --> 00:19:01.342
and then VIP access
to the world!

00:19:01.342 --> 00:19:02.943
(giggling)

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:04.812
I am issuing a new directive

00:19:04.812 --> 00:19:07.013
to ensure your focus
will not sway.

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:09.182
all lunches are to be taken
on the weekend!

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:11.952
Scratch that!
There are no more weekends!

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:15.189
For you see, your sacrifices
will be the stepping stones

00:19:15.189 --> 00:19:16.656
to securing my triumphs,

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:19.226
and there cannot be
any risk for my rewards!

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.131
Ever think of signaling?

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:32.205
(Playmaker gasps)

00:19:32.205 --> 00:19:34.875
I leave LINK VRAINS for, like,
two and a half seconds

00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:36.477
and now duelists are robots?

00:19:36.477 --> 00:19:38.979
How did-- Blue Angel?

00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.449
A two-on-one duel?
Are you for real?

00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:42.483
That's so not cool.

00:19:42.483 --> 00:19:44.952
Well I'm here to
even up the odds!

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:47.354
Intruder determined
as hostile.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:50.190
Optimal action:
eliminate intruder.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.360
Go ahead and give it
your best shot.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.296
In the end,
you'll be seeing blue!

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:01.134
