since you didn't defeat Varis,
the tower's still growing.

So, like, why are we

During my duel with Varis,

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:38.959
when he used his skill,
a path opened up before him.

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.796
A path that looked just like
the Stardust Road.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.965
The Stardust Road?

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:46.066
Yeah.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.968
That phenomenon is so rare

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:50.403
that it only appears
in one place near the city,

in the water
by the cliffs.

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.440
So if Varis knows about it,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.909
he must be headquartered
in that area somewhere.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.811
Actual
logical thinking!

where we're going.

So you know
who we are.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.574
But we know
who you are, too.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.776
You're Dr. Kogami's son.

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:05.746
Yes.
The name's Roken.

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:08.048
Tell me where
he's hiding.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.084
I'm sure my father
would've introduced himself,

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.686
but my father's
in no condition

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:16.090
to offer his pleasantries,
as you can see.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.092
Yeah, guess not.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.528
Since I transferred his mind
to the digital realm,

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.597
his body is but
an empty shell.

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:26.767
However, he had no qualms
about leaving the physical world

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.336
if it was in order
to accomplish his mission.

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:33.240
The mission to save the world
by destroying his own creation,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.710
the Ignis... before
the Ignis destroys us.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:40.247
Or so you repeatedly claim
without offering up proof.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.249
I can't think of any reasons
to justify

00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:44.184
not only destroying Link VRAINS,

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:47.421
but also risking the lives
of countless duelists.

00:04:47.455 --> 00:04:48.589
Of course you don't,

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.891
because though you think
your life's been tough,

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.461
you've never had to make
a truly difficult decision.

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.296
But allow me
to enlighten you.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:58.265
My father is a brilliant man...

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:01.535
but know that he is
an even greater visionary.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.438
He could see the course of
the future better than anyone.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.140
That future...
was one full of strife,

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.908
of difficulty,
and of challenges

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.244
that mankind had
never faced before,

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.780
from miniscule
biological diseases

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.850
to grand extinction-level events
like asteroids.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.686
He felt that humans alone

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:20.754
could not stand up
to these challenges,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.790
that we would need help
to solve these global issues.

00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.459
That is why he decided to use

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.096
all of SOL Technologies'
resources to create the Ignis.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.865
Not just regular old AI
that simply followed orders,

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:33.333
but AI with free will.

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.801
And that free will...

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.603
will enable them
to think creatively

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.507
to help solve the problems
of today and tomorrow.

00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:42.342
And those solutions
would arrive much faster

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.311
than any human brain
could process.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.414
But to create this new AI
would be a challenge.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.583
How could my father create AI

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.819
that would be able to understand
humanity's challenges?

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.422
And that is when
he came up with a brilliant--

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:57.825
albeit controversial--
solution.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:00.127
He would have the Ignis
observe and learn

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.229
from actual
human counterparts--

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.064
but counterparts
still unsullied

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:06.533
by the many vagaries
of the world.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.201
They would learn
from children--

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.338
the six children
of the Lost Incident.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.574
By dueling
and facing challenges,

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:16.176
the Ignis could watch
and learn how each child

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.512
dealt with the same problem
differently.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:20.881
The child's approach
gave the Ignis insight

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.717
to think about problems
and solutions creatively.

00:06:23.818 --> 00:06:26.553
And by doing this it would help
to improve their programming.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:30.024
I know my father did this
with the best of intentions,

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:32.859
but still...
it didn't feel right.

00:06:32.893 --> 00:06:34.394
It didn't
sound right.

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.397
So I betrayed my father
and alerted the authorities,

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.733
bringing the experiments
to an end.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:42.069
So you were
the one responsible

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.737
for ending
the Lost Incident?

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.406
You were the one
who freed me?

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:47.374
Who freed all of us?

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:50.377
So what? You think he deserves
a lollypop or something?

00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.147
I don't deserve
a thing from anyone.

00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:55.983
Because letting you go free
was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.551
Is that so?

00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.020
To avoid
getting into trouble,

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:02.390
SOL Technologies
covered up the whole Incident

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.990
as if it never happened,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.793
shutting down
all of the research

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.461
and exiling my father.

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.496
But while they
covered everything up,

00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:12.666
it was not as if
they erased the Ignis.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.934
No, no, no.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:16.937
They were forgotten,
but they were not gone.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.806
(zapping)

00:07:18.906 --> 00:07:22.042
They continued to grow
and evolve and mature...

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.711
studying, learning, thinking.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.381
They evolved so much
that they even created a world

00:07:27.448 --> 00:07:29.884
of their very own...
the Cyberse.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.886
♪♪♪

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:37.224
And from this new world...

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.793
came new monsters...

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.962
new cards.

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.965
And new Data Material
was also being created,

00:07:44.998 --> 00:07:46.800
feeding into the network...

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.603
so much data that they
even formed Data Storms.

00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:53.073
And with more data,
the greater Link VRAINS grew...

00:07:53.107 --> 00:07:55.142
and so did
SOL Technologies' profits.

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:58.446
The network was expanding
like never before.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.148
It was exactly as everyone hoped
when they created the Ignis--

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.684
that they would work together

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:09.323
and help humanity achieve
a new level of prosperity.

00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:12.993
Everyone was celebrating an age
of digital innovation.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:14.728
Except for my father.

00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:18.198
While everyone was celebrating,
my father was not.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:22.035
Because he knew that when things
seem too good to be true,

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:23.637
they usually are.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.807
Like I said,
my father was a visionary.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.176
He could see things
that others could not.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.212
He felt that the Ignis
were evolving too quickly,

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:35.649
quicker than even he
imagined to ever be possible.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.018
So he ran
millions of simulations

00:08:38.118 --> 00:08:40.521

All the simulations
reach the same conclusion.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.042
The extinction of mankind?
Yes.

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:03.777
But I thought you
had created the Ignis

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.446
to help solve all of
humanity's problems.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.216
I did, but as
the Ignis evolve,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.284

that they will start thinking

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.187
differently than they do now,

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:16.090
eventually hitting
a critical decision point.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.058
A point where the Ignis
will think that instead

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.427
of solving mankind's
problems...

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.130
it will be easier

mankind itself.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.670

exponentially faster,

the decision point
is fast approaching.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:37.044
We must eliminate the Ignis
before they eliminate us.

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.079
But if we try
to erase them,

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:41.281
they'll fight back

Varis, perhaps
you are correct.

But based on the conclusion
of the simulations,

00:09:50.023 --> 00:09:51.592
do we have a choice?

I understand, Father.
I will help you.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.237
By discarding a card
from my hand,

00:16:43.304 --> 00:16:45.439
I can activate Linkslayer's
special ability

00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:48.975
to destroy one of your
spell or trap cards.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:52.479
That means your Mirror Force
will be no more,

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:55.015
leaving you nothing
to defend yourself with.

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:56.116
Here I go!

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.151
I discard my Latency!

00:16:59.754 --> 00:17:02.857
Linkslayer!
Destroy his Mirror Force!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:03.857
(growling)

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.191
Hyah!

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:08.762
Linkslayer!

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:11.097
Destroy his Mirror Force!

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:14.101
Heh. Why, thank you.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.970
You did exactly
what I wanted.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:20.040
You triggered my Mirror Force
Launcher's effect!

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.176
When this trap card
is destroyed

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.911
while it's facedown
on my field,

00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:25.913
I can put it back
right where it was

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:27.881
as if you did
nothing at all!

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.550
What?
Mirror Force
Launcher?

00:17:30.584 --> 00:17:33.154
Nooo!
I was off by a word!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.822
And that one word
makes all the difference,

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:38.359
because Mirror Force
Launcher's effect allows me

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.894
to place Mirror Force
facedown on my field

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:43.229
and use it this turn,
if I wish.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.565
So instead of
destroying Mirror Force,

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:46.766
I've allowed him to play it.

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.970
Yup. Smooth as sandpaper,
Playmaker.

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.139
But what's done is done.

00:17:52.206 --> 00:17:54.207
There's no point
in dwelling on it.

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:56.743
I summon Rom Cloudia!

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:02.049
Rom Cloudia's special ability
allows me to retrieve a Cyberse

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:05.119
from my graveyard--
specifically, this one.

00:18:05.219 --> 00:18:06.487
Latency!

00:18:06.587 --> 00:18:09.089
And when this card
is added to my hand,

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:11.625
I can then automatically
summon it to the field!

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:18.265
This gives me the two monsters
I need to create my circuit!

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.233
(zapping)

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.437
I Link Summon
Link 2 Restoration Point Guard!

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:30.377
Since I used Latency to Link
Summon Restoration Point Guard,

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.947
I get to draw one card
from my deck.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.949
I draw!

00:18:34.982 --> 00:18:36.550
Um... you know
Link Monsters

00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:38.552
can only be summoned
in attack mode right?

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:41.288
And Mirror Force destroys
monsters in attack mode.

00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:42.989
I'm not saying you don't know
what you're doing,

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:44.758
but I'm saying you don't
know what you're doing.

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:45.992
You're wrong!

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.796
I know precisely
what I'm doing!

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:50.564
In order to Link Summon...

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.134
I need to set at least two
Cyberse monsters

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:55.202
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:59.139
I Link Summon
Link 3 Excode Talker!

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:02.175
Hyaagh!

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:07.214
Since I summoned Excode Talker
in my Extra Monster Zone,

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.884
it can block one of
your Main Monster Zones!

00:19:09.984 --> 00:19:12.018
Go! Grasp Zone!

00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:15.322
Arrgh!

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:19.827
Umm, not exactly
helpful.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.129
Why are you focusing
on his Monster Zones

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:23.830
when his trap
is the problem?

00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:27.301
His Mirror Force will destroy
Excode Talker if you attack!

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:30.003
Then it's clear
you won't like this.

00:19:30.037 --> 00:19:34.175
Excode Talker!
Attack Varis directly!

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.143
Screeeeam!

00:19:36.176 --> 00:19:39.046
Well, that's not
the move I'd make.

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:41.882
But that's why you're
not as great as me...

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:43.283
and never will be!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.853
I activate my trap
Mirror Force!

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:49.957
Your Excode Talker
is instantly pulverized.

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:51.458
Farewell.

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:53.894
(zapping)

00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:56.530
Well, perhaps
you aren't as great

00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:58.865
as you think you are,
Varis.

00:19:58.965 --> 00:20:01.468
By destroying Excode Talker,

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:02.502
you've allowed me
to resurrect

00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:05.438
Restoration Point Guard
from my graveyard!

00:20:08.508 --> 00:20:10.677
You're bragging about
summoning a monster

00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:13.180
that's weaker than the one
you already had?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.882
Without Excode Talker,
my Monster Zone

00:20:15.982 --> 00:20:17.717
is no longer blocked.

00:20:17.817 --> 00:20:19.353
That's true.

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.889
But you no longer have Mirror
Force to stop my second attack!

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.332
All that work to deal a paltry
1,000 points of damage.

00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:34.768
Damage is still damage.
And it'll add up.

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.304
Ah, but not quickly enough.

00:20:37.338 --> 00:20:39.639
You may have dealt
the opening blow,

00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:42.109
but I will
deal the final one!

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:43.276
♪♪♪
