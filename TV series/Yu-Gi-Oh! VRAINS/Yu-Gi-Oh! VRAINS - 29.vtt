WEBVTT

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:09.009
Kolter's Khronicles:
File number 1007.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.744
I started this log
thinkin' it'll make

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:12.646
a great novel someday,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.449
but now I'm not so sure
I'll survive 'til then.

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.485
The Hanoi have expanded their
reach beyond the boundaries

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:19.786
of LINK VRAINS,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.755
hurting duelists
in the real world.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.991
And just when we think
we find a lead to stoppin' em,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.461
another new mystery pops up.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.498
I gotta take a breather and
figure out what we know so far.

00:00:30.598 --> 00:00:33.200
Maybe that'll let me see
the forest from the trees,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.770
or else I'll get lost
in these woods forever.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.307
♪♪♪

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.702
What better place to start
than... well, the start.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:45.072
It all began ten years ago
with the Lost Incident.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.707
Six children were taken
from their homes...

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.511
including my brother Jin

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.313
and Yusaku.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.683
(Yusaku)
Unh... Where am I?

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:59.553
(Kolter)
Each child was locked away
in an empty room

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.755
except for a VR headset.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.625
Ya know, most people log in
to virtual reality

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.260
to have a good time,

00:02:06.327 --> 00:02:08.128
but it was the opposite
for them.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.432
They were forced to duel
over and over.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.000
We still don't know why.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.569
But they had to win,
or else.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:16.870
(game voice)
You lose!

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:19.873
(pained grunts)

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.076
The only things they were
allowed to do

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.411
were eat, sleep, and duel.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.081
That's it.
Day in, day out.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.750
Eat, sleep, and duel.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:30.751
And if you lost...

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.220
(game voice)
You lose.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:36.156
(Kolter)
You lost out on the eat part.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.658
Sure the grub
wasn't that great,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.094
but grub's grub
when you're starving.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:43.097
(pained grunts)

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.000
They took this game that's
supposed to be fun for everyone

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.534
and twisted it.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.739
But then one day&amp;

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.142
(game voice)
Good, you never gave up.

00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:56.243
You may go home now.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.712
(Kolter)
It was over.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:04.685
After six long months,

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:07.188
the children
were finally rescued.

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:10.156
Well, physically rescued,
but emotionally?

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.793
My kid brother's
still not the same,

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.329
'cause some scars heal
quicker than others

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.065
and some
don't ever heal at all.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.800
But you get
two choices in life.

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:23.837
You can let your past break you,
or you can break your past.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.373
So when we learned that a group
of hackers known as

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:29.643
the Knights of Hanoi were
involved in the Lost Incident,

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.778
we teamed up
to take them down.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.518
Linkslayer attack!

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.554
Giga-Claw!
(screams)

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:45.358
Uh!

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.328
You dare to attack
the Knights of Hanoi?

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.229
You've made
a fatal mistake!

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.731
Once you cross us,
you're marked for life!

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:54.702
Good, then you'll be seeing
a lot more of me.

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:56.503
So you ought to
remember this face

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:57.437
or better yet...

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.341
My name:
It's Playmaker.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.913
(Kolter)
While we were
trackin' down the Hanoi,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.217
they were trackin' a rogue
AI known as an Ignis.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.619
What made it different from
other AI programs

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.054
was that it was self aware,

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:15.923
too self aware
if you ask me.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:17.057
Uh oh!

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:18.258
Feet do fail me now!

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.227
Oh wait,
I don't have feet.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.596
I found you, Ignis!

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.265
Or not!

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:26.966
No no no no no!
I'm trapped!

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.703
(Kolter)
We figured that if we could
capture the Ignis,

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:32.072
it'd save us the trouble
of finding the Hanoi

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.108
'cause they'd come
looking for us.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.676
(panicked flee)

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:39.513
If the AI took the bait...

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.248
it'll come straight here!

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.088
(sighs)

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.123
(surprise reaction)
Oh...
Hello there.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.092
You must be the AI
everyone wants.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.261
(surprise reaction)
Where am I?

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:55.762
Inside my Duel Disk.

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:57.765
So I'm trapped in here?

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.232
Who are you clowns?

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:01.669
Clowns who rescued you
from the Knights of Hanoi.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.003
Why you!

00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:04.638
I'm sorry I called you
stupid ugly clowns.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:05.939
Let me go!

00:05:05.973 --> 00:05:08.309
(Kolter)
But that wasn't happenin'.

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:10.978
I have what you're
looking for right here.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.313
So if you don't
call off your attack,

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:14.648
you will regret it.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.852
Because I'll delete
this AI right now.

00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:19.920
W-w-w-w-what?

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.322
I've decided I don't
like you very much.

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.024
If you want this program,

00:05:24.124 --> 00:05:25.993
there's only one way
for you to get it.

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:27.995
By beating me in a duel.

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.329
(growl)

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:31.098
That Ignis is
as good as mine.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.535
(Ai)
Hey I've been looking
for your deck and woof!

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:37.137
You won't beat his dragon
with these cards.

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:38.906
Oh, is that so?

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.140
Then you had better hope

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.309
that your analysis
is incorrect.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.611
Or else you'll be
going home with him.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:48.015
Glitch, that'll be worse than
hanging out with you.

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:51.818
Okay then,
I'll even up the odds.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:54.120
Cyberse, generate
new data material!

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.099
(electronic buzzer)

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:12.339
Interesting.
I've never felt such speed.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.209
Ready?

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.544
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:21.748
Now arise!
Cracking Dragon!

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.655
How do you like that,
Playmaker?

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.929
Whoa!

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.732
How could you be so dumb to
switch to the wave directly

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.734
in front of
the Data Storm?

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.569
(laughing)

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:45.372
(screaming)

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.308
There are special monsters

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.343
that only live inside
the Data Storm.

00:06:49.377 --> 00:06:51.845
What do you mean,
special monsters?

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.713
Monsters that
you and only you

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:56.383
can summon with
your unique skill!

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:58.351
And the more intense
the storm,

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.153
the stronger the monster!

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.290
Which you'll need if you
wanna beat that hoodlum!

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.294
Your skill lets you
draw one random card

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:08.795
in the Data Storm

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.298
when you have a thousand
or fewer life points.

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:16.102
Seize the wind,
Playmaker!

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.610
You did it!
Go Storm Access!

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:30.951
I Link Summon!

00:07:30.984 --> 00:07:32.886
Link 3, Decode Talker!

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:46.733
Decode Talker!
Attack!

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.268
Decode Destruction!

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.811
Aaaaahhhh!

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.786
A thug like you has
no place in LINK VRAINS!

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:12.325
Since the Hanoi
wanted Ai so badly,

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:13.994
we wondered what secrets
he was hiding.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:16.229
Turns out hacking
his hard drive was tougher

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.532
than cooking
the perfect footlong.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.701
But we did crack
one video file

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.836
and, man, was it a doozy.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.011
Hey, that's Hanoi's
Cracking Dragon.

00:08:31.045 --> 00:08:33.848
It appears Ai's faced
the Hanoi before.

00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:36.617
And it looks like the dragon
is attacking that world.

00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:38.618
What is this place?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.291
(Kolter)
Who's that?

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:49.029
Whoa, bro!

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:51.565
There you are, Ignis!

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.802
Kolter, shut down
the power!

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:57.170
Quick!
On it.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.107
(grunts)

00:09:12.887 --> 00:09:15.088
(gasping)

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:45.585
(breathing heavily)

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:47.721
Are you okay?

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:49.423
I saw him.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:50.558
Saw who?

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:52.593
The guy we saw
in Ai's memories.

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:55.729
So like do ya think
he was tracking us down?

00:09:55.763 --> 00:09:57.230
Seems so.

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:02.102
Ai, who was that
in the video?

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.538
I unmuted you.

00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:06.873
So I strongly recommend
that you stop pretending

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.175
that you can't talk.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:10.744
I could just hack into
your source code again.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.245
All right, all right!

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.181
I'll talk you
crazy flesh beast!

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.750
But a lot o' my memories have
been lost or damaged.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.186
I was lucky to escape
with any memory circuits

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:21.688
after that dragon
accosted me!

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.723
So who is the guy
in the video?

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.692
That was Varis.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:28.028
And who exactly
is Varis?

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:30.031
Ya know your buddies,
the Knights of Hanoi?

00:10:30.097 --> 00:10:31.398
He's their alpha dog!

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.267
Hold on, you mean
their leader?

00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:35.735
You should see
the look on your faces!

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.238
Goofy as ever!

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:39.573
But as to who what when
where why he attacked?

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.575
Well, I don't remember.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:44.244
Except who!
'Cause who's me!

00:10:44.345 --> 00:10:45.679
He's the one I want.

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:51.251
Learning that Varis was
the leader of the Hanoi

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:52.385
was one thing,

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.454
actually dueling him
was another.

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:02.262
Playmaker!

00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:04.665
This is where you
will crash and burn!

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:07.301
As you already know,
I can wield the incredible power

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:09.502
of the Data Storm
in the palm of my hand.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:17.143
These winds rage for me,
and me alone.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:29.189
I activate my skill!

00:11:31.592 --> 00:11:34.160
That's the monster
that I'm looking for!

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.263
Storm Access!

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.136
You're mine now.

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:43.804
I Link Summon!

00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:48.842
behold the power of Link 4,
Topologic Bomber Dragon

00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:51.645
Get your act together,
Playmaker!

00:11:51.745 --> 00:11:53.013
If I had sweat glands,

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:55.616
I'd be swamped waist deep
in AI juice!

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:59.086
Face the facts,
you're backed into a corner.

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:00.320
But you still got a way out!

00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:02.723
By using my skill?

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.724
Exactly!

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.475
Seize the wind,
Playmaker!

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:23.243
Go, Storm Access!

00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:30.885
You may have retrieved
the Link Monster,

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:33.186
but it's useless
if you can't summon it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.866
(Kolter)
A Speed Duel wasn't enough
to settle their fight,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.368
so they took their scrap
to the next level--

00:12:48.402 --> 00:12:49.703
a Master Duel!

00:12:49.736 --> 00:12:51.472
I Link Summon!

00:12:51.538 --> 00:12:52.873
Rise up!

00:12:54.208 --> 00:12:56.209
Link 4 Borreload Dragon!

00:13:02.783 --> 00:13:04.284
(roaring)

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:09.156
I know that dragon.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.625
It must be his
strongest monster!

00:13:14.227 --> 00:13:17.564
Though you technically still
have your Cyberse monsters,

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.300
they're not around
to help you.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.236
So you can't stop
Borreload Dragon

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:26.540
from attacking you
directly!

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:27.942
Now fire!

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:29.776
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.887
(screaming)

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:42.923
With that,
I end my turn.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.892
I draw!
Unh!

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.095
But it'll be my last draw

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:49.829
if I don't immediately
make a comeback.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.465
But what can I do
without my monsters?

00:13:55.803 --> 00:13:57.971
What's this?

00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:02.175
Uh, I sense the presence

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.711
of a new Cyberse monster
in my deck.

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.113
So if my gut is true,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.850
that means Varis failed
to truly erase the Cyberse!

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.853
Oh!
I'll prove it!

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.721
I Link Summon!

00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:17.824
Link 4
Firewall Dragon!

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:29.537
(Varis)
When Fire Prison no longer has
any Cyberses under lockdown,

00:14:29.637 --> 00:14:32.172
it's destroyed.

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.842
So when you used your
Cyberses to Link Summon,

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:38.011
you destroyed my prison
and summoned a new monster

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:39.713
at the same time.

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.184
Tempest Terahurtz!

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:50.790
Time for you to go kapow!
Grr!

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:55.528
(pained cry)

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:03.703
(Kolter)
We haven't seen Varis
since that duel,

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:06.907
and that worries me
more than eases my mind.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.209
'Cause you know he's up
to somethin'

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:12.846
and that something
can't be good.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:15.282
But at least we have a few
new allies on our side

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:17.251
who've stepped up
their game.

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.552
Like Gore.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:22.055
Mash up my circuit!

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.796
I'm now Link Summoning!

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:33.567
Link 4
Gouki The Master Ogre!

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.071
Grr!

00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:41.174
Next I activate
Master Ogre's ability!

00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:46.080
Once per turn, for each Gouki
that I return to my hand

00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:49.216
one of your monsters loses
their special abilities!

00:15:49.249 --> 00:15:53.954
And I'm subbing out two!

00:15:54.054 --> 00:15:57.791
So your Helixx Necro Darwin
has its feathers plucked!

00:15:57.891 --> 00:16:01.495
And Helixx Gothiclone ain't
lookin' too good either!

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.330
No!

00:16:03.364 --> 00:16:04.865
Then what do you say
we get to tearin' down

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:06.700
those jobbers one by one!

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.970
Go and drop kick Necro
Darwin into next week!

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:19.579
(pained scream)

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.816
And next and last.

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:26.086
Carve up Helixx Gothiclone
and end this duel!

00:16:30.124 --> 00:16:32.025
(growling)

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:37.530
(pained scream falling)

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.975
(Kolter)
And Blue Angel's doin'
her thing too.

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:52.646
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.951
Huh?

00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:01.054
The summoning conditions require
at least two Trickstars.

00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:02.723
And I have three!

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:06.560
I set Trickstars Narkissus,
Mandrake, and Holly Angel

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.562
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:10.564
Link the circuit!

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:15.469
I Link Summon Link 4
Trickstar Bella Madonna!

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.905
(screaming)

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:20.541
Unh!

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.010
Well, Bella,
what say we end this duel.

00:17:23.043 --> 00:17:26.313
Destroy Dark Mummy
Surgical Forceps!

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.582
Scimitar Stream!

00:17:34.354 --> 00:17:36.089
(announcer)
Gee-Gee!

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.826
No one's clipping Blue Angel's
wings this day!

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.095
(Kolter)
When I first thought
of bustin' up the Hanoi,

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:42.562
I never thought
I'd be teaming up

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:45.532
with a fez-wearing wrestler
and a blue-haired pop star,

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.002
but hey,
whatever works, works.

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:49.870
And Yusaku will
never admit it,

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.706
but I'm sure he doesn't
not not hate it.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.875
But his primary MO
is to go solo.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:56.877
Now!

00:17:56.977 --> 00:17:59.045
I create
the ultimate circuit!

00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.550
Link Arrows authorized!

00:18:02.616 --> 00:18:04.451
The summoning conditions
are three monsters.

00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.987
So I set two
Motor Worm Tokens

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:10.056
and Cyberse Wizard
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:13.627
I Link Summon!

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:18.231
Link 3 Powercode Talker!

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.967
(roaring)

00:18:24.304 --> 00:18:26.540
Go! Power Smash!

00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:28.742
(roaring)

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.952
(Kolter)
We took out three
of Varis's top lieutenants,

00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:41.455
but I doubt
that'll slow him down.

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:43.991
And what if the Hanoi
aren't the only ones

00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:46.226
working against us?

00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:48.396
So like a hot dog
without toppings,

00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:49.797
things could be better,

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.131
but it could be
a whole lot worse.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:54.635
'Cause if every duel gets me
closer to saving Jin,

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:56.871
then bring on the slings
and arrows.

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.438
Even though we've
already been battling

00:18:58.538 --> 00:19:00.240
the Knights of Hanoi
for years,

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:01.842
this war is only beginning.

00:19:01.942 --> 00:19:04.311
And one thing
I know for sure

00:19:04.344 --> 00:19:06.213
those thugs may have
started the fight,

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:08.014
but Yusaku and I
will end it.

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:10.217
(sighs)

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:16.790
Jin.

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:18.024
(knock on door)

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:20.895
Who's there?

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:23.630
Hey, still up?

00:19:23.697 --> 00:19:25.365
It's kinda late
even for you.

00:19:25.466 --> 00:19:28.602
I just have way
too much on my mind.

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.005
Soo much that he
couldn't fall asleep.

00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:34.675
Even after buying
a Mr. Stuffybear
for snuggle time.

00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:36.443
That's enough.
Oh!

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.546
Anyway, that's why
you're here, right?

00:19:38.646 --> 00:19:40.714
'Cause Kolter tells
the best bedtime stories.

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.550
Nothing'll send you
to dreamland faster

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.518
than his thrilling tale
of combining different meats

00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:46.186
into the perfect
frankfurter.

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:49.189
I thought that
ten-parter was good.

00:19:49.223 --> 00:19:53.160
It wasn't, but that's
the least of my concerns.

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:56.329
I'm worried about what Varis's
next move might be.

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.871
The time is near.

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.708
The Tower of Hanoi
will soon be complete

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:11.645
and all of humanity will be
put to the ultimate test.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:16.216
