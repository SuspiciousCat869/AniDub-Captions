WEBVTT

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.971
(Frog)
Did they win?
I think they won!

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.005
They did!

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.406
And speakin' of winnin',

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.975
I wonder what awards we'll score
for getting' this scoop?!

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.244
You hit record, right?

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.282
(Ai)
Now that Windy's gone,

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.851
things should be a lot
less turbulent movin' forward.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.253
Yes, but this war
is far from won.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:23.323
That's one less
Ignis infecting our world,

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:26.427
but my strongest enemies
still lie ahead.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:29.429
Well Aqua, Soulburner's
handlin' his business,

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.997
let's go handle ours.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.696
(Aqua)
Blue Maiden,

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.398
now that Windy is
out of the picture,

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:39.833
the only ones left are
Lightning and Bohman.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.702
And if we can stop them,
we can bring this war to an end.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.538
I totally agree
with ya, Aqua

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.407
but we gotta find ‘em first.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.375
Yes, where could they be?

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.647
(Blue Maiden)
I don't know, Aqua.

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.316
They could be hiding anywhere

00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:58.318
and when I say anywhere,
I mean anywhere.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.555
Because if this world is
a mirror copy of LINK VRAINS,

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.124
there's more than a few corners
where they can be hiding.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.159
(Aqua)
So then let's start looking.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:18.705
(Announcer)
<i>Attention. LINK VRAINS</i>

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:21.475

<i>Please stand by...</i>

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.918
It feels like I've been
“standin' by ”

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:32.152
for hours and hours!

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.922
If I wanted to hang around
doin' nothing all day,

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:38.058
I coulda just

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:39.626

Do you have any idea
what's causing this, Ghost Gal?

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:54.307
(Blue Maiden)
Hey, Aqua. Check that out.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.310
That building doesn't exist
in LINK VRAINS,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.214
well, at least in
our version of LINK VRAINS.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.850
That's where Central Station
is supposed to be.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.851
(Aqua)
Let's take a
closer look then.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.229
(gasps)

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.062
(Bohman)
Ah.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:17.998
Welcome, Blue Maiden.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.532
Welcome, Aqua.

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:21.668
Bohman!

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.804
I was wondering
when you would show up.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.976
Ah, we're free again!

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.112
And back in the real
LINK VRAINS!

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:32.846
Wait, what?

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.348
(Pigeon)
Nah, we're still stuck
in the phony baloney one!

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:38.819
Cuz the real LINK VRAINS
doesn't have a that guy in it!

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.887
And look, Blue Maiden's
down there too!

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.557
Which means this throne zone's
gonna turn into an

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.992
all out danger dome!

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.794
So c'mon and hustle cuz
they're about to tussle!

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:48.895
Sure thing, Boss!

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.400
(Ai)
Ooh, the feed's
feedin' again!

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.172
You got this, Blue Maiden!
Take Bohman down!

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.276
Mirror world?

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.076
Yeah.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.047
It seems the Ignis created
their own copy of LINK VRAINS

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.783
and now it's
affecting this one.

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:11.418
I'm quite curious
as to why the Ignis

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:12.886
would go to all
of that trouble?

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:15.555
(Ghost Gal)
That's what Playmaker
and his crew went to check out.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.224
Well, not just Playmaker.

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:18.758
Varis went with him too.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.095
Is this a joke?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.131
Playmaker is working
with the Knights of Hanoi?

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.632
Strange times, huh?

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.501
Strange isn't
the word I'd--

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.502
(buzzing)

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:30.571
I'm getting a signal
from the mirror world.

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:32.572
Here, take a look
at this, Akira.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.243
Looks like your sis
caught up with Bohman.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:39.680
Blue Maiden, listen,

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:42.449
I know you're the one
who defeated my brother Harlin.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.919
And I may not be able
to get my brother back,

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.087
but I can get his revenge.

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:50.424
You don't realize the chain
reaction you started.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:52.225
After I eliminate you,

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.428
I will eliminate your friends,

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:56.897
and then eliminate
the rest of humanity.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.798
Bohman,

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.133
I know you lost so much...

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.468
but so have I.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.637
When Lightning
held me hostage,

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.506
I couldn't warn my friends
that he was going

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:07.141
to destroy the Cyberse.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.076
I lost my whole world.

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:13.247
The only way to stop this cycle
is to stop fighting between us

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:15.182
and to stop Lightning
as well.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.785
(Bohman)
That is one way
to end this war.

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.320
But there is another way.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.489
If I eliminate
every human in existence,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.791
there will be
no enemy left to fight

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.927
and that will
also end the war.

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.095
And I prefer this way more.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.700
Perhaps you believe
that you can stop me,

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:35.636
but I am not the weak
and confused AI

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:36.904
that I used to be...

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:38.939
because I have evolved.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.408
I have now become
the most perfect

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:43.777
and powerful lifeform
on this planet.

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.647
As such, it is my duty
to guide this world

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.615
and finally achieve peace.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.018
(Aqua)
It's not real peace
if you have to achieve it

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.786
by eliminating lives!

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.021
That's not true.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.990
Logically speaking,
peace is peace,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.757
regardless of the process.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.793
History says you're wrong.

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.864
Then allow me to be the first
in history to prove you wrong.

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:05.899
I have news for you, Bohman.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.902
After listening to you
drone on and on,

00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:12.005
I realized we actually
have something in common.

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:13.841
No, really...

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.376
and here it is:

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:17.577
You say that you've evolved.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.146
Well, so have I.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.915
Not that I'm all perfect
like you,

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:25.185
but I have changed
a lot over the years.

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:26.086
For instance,

00:06:26.387 --> 00:06:28.722
I used to be a shy
and awkward loner.

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.689
Which is cool,

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:32.559
but it took me forever
to make my first friend,

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.894
and even longer
to find all the friends

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.063
that I have now.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.430
Naturally then,

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.733
I value my friends a lot

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.701
and if you try
to take them from me

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.204
I will crush you!

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:47.741
<i>Aqua and I will give you
one last chance to back down!</i>

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.178
You and Aqua are
in no position

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:53.747
to demand anything from me,
Blue Maiden.

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.048
The fact is,

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:57.150
instead of throwing
around words,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.553
we should be settling this
with our cards!

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.288
You're on, then!

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:03.924
(both)
Let's duel!

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:09.162
A word of warning,
Blue Maiden.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.432
If Bohman has upgraded
his intellect,

00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:13.600
then he won't fall
for the same strategies

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.936
that worked in the past
including the ones we used

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.438
to win against Harlin.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:19.606
Well Aqua, that just
means we're gonna have

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:21.475
to create some
new strategies,

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:23.577
and we'll create them
together.

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:25.112
Here we go!

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.782
I'll start my turn by summoning
Marincess Sea Horse!

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.584
(giggles)

00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:35.923
Next up, I'll use her
to build my circuit!

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:39.326
I set Marincess Sea Horse
in the Link Arrow!

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.062
I Link Summon!

00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:43.430
Link 1

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.899
Marincess Blue Slug!

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.037
And due to Blue Slug's
special ability,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.306
I can retrieve Marincess
Sea Horse from my graveyard

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.809
and then use my
Sea Horse's ability

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:57.444
to summon her to the field!

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:01.281
Though you spoke
of using new strategies,

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.317
this is the exact same
set of moves

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.685
you used against Harlin.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:05.986
No, it's not.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.988
It's like, 97% the same.

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.357
But don't worry,
you'll see what's different.

00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.859
Now if these opening
moves aren't broke,

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:13.994
why fix them?

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.197
I'll use these two
to rebuild my circuit!

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.199
I now Link Summon!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.634
Link 2

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.336
Marincess Coral Anemone!

00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:28.509
My Coral Anemone
uses her special ability

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:32.146
to resurrect a Water Attribute
monster from my graveyard!

00:08:32.212 --> 00:08:34.381
So c'mon back,
Blue Slug!

00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:40.020
Now I can Link
Summon for a third time!

00:08:40.187 --> 00:08:42.489
I set Coral Anemone
and Blue Slug

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:44.458
in the Link Arrows
to Link Summon...

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:48.028
Link 3 Marincess
Marbled Rock!

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.200
Since I used Coral Anemone
to Link Summon,

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:55.302
her special ability
activates!

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.638
I get to take
a Marincess back...

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.306
from my graveyard!

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:02.009
Blue Maiden managed to summon
her strongest monster

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:03.410
on her very first turn.

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.513
(Ai)
Yeah, she's going all out
like a bear at a buffet!

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.350
I ‘ll place one card
facedown and end my turn.

00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:10.951
You're up, Bohman!

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:14.254
Now let's see
what you've got!

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:19.393
(Blue Maiden)
It's your turn, Bohman.

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.028
Not that we need
to remind you 'cause

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:22.596
you're so smart
and everything.

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:24.898
But don't forget that
when I dueled Harlin,

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.600
he played the same
deck as you.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.669
So I know how
your deck works.

00:09:29.503 --> 00:09:31.238
(Bohman)
But you don't know
everything!

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:32.072
(grunts)

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.774
Oh, we'll see.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.544
Since both our Main Monster
Zones are currently empty,

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:39.446
I'm allowed to
automatically summon

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:41.748
Hydradrive Booster
from my hand.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:47.287
And I shall use this Hydradrive
to generate my circuit!

00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.256
I Link Summon!

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.292
Link 1 Coolant Hydradrive!

00:09:54.962 --> 00:09:57.932
When you have a Water Attribute
monster on your field,

00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:00.201
Coolant Hydradrive
is allowed to attack

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.735
your life points directly.

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:05.071
So it would behoove me
to take full advantage

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:06.173
of this feature.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.242
I summon another
Hydradrive Booster

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:13.413
and use it to Link Summon
a second Coolant Hydradrive!

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:18.585
And since I summoned
it to my Main Monster Zone,

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.922
its Link Arrow points
to my Spell &amp; Trap Zone,

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:25.559
which in turn allows me
to activate a Link Spell!

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:26.893
A Link Spell?

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:27.928
This isn't good.

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.764
The same spell I used
to end the Cyberse.

00:10:30.764 --> 00:10:31.731
That's right!

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:35.202
I activate the Link Spell
Judgment Arrows!

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:37.838
That allows me to deal
even more damage,

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.340
but I'm not done
maximizing my attack output.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.746
I summon a third
Hydradrive Booster

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:49.683
and use it to Link Summon

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:52.052
a third Coolant Hydradrive!

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:54.187
Blue Maiden,
all three of his monsters

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.256
can attack our life
points directly!

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.592
Since they each have
a 1000 attack points,

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.627
that's 3000 points of damage!

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:01.929
No, it's more than that

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.830
because Bohman's
Judgment Arrows

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.366
will double the attack points

00:11:05.366 --> 00:11:07.501
of two of his
Coolant Hydradrives.

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.136
That adds up to...
(muttering)

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.605
game over! Ah!

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:15.442
(Aqua)
His monsters will deal us
5000 points of damage,

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:17.978
but we only have
4000 life points.

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.113
We won't survive
those attacks!

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.082
Then we better work
to figure out

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:23.483
a solution, Aqua.

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.152
Let's see...

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.154
I have Marbled Rock in play,

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:29.489
and her ability
lets me discard a Marincess

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:31.358
from my hand
to negate damage.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.660
And I happen to have three!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.528
One for each of
his Hydradrives.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.131
I wouldn't count us out yet!

00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:39.499
Really?

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.269
Because you can use your
Marbled Rock's ability

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.004
to prevent taking damage?

00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:46.072
Hold on,
you knew about that?

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:48.976
(Bohman)
I know everything!

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:51.979
Instead of attacking,
I'm using my Hydradrives

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:55.316
to Link Summon a new monster
you've never seen before!

00:11:55.683 --> 00:11:58.118
Awww, glitch!

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:02.489
I Link Summon...

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:06.693
Link 3 Cubed
Hydradrive Lord!

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.336
Bohman knew
Blue Maiden's plan,

00:12:16.536 --> 00:12:18.339
so he's trying
a different tactic.

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:21.809
Your strategy may have worked
against the old Bohman,

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:24.378
but in my current,
perfect incarnation

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:26.914
your tricks are quite
simple to figure out,

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:30.083
Blue Maiden, you should
have tried much harder.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.986
Yeah, well you made yourself
simpler to figure out too.

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:35.522
Cuz it's easier to deal
with one monster than three.

00:12:35.556 --> 00:12:37.725
It's not the quantity
that matters,

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:38.892
it's the quality.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.662
And Cubed Hydradrive
Lord possesses features

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:43.063
that are quite useful.

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:43.863
(grunts)

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.934
You see, Cubed
Hydradrive Lord

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.869
is an Earth
Attribute monster,

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:52.639
but due to its special ability
it gains two more Attributes,

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.207
Water and Fire.

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:00.714
So now it has
three Attributes?

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:01.649
Big deal.

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:03.316
Like, that's supposed
to scare me?

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:06.219
Perhaps not
in and of itself,

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:09.056
but my Cubed Hydradrive
Lord can also negate

00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:11.458
the special abilities of
all monsters it shares

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:12.659
an Attribute with.

00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:15.262
So since it's now
a Water monster,

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:17.898
your Marincess
loses its abilities!

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:23.303
That means we can't
stop him from dealing damage!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.773
Yes, that is exactly
what it means!

00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:29.709
Now Hydradrive Lord, attack
Marincess Marbled Rock!

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:34.781
And Judgment Arrows' effect
doubles its attack points!

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.488
(grunts)

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:44.158
Oh, no!

00:13:44.158 --> 00:13:45.960
That was less than good,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.995
but at least she still
has life points left.

00:13:47.995 --> 00:13:49.296
Yes, for now.

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.899
But knowing Bohman,
I suspect that this isn't

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:53.300
the last of his moves.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.069
He always has additional
strategies in mind.

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.404
(grunts)

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.140
Now that this attack
is complete,

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.176
Judgment Arrows'
effect ends,

00:14:02.176 --> 00:14:04.311
so Cubed Hydradrive
Lord's attack points

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:06.646
drop back down to 2300.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:10.484
Oh, and I hope you noticed
that I said “this ” attack,

00:14:10.484 --> 00:14:12.619
because there's
another one coming!

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:15.389
When it destroys a monster
with the same Attribute,

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:19.159
my Hydradrive Lord can
attack for a second time!

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:20.527
That's not good!

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.396
That'll take out the rest
of her life points!

00:14:22.663 --> 00:14:24.164
Well how about this!

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:27.768
I activate my trap card
Marincess Snow!

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:31.538
I get to Link Summon
a Marincess from my Extra Deck

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:35.142
that has fewer Link Arrows
than the one that you destroyed!

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:39.980
So feel the pulse of my
Marincess Crystal Heart!

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:50.991
(Blue Maiden)
Feel the pulse of my
Marincess Crystal Heart!

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.492
It's a Crystal Heart...?

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:58.899
That looks just like the one
Aqua gave to Earth.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:02.436
I know that this Crystal
Heart will help us

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:04.672
just as much as
it helped Earth.

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:06.339
(Blue Maiden)
That's right, Aqua.

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:09.209
Cuz Crystal Heart is immune
to all of your effects

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.878
and abilities, Bohman!

00:15:11.512 --> 00:15:13.713
That means Hydradrive
Lord's abilities

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:14.849
no longer work.

00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:15.882
Oh, yeah!

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.918
But Hydradrive Lord can still
attack and destroy it.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.389
Your monster has 0
attack points.

00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:26.059
While my Cubed
Hydradrive Lord has 2300!

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:29.229
So I can attack and shatter
your Crystal Heart!

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:32.399
Do you reall think I wouldn't
be prepared for that?

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:36.403
I activate Marincess Crystal
Heart's special ability!

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.839
By sending one Marincess
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:43.077
Crystal Heart can't be
destroyed in battle!

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:45.579
Plus I don't take any damage!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.587
Quite impressive.

00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:56.790
By using a monster that's not
in my mental database,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.259
I couldn't anticipate
your moves and prepare

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.194
a counterstrategy
in advance.

00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:05.332
However, it's only
a matter of time

00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:08.068
until I analyze
every facet of your card

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:10.003
and develop a proper counter.

00:16:10.504 --> 00:16:12.306
Well, guess what, Bohman,

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:15.075
there's a simple way
for me to counter that.

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:18.412
I'll just win this duel
before you do!

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:19.847
That's right, Skye.

00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:21.515
Don't let Bohman
intimidate you.

00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:22.783
I know you can win.

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:24.818
I know you will win
this duel and prove

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.488
Bohman wrong because that
is what you've always been

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:28.355
so good at.

00:16:28.755 --> 00:16:31.491
You've proven me wrong
more times than I can count.

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.526
I sheltered you 'cause
I thought you weren't ready

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.428
to face the realities
of the world.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.497
When in fact,

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:41.067
you were more ready than
I could ever possibly be.

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:43.637
All I ever did...

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.439
was hold you back.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:49.176
But all I'll ever do
from now on is hold you up!

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.978
I know you got this,
Blue Maiden.

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:54.782
As long as Blue Maiden
focuses on her strategy

00:16:54.782 --> 00:16:56.417
and doesn't let
Bohman intimidate her,

00:16:56.417 --> 00:16:57.785
she can win this duel.

00:16:58.152 --> 00:17:00.321
When a duel is this
evenly matched,

00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.856
it comes down
to who blinks first.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.193
Though you appear confident,
how confident will you be

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:08.728
when I show you
how powerful I truly am?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:16.370
Whatever Bohman did,
is affectin' this place too!

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:19.840
The whole mirror world
is destabilizing!

00:17:20.174 --> 00:17:22.209
It's not just
the mirror world.

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:26.513
The real LINK VRAINS
is goin' berserk too!

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.587
(crowd screaming)

00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:34.721
(Woman)
What's happening?

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:37.091
Whoa.

00:17:37.091 --> 00:17:38.159
Not flash!

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:38.892
Aah!

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.330
This whole world's
starting to break apart!

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.732
I gotta log outta here stat!

00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:49.536
Huh?

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.976
It says error code.

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:57.577
What's an error code?

00:17:58.045 --> 00:17:59.146
Does this mean...

00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:01.815
I can't log out of
LINK VRAINS?

00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:04.951
(Zaizen)
What? We're locked out
of our own systems?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.886
Yes, sir.
Someone's overwritten

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:10.257
our access protocols and
taken control of LINK VRAINS!

00:18:10.724 --> 00:18:11.825
Just great.

00:18:11.926 --> 00:18:14.461
I have become one
with LINK VRAINS,

00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:17.797
and LINK VRAINS has now
become one with me.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:22.435
(grunts)

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:24.938
So I now control
everything,

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:29.109
every program, every command,
every bit and byte.

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:33.880
And most importantly, I control
the fate of both our worlds.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.783
And your fate ends
in total defeat, Blue Maiden.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.586
We'll just see about that.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:41.488
Don't you get it?
I already have.

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:44.758
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:49.396
It's my turn!

00:18:51.565 --> 00:18:52.499
I draw!

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:53.633
Ha!

00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:55.402
Oh yeah!

00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:58.805
This is just the card I need
to put my plan in motion!

00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:01.107
I activate the Equip Spell,

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:03.844
Marincess Bubble Blast!

00:19:03.978 --> 00:19:06.313
And equip it
on my Crystal Heart!

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.548
Now each time
I summon a Marincess

00:19:08.548 --> 00:19:10.518
next to my Crystal
Heart's link,

00:19:10.518 --> 00:19:14.688
you take 500 points of damage
for every link that they have!

00:19:14.688 --> 00:19:17.157
But whenever I use
this effect, Bohman,

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:19.459
I'm not allowed
to attack that turn.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:22.529
Blue Maiden has changed
her strategy to deal damage

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.231
using effects
instead of attacks.

00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.800
(Ai)
But do you think
it will be effect-ive?

00:19:27.034 --> 00:19:30.104
Next I use Marincess
Sea Horse's special ability

00:19:30.104 --> 00:19:32.172
to automatically
summon her next to my

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.374
Crystal Heart's link
in attack mode!

00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:41.115
But since that Marincess
is a Water monster,

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.684
my Hydradrive Lord
negates its abilities.

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:46.487
I know.

00:19:46.987 --> 00:19:49.123
But by summoning her,
I triggered Marincess

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:50.490
Bubble Blast's effect!

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:53.560
You take 500 points
of damage for every link

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.029
that Crystal Heart has.

00:19:55.396 --> 00:19:58.199
And that... adds up
to a thousand points!

00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:59.900
Indeed it does.

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:02.869
But I'll take none
of that damage

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:05.005
when I activate
my trap card

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.007
Interference Canceller!

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.811
It reduces the damage I take
from card effects to 0.

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:14.881
And for every Link that my
Cubed Hydradrive Lord has,

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.983
I can use this trap again.

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:18.319
Oh no!

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:21.822
Since Cubed Hydradrive
Lord is a Link 3 monster,

00:20:21.822 --> 00:20:25.192
that means Bohman can stop
Bubble Blast two more times!

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:27.294
True, but try to
think of it differently.

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:28.062
Huh?

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:30.898
Don't just think of it
as two more times, Aqua.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.468
Try thinking of it
as only two more times.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.203
Because after that,
we can deal

00:20:36.203 --> 00:20:37.771
all the damage we want!

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:38.705
And then,

00:20:38.872 --> 00:20:40.173
we'll win this!

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:41.841
Aah!
