00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.638
(Ai)
Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.975
Link Vrains' security
cams picked this up

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.309
half an hour ago.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.778
Why is the Shepherd
chasing after Blue Gal?

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:13.613
(Yusei)
Because of this.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:15.749
Aqua!

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.184
(Flame)
How do we help her?

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.787
Yeah, we can't let her
get zapped like Earth.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.188
(majestic music)

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.292
It's time to link
into the brains.

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:27.260
(Yusei)
Hey, Ghost Gal.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.263
(Takeru)
Did you see
the Shepard around here?

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.764
You just missed him.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:31.998
Which way did he go?

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.468
'Cause he's on the hunt
for Blue Gal and Aqua.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.770
And we must do all
we can to help them.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.238
We're fine, guys.

00:00:39.473 --> 00:00:42.242
With Aqua by my side,
I can upgrade my game.

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:48.582
So say goodbye to Blue Gal
and hello to Blue Maiden.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.986
Let's fight together
to stop this war.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.153
Let's go!

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.454
(Ai)
Yeah!

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:03.196
(intro music)

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.722
Let's get to work, shall we?

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.126
(Earth)
What's going on?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.894
If it's any consolation,

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.465
you'll be helping with the
advancement of human technology.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:12.499
Now do it.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.567
Yes ma'am.

00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:16.570
Stop this.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.439
You can't do this to me.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:24.611
Good riddance.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.112
One fewer Ignis

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.415
means one fewer problem that

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.284
I have to deal
with in this world.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.253
But why did Sol Tech send
Gore after the Earth Ignis

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:34.655
instead of me?

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.089
I'm the one they're
supposed to call

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:38.392
when a job needs to get done.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:39.292
Hmph.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.595
He barely won even
with an upgrade.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.264
He used to be a loser.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:46.800
But now he's a loser with
an AI chip in his brain.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:50.204
A real bounty hunter would
eliminate his target,

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:54.307
not bring it back to Sol Tech
like some hunting trophy.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:57.911
And maybe that's why they
sent him instead of me.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:05.820
Here it is,

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:08.055
Sol Tech's data bank.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:12.058
I don't like it when people
try to keep secrets from me.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.793
Especially since
they should know

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.196
that it's pointless to even try.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:21.868
Now, let's see why Sol
Tech would want an Ignis.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.107
No.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.607
This can't be true.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.717
That's him.

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.787
Kenneth Drayton, sir.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.223
Also known by many
as the Sheperd.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.625
He's not only a first
class bounty hunter,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.229
but also an expert hacker.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:51.965
And someone who despises
AIs just as much as we do.

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.334
Maybe even more so.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.370
(Rokin)
Someone like that
could be very useful to us.

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:02.243
What's this?

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.177
Sky left me a note?

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:07.348
(Sky)
Hey Akira,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:08.949
just letting you know
I'll be out and about,

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.250
so don't wait up.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.718
After seeing what
happened to Earth,

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.954
I can't just sit
by and do nothing.

00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.625
I have to make sure something
like that never happens again.

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:19.226
One of us has to.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.427
Sky.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.428
Be careful.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.132
(Hiyami)
Stop, you can't
just barge in.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.033
(Sheperd)
Watch me.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.101
Sorry, chief.

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:30.203
I told him you were busy, but.

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:32.673
Zaizen always has time for me,

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.341
don't you, Zaizen?

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.509
I'm calling security.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.377
And you'll find they're
not as nice as me.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.579
(Akira)
It's fine, Hiyami.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.047
I'll take care of this.

00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:40.914
Kay.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.850
So Sheperd,

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:46.086
to what do I
owe this pleasure?

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.889
You've been holding
out on me, Zaizen.

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:50.224
What?

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.760
I was curious why
Sol Technologies

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:55.696
would move mountains
to capture an Ignis.

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:57.530
And I found out why.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:03.604
What's this?

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:05.105
(Sheperd)
Don't play dumb.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.408
I pulled these docs straight
off your company servers.

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:09.810
You're planning to use the data

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:11.845
you extracted from
the Earth Ignis

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:14.915
to create a new
generation of AIs.

00:05:14.915 --> 00:05:17.751
AIs so superior that
all the current ones

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.120
will seem like cavemen.

00:05:20.154 --> 00:05:23.256
Such advanced technology
will be a financial windfall

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.191
for Sol Tech.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:26.427
So that's the Queen's plan.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.662
You tricked me, Zaizen.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.832
I was told to hunt down the
Ignis to get rid of them,

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.835
not so you could create
more powerful ones.

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:39.006
You made me do the exact
opposite of what I wanted.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.407
Well yes, it seems so,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.610
but I knew nothing
about this.

00:05:42.643 --> 00:05:45.413
Ignorance is no
excuse, Zaizen.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.180
But now that you know,

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.182
what are you
going to do?

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.785
Are you going to
force your bosses

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.919
to shut down this project?

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.156
If you think I can tell
my bosses what to do,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.992
you must've never worked
in a corporate environment.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.829
Besides, I already tried
and they ignored me.

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:03.663
So my hands are tied.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.399
But mine aren't.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:08.368
And I'll handle
this my way.

00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:12.139
And next time Sol
Tech has a job for me,

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.207
don't call.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:18.012
It appears I'm not popular
with anyone these days.

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.081
But I wish they knew that
although my hands may be tied,

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.916
I still have a
seat at the table.

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:25.919
Some changes can only be
done from within Sol Tech,

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:27.988
and not from the
outside looking in.

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.699
Blue Maiden,

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:39.866
I've been thinking,

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.701
and well...

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.038
I know your brother works
for Sol Technologies,

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.672
so if you're helping me,

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:47.474
doesn't that mean you
two are fighting on

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:49.310
opposite sides?

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.644
I know it looks
like that,

00:06:50.644 --> 00:06:52.479
but he's actually
on our side.

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.348
Even though I
really do wish Akira

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.250
would try a bit harder
than he currently is.

00:06:57.317 --> 00:06:58.752
Oh.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.722
Because I'd hate myself
if I broke up your family.

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:04.325
Hey, you're not
breaking up anything.

00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:05.625
Besides, remember,

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.261
you didn't force me to help you.

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:09.162
I'm choosing to help you.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.097
So don't you worry,
we're good.

00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:11.965
Thanks.

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:15.769
Oh.

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.204
We're here.

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.472
So that's where
Lightning locked up Aqua.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.308
I wonder what he
put down for it.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.943
Let's check this place out,

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:25.111
and see if he left
any clues behind.

00:07:34.388 --> 00:07:36.723
Are you detecting
anything here, Ai?

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.925
Am I?

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.626
I can see particles at
the microscopic level,

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.228
so nothing gets past me.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:42.462
And...

00:07:42.496 --> 00:07:44.130
Nope, no, no, no
traces of nothing.

00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:46.300
Cleaner than a dentist's teeth.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.202
When Lightning doesn't
want to be found,

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.870
he makes sure not to be.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.271
For real.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.574
He covers his tracks
better than a Proxy server

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.709
hidden in
a railway tunnel.

00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.044
(Man)
Master Rokin,

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:58.912
despite our best efforts,

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:02.950
we still have no idea where
the Light Ignis is hiding.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.051
Of course not.

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:06.686
If the Light Ignis has half
the intelligence that I do,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.989
I would only make
my presence known

00:08:09.023 --> 00:08:12.125
when I'm absolutely
ready to attack.

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:15.129
That means it's imperative
that we find it beforehand.

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:18.632
I can double our search
parties if you so desire.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:21.835
No, I have another
idea to find the Ignis.

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.770
But if I want
to do it quickly,

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:25.506
I can't do it alone.

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:28.108
I need the skills of a
certain hacker to help me.

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:31.779
You mean the
Sheperd, Master Rokin?

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.214
I think it's time
we pay him a visit.

00:08:38.285 --> 00:08:40.454
I'll find the Ignis myself,

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:42.522
and crush them into oblivion.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.198
No one understands the pain
the AIs have put me through.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.102
Except maybe

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.537
her.

00:08:56.604 --> 00:08:58.338
No, not even her.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.775
I've never needed
anyone's help before.

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.576
And I don't need it now.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.777
Even from you,

00:09:04.712 --> 00:09:05.579
Varis.

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:10.117
I'm not here to
offer you my help.

00:09:10.184 --> 00:09:12.252
You're here
to help me, Sheperd.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.755
Or should I say Kenneth?

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.289
So,

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:18.359
you know who I am.

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:20.694
Oh, there's nothing
that I don't know.

00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:23.463
I know that AIs have put
your mother in the hospital.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.867
And I know you spent your
entire life erasing AIs.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.503
And of course, you know
that the Knights of Hanoi.

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.605
have no love for the Ignis.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:33.506
But here is what
you don't know.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.712
The Ignis have officially
declared war on all of humanity.

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:40.347
So it seems our
interests are aligned.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.917
And it's in your best interest
to join the Knights of Hanoi.

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:46.754
My best interest, aye?

00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:49.523
To be your minion and
follow your orders?

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:53.527
You must've mistaken this
lone wolf for a lap dog.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.463
Because even if our
goals are similar,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.066
the Sheperd takes
orders from no one.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.503
I'll fight the Ignis
on my own.

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:04.171
And if that helps you,

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.073
consider yourself lucky
that you're getting

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.709
my services for free.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.711
That doesn't work
for me, Sheperd.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:13.179
I don't need lone
wolves or freelancers

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:15.549
accidentally
messing up my plans,

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.752
especially when my
plan is sure fire.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.454
So you're going
to join me,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.222
whether you
like it or not.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:23.624
Or what?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.393
You don't
want to know.

00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:27.761
No, I do want to know.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.530
Or I wouldn't ask.

00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:31.398
And you should
know by now,

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.767
since you did all
that research already,

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:36.102
that I don't like
to be threatened.

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:40.107
So I'll give you until the count
of three to leave me alone,

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:42.909
before I erase you
from existence.

00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:45.512
One.

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:48.181
Two.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:55.389
I don't like being
sneaked up on.

00:10:55.422 --> 00:10:57.291
Firing on the
count of two,

00:10:57.358 --> 00:10:58.926
how sporting of you.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:02.162
But that type of ruthlessness
is why I want you to join me.

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.264
Unhand me.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:06.167
I was going to
let you off easy.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.069
But I guess that
plan's out the window.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.741
(dramatic music)

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:19.279
Let's see how tough you
Knights of Hanoi really are.

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:20.247
Let's duel.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.252
Allow me to make
the move, Shepherd.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:29.957
Huh, go right on ahead,
it doesn't matter to me.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.092
Very well.

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:36.630
I'll place this card face down
on my field and end my turn.

00:11:36.664 --> 00:11:37.598
That's it?

00:11:37.598 --> 00:11:39.499
Just one measly card?

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.103
You think that's
enough to stop me?

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:44.672
Well, we'll see,
won't we?

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:46.440
Yes we will.

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:51.077
I draw, first I summon
Duplicate Drone,

00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:54.348
then I activate
the special ability

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:57.418
of a second duplicate
drone from my hand

00:11:57.418 --> 00:12:00.087
If I already have a
Duplicate Drone in play

00:12:00.121 --> 00:12:02.155
I'm also allowed
to summon this one.

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.691
(mechanical beeps)

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.228
and I also get to summon
Scud Drone from my hand

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:10.998
when I have other drone
monsters on my field.

00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:14.367
(mechanical beeps)

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:16.804
You may have gotten
three monster quickly

00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:19.706
but none are
particularly powerful.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.843
They will be when
I forge them together

00:12:22.877 --> 00:12:27.213
I link summon link two
Battle Drone Warrant

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.549
(drone whirling)

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.918
(suspenseful music)

00:12:30.985 --> 00:12:32.353
(mechanical beeps)

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:35.989
And I'll use this new
monster to link summon again

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:40.160
I set Scud Drone and Battle
Drone Warrant to the link arrows

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:44.998
to link summon Link three
Battle Drone General!

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:47.334
(drone beeping)

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:51.305
Next, I activate battle
drone general special ability

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:55.075
to re-summon a drone from my
graveyard next to its link.

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.513
So Battle Drone Warrant
returns to this battle

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:03.216
and it has you in
its sight, attack!

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.886
(drone blasting)

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:07.087
Ugh!

00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.056
(mechanical beeps)

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:12.293
If my drone deals you
damage with a direct attack,

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:14.761
Battle Drone General
can tribute that drone

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:16.564
to deal you with
additional damage

00:13:16.597 --> 00:13:18.565
equal to its attack points,

00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:22.202
so it zaps away 1,200
more life points.

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:25.372
(mechanical beeps)

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:29.376
And since Battle Drone general
has 2,400 attack points

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:31.145
it can attack you directly

00:13:31.212 --> 00:13:34.648
and wipe out the rest
of your life points.

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.150
Finish him!

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:39.553
Do you actually think
that's going to work?

00:13:39.553 --> 00:13:40.721
What?

00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:43.324
Calm down Shepherd,
don't be a fool

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.592
you shouldn't group me

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:46.961
with every lame bounty
you've ever captured.

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.461
Ugh.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:52.099
Watch this, I activate
Checksum Dragon's ability.

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:54.268
If you attack my
life points directly

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:56.203
after you've already
dealt battle damage

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.071
to me earlier in the turn,

00:13:58.105 --> 00:14:00.941
I can summon this card
from my hand to protect me

00:14:00.975 --> 00:14:03.510
(mechanical beeps)

00:14:03.544 --> 00:14:06.013
I also regain life points equal

00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:08.682
to half of Checksum
Dragon's defence points.

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:10.016
(mechanical beeps)

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.952
Listening to the
tone of your voice

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.121
you sound like you did
something impressive

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:16.724
when all you did was
summon Cannon bother

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:19.059
for Battle Drone
General to destroy.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:20.794
(missiles exploding)

00:14:20.828 --> 00:14:23.730
(mechanical beeps)

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.002
It's still alive?

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.105
Will you look at that?

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:33.941
It seems I forgot to tell
you that Checksum Dragon

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:37.477
can't be destroyed
this turn, oops.

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:40.947
One good shot
deserves another,

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:45.219
I activate the spell card
Blitz Drone and end my turn

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:48.622
but by doing so that triggers
Battle Drone Warrant's

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:51.158
special ability
from my graveyard.

00:14:51.192 --> 00:14:53.827
When I end my turn and
there're no monsters

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.664
in my main monster zone,
Battle Drone Warrant

00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:58.699
re-summons itself
from my graveyard.

00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:00.901
(mechanical beeps)

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:05.506
And this move starts a combo
that wins me this duel.

00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:09.209
I activate Blitz Drone's
effect by tributing

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:13.079
Battle Drone Warrant you
take 1,200 points of damage.

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:16.783
And I only have
800 life points,

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.520
but I also have this card
that I placed face down

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.620
at the start of the duel

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:23.257
Uh, so what?

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.126
So this,
I activate my trap

00:15:26.193 --> 00:15:28.261
Imperial Order!

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:31.398
It negates the effects of
every one of your spells,

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:33.534
even the spell card
that you claimed

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:34.901
would bring you victory.

00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:37.538
Ugh.

00:15:37.571 --> 00:15:39.173
From one hunter to another,

00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:42.910
allow me to give you some
professional duelling advice,

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.945
unless you up your
duelling skills

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:46.880
you'll never defeat an Ignis,

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.918
especially since they
have a powerful new card

00:15:50.951 --> 00:15:53.053
known as a Link Spell!

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:54.688
A Link Spell?

00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:57.591
It's a spell card that
has link arrows of its own,

00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.260
opening upon new
duelling strategies.

00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:02.830
Yes, I can see that.

00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:04.531
So, unless your
game is prepared

00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:06.833
to deal with a
card like that Shepherd,

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.236
you have
no chance of winning.

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.972
Why are you telling me this?

00:16:12.005 --> 00:16:13.574
Because like I said before,

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:16.577
as a future member of
the Knights of Hanoi,

00:16:16.577 --> 00:16:19.646
I need you to help me
execute my master plan

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.016
and you can't exactly serve me

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:25.418
if the Ignis find
and defeat you.

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:26.653
Now, can you?

00:16:26.687 --> 00:16:29.656
You've got some nerve
talking to me this way,

00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:32.760
you should show a little more
respect to your superiors.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.663
If you haven't noticed, I'm
beating you in this duel.

00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:39.099
Of course I have,
but getting a lead

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:42.169
and holding a lead are
two separate matters.

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:45.239
It's my turn, I draw!

00:16:45.272 --> 00:16:47.941
When Imperial Order
is on my field

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:51.278
I have to pay 700 life points
at the start of my turn.

00:16:51.312 --> 00:16:53.948
Next, when you have a
Link monster in play

00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:57.284
I'm allowed to summon
Gateway Dragon from my hand.

00:16:57.318 --> 00:16:59.419
(mechanical beeps)

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:02.756
And by using Gateway
Dragon's ability

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.825
I can summon a dark
attribute dragon

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.228
from my hand as long as
its level 4 or below.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.997
Come on now DMZ Dragon

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.399
(dragon roaring)

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:13.567
(mechanical beeps)

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.570
Now is the time to
manifest my circuit,

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:21.642
the summoning conditions are
two or more effect monsters

00:17:21.642 --> 00:17:24.144
so I'll set Gateway
Dragon, Checksum Dragon

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:27.547
and DMZ Dragon in
the link arrow.

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:34.654
I link summon Link 3
Topologic Trisbaena!

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.226
(robotic beeps)

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.500
I link summon Link
3 Topologic Trisbaena!

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.503
(robotic sounds)

00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:50.637
So what?

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.307
I activate my trap
Capture Drone

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.210
and use it on
Topologic Trisbaena.

00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:59.079
By doing so, Trisbaena
can no longer attack

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:01.448
or use special abilities.

00:18:01.482 --> 00:18:04.884
Furthermore, you can't use
it to link summon either.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:09.489
In other words, all your
added up to less than nothing.

00:18:10.257 --> 00:18:12.059
Hmm, that's
because you think

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:14.495
this is the end
point of my strategy,

00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:17.163
when, it is merely
a midpoint of what

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.100
I'm actually
intending to execute.

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:23.036
Since I have a link
monster on my field,

00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:26.073
I can summon Vulnerability
Dragon from my hand,

00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:27.607
(mechanical beeps)

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:31.378
but in exchange I have to
destroy one monster on my field

00:18:31.412 --> 00:18:33.647
for everyone that you
have on your field.

00:18:33.714 --> 00:18:35.816
Since you have one
monster in play

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:37.751
I have to destroy one of mine,

00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:41.288
so I'll destroy
Topologic Trisbaena!

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:46.393
You destroyed your
best monster, why?

00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:51.431
No, since Capture Drone lost
its target it's also destroyed.

00:18:51.665 --> 00:18:52.800
Well well,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.735
it looks like you have
what is known as a problem.

00:18:55.735 --> 00:18:57.604
(groans)

00:18:57.637 --> 00:19:00.073
And it'll get even worse,
because now I summon

00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:03.009
the Tuner monster,
Rokket Synchron!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.378
(monster roaring)

00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:06.112
(mechanical beeps)

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:07.781
A Tuner monster.

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:11.118
Rokket Synchron's
ability activate.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:14.287
When I summon this
monster I can re-summon

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:17.457
a level five or higher
dragon from my graveyard

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.025
in defence mode.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:22.462
Come on back, Checksum Dragon!

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.331
(mechanical beeps)

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:26.967
My level one Rokket
Synchron tunes

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:29.369
with my level one
Vulnerability Dragon

00:19:29.436 --> 00:19:32.505
and the level six
Checksum Dragon!

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:35.609
(laser beeping)

00:19:37.845 --> 00:19:38.678
Oh!

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:44.184
The fuel of the cosmos
mixes with abundance of speed

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:46.553
to transcend to beyond

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.491
I synchro summon
Borreload Savage Dragon!

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.461
(robotic beeps)

00:19:58.498 --> 00:19:59.967
(dragon roars)

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:01.368
This can't be.

00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:06.340
Yes it can, my Savage Dragon's
special ability activates.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.775
When I synchro
summon this monster,

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:11.445
I can retrieve a link
monster from my graveyard

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:13.947
and equip it onto
my Savage Dragon

00:20:13.947 --> 00:20:16.717
and by doing so my
Savage Dragon gains

00:20:16.783 --> 00:20:19.719
a Borrel Counter for
every one of its links.

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:24.224
So I equip my Link 3 Topologic
Trisbaena onto my dragon,

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:26.159
giving it three Borrel Counters.

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:28.328
(mechanical beeps)

00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:31.298
Savage Dragon also gains
half the attack points

00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:33.133
of the monster it equips,

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:38.204
so Savage Dragon's attack
points rise to 4,250.

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:39.839
Ready Shepherd?

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:44.644
Borreload Savage Dragon blast
away Battle Drone General!

00:20:47.113 --> 00:20:49.783
(fire blasting)

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:54.955
(mechanical beeps)

00:20:54.955 --> 00:20:59.793
And next, by vanishing my
DMZ Dragon from my graveyard,

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:02.430
I can destroy
Topologic Trisbaena

00:21:02.463 --> 00:21:05.732
to allow Savage Dragon
to attack again!

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.701
A second attack?

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:10.204
Without Trisbaena
to power it up,

00:21:10.237 --> 00:21:13.173
Savage Dragon's attack
points will drop,

00:21:13.173 --> 00:21:15.342
(mechanical beeps)

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:18.612
but still has enough
strength to end you Shepherd!

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.416
(fire blasting)

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.285
(Shepherd groans)

00:21:30.257 --> 00:21:32.859
(mechanical beeps)

00:21:32.859 --> 00:21:36.230
So, this is the
power of the Hanoi?

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:39.633
No, this is a mere
fragment of our power,

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.169
because if I was really
trying to beat you

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:44.705
you wouldn't have lasted
more than a second

00:21:44.738 --> 00:21:46.539
and if you don't
improve your duelling

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:48.842
you'll never defeat
the Ignis either

00:21:48.842 --> 00:21:51.078
but now that you're
one of the Hanoi,

00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:53.180
I'll help improve your game

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.749
and you'll help
with my master plan.

00:21:55.782 --> 00:22:00.120
I don't think so, I never
agreed to join you if I lost

00:22:00.187 --> 00:22:04.925
and after I defeat the Ignis
you're next on my bucket list

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:08.529
The Shepherd may
think that for now

00:22:08.595 --> 00:22:10.430
but he'll come around.

00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:14.434
Because if he truly wants
to destroy the Ignis,

00:22:14.468 --> 00:22:17.070
he knows what the smart move is.

00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:22.242
(upbeat dramatic music)
