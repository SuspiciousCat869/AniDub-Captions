WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.471
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains...

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.641
Blue Angel...
(chuckles)

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.177
And.. you're Baira,
right?

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.279
The one who created
this stupid virus

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.680
that's deleting peeps?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.284
A lil' ghost told me
you tested the original on me.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.253
You may disagree with
my methods,

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.255
but what I'm doing is
actually for the greater good.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:23.691
(Blue Angel)
Not one more duelist
will get

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.627
deleted on my my watch.
And I'm on watch!

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.861
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.001
Surgical Forceps, incise
Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.839
Trickstar Holly Angel can't
be destroyed in battle!

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.175
You may have saved
your monster...

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.809
but can you
save yourself?

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.248
Have a nice fall,
Blue Angel.

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:48.648
(shouts)

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.821
You're not shaking
me off!

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.291
I pity you, Blue Angel.
Crashing would've been

00:00:57.324 --> 00:00:59.826
far less painful than what
I have in store for you.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.363
(Yusaku)
Let me check
this video again.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.636
Who's that?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.140
♪♪♪

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.633
♪♪♪

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:14.768
Who's that?

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.869
(Kolter)
Hmm...

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.971
Hard to tell through
the tinted windshield.

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:23.777
Not the one in the car...
the one behind the car.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.446
Whoa!
Creeper alert!

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.781
Let me enhance
the image.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:34.555
You think you can identify
who this woman is Kolter?

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:36.389
Who ya think
you're talking to?

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:39.459
And...Boom.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.962
99.9%, huh?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.830
You think
that's close enough?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.434
(Yusaku)
Close enough to wonder
what she's up to.

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:49.303
For three reasons.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.906
One: Why would she be hiding?

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.976
Two: Judging by her white coat,
this woman's a doctor.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.580
So why wouldn't she help a man
who's clearly in distress?

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.515
Because she's somehow
involved!

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:06.120
Geez, Playmaker, learn
to put two and two together.

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:09.022
Number three:
Who would be involved

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:10.457
in the act of a deletion?

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.826
A-ha!
A Knight of Hanoi!

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.129
It seems I put two and two
together

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.196
quicker than you did.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.230
Wiseguy!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.466
(Kolter)
Okay, I'm pulling up
her 411.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.636
Dr. Klarissa Turner.
Says here she suddenly

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.771
cut her shift short today
and went home.

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:25.939
Here's her address.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.008
Wanna go visit
the good doc?

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.277
'Cause I'm believing
that a medical professional

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.013
would be super great
at creating a virus.

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:34.682
You game?

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.516
Yes.

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:44.691
(Baira)
It's your turn,
Blue Angel.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.399
(Ai)
Your best move is
to make any move.

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.201
Uh, thanks.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:59.339
Here I go!
I draw!

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:02.776
Argh!

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.912
If I summon
either of these monsters

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:06.614
Current Hack Virus
will infect 'em

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:07.614
like
my Trickstar Nightshade.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.049
Aah!

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:12.753
(Blue Angel)
In that case...

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.257
I'll play this
facedown.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.260
Silly girl.
That won't help you.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.962
When you place a monster
next to Holly Angel's link,

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.364
Surgical Forceps
destroys it!

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.600
(chuckles)
Your monster's like

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.903
an appendix: useless
and about to be removed!

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.743
Mm! I had no idea
it could do that.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.277
(Baira)
Blue Angel,
what you don't know

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.013
could fill
an entire ward!

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.615
You are a joke.
You didn't even know

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:43.717
not to mess with
the Knights of Hanoi!

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.686
(sighs)
I end my turn.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:49.623
Well that turn sure
ended quickly.

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:50.891
(Baira)
Are you trying
to let me win?

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:52.893
Because I don't need
your help.

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:54.094
(Blue Angel grunts)

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.763
It's my turn!
And I draw!

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.266
Ha!
Look.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.368
I drew yet another
trap card.

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:02.669
And whenever I do,

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.672
Surgical Forceps's
special ability

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:08.409
deals you 500 points
of damage.

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:09.843
(Blue Angel shouting)

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.244
(explosion)

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.446
Ahh!
(grunts)

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:16.483
Ouch.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.355
My board!

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:24.958
If I don't get back on,
I'll be DQ'ed!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.862
My board!

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.998
If I don't get back on,
I'll be DQ'ed!

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:39.740
(chuckles)
Nothing to it!

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:43.243
You won't be getting away
from me that easily, Baira!

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.511
(Baira chuckles)

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.480
You'll wish that I had
because I'm now

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.183
elevating my game
to prolong your suffering.

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:51.184
I use my skill!

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.655
Malevolent Malpractice!

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.257
(Ai)
I regret
to inform you

00:05:57.324 --> 00:05:59.793
that my confidence
in your victory is waning.

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.395
(Baira)
By banishing two copies

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.331
of the same monster
from my graveyard,

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:06.266
my Skill then allows me
to summon

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.536
two copies of another monster
straight from my deck!

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.405
Arise, Dark Mummy Infusers!

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:16.210
(MC)
<i>Baira's stickin' it
to Blue Angel!</i>

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.412
<i>I hate to say it,
but the paramedics</i>

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.714
<i>better get another
hospital bed ready.</i>

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:25.319
Since I summoned
one of my Infusers

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.721
next to Surgical Forceps's
link,

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:29.990
its special ability
activates!

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:32.659
My Infuser protects
Surgical Forceps

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.328
from being affected
by trap cards!

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.066
Wha-- ?

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.234
Now my traps aren't
gonna work on that thing?

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:44.337
That, Blue Angel, is only
the beginning of your problems.

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:47.875
Surgical Forceps also
gains 600 attack points

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:50.577
for every monster
next to its links!

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.850
Up to 3K?
Just great.

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:57.685
I'll place this
for later.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.520
Oh look,
it is later!

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:02.990
Due to the effect of my spell
Temple Of The Kings,

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.060
I can activate
the trap card I just placed!

00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:10.296
By tributing one of
my Dark Mummy Infusers...

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.334
Root Ransom Virus infects
every Link Monster on the field,

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.704
lowering their attack points
to zero

00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:19.639
and neutralizing
their special abilities!

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.576
Your Holly Angel's not looking
so good.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:28.715
(Blue Angel)
What gives?

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.250
She said
Root Ransom Virus

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.952
infects all
Link Monsters,

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.721
But Surgical Forceps
doesn't look sick at all...

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.456
well, for her
that is.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:38.792
(gasps)

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:41.462
As long as Baira
has Dark Mummy Infuser,

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:44.131
Surgical Forceps isn't affected
by traps.

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.233
When a good doctor
creates a virus,

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.235
she always creates
an antidote.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:50.771
I'd never allow
my monsters to get sick.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.707
But I have no such hesitation
about yours!

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:56.610
Surgical Forceps,
attack Holly Angel!

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.247
That's a no!
I activate Trickstar Perennial!

00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:02.649
By sending this trap to
the graveyard

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:06.387
it stops Holly Angel
from being destroyed!

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.822
But it's not going to stop
the damage!

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.527
Ahh!

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.835
<i>Blue Angel's down to
a hundred life points!</i>

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:23.471
<i>If she had any fewer
life points,</i>

00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:25.639
<i>she'd be in debt!</i>

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:26.673
(Zaizen)
I've seen enough!

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:28.676
Just when
it's getting exciting?

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:29.977
Exciting?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.378
I don't care
about exciting!

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:33.380
I'm putting an end
to this duel.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.516
I won't just stand by
and watch my sister lose!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.220
But..
who says she will lose?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.489
Who says she won't?
As her brother,

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.858
it is my duty
to keep her safe.

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.295
Well, I think it's your duty
to believe in your sister.

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:51.031
So stop being
such a lame ol' lame-o!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.503
(giggles)
Please don't fire me.

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:59.806
You can't protect her
from everything forever,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.109
but you can believe
in her forever.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:05.045
And she's actually
really good at dueling!

00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:07.581
(Ai)
Your best move is to make
any move.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:09.582
I know that.

00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:11.685
Okay, let me
think this through.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.420
I have a Trickstar
in my hand.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.455
And I have to destroy
her Infuser

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.591
to get even a teeny chance
at a comeback.

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:20.260
And the first step
to doin' that is using my Skill.

00:09:22.263 --> 00:09:23.930
But, my Skill
has a drawback--

00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:26.266
Baira gets to draw cards
from her deck.

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.435
And if she draws
even one trap card,

00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.571
Surgical Forceps's
special ability

00:09:30.604 --> 00:09:32.706
will activate
and I'm toast!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.341
And the way she's played
so far,

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:37.411
I bet she has like
a bazillion traps in her deck.

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:39.780
I'm sure you're thinking
of every option

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.384
to turn this duel around,
but the diagnosis is hopeless.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:45.252
It's over.

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:48.088
Why, just because
you say it is?

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:50.023
I'm using my Skill,
Trickstar Trick!

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.927
Here goes.
This is my last chance.

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.896
Emphasis on last.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:57.565
(Blue Angel)
By sending
Trickstar Mandrake

00:09:57.598 --> 00:09:59.432
from my hand
to the graveyard...

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.468
Yes yes, I know.

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:04.271
I get to draw until
I have three cards in my hand.

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:05.505
But in exchange,

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.173
I must banish a card
from my hand

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.076
for every Trickstar
in your graveyard

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.277
at the end
of the turn.

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:12.579
Huh, quite
a risky move.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.382
I draw one trap card
and you're done!

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.453
Aww, a spell card.

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.188
You survived
the first draw

00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.090
but I have
two more remaining.

00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:25.592
(laughter)
I draw!

00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:32.099
Appears you lucked out again.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:36.070
But will your luck hold?
Let's find out!

00:10:36.103 --> 00:10:39.039
The final card!
(shouts)

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:48.915
(Blue Angel)
It all comes down
to this!

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:53.119
(shouts)

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.262
(Blue Angel)
It all comes down
to this!

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:08.135
You're one lucky girl.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.104
Yes!

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:13.307
And when I sent Trickstar
Mandrake to the graveyard...

00:11:13.407 --> 00:11:16.243
that flipped the on switch
of her special ability,

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.745
so I can automatically
summon her

00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:18.979
to my field
in defense mode!

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:28.155
You took all that risk
to gain one measly monster.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:30.157
Okay.
Your turn, Blue.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.491
(Ai)
Your best move
is to make--

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:33.527
Shush!
By ending your turn,

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:34.695
my Skill forces you

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:37.330
to banish all three cards
from your hand!

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.665
Toodles!

00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:42.303
Baira!

00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:45.972
I'm not gonna lose!
'Cause, you are!

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.311
(AI whistles)

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:52.980
The doc
has swanky digs.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.982
I bet her monthly rent
can buy ten food trucks.

00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:57.617
Twenty if
it's like Kolter's.

00:11:57.651 --> 00:11:58.986
(Kolter)
<i>You know I can hear you.</i>

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:01.188
Oh, I know.
That's why I said it.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.056
Ready to venture inside?

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:05.592
If the doc's smart enough
to create a plague,

00:12:05.693 --> 00:12:07.228
she's smart enough
to rig some traps

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:09.230
in her apartment
to ambush us.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.064
Your concerns are duly noted.

00:12:11.098 --> 00:12:13.233
But not processed!

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.171

Unregistered resident.

You have ten seconds
to comply

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.916
before security protocols
are initiated.

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:31.084
C'mon, say something.

00:12:31.184 --> 00:12:32.886

Cutting it really close
there, Kolter.

00:12:50.904 --> 00:12:53.841
We were almost down
one brainpan.

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.043
Eh.
I got the job done.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:57.711

Hmm... this lock

The whole duel depends
on the next card...

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.131
I draw!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.502
Nice!

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.172
I'm starting off

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.341
by summoning
Trickstar Narkissus!

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.813
That triggers my
Current Corruption Virus,

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.983
which wipes out all of
your monster's attack points!

00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:51.191
Good job!
It's not easy

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.526
to get three monsters

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:55.129
whose total attack points
add up to 0.

00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:56.497
Well then...

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.531
good thing I'm not
usin' 'em to attack!

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:01.735
Huh?

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:05.172
The summoning conditions require
at least two Trickstars.

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:06.874
And I have three!

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:08.743
I set
Trickstars Narkissus,

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:12.412
Mandrake and Holly Angel
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:12.513 --> 00:15:14.348
Link the circuit!

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:19.920
I Link Summon Link 4
Trickstar Bella Madonna!

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:23.223
(shouting)

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.061
(Blue Angel)
Trickstar Bella Madonna,

00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:29.763
let's send this dirty doc
home in stitches!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.035
(MC)
<i>She did it!
Blue Angel finally summoned</i>

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:36.737
<i>a monster with some
attack points!</i>

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.207
<i>But trouble is,
it's still weaker than Baira's!</i>

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.242
Well... that certainly
added up

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:43.777
to a whole lot
of nothing.

00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:46.747
Then I guess they don't teach
any math in med school.

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:49.349
(Ai)
When Trickstar Bella Madonna
is summoned

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:50.750
using Trickstar Mandrake,

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.553
you are allowed to destroy
a monster

00:15:52.586 --> 00:15:55.088
linked to Dark Mummy
Surgical Forceps.

00:15:55.188 --> 00:15:57.724
That definitely sounds
like something I'd like to do.

00:15:57.758 --> 00:16:00.961
I'll destroy
Dark Mummy Infuser!

00:16:03.631 --> 00:16:04.998
And then that drops

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:07.935
Surgical Forceps's
attack points by 600.

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:10.337
(growls)
But what's even better,

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:13.740
without Infuser's mojo
or whatever to protect her,

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.810
your very own
Root Ransom Virus

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.577
infects your Surgical Forceps,

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:18.912
shutting off her abilities

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.148
and lowering
her attack points to 0.

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.684
So what?
The same goes for you.

00:16:23.784 --> 00:16:26.486
The virus infects
Trickstar Bella Madonna!

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:28.822
And weakens her and--
Nope, you're wrong.

00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:30.023
When there are
no monsters

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:31.625
next to
Bella Madonna's links,

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.828
no spells, traps or abilities
can affect her!

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:37.531
No way!
She's immune?

00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:39.499
Now you're starting
to get it, Baira.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.834
But that's not all.

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:43.136
Bella has another
special ability.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.138
She deals 200 points
of damage

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:46.974
for every different Trickstar
in my graveyard.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.575
And if you weren't
counting--

00:16:48.642 --> 00:16:49.610
which I know
you weren't

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:51.144
'cause you're bad at math--
there's 6!

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:54.247
Ahh!

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:57.417
Unh!

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.423
(Baira)
This can't be happening.

00:17:02.523 --> 00:17:04.925
I pushed her to the very edge
of deletion--

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.328
but she found
a way to survive.

00:17:07.395 --> 00:17:09.930
No, not just survive,
but thrive...

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:13.534
because she never
gave up hope.

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:16.169
Did I lose hope?
Did I lose hope that

00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:18.739
the Hanoi would find
Playmaker and his Ignis

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.208
Ignis in time that
I was willing to risk

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:24.144
infecting thousands
of innocent duelists?

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:27.081
Who am I kidding--
of course I was.

00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:30.217
Well Bella, what say
we end this duel.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.186
Destroy Dark Mummy
Surgical Forceps!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.522
Scimitar Stream!

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:39.593
But, it's not too late
to make amends.

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:49.703

Playmaker,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.922
I told you

no one's here!

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:12.326
Uh...

You were saying Ai?

00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:17.564
Like I told you
a quadrillion times,

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:19.333
someone's here!

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:20.634
Kolter...

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.236
Our target is currently logged
into Link Vrains.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.972
And it's clear
that she's the one

00:18:25.072 --> 00:18:27.608
who is dueling
Blue Angel.

00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:29.309
What's our next step?

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:32.245
(Kolter)
<i>Let's question her when
she logs out.</i>

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.417
(Baira)
You may have avoided
being deleted today,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.619
but I can't speak
for the future.

00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:41.088
I'll worry
about that tomorrow.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.623
Listen I know I shoulda
set the stakes

00:18:43.657 --> 00:18:45.625
before we started
our duel...

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:48.061
but, ya know,
I kinda forgot.

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:49.729
But since I won...

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:51.765
can you please heal
the Deleted?

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.769
No can do.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.370
Take a look.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:01.374
I can't do what
I've already done.

00:19:02.943 --> 00:19:07.347
♪♪♪

00:19:12.186 --> 00:19:13.287
I'm here!

00:19:13.354 --> 00:19:15.388
Just in time.
Something's happening.

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:20.394
Oh...

00:19:20.494 --> 00:19:23.364
Hey, I can log out!
What happened?

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:24.364
Whoa.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.441
Check it out...

00:19:34.508 --> 00:19:37.311
it looks like all the Deleted
are regaining consciousness.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:40.113
The doctor must have
released the cure.

00:19:42.983 --> 00:19:44.818
Why are you healing
all of them?

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:47.788
You had a little something
to do with it, Blue Angel.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:49.023
Ah...

00:19:49.056 --> 00:19:50.490
Do no harm.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.525
That's the first lesson
you learn

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:53.460
when becoming
a doctor.

00:19:55.463 --> 00:19:57.530
Then why did you
create it?

00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:00.300
Fine, don't tell me.

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:03.304
(Baira)
It's because I was willing
to sacrifice thousands

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:05.306
in order to save millions.

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:07.207
And that's only because
I lost hope.

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:09.442
In my younger days,

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:11.278
I'd find a way
to save the millions

00:20:11.345 --> 00:20:13.981
without sacrificing
a single person.

00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:18.118
Because I had hope for
the best... like you do now.

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:20.187
So no more Deleted.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.989
I'm going to hope that
it will all turn out fine...

00:20:23.023 --> 00:20:25.392
because if it doesn't,
the consequences

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:27.494
will be beyond imagining.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.067
She logged out.

00:20:33.167 --> 00:20:34.201
Right.

00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:36.837
She'll be back in her body
any second now.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.674
Then we should tie her up
before she wakes up!

00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:41.809
Instead of rope,
I recommend

00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:45.345
a soft terry cloth
to prevent chafing.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.848
(Kolter)
Hmm... that's weird.

00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:51.151
It shouldn't take
this long to log out.

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:54.354
But she's clearly no longer
logged into Link Vrains.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:57.491
Huh?
That's glitchy.

00:20:57.524 --> 00:20:59.993
You're not gonna
like this, buddy.

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:04.031
(Ai)
Varis! What's he doing?

00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:06.901
Looks like Varis took care
of the good doctor.

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:09.703
She knew the consequence
of releasing the cure...

00:21:09.736 --> 00:21:11.772
but she still
did it anyway.

00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:14.608
Huh? For realsies?
Why?

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.577
'Cause she had
a change of heart.

00:21:16.677 --> 00:21:18.845
She had
a heart transplant?

00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:21.014
We should do something,
Kolter.

00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:23.750
I'll call the medics.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.957
(TV reporter)
<i>The top story today:</i>

Akira...
so, um...

00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:45.272
I heard some
interesting news...

00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:48.575
Blue Angel dueled against
one of the Hanoi last night.

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:52.012
And I also heard...

00:21:52.078 --> 00:21:53.546
she did great.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.416
(gasps softly)

00:21:57.918 --> 00:21:59.553
Thanks!
