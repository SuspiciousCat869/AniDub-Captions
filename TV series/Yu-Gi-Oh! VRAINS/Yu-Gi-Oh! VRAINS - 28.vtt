WEBVTT

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.905
(Faust)
Prepare to duel,
Brave Battler!

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:10.176
(man)
No, Faust, you prepare
to duel against me!

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.980
Playmaker!

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.450
It's really you!

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.287
Wow! That scowl.
And that hair?

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.289
Yeah!
So flash!

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.690
My card, please.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.960
Huh? Oh!

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.529
Of course, uh, here.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.265
And, uh,
thank you,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.969
you know, for, um, letting
me borrow it like you did.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.139
I hope I made you proud!

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:41.741
So proud that maybe you
and I can be buddies now?

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.677
What do ya say,
Playmaker? Huh?

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:47.748
BFF's, you, me?
If your plan was to draw me out
into the open,

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.617
congratulations,
it worked.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:53.019
But you, Faust,
have crossed the line

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.523
by stealing my card data
from me,

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.525
and then giving it
to this amateur.
Hey!

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:01.328
You think I stole
your card data?

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.197
That's news to me.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.331
You lie.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.001
If you're not the thief,
then who is?!

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.736
(Ai)
Don't believe him, Playmaker.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.704
He's a super villain
after all.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.874
With a super villain goatee
and a super villain eye patch.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.576
Just 'cause his pants
aren't on fire

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.744
doesn't mean
he's not fibbin'!

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.580
Think what you want,

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.482
but understand
this, Playmaker.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.650
I will take your Ignis.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.486
And do so with speed.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.321
And when I say speed,

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:30.690
realize that I mean it
in every sense of the word.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.060
I activate the Data Gale!

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:40.567
Whoa!
The Data Gale.

00:01:40.668 --> 00:01:42.636
That's what the Hanoi used
to Speed Duel

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:44.805
against Gore
and Blue Angel.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:48.142
(Ai)
With the added effect of
trapping us inside these winds.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.810
If we're gonna wrap up
this rescue,

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.712
we're gonna have
to beat this guy!

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.515
Prepare for defeat, Playmaker!

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.317
♪♪♪

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.158
Now let's Speed Duel!
Now let's Speed Duel!

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.160
♪♪♪

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:07.120
I shall go first!

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:08.823
And I will initiate this duel

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.726
by activating the spell
Wormhole Defense!

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.335
(Ai)
Holy moly!

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.642
That thing's
a sight to behold!

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.043
Uh...

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.812
At least, I bet it would be
if I could see it.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.050
But that may be tough seeing
as how there's no live feed.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.884
(groans)

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.320
I know!

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.188
I can adjust
my superhero visor

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:43.190
so I can see super-duper close!

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.191
(laughs)

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.126
Engage!

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:50.497
Oh, yeah!

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.499
By activating Wormhole Defense,

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:55.769
I'm allowed to summon
one Motor Worm Token

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.971
to my field in defense mode.

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.845
But instead
of stopping at one,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.782
I shall triple my Worm count
with the spell Motor Worm Bait

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:12.886
to invite two more Worms
to our dimension!

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.059
(Ai)
Eww! Those squiggles
give me the creeps.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.728
Who knew there were creatures
uglier than you meatbags?

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.098
Now, Playmaker!

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:26.733
(grunts)

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.337
Bear witness as I bridge
the circuit between dimensions!

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.672
My Worms!

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.907
Set yourselves
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.612
I Link Summon!

00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:42.082
Link 3
Motor Worm Spreader Queen!

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.253
(roars)

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.424
I Link Summon!

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.594
Link 3
Motor Worm Spreader Queen!

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:58.866
Giving up three monsters for one
may seem like a high price,

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:01.535
but not when she can
create her own army!

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.971
When there are no monsters
next to her links,

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.307
she can summon she can
summon a Motor Worm Token!

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.914
And that's not her only
special ability!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.817
My Spreader Queen
gains 700 attack points

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:19.853
for every Insect-Type monster
on the field.

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.588
Since I have two Insects,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:25.158
her attack points
increase by 1400!

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.527
(Ai)
That bug is totally
buggin' out!

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.931
Better squish it before
we get squashed.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.834
2400 attack points
is a lot to handle.

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.336
But nothing's too much
for my best friend.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.006
(Faust)
That will do for now.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:44.078
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:45.312
(tires screeching)

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.015
Where are you, Shima?

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:53.120
My turn! (grunts)

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:56.323
Since there are
no monsters on my field,

00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.728
I'm allowed to summon Linkslayer
straight from my hand!

00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:02.362
(grunts)

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:06.433
And now... by putting
this Cyberse monster into play

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.869
I can also summon this monster
from my hand:

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.805
Backup Secretary!

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.142
Now, Faust...

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:19.680
if you can Link Summon,
so can I!

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:22.182
The summoning conditions
require two monsters,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.852
so I set Linkslayer
and Backup Secretary

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.386
in the Link Arrows!

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.858
I Link Summon!

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.027
Link 2 Space Insulator!

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.028
(grunts)

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.765
But I'm afraid
that this monster

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:39.766
is only the beginning, Faust!

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.236
Next to
Space Insulator's link,

00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.539
I can automatically summon
Link Infra-Flier!

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:51.412
And with these two monsters,
I can Link Summon again!

00:06:51.512 --> 00:06:54.982
Because what you can do,
I can do even better!

00:06:55.048 --> 00:06:56.717
Now...

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.455
I set Link Infra-Flier and Space
Insulator in the Link Arrows!

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.458
I Link Summon!

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:09.396
Link 3 Decode Talker!

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:11.798
(grunts)

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:15.268
Next, I shall summon
Cyberse Wizard!

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.774
And Decode Talker
gains 500 attack points

00:07:20.808 --> 00:07:23.210
for every monster
next to its link.

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:28.449
Oh, yeah!

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:31.952
Decode Talker's taken
the crown from the Queen!

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:34.255
(Faust chuckling)

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:37.658
After I place this card
facedown on my field,

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:40.961
my Decode Talker is now going
to attack your Spreader Queen!

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.297
Decode Destruction!

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.467
Did you actually think
I wouldn't be prepared for that?

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.602
With my spell
Wormhole Defense,

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.071
instead of Spreader Queen
being destroyed,

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:54.774
a Motor Worm Token
is destroyed in her place!

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.716
In other words,
long live the Queen.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.718
Well...
You still lose life points..

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:10.024
And with one less strand
of spaghetti,

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:12.659
your Queen loses
700 attack points!

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:14.061
(laughs)

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.663
Which makes her weaker
than my Cyberse Wizard!

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.465
Now, go!

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:26.373
Toodle-oo!

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:29.977
I activate the trap card
Worm Revival!

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.147
It resurrects a Link 3 or lower
Insect from my graveyard!

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:38.051
Return to rule,
Motor Worm Spreader Queen!

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:41.288
Ugh, looks like her "reign"
is back in the forecast.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.791
You really are prepared
for everything.

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:47.827
Yes. And much more than
you can ever imagine.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.963
Because Worm Revival's
second effect

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.366
summons another
Motor Worm Token

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:55.335
next to my Spreader Queen,
which you can't attack

00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:58.139
as long as her highness
roams the field.

00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:00.507
And I'm back to having
two Insects in play,

00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:03.677
so my Queen now gains
1400 attack points

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.913
raising her to 2400!

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.915
You thought attacking my Queen

00:09:07.948 --> 00:09:11.452
would pull you closer to
victory, but you were wrong!

00:09:11.552 --> 00:09:14.855
All it did was push you
further towards defeat!

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:17.858
And this will push you
over the edge!

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.094
Egg Clutch negates
your monster's abilities

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:21.394
and locks it in defense,

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:24.798
but also transforms
your monster into an Insect!

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:25.966
(Ai)
No way!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.670
I'm altering
Cyberse Wizard's DNA!

00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:31.104
(panicked gasp)

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.408
(groaning loudly)

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.512
Aww, glitch!

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:42.583
Now it seems your Wizard serves
me more than he serves you!

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:44.752
With another Insect
on the field,

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:49.122
Motor Worm Spreader Queen gains
700 additional attack points.

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.525
Oh, no!

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.096
It's got more attack points
than Decode Talker now!

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:58.599
(Ai)
This is bad!
Do something, Playmaker.

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:00.467
I'm ending my turn.

00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:02.769
No, I didn't mean
do that, ya dummy!

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:04.371
Well...

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.073
It's not like you had
any options left.

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:08.909
This duel's done!

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.915
♪♪♪

00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:16.517
It's my turn!

00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:19.520
And I will make sure
it's your last!

00:10:19.587 --> 00:10:22.222
Egg Clutch allows me to tribute
one of my monsters

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.591
in order to summon
two Motor Worm Tokens

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.427
to your side of the field.

00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:27.928
Consider it a gift,

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:30.564
a gift that you didn't
ask for or want.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:34.734
Because it means there'll
be more Insects in play!

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:41.041
Just great.

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:44.378
He took one monster
and turned it into two.

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:48.248
(Yusaku)
I know how
to count, Ai.

00:10:48.282 --> 00:10:50.918
Then my
Spreader Queen can summon

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.186
another Motor Worm Token
of her own!

00:10:56.456 --> 00:11:00.995
So Spreader Queen gains
700 <i>more</i> attack points!

00:11:01.095 --> 00:11:02.863
Of course she does.

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:06.467
Lastly...
I activate this!

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.301
My spell Motor Worm Gate!

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:11.905
When all of the monsters on your
field happen to be Insects,

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.474
my very own Insect can then
go and attack

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:16.810
your precious
life points directly!

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.079
Uh, yoo-hoo?

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.014
I think you're
forgetting something!

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.284
Decode Talker is no bug,
so that effect won't work!

00:11:24.317 --> 00:11:25.819
For now!

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:29.690
But it will when Spreader Queen
destroys Decode Talker!

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.158
Swarming Storm Assault!

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:40.634
Ah!

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.002
It's like
he's programmed

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:44.170
to contradict
everything I say!

00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:46.573
(Faust)
I will defeat you, Playmaker.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.808
I will acquire that Ignis.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.479
I will triumph and avenge
the two who fell before me.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.981
I owe it to them.

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:57.918
I activate my skill...

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.320
Double Bite!

00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:02.723
(Ai)
And I bet it bites.

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.190
(Faust laughs)

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.093
My Skill allows
my Spreader Queen

00:12:06.193 --> 00:12:09.229
to attack twice this turn
instead of just once!

00:12:09.262 --> 00:12:10.230
What?!

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:13.667
That's right!
Now go...!

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.669
Thanks to Motor Worm Gate,

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:18.539
this attack will be a direct
attack to your life points!

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:22.710
Uh, Playmaker, does he know
the definition of direct?

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.712
Because that attack
went directly nowhere.

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.214
(insects buzzing)

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.183
Uh, what's buzzin'?

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.251
Huh?!

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:35.589
Finish him!

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.860
Not so fast!

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:43.430
I activate my trap card
Urgent Link!

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.532
It cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.738
Playmaker!

00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:59.213
(Ai)
Only 50 life points?

00:12:59.313 --> 00:13:01.448
Guess that's
better than 0.

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.717
Good to know you
can still count, Ai.

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.053
Let's go!

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.122
♪♪♪

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:15.428
You thought I was playing
straight into your hands.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:17.597
But perhaps <i>you</i> were
playing into mine!

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.966
'Cause my Urgent Link
has another effect!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.604
Yep, we can use a Worm Token
to summon a new Link Monster!

00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:25.939
That's right!

00:13:25.973 --> 00:13:28.108
Faust, watch this!

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.110
Huh?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.811
(Faust)
Watch what?

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.413
Hmm?

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.582
Due to Wormhole Defense's
effect,

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:38.919
you're not allowed to use
an Insect to Link Summon.

00:13:38.953 --> 00:13:44.057
So it seems you're still
playing into my hands.

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:46.460
It was a nice try.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.963
But no shred of effort
will save you from defeat!

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:53.066
I don't think we can get
outta this mess, Playmaker.

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:55.435
Perhaps.
But I'm not going to give up.

00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:57.270
Of course not.

00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:00.707
And I would expect
nothing less from you.

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.344
Not from someone who had
the fortitude to survive

00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:05.179
the Lost Incident.

00:14:05.212 --> 00:14:08.616
You will lose, and that
Ignis will be mine!

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.118
Yes, I'll be carrying
the guilt for my role

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:13.954
in the incident
for the rest of my life.

00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:17.458
But now's not the time to feel
sorry for myself, or for you!

00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:21.461
I must complete my mission
by destroying the Ignis!

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.565
(Kolter)
Shima's signal
is getting stronger.

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.500
(Faust)
It's your turn, Playmaker.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.669
Your very last turn!

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:32.206
We'll see!

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:33.874
It doesn't matter
what you draw

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:35.643
because I've
designed my combo...

00:14:35.676 --> 00:14:39.113
to be unbreakable.

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.515
Just because you've designed it
to be unbreakable

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:44.051
does not make it so!

00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:46.620
By banishing a Monster
from my graveyard

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:49.189
with the same number of links
as your Link Monster,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.826
Cybersal Cyclone
destroys your monster.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.629
Your Spreader Queen is Link 3

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:59.499
which is exactly the same
as my Decode Talker!

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:05.672
Toodle-dee-doo
part two!

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.408
I don't think so!

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.844
I still have Wormhole Defense
in play!

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.779
My Motor Worm Token
takes the hit

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:15.282
to protect
my Spreader Queen!

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.955
That's what I was hoping for.

00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:21.955
Say what?

00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:25.258
Cybersal Cyclone
has a second effect!

00:15:25.292 --> 00:15:28.129
If the monster I banished
was a Cyberse-Type monster,

00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:32.099
I can destroy one
of your spell or trap cards!

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:33.367
(growls)

00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:35.536
Cybersal Cyclone!

00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:39.373
Destroy Wormhole Defense!

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:40.941
All right!

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.576
That's so totally
what I would've done!

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.910
(growls)

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.779
There goes your combo.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:49.616
But still Spreader Queen's
ability activates!

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:52.753
Summoning another
Motor Worm Token!

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:57.424
And raising her attack points
back to 4500!

00:15:57.524 --> 00:16:00.461
And that means not a single
one of your monsters

00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:02.495
is strong enough
to defeat her!

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:03.663
That is true.

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:05.999
(strange noise)

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:10.070
(Ai)
Data Storm, portside!

00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:15.475
Here goes!

00:16:15.575 --> 00:16:18.478
♪♪♪

00:16:25.586 --> 00:16:27.320

(Ai)
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:33.026
(Ai gasps)

00:16:33.126 --> 00:16:35.829
There it is!

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:37.998
Storm Access!

00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:45.405
Now...

00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:49.109
I create the ultimate circuit!

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:50.844
Link Arrows authorized!

00:16:50.944 --> 00:16:53.681
The summoning conditions
are three monsters.

00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.683
So I set two Motor Worm Tokens

00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:58.652
and Cyberse Wizard
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:01.254 --> 00:17:06.226
I Link Summon...
Link 3 Powercode Talker!

00:17:07.561 --> 00:17:09.763
(roars)

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:20.674
I Link Summon...
Link 3 Powercode Talker!

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:23.476
That's flash!

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.712
A brand spanking new
Link Monster!

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:29.716
Since I eliminated three Insects
to summon Powercode Talker,

00:17:29.749 --> 00:17:33.154
Spreader Queen loses
2100 attack points!

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.989
But my Spreader Queen
still has more attack points

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.391
than your monster!

00:17:37.424 --> 00:17:40.227
You saying it as though
I'm not aware of that fact.

00:17:40.261 --> 00:17:41.862
But when I summon
Powercode Talker,

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:45.265
I can re-summon Space
Insulator from my graveyard.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.868
(grunts)

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.306
Now, Powercode,
activate your ability!

00:17:52.373 --> 00:17:55.342
It can negate your Spreader
Queen's special abilities,

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:59.079
so all her powerups
come powering down!

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:01.147
Withering Wire!

No, wait!
Don't attack me!

00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:18.399
There's something you need
to know about your Ignis!

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.967
It's keeping
a secret that--
Blah, blah, blah.

Anything to save his skin,
amirite, buddy?

By tributing Space Insulator,

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.282
Powercode Talker's
attack points double!

My bad for causing
you trouble.

I was just trying my best

you can forgive me.

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:17.350
Yeah, we're pals now--

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:20.321
actually, more like besties.
Or brothers!

00:20:20.354 --> 00:20:22.390
(Yusaku)
What did Faust want to tell me?
Yeah, that's it!
We're like family.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.624
That's how
close we are!

00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:26.794
There's something you need
to know about your Ignis!

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:28.361
It's keeping
a secret that--

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:31.232
(Shima)
On second thought,
we may just move in together.

00:20:31.332 --> 00:20:32.365
(giggles)

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:34.034
So to sum things up,

00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:36.503
this has been
the greatest day ever!

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:40.541
You know, aside from the whole
being afraid for my life
thing and all.

00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:42.209
Not that I was afraid.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.511
The Brave Battler laughs
in the face of danger!

00:20:44.545 --> 00:20:46.680
(laughing)

00:20:46.713 --> 00:20:48.382
(Yusaka)
Faust also said that
he didn't steal

00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:50.351
my Cyberse Wizard's card data,

00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:52.986
so who could have given it
to Shima?

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:55.456
Only a certain few would have
the technical knowhow

00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:57.357
and the access...

00:21:00.027 --> 00:21:02.062
Could it be?

00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:08.435
