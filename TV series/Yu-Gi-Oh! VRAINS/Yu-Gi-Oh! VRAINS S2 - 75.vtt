WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.571
(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh! Vrains.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.073
Hey, Earth.

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:06.974
(Earth) Ai?

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.742
Pender's pal Playmaker.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.910
(Yusaku)
Who are you?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.779
(Gore)
Can't believe you're
already forgotten me.

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.447
(Ai)
That's Gore?

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:18.118
This Ignis is mine and you
can't do anything about it.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:23.023
Go, shatter his crystal heart.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.258
(Earth)
I don't think so.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.097
You will never hurt Aqua.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:34.268
I activate Gravity Vision.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.338
I can summon a
G, Golem Token

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:40.607
in defence mode.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:45.479
Your monster also loses
twenty four hundred,

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.849
attack and defence points.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.352
You're duelling would
have flustered the old Gore,

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.522
but I'm a new Gore.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.257
Brain hack!

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:58.292
Ah!

00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.159
Wow.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.160
Whoa.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:07.467
I fusion summon, my dino
wrestler, chimaera T-wrextle.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.171
I've hacked my brain,

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:12.706
so that I can calculate
moves faster and better,

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.975
than any human or ignis,

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.078
your defeat is only
a matter of time.

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:21.308
(dramatic tense music)

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.880
(Yusaku)
You hacked, your brain.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.649
What do you mean Gore?

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.217
(Gore)
What I mean is,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.586
I now have super
human intelligence.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.987
(grunts)

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:37.257
Because...
sol technologies,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.561
have planted an AI chip,
directly into my brain.

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:41.562
They what?

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:42.796
(Ai)
That AI code could,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.331
play havoc with
your brain cells,

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.399
and scramble
a lump like eggs.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.202
(Gore)
You have got it all wrong,

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:51.304
I've taken the uniqueness
of human creativity,

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.306
and the calculated
processing speed of

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:57.278
AI and united them into one,
enhanced my duelling skills.

00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:59.212
(electrical static)

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:02.783
He combined with an AI

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:03.617
Ai, ai, ai.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:05.853
(Zaizen)
This is bad.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:06.787
(cowering)

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.489
by activating his AI chip,

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.691
Gore is putting
his life in danger.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.727
(tense music plays)

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.331
(Gore)
What's that gizmo?

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.399
Its an AI duelling chip
we designed,

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.269
that directly interfaces with
the brains neural pathways.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.170
Meaning what?

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.271
(Female Scientist)
Meaning it transforms,

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.607
an ordinary duelist,
into a spectacular one.

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.108
Oh yeah.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.611
(Male Scientist)
By surgically attaching
this chip to the brain,

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:33.347
its built in AI boosts
your thinking process,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.381
allowing you to make,

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.316
the most optimal decisions,
quicker than ever.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.321
I figured out why you
dragged me here Zaizen.

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.822
(Zaizen) Oh?

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.457
You want me to take
that chip for a test run.

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:47.061
No I don't, but
my superiors do.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:50.130
See they feel that by
enhancing your duelling skills,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.501
it will allow you to defeat
and capture the ignis easier.

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.769
But what they failed to
take into consideration,

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.106
is that the chip also pushes
the brain into overdrive,

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.342
which strains both
mind and body,

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:04.411
and that will clearly not
be healthy for you Gore.

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.281
I didn't know
you cared about me.

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:09.850
Your worried my brains
going to short circuit,

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:11.885
or maybe go pop like a balloon?

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.020
I'm not saying it will,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.289
but why risk it.

00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:19.060
Point taken, but I'm still
taking the chips Zaizen.

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:21.928
Have you listened
to a word I've said?

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:25.365
I have, if it makes
me a better duelist,

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.068
I'm willing to risk anything.

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:30.403
(Zaizen)
Why would Gore
go this far?

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.941
So you are now half AI?

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.210
Yeah that's right.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.780
If Gore is part AI,
does that make us cousins?

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:40.847
Were family.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.019
No, that isn't exactly how
family structures work Ai.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.854
Even if we were family,

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:51.525
I'd have no qualms capturing
you or any of the other ignis.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:53.293
Hm, with that attitude,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.296
your dis invited
from family reunion.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:58.365
So what, I have
more present concerns,

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:59.733
like this duel.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.969
Chimaera T-wrextle, attack.

00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:03.804
My gravity vision,

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:08.275
redirects your attack
to my G golem token,

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.778
so my Chrystal heart is safe.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.581
But you can't say the
same for your life points.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.250
When my Chimaera T-wrextle,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.018
attacks a monster
in defence mode,

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:20.287
it still deals you damage.

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:26.459
(crashing)

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.533
Not only did you
take damage,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.834
but when Chimaera
destroys a monster,

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.571
it gains five hundred
attack points.

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:40.440
With that I end my turn.

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:43.310
Now lets see what you got,
not that it will help,

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:48.081
because I can feel my mind
working like never before ignis.

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:50.784
That's right, every strategy,

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:53.954
you could possible use
is filling my mind,

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.924
as is every counter
strategy to stop it.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:00.094
This human,
has no qualms about

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.230
hurting me or aqua.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:08.235
She wanted me, to choose
which side to fight for,

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:14.140
but the decision may have
already been made for me.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.643
Its my turn.

00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:21.481
Chrystal heart,
resurface Invalid Dolmen,

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.751
from my graveyard
next to its link,

00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:32.526
and by doing so,
Chrystal heart gains one,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.832
G golem counter and
gives Invalid Dolmen,

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.602
six hundred attack points.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.403
That makes
Invalid Dolmen,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.873
just as strong
Chimaera T-wrextle,

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.575
so earth can put that chomper
down for the three count.

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:51.511
Actually, due to
tyrant dino fusions effect,

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.980
his chimaera won't be
destroyed in battle.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.150
So not even a two
point five count?

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.954
Next I summon,
G golem pebble dog,

00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.055
to the field.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.559
(dog barks)

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:09.496
And its ability, lets me draw,

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:14.067
another pebble dog from my deck.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:18.305
I can now accrete my circuit,

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:23.243
I set, pebble dog
and Invalid Dolmen,

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:26.546
in the link arrows,
to link summon,

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:31.551
link for, G Golem
Dignified Trilithon.

00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:35.055
(sound of rock slide)

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:39.159
And Trilithon, gains six
hundred, attack points,

00:07:39.226 --> 00:07:43.263
for each Chrystal
hearts counters.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:47.000
Bananza!
That makes Trilithon,

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:49.436
the strongest monster in play.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.438
Ready human?

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:55.709
Trilithon attack
Chimaera T-wrextle,

00:07:57.378 --> 00:08:02.282
and ill up the damage by
discarding an earth monster,

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:06.620
from my hand, your
chimaera loses,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.624
two hundred, attack
points and its abilities

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:11.825
(gore grunts)

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:15.795
So I lose my pebble
dog but you lose,

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:18.132
seven hundred, attack points.

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:20.333
(counters going down)

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:24.505
And my loss is only temporary,

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:27.207
because pebble dogs ability,

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:31.111
lets me draw another
one from my deck.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.213
Go!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.114
Trilithon.

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:40.186
Due to tyrant dino fusion,
my chimaera can't be destroyed,

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.790
Yes but you still take damage.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.392
(chimaera roars)

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:46.293
Ah!

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:52.466
(Earth)
And when crystal heart,
has at least two counters,

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:55.335
Trilithon can attack twice.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.837
What?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.107
And tyrant dino fusions
effect can't be used again.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:05.012
So your chimaera is destroyed.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.348
(explosions)

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.215
Ah!

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:13.720
(counters going down)

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:17.524
Aw, a hundred life
points, he was so close.

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:19.359
But close enough.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.230
What is that?

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:27.167
I activate my skill,
stalag tite spear.

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:32.673
When my earth monster
destroys your monster,

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:35.609
you lose, one
hundred life points,

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:39.512
for each of your
monsters levels.

00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:44.751
Now, Chimaera
T-wrextle is level eight.

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:45.752
So that's enough
to dump

00:09:45.786 --> 00:09:47.787
Gore's life points
down to zero.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:55.195
(dramatic music)

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:57.130
(alarm blaring)

00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:59.933
Gore's EEG readings are
completely off the charts.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:02.335
And so are the rest
of his biomarkers.

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:04.771
He may be going
into shock.

00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:06.106
(Computer) You lose.

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:08.341
(gasping)

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.378
That makes 12 loses in a row.

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.516
(door hissing)

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.584
(grunting)

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.220
(thud)

00:10:19.253 --> 00:10:20.221
(gasping)

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:21.187
Hey Gore!

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.255
Are you okay?

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.558
(grunting)

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.359
Quick, call the medics!

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.195
I'm all right.

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:30.430
(grunting)

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:39.206
(screaming)

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.042
I'm shutting
this project down.

00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.680
There's no evidence
that the AI chip

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.182
in your brain is
helping you win.

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:50.384
In fact, all it's
doing is hurting you.

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:52.519
Slow your roll bub.

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:55.722
The chip is working.
And I can prove it.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.058
(growls)

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:00.127
I'm giving you
one last chance.

00:11:00.193 --> 00:11:01.595
(Gore)
That's all I need.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:06.767
(dramatic music)

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.435
(Computer) You win.

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:12.573
Gore finally did it!
He finally won!

00:11:12.573 --> 00:11:14.808
Quite true, but at what cost?

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:18.111
(door hisses)

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:21.348
(dramatic music)

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:23.917
(growling)

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:28.421
This infinite field of data
is in the palm of my hands.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:35.796
(grunts)

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:38.465
I've seen enough,
I want that chip removed.

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:40.500
What you want doesn't matter.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.672
We've invested too
much time and money

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.908
into this technology
to stop now Zaizen.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:50.477
Time? money? These
experiments are

00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:52.413
much too dangerous to continue.

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:54.014
Gore's life is at risk.

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:56.616
You heard what the
lady said Zaizen.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.285
Stay out of this.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:00.587
No, you stay out of this!

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:03.824
Because whatever the
risk, I want the chip.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.326
Even if it shuts down
your brain permanently

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:08.328
and you're never
able to wake again?!

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.563
Yeah, even then!

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.397
But.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.331
But nothing.

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.733
You don't see what I see Zaizen.

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:16.169
I see the reality
behind reality.

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.472
I see the past,
present, the future,

00:12:18.472 --> 00:12:20.474
(Gore)
and every moment
in between!

00:12:20.508 --> 00:12:22.242
I see everything!

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:26.246
And I still see
that you won't win.

00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:30.317
We'll see about that!

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:32.052
Stalactite spear!

00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:34.521
Heh.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:36.323
Gi gi, gi gi!

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:39.326
(laughing)

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:40.894
(gasps)

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:44.832
I also have a skill, One
that you've never seen before!

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.233
I activate anti-skill!

00:12:47.468 --> 00:12:48.235
(gasps)

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.237
(thuds)

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:53.840
Earth still won!

00:12:58.846 --> 00:12:59.679
What?

00:13:00.914 --> 00:13:02.450
By hacking my
brain, I was able

00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:05.886
to create the ultimate
counter strategy.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:10.891
By activating anti-skill,
I can negate your skill.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.561
And I also get to draw
two cards from my deck.

00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:18.132
I end my turn.

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:21.067
A skill that stops
the opponents skill?

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.302
That's not fair.

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.104
That's like a super cheat code.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.773
And it's all 'cause of
that chip in his cranium.

00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:28.375
His noggin's gotta
be overclocked

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:30.544
to create a skill like that.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:31.545
(Playmaker) And
that much stress

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.380
on his brain can't be healthy.

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:35.883
Playmaker.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.251
Hmm?

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.920
Blue Gal, what
are you doing here?

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:42.122
I came here to give
a hand to the Ignis.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.924
Oh, then you're
here just in time.

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:46.793
If your intention was to
arrive fashionably late.

00:13:46.827 --> 00:13:48.229
Who's winning?

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:50.130
Earth's in the lead.

00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:53.900
But, the outcome of the
duel is far from decided.

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.036
Skye, be careful.

00:13:57.438 --> 00:13:58.271
(beeps)

00:13:58.305 --> 00:13:59.106
Yes?

00:13:59.139 --> 00:13:59.940
Bad news!

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:00.941
It's Gore!

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:02.643
His vitals are in the red.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.779
(Risa)
Oh no, he's pushing
himself too hard!

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.981
(dramatic music)

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.216
It's my turn.

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:10.183
I draw!

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.821
When there are no
monsters on my field,

00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:17.123
I can summon Dinowrestler
Coelasilat from my hand!

00:14:18.124 --> 00:14:20.294
(growls)

00:14:20.294 --> 00:14:22.963
And by doing so,
I can also summon

00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:25.132
Dinowrestler Eskrimamenchi.

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:27.133
(roars)

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.770
Next I'll do level
two Coelasilat

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:33.807
with level six Eskrimamenchi!

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.109
(whirring)

00:14:42.316 --> 00:14:44.985
The kings of the
prehistoric unite

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:47.821
to forge a new future of terror!

00:14:47.855 --> 00:14:52.726
I synchro summon level eight
Dinowrestler Giga Spinosavate!

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.396
(roaring)

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:02.035
A synchro monster?

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.070
That's new.

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.540
Gore has never summoned
a synchro monster before.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:08.776
He's really
stepped up his game.

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:10.244
By mixing up his brain.

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:12.379
And even with all
that razzle dazzle,

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:15.416
that new toy of his is still
weaker than our Strilahen!

00:15:15.449 --> 00:15:19.686
Next I activate my spell,
space time trancendance.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.723
By banishing at least
two dinosaur type monster

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.392
from my graveyard and
adding up their levels,

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.862
I can summon a
monster from my hand

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:30.431
or my graveyard that
equals that total.

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:32.566
Though it's not
allowed to attack.

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.201
So I banish level one

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:38.005
Marshall Ampalow and
level seven pancratops.

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:42.943
To resurrect level eight
Dinowrestler Kimera-T-Rexal

00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:46.780
(Roaring)

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:50.384
Why summon a monster
that can't attack?

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:51.885
(grunt)

00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:53.453
Now I'm allowed to destroy a

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.057
monster, using
spino-savats ability!

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.526
Be gone, crystal heart!

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.828
(crashing)

00:16:01.862 --> 00:16:05.766
I won't let you, my trilenants

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:10.136
old ability, redirects it
back to your spino-savat!

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.408
But I have another ability,

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:16.977
when spino-savats
about to be destroyed,

00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:20.281
another monster can
take it's place instead.

00:16:20.314 --> 00:16:21.815
(crashing)

00:16:21.849 --> 00:16:24.618
And when Kimera-T-Rexal
is destroyed,

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.620
its own ability activates.

00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:29.023
What's that?

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.091
Bad news I think!

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:33.593
Kimera-T-Rexal's
special ability,

00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:37.030
destroys all monsters on
your field in attack mode.

00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:41.201
And last I checked, all your
monsters are in attack mode.

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.736
This isn't good for Earth.

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:46.607
That is an understatement,
is it panic time?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.142
I think it's panic time!

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:54.514
I activate,
gravity protection!

00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:58.084
I can equip this
card on my crystal

00:16:58.084 --> 00:17:00.987
heart by attributing
my trylanon.

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:06.393
By doing so, crystal heart can't

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:10.664
be destroyed, in
battle or by your

00:17:10.664 --> 00:17:14.101
special abilities, and it gains

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:17.304
half of trylanon's
attack points!

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.974
(thundering)

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:27.248
You will never destroy my heart!

00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:29.382
That's the spaghetti!

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:32.486
Now Earth has just enough
to survive this turn.

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:35.155
Not just survive,
but win, because when

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:36.857
its Earth's turn,
Gore only has

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.359
a hundred
life points left and

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.493
Earth can knock that out
with a flick of a pebble.

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:42.896
It's over human.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.100
After calculating
every possibility,

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:49.369
I must admit you're
absolutely right.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.739
It is over, but not for me.

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:59.480
It is over, but not for me.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.781
What?

00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:03.417
Your moves maybe
would've been enough

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.953
to defeat the old
Gore, but the old Gore

00:18:05.986 --> 00:18:09.456
couldn't calculate the paths
and possibilities I can,

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:12.492
such as the one that
leads me to victory.

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:17.564
This one, Giga-spino-savat
attack crystal heart!

00:18:18.132 --> 00:18:19.299
(roaring)

00:18:19.332 --> 00:18:22.269
And I activate the
spell card dino-roar!

00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:25.539
When my spino-savat
battles your monster,

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:27.541
I can send a spell or trap card

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.643
on your field to the graveyard.

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:31.044
(gasps)

00:18:31.078 --> 00:18:33.413
so gravity protection
won't protect

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.948
your crystal heart anymore.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:38.051
(beeping)

00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.053
No!

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:41.555
This can't be!

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:45.559
Yeah it can,
claw dive chasse

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:50.463
shatter crystal heart
into a million pieces.

00:18:50.497 --> 00:18:53.433
No, don't do it!

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.403
(shattering)

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.372
(beeping)

00:18:58.372 --> 00:19:00.273
(exploding)

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:01.107
Aqua

00:19:02.776 --> 00:19:03.777
Earth.

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:13.520
The Earth ignis is mine.

00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:14.387
Oh no!

00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:19.159
What, we gotta do
something Playmaker!

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:21.729
Release him
Gore, if you don't,

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:24.831
I'm going to have to
force you to do so.

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.633
I sure hope
that's a challenge,

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:29.269
cause that's just
what I wanted to hear.

00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:31.272
Cause everything
I've done to myself,

00:19:31.272 --> 00:19:34.341
is so I'd be ready to
duel you, Playmaker.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:38.479
In fact, I didn't care about
this Ignus to begin with.

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.615
I just wanted to draw
you out into the open.

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:43.450
There's easier
ways to do that.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:45.485
Like, I don't know,
call us!

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.220
We used to be
allies Gore.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:49.189
What happened to
change all that?

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:50.457
What happened,
was that I've

00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:52.459
never been able to defeat you,

00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:55.129
and my mind can't
rest until I do!

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:56.363
(grunt)

00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:57.964
And how can your
mind rest when

00:19:57.998 --> 00:20:01.135
a chip's pinging
it like a doorbell?

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:02.269
Hey Gore?

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:03.970
You wanna duel, lets duel.

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.774
I want that Earth Ignis, so

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:10.110
bring that dog in from the yard.

00:20:12.512 --> 00:20:14.548
(screaming)

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:17.051
Looks like our duel
will have to wait.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:20.387
But I'll be back for you
Playmaker, count on it.

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:22.889
He got away.

00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:27.460
And took Earth to Soul-tech.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.695
(crying)

00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:32.532
This isn't right,
this isn't right!

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:38.471
(intense music)

00:20:42.976 --> 00:20:44.811
(grunt)

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:48.381
Let's get to work, shall we?

00:20:52.986 --> 00:20:55.489
What's going on?

00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:58.292
If it's any consolation,
you'll be helping

00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:02.096
with the advancement of
human technology, now do it.

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:03.864
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:06.199
(whirring)

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.402
What's that?

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:14.874
(whirring)

00:21:14.908 --> 00:21:17.577
(intense music)

00:21:20.281 --> 00:21:22.115
Oh, this is awkward.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:27.254
They're taking his code apart.

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:30.758
(grunt)

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:35.762
Stop this, you
can't do this to me!

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:42.402
My memories, are fading
even so, I won't forget you

00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:51.344
Aqua, even if I
forget everything.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.855
Huh? Earth?

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:03.924
Did you feel that?

00:22:03.958 --> 00:22:04.791
Yes.

00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:08.628
What is this?

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.365
Not cool.

00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:14.901
Totally not. Earth's
no different than us

00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:16.737
just because he was a program.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.474
This has to stop, and
I'm gonna stop it.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.676
(booming)

00:22:29.316 --> 00:22:31.985
(intense music)
