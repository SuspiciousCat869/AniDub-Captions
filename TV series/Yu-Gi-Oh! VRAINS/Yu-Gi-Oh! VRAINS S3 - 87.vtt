WEBVTT

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:05.673
(Ai)
Previously on
Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS...

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:09.075
(Kolter)
Mirror Link Vrains is merging
with the original!

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.679
(gasping)

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.247
(grunting)

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.128
(grunts)

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.134
What is that?

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.235
(groans)

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:37.137
A barrier?

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:39.640
(gasps)

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.441
(Lightning)
Greetings, Spectre,

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.476
and all of those tuning in.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.811
It's Lightning!

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.914
I take it you plan to duel
each of us separately?

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.983
Precisely.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:51.652
And I chose you to
be first, my friend.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.987
I see.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:54.121
Well, then-

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.755
Let's duel! Let's duel!

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.658
I pay 800 life points...

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.460
(timer beeping)

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.560
to activate the spell

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.529
SUNVINE PLUNDER!

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.332
It allows me to take control
of your spell card...

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:05.699
meaning JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.035
is mine!

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.236
What?

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.470
What I don't own,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.006
I'll just simply steal from you.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.810
I now Link Summon!

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.214
Link 1 SUNAVALON DRYAS!

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.381
(computer chirping)

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.683
(grunts)

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.919
Spectre stole control
of the duel with his DRYAS!

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.321
True, but there's still
a lot of duel left.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.924
The outcome is far from decided.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.952
(electronic whirring)

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.388
(Pigeon)
What a duel, Boss!

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.124
I thought Lightning took
an insurmountable lead,

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:39.459
but Spectre just
surmounted it!

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.328
Yeah, cuz here's a fun fact:

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:41.962
Most folks say
Spectr

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.464
e's got better

00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:46.266
dueling skills than Varis!

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.435
That's neither fun
nor a fact Boss.

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:49.136
(grunts)

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.404
Wise guy.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:51.605
(computer chirping)

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.540
I may have underestimated you,
my friend.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.876
You succeeded in
stopping my strategy

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.412
of stopping your strategy.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:02:59.613
<i>Indeed, I did,</i>

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.348
<i>and I can't say
it was difficult.</i>

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.784
<i>You see, us humans
have a gut instinct</i>

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.051
<i>to sense trouble</i>

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.389
<i>while you Ignis don't
even have a gut.</i>

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.392
Nor the guts to pull off
a maneuver like mine.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.727
(grunts)

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.862
We shall see.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:16.964
It's my turn.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:17.731
I draw.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.367
Due to PILUS PRIOR's ability,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.002
I can add the three cards

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:26.206
I banished on my previous
turn to my hand.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.708
By restocking his hand,

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.110
Lightning's got
a buncha new options.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.546
But since Spectre stole
his JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.181
those options are limited.

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.515
(Ai)
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.685
But if anyone can make
the most out of a bad situation,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.519
it'd be-

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.855
well, me first,

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:43.023
but a close second
would be Lightning.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.160
I activate the spell card,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.529
ARMATOS REPLACEMENT!

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.998
Bytributingan ARMATOS LEGIO,

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:53.700
I can summon
a different ARMATOS LEGIO

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.702
from my graveyard

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:57.605
that has equal or fewer
Link Arrows.

00:03:57.605 --> 00:03:59.507
So I tribute Link 2

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:01.742
ARMATOS LEGIO PILUS PRIOR

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.110
to resurrect

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.279
Link 2 ARMATOS
LEGIO CENTURION.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:06.914
(grunts)

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:08.448
(computer chirping)

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.786
And that triggers
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM's effect.

00:04:12.786 --> 00:04:14.722
I can discard a Level 4

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.858
or lower ARMATOS LEGIO
from my hand

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.761
to revive even more
ARMATOS LEGIOS

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.462
from my graveyard.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.798
In essence,

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:25.533
I exchange my GALEA

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.901
for SCUTUM and SICA!

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:30.371
(computer chirping)

00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.040
And that allows me
to illuminate my circuit!

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.076
The summoning conditions require

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.213
at least two
ARMATOS LEGIO monsters.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:40.680
(shooting)

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.216
I Link Summon!

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:48.088
Link 3 ARMATOS
LEGIO LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.791
(grunting)

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:54.594
(computer chirping)

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:56.597
Now I'll use

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.233
LEGATUS LEGIONIS's
special ability

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.501
to strengthen
my battle formation

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.905
by exchanging an ARMATOS LEGIO
on my field

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.674
with a different one
in my graveyard.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.643
GALEA, replace SCUTUM

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.944
and take your place

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:13.514
next to LEGATUS LEGIONIS's link.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:14.448
(computer chirping)

00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:17.484
With that, I end my turn.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.086
So he replaced this with that

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:22.356
and moved that to this so
that that did this to that.

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:23.257
Got that?

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:24.258
If you're trying to say that

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:27.127
Lightning is setting up
for something big,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.428
you couldn't be more clear.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:28.929
All that but not

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.264
a single attack?

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:31.532
(scoffs)

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.466
Do

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:34.935
n't expect the same from me!

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.804
I summon SUNSEED TWIN!

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.774
(computer chirping)

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:44.311
Then I'll activate its ability!

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.980
SUNSEED TWIN can resummon

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.317
a Plant-Type monster
from my graveyard.

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:53.653
Rebloom, SUNSEED GENIUS LOCI!

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:55.822
(computer chirping)

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.591
And with that,

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.594
I can now manifest my circuit.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:01.728
The summoning conditions are

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.730
at least two Plant
type monsters,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.832
one of which is a Link Monster.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.501
I Link Summon!

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.371
Link 3 SUNAVALON MELIAS!

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.204
(computer chirping)

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.340
And when I summon...

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.407
MELIAS...

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.476
Its special ability activates,

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.379
regrowing one Plant monster
from my graveyard

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.981
in defense mode!

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:23.851
Once again
I present GENIUS LOCI!

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.352
(computer chirping)

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:26.253
No.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:27.421
Oh, yes!

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:30.323
And next, allow me
to hit the repeat button.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.227
I Link Summon a second MELIAS!

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.664
(computer chirping)

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:40.066
And just like earlier...

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.670
MELIAS regrows my GENIUS LOCI.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.672
That means like
a loop within a loop,

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:47.907
I can Link Summon again.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:51.879
But I think I'll summon
a different monster this time.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.814
Watch as I Link Summon...

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.384
Link 1 SUNVINE THRASHER!

00:06:56.384 --> 00:06:57.384
(computer chirping)

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:59.019
When I summon my THRASHER

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.088
next to SUNAVALON MELIAS,

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.123
it gains 800 attack points

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:05.659
from each of MELIAS's links.

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:08.662
Since MELIAS is Link 3,

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:09.963
my THRASHER gains

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.632
(timer beeping)
2400 attack points!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.634
And what's more,

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.968
if THRASHER attacks,

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.905
JUDGMENT ARROWS
will double its attack points.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:19.039
This is adding up to

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.441
a significant amount of damage.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.709
In that case,

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:25.545
I activate LEGATUS
LEGIONIS's ability

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.415
to exchange ARMATOS LEGIO GALEA

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:31.752
with ARMATOS LEGIO SCUTUM.
(computer chirping)

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:33.320
How does that help?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.921
Ha!

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.155
It doesn't.

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.326
Especially when I activate

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.962
MELIAS's second ability.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:43.263
My THRASHER can attack

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.565
for every SUNAVALON
Link Monster

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:46.800
on the field.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.901
So my THRASHER

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.270
can attack three times.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.705
(grunts)

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:52.639
That's nuts!

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.608
6400 attack points

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:56.209
and three attacks is-?

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.044
Is what ya need,

00:07:57.044 --> 00:07:57.778
if ya wanna turn the lights

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:00.480
out on Lightning!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.848
Time to battle!

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:02.883
SUNVINE THRASHER,

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:06.052
attack LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:10.857
Time to battle!

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.292
SUNVINE THRASHER,

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.328
attack LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:18.698
I don't think so.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.967
My CENTURION's special ability

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:23.870
can negate your attack
once per turn.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:26.873
(roars)

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:28.542
Fine.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:29.843
Then I'll just attack again!

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.345
SUNVINE THRASHER,

00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.515
strike LEGATUS LEGIONIS!

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:35.849
And JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.384
will double its attack points

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:39.052
to 6400!

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:40.153
(timer beeping)

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.022
That's enough damage

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.323
to end the duel.

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:44.825
And end the war.

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.860
So whattaya say we logout
and hit the park

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.128
and feed some squirrels?

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:48.695
It

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.964
's not over yet.

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:53.066
By sending GALEA
to the graveyard,

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:55.669
its special ability activates.

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:57.871
When LEGATUS LEGIONIS battles,

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.208
the damage I take
is dropped to 0.

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:04.278
In addition, my SCUTUM
has its own ability.

00:09:04.278 --> 00:09:06.747
When it's linked
to LEGATUS LEGIONIS,

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.282
my armored knight
can't be destroyed in battle

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.084
once per turn.

00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:12.252
(timer beeping)

00:09:13.421 --> 00:09:14.421
Aww!

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.257
That means
no squirrels time?

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:20.760
But I still have
a third and final attack!

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.296
(timer beeping)

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:23.363
Yes.

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:26.100
But due to GALEA,
I take no damage.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.569
But LEGATUS LEGIONIS
will be destroyed.

00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:30.270
(roaring)

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.045
That was tougher than it looked.

00:09:38.045 --> 00:09:40.848
Yes, but the effort
was worth it.

00:09:40.848 --> 00:09:42.449
When my SUNVINE THRASHER

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:44.585
destroys your monster in battle,

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.420
I get to take control of it

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.590
and summon it next
to my SUNAVALON's link!

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.924
So in other words...

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:51.726
your monster will now

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:54.728
be fighting for me!

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.864
(roars)

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:57.698
(computer chirping)

00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:59.233
LEGATUS LEGIONIS,

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:01.735
attack and destroy
that CENTURION!

00:10:01.735 --> 00:10:02.903
(horse neighing)

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.238
(grunts)

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.209
(timer beeping)

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:12.579
That's the last of my attacks.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.181
But not the last of my moves

00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:17.084
since I was reminded
of a trick from you,

00:10:17.084 --> 00:10:19.854
one which I'll now implement
by activating my spell

00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:21.755
SUNVINE CROSS BREED.

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.258
By tributing
a Link Monster on my field,

00:10:24.258 --> 00:10:26.426
I can resummon
a Plant-Type monster

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:27.761
from my graveyard.

00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:31.097
So I tribute my
SUNVINE THRASHER!

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.633
And regrow this!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.202
SUNAVALON DAPHNE!

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:36.904
(computer chirping)

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:38.371
I'll follow that up...

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.840
by activating SUNVINE SHRINE!

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.743
It lets me summon another
Plant from my graveyard

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.580
to join my arboreal assortment.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.750
SUNSEED GENIUS LOCI!

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.351
(laughing maniacally)

00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.588
And this is where my genius
comes to fruit!

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:55.556
(laughs)

00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:58.225
With one final Link Summon!

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:00.995
I see now.

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:03.931
See what?
Cuz he made it sound scary!

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:05.866
Now take to the field...

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.601
SUNVINE THRASHER!

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.768
(computer chirping)

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:14.174
(Playmaker)
Spectre controls
both Extra Monster Zones.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.978
(laughing)

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:18.645
Huh?

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:26.587
(Spectre)
I've created an Extra Link!

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:29.089
Just like the Ignis did.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:31.124
But now the tables
are turned.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.794
Since I once again summoned

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:35.996
SUNVINE THRASHER

00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:37.932
next to SUNAVALON MELIAS,

00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:39.833
it gains 800 attack points

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.968
from each of MELIAS's links.

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:45.238
(timer beeping)

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.276
I finally did it, Master Varis.

00:11:49.276 --> 00:11:51.444
I finally accomplished
what you did

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.948
in your duel against Playmaker.

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:56.950
I created the Extra Link!

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.819
The Extra Link is the height

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:01.422
of summoning perfection!

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:05.893
Proof that I have mastered
the craft of dueling...

00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:08.095
or so I thought until you...

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.096
you Ignis...

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:12.065
You accomplished
the same feat as well.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.767
Therefore, I must go further

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.703
and perfect perfection...

00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:18.539
by going and creating
the ultimate

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:20.207
Extra Link!

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.575
Hmm?

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.878
To do that, I'll start
by activating

00:12:23.878 --> 00:12:26.713
SUNSEED SHADOW's
special ability!

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:29.316
By banishing this card
from my graveyard,

00:12:29.316 --> 00:12:31.751
I can target a Plant
monster on my field

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.420
that's currently Extra Linked,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.156
such as my SUNAVALON DAPHNE.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.027
And by doing so,

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:41.896
I can summon a second copy

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:43.330
of SUNAVALON DAPHNE

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.431
from my deck

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:47.034
and co-link it
with the rest of my monsters

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.403
to make an even bigger
Extra Link!

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:51.171
An Extra Link so large

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:53.874
that it ties seven
monsters together!

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:54.875
(rumbling)

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:57.344
(gasps)

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.580
How very impressive, Spectre.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.080
You've accomplished
what even I couldn

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.917
't do.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:03.950
(computer chirping)

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.619
The ultimate Extra Link
that connects

00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.388
every single monster space

00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:09.757
on your side of the field.

00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:10.624
That ain't polite...

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:11.625
cuz that's a whole lot of arrows

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:13.961
doin' a whole lot of pointin'.

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:15.629
With my perfect field,

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:18.932
I shall manifest
my perfect monster!

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:20.735
The summoning conditions require

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:23.204
at least two Plants!

00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:24.771
(laughing)

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.574
I Link Summon!

00:13:26.574 --> 00:13:30.110
Link 3 SUNAVALON DRYANOME!

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:35.916
(computer chirping)

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:38.151
Your demise Light Ignis

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.086
has taken root!

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.227
(Spectre)
As my field flourishes,

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:50.130
your odds of victory
dim, Light Ignis.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.298
For one thing,

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:53.467
your monsters
aren't allowed to attack

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:55.936
my SUNAVALON DRYANOME.

00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:57.404
Yes, I know.

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:58.972
I also know that thrice
per turn,

00:13:58.972 --> 00:14:00.774
if I damage your life points,

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:03.844
your DRYANOME can summon
a SUNVINE Link Monster

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:05.012
from your Extra Deck

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.214
to regain those life points.

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.683
I did say that I did
my research on you,

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:10.650
my friend.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:11.385
Oh, that

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:12.653
's right.

00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:14.054
Then you're also aware

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:16.457
that if you attack a monster
next to DRYANOME's link,

00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:18.993
I can move that monster
to a different location

00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:21.862
on my field
to negate that attack.

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:25.199
And here's one last move
to strengthen my team!

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:27.368
I banish SUNSEED TWIN

00:14:27.368 --> 00:14:29.103
from my graveyard...

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:31.671
and LEGATUS LEGIONIS
from my field

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.775
to resummon SUNVINE THRASHER!

00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:35.843
(computer chirping)

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:37.444
And its special ability

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:39.179
increases its attack points!

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.180
(timer beeping)

00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:44.485
That's one ferocious forest.

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:45.685
Yeah!

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:48.022
If he keeps this going,
Lightning's zapped!

00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:50.290
Hey, that should be
the headline!

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.291
(scoffs)

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.360
For a duelist
I deemed the weakest

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.829
in this mirror world,

00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:56.496
you're not half bad.

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:58.031
How nice of you.

00:14:58.031 --> 00:15:00.935
But a backhanded compliment
is still a compliment.

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:01.401
Though it does hurt

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.870
that you rank me

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.005
below a frog and a pigeon.

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:07.073
Well, I've never seen them duel,

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.075
so logically,

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.610
they may possess
greater skills than you.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.379
Then please allow me
to judge you

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.714
by the same criteria.

00:15:13.714 --> 00:15:15.182
You said that you prefer

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:17.384
to defeat
the weakest duelists first.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.085
So isn't it logical to assume
that i

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.220
t's because

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.224
you lack the skills
to defeat the best duelists?

00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:23.924
Hmm?

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.092
No,

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.762
that is not logical to assume!

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.898
Do not think
you're better than me!

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:33.133
The Ignis are inferior

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.902
to no human!

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:36.336
Whoa!

00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:38.405
I've never seen Lightning
lose his cool before.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.873
Now calm down.

00:15:39.873 --> 00:15:42.909
We're only having a delightful
conversation, my friend.

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:44.011
I am calm.

00:15:44.011 --> 00:15:45.613
And I am not your friend.

00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:47.248
And I am here to duel,

00:15:47.248 --> 00:15:49.583
not to have
a delightful conversation.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.851
Well then,

00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:52.920
why don't you go ahead
and make your move.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.555
Oh, I will!

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:55.622
I draw!

00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.759
You are not more intelligent
than me!

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:02.829
In fact, did you actually think
that you stole

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:05.165
JUDGMENT ARROWS
from under my nose?

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:05.799
Wrong.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.133
I let you have it!

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.670
Oh, my-

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.438
judging by the look
on your face,

00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:13.273
you didn't know that.

00:16:13.273 --> 00:16:16.076
It was all a set up
to unleash my end game-

00:16:16.076 --> 00:16:18.678
starting with this spell card!

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.981
JUDGMENT SWORD!

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:24.117
When you have Link Monsters
in the Extra Monster Zone

00:16:24.117 --> 00:16:25.753
while I do not...

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:27.988
I can banish one of
those Link Monsters

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:30.524
to summon an ARMATOS LEGIO

00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.459
with the same number of links.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.495
You can say your Extra Link

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.663
is actually helping me now.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:37.998
(gasps)

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:40.701
Afterwards, I resummon your
banished monster

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.602
to your Main Monster Zone.

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.304
Now here I go.

00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:48.809
I banish your

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:52.245
SUNAVALON DRYANOME!

00:16:58.152 --> 00:16:59.286
(Lightning laughing)

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:01.755
I may not be able
to attack your tree

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:02.556
with a monster,

00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:03.523
but nothing says I could

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.159
n't
use a spell against it.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:07.060
(grunts)

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.061
This doesn't change a thing!

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:08.929
I still have plenty of monsters

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:11.665
remaining on my field

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:12.732
to protect me!

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.368
Indeed, you do.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.636
But I now get a monster too.

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:20.073
ARMATOS LEGIO TRIBUNUS MILITUM!

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:22.509
(computer chirping)

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.710
And your DRYANOOME

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.180
is resummoned
to your Main Monster Zone.

00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:29.649
(computer chirping)

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.387
Next, I activate

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.856
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM's effect!

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.225
I discard an ARMATOS LEGIO

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:39.726
from my hand to summon

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.562
SPECULATA, GLADIUS and SICA

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.065
next to TRIBUNUS MILITUM's links

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:47.168
in defense mode.

00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:48.368
(computer chirping)

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.904
But they won't remain
on my field for long

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.374
because I'm using
them and SCUTUM

00:17:53.374 --> 00:17:55.742
to illuminate my circuit!

00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:58.879
Bear witness to the commander

00:17:58.879 --> 00:18:01.281
who leads the might
of the military!

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:02.950
I Link Summon!

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.285
Link 4

00:18:04.285 --> 00:18:08.622
ARMATOS LEGIO MAGNUS DUX!

00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:11.291
(computer chirping)

00:18:14.828 --> 00:18:16.330
(Lightning)
I Link Summon!

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.565
Link 4

00:18:17.565 --> 00:18:21.902
ARMATOS LEGIO MAGNUS DUX!

00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:22.936
(computer chirping)

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:26.306
Is that an armored elephant?

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:29.944
What it is Ai,
is trouble for Spectre.

00:18:29.944 --> 00:18:32.646
(Lightning)
For every monster
it's co-linked to,

00:18:32.646 --> 00:18:34.781
MAGNUS DUX's special ability

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.450
returns a card on the field

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.819
or in the graveyard
to the owner's hand.

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:42.155
And there's one particular spell

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:43.723
I have my eye on.

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:45.492
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.826
Aww, glitch!

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:49.663
Lightning's gonna steal back
what Spectre stole!

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:51.098
Na-ah-ah.

00:18:51.098 --> 00:18:53.099
You're not allowed
to target my JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:56.604
due to SUNVINE PLUNDER's effect.

00:18:56.604 --> 00:18:58.372
And what you can't target,

00:18:58.372 --> 00:19:00.207
you can't steal back.

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:01.775
That would be true-

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:04.678
if I didn't have
my TRIBUNUS MILITUM.

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:05.345
When it's linked

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:07.013
to a Link Monster,

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:08.949
I can negate a card
on the field

00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:11.785
for every link
that that Link Monster has.

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:13.820
Now if the multiple use
of the word "link"

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.021
confuses you,

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.190
allow me to clear it up for you.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.860
This monster is
linked to MAGNUS DUX.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.629
And MAGNUS DUX
has four Link Arrows.

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:24.965
Therefore,
I can negate four cards:

00:19:24.965 --> 00:19:27.368
SUNVINE SHRINE, PLUNDER,
CROSS BREED

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:29.703
and SUNAVALON DRYANOME!

00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:31.104
(grunts)

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:32.372
(Lightning)
Frustrated?

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:35.509
Yes, I would be too
if I was in your position.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:38.846
Because now that that I negated
SUNVINE PLUNDER's effect,

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.614
MAGNUS DUX can target your

00:19:40.614 --> 00:19:43.984
-make that my-
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:19:48.155 --> 00:19:49.557
Now that JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:19:49.557 --> 00:19:50.824
is back in my hand,

00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:53.393
it sets off a chain
of cataclysmic events

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:54.394
on your field.

00:19:54.394 --> 00:19:56.530
Did you not for a single moment

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.700
consider how easy it was
to take my JUDGMENT ARROWS?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.637
Your arrogance is going
to cost you everything!

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:06.006
When JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:20:06.006 --> 00:20:08.342
leaves your Spell and Trap Zone,

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:10.610
all monsters that were next
to its links

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.212
are destroyed!

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.618
(grunts)

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:19.520
This can't be happening!

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.889
Oh, it is, my friend.

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.123
And when your THRASHERS

00:20:23.123 --> 00:20:24.992
are not next
to a SUNAVALON's link,

00:20:24.992 --> 00:20:27.561
they're also destroyed.

00:20:29.363 --> 00:20:31.164
This is a disaster.

00:20:31.164 --> 00:20:33.033
Spectre's monsters are almost

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:36.103
totally wiped out!

00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:38.972
Now I'll play
what's rightfully mine!

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:41.975
The Link Spell JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:46.012
Any last words?

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:49.316
I didn't think so.

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:50.184
MAGNUS DUX,

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:53.787
attack SUNAVALON DRYANOME!

00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:55.689
And JUDGMENT ARROWS's effect

00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:58.825
doubles MAGNUS DUX's
attack points!

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:00.894
(timer beeping)

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:01.728
(gasps)

00:21:03.063 --> 00:21:04.064
(blasting)

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:08.768
(groaning)

00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:16.743
(timer beeping)

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.012
(gasps)
Spectre!

00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:20.181
(groans)

00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:21.748
I may have failed...

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:23.617
B-But Varis...

00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:25.118
He'll stop you.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:26.686
No, he won't.

00:21:26.686 --> 00:21:29.089
He'll end up the same as you:

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:30.557
gone.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:38.299
Wait.

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:39.900
Let's hold on to his data.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.537
Because even the weak
have their uses.

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:45.439
That's over.

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:46.740
Or not!

00:21:47.674 --> 00:21:49.877
(Windy laughing)

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:51.912
Well done, well done!

00:21:51.912 --> 00:21:54.582
One down and so many
delightful prey to go.

00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:55.549
So,

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:56.450
who shall I hunt down

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.751
and dissect and desiccate

00:21:57.751 --> 00:21:59.052
and eradicate?

00:21:59.052 --> 00:21:59.586
How about...

00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:01.187
you.

00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:33.320
(electronic whirring)
