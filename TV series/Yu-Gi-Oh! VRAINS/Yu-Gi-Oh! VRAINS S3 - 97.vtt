WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.070
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:05.605
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:08.575
Varis!

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.446
Now that we're all together,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.616
I think it's time I share
a little secret the Light Ignis

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.517
has been keeping
from all of you.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.521
A little secret known
as Project Ignis Futura.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.692
It's a simulation
that the Light Ignis ran

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:26.994
that predicted
the future of the Ignis.

00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:30.431
And the Light Ignis discovered
something it did not expect.

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.467
That the humans could coexist
with the Ignis.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:34.935
What?
Huh?

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.772
Humans could coexist
with five of the six Ignis.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.110
This single Ignis is why humans
and Ignis cannot coexist.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.180
Because it is the very source
of all our conflict.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.983
And that's the secret
the Light Ignis was hiding.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.452
Because this sixth Ignis,
is the Light Ignis!

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.022
Silence yourself.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.757
You're no leader.
You're barely anything.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.661
You're a flawed program.
Just a glitch in the matrix.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.999
You are not superior
to me, human!

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.168
The Ignis are the perfect
form of existence,

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.972
I am the most perfect
of all the Ignis!

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:13.640
(Varis)
I Link Summon!

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.843
Link 4 BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.882
Listen, Light Ignis...

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:25.352
You may theoretically think
you're prepared for everything,

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.320
but you're not
prepared for this!

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.030
♪♪♪

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.654
(Pigeon)
Boss, Varis summoned
one of his best monsters,

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:34.788
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.758
He sure did!

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:40.594
And with that thing out he's got
more than enough power to blast

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.997
Lightning's monster
to itty bitty pieces!

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:46.133
It's just what he needed
to turn this duel around!

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.902
I activate
BORRELOAD's ability!

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.542
It lowers your PLUMBUM TRIDENT's
attack and defense points

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.244
by a total of 500.

00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:59.580
And my favorite part
about this is that

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.548
you can't do anything
to stop it.

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.152
BORRELOAD, attack!

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.855
Thunder Borrel Cannon!

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.991
Fire!

00:03:13.494 --> 00:03:17.397
(loud roaring, blast)

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.303
He blasted it to bits!

00:03:22.303 --> 00:03:23.971
But, wait a sec...

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.707
Couldn't Varis have used
BORRELOAD's second ability

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:28.809
to take control
of Lightning's monster

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.477
instead of destroying it?

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.480
Yes, but by destroying
his monster

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.316
instead of stealing it, he was
able to deal greater damage

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.818
to Lightning's life points.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.553
Ah, I get it!

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.056
This is one of those rare times
where it pays not to steal!

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:46.560
Varis, you made
the most logical, decision.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.329
As I knew you would.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:53.167
And that predictability is what
makes you easy to exploit.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.802
Is that so?

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.605
(Lightning)
Yes, you really are
a dear friend

00:03:57.605 --> 00:03:59.340
for aiding in my strategy.

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:03.276
I activate PLUMBUM
TRIDENT's special ability

00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:04.377
from my graveyard!

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.381
When it's destroyed in battle,

00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:11.585
I can take JUDGMENT ARROWS from
my deck and add it to my hand.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.253
(grunts)

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.390
I now have the card
you specifically

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.058
didn't want me to have.

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.561
This isn't good at all.

00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.798
Lightning just tricked Varis
into doing exactly

00:04:23.798 --> 00:04:25.266
what he wanted him to do.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:28.501
Yeah. Maybe Varis shouldn't
let him do that next time.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:32.373
I activate PLUMBUM TRIDENT's
additional ability

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:34.207
to return it to my field,

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:36.877
not as a monster,
but as a Link Spell.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.949
And it has an effect you know
nothing about my friend.

00:04:43.884 --> 00:04:45.853
You have a new
Link Spell, huh?

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:50.257
So JUDGMENT ARROWS isn't the
only Link Spell in existence.

00:04:50.557 --> 00:04:54.061
A new Link Spell would open up
a whole new set of strategies.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:57.264
Yeah, and not a single one of'em
will be good for Varis!

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.738
(Lightning)
Varis, I thought
you despised AIs,

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:06.239
but perhaps not.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.510
You're only in this predicament
because you behaved like an AI,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.512
optimizing every move.

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:14.147
I never said that I hated AIs.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.016
I just hate you.

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:18.085
(grunts)

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.955
Well, my friend
what you feel is irrelevant

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.492
because feelings have no effect
on the cards themselves.

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:28.528
And the cards say
that I have the advantage.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.597
It's my turn.

00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:31.965
I draw.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.903
I activate the effect of my Link
Spell PLUMBUM TRIDENT.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.941
Huh? What do you think
it does?

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:43.176
I believe we're about
to find out.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.413
It not only returns
a Link Monster in my graveyard

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:47.781
to my Extra Deck,

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:50.150
but it also resurrects
a different Link Monster

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.121
from my graveyard and summons it
next to PLUMBUM TRIDENT's link.

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:57.457
In other words,
I return DECURION to my deck

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.227
and summon my CENTURION
to the field.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:05.032
Next, I activate ARMATOS
COLOSSEUM's effect.

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:07.401
By discarding SICA
from my hand,

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:12.172
I can summon both ARMATOS LEGIO
SEGMENTATA and GLADIUS

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:14.341
next to my CENTURION's links.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.479
And that gives me the monster
I need to illuminate my circuit!

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:30.190
I Link Summon Link 1
ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:34.561
Lightning now has a monster
whose Link Arrow

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.864
points to his
Spell and Trap Zone.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.167
Which allows him to play
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:41.067
(groans)

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.837
All your work to stop me
from playing

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:46.206
JUDGMENT ARROWS was for not.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.843
Yes, I'm so very
disappointed.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.878
You find this amusing?

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:55.682
It amuses me that you'd think
I wouldn't be ready for this.

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:56.349
(grunts)

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.919
It's absolutely true
that you did manage

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.054
to counter one of my strategies.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.924
But what kind of primitive
program wouldn't expect me

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.559
to have a Plan B?

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.262
I activate my trap
MIND CRUSH!

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.598
I'll say the name of a card,

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:14.000
and if you happen to have
that card in your hand,

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.070
you have to discard it.

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:19.239
I'm sure you know
which card I'll choose.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:24.277
I choose the Link Spell
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:36.323
You found a way to destroy
my JUDGMENT ARROWS?

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.259
(Ai)
Duh, obviously.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:41.094
It appears Varis
outsmarted Lightning.

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:43.296
C'mon, Lightning,

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.999
you gotta do better than that.

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.334
How didn't you know
Varis had something sneaky

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:48.568
in his backpocket?

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:53.407
You may have had a Plan B,
but I have a Plan C.

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:56.043
And the C stands for circuit!

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.578
The summoning conditions
require at least

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.814
three ARMATOS LEGIO monsters!

00:08:02.716 --> 00:08:08.622
I Link Summon! Link 4 ARMATOS
LEGIO MAGNUS DUX!

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:14.294
I activate ARMATOS LEGIO
SEGMENTATA's

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.464
special ability
from my graveyard.

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:20.167
In exchange for a thousand
of my life points,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:24.338
I can return all the monsters
I used to Link Summon

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.840
MAGNUS DUX back to my deck.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.113
That leaves five cards
in my graveyard.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.818
However, I get to return a card
for each of MAGNUS DUX's links.

00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:40.553
MAGNUS DUX is a
Link 4 monster,

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:43.490
so he's getting four of
his remaining five cards back!

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:47.394
I return ARMATOS
LEGIO SPECULATA, GLADIUS

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:49.363
and two SICAS to my deck.

00:08:49.663 --> 00:08:52.566
And SEGEMENTATA
has one final ability,

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:57.104
you get to choose one card in my
graveyard and add it to my hand.

00:08:57.471 --> 00:08:59.340
Not that you have
much of a choice,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.108
since there's only one card
in my graveyard.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.344
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.014
That's correct, my friend.

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:09.950
Similar to how you had
multiple ways to prevent me

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.385
from getting JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:15.288
I also had multiple ways to
prevent you from preventing me

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:17.090
from getting JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.059
(laughs)

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:23.396
Don't you find this challenge
quite entertaining, my friend?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.534
Our two minds
engaged in combat,

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:31.772
seeing which of us can outsmart,
outwit and outthink the other.

00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:36.410
And in our battle of wills,
it is I who comes out ahead,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.114
for JUDGMENT ARROWS
has returned to my hand.

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:43.850
Aww glitch! You think Varis
has a Plan D or E?

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.421
Well Ai, if he doesn't have
another strategy ready to go,

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:49.957
then Varis is
in serious trouble.

00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.024
(Ai sighs)

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:54.761
And there's no trouble more
serious than serious trouble!

00:09:56.563 --> 00:10:00.233
I activate the Link Spell,
JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.837
With it, I'm now fully
prepared to strike!

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:11.545
MAGNUS DUX, attack
BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.748
I activate BORRELOAD's
special ability!

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.182
Enemy Negation!

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:20.254
This special ability

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:23.056
lowers your monster's
attack points by 500,

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.925
and no matter what you try...

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:27.561
there's nothing you can do
to stop it from happening!

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:34.067
My dear friend, 500
is nothing but a trifle.

00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.503
You must do more
than that to stop me!

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.107
Because JUDGMENT ARROWS's effect

00:10:40.107 --> 00:10:43.009
doubles MAGNUS DUX's
attack points!

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:46.447
(explosion roars)

00:10:46.614 --> 00:10:47.881
(groans)

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:51.051
(Lightning)
With the completion
of that attack,

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.953
I shall now end my turn.

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:58.592
(Ai)
Lightning currently has
1700 life points,

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.261
but Varis has 2000.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.796
Varis may have more life points
than Lightning,

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.632
but Lightning's ahead
in all other facets of the duel.

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.968
(Lightning)
When I created
JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.438
I knew it would prove
to be an effective weapon

00:11:10.438 --> 00:11:11.839
against you humans.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:15.776
But even I could not predict
how effective it would be.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.080
Yeah, you can even say
it's kinda like... cheating.

00:11:20.814 --> 00:11:23.283
That's quite the accusation,
my friend.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:27.454
I don't need to cheat
to defeat a human.

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.623
(Varis)
You cheat all the time,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.326
even outside of a duel,
to get what you want.

00:11:33.326 --> 00:11:35.629
And the other
Ignis know it as well.

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:37.864
What exactly do you mean?

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:42.068
Do you remember what the Fire
Ignis said about the Wind Ignis?

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:45.272
How it said the Wind Ignis
was not the same Ignis

00:11:45.272 --> 00:11:46.439
that it once was.

00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.776
Weren't you
the least bit suspicious?

00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:53.246
(Ai)
Well... Yeah...
of course we were.

00:11:54.515 --> 00:11:55.816
What happened to you?

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.452
The Windy I knew back in the
Cyberse was my friend.

00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:00.755
He wasn't twisted with hate,
but peaceful,

00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:02.189
loving and carefree.

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:05.192
Carefree?
I was never carefree.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:06.994
But I do care.
To be free.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:09.163
Free from your amateur analysis.

00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:11.932
Wrong, Windy.
I know the real you.

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:13.567
And this isn't you.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.470
The real Windy would never
betray the Cyberse

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.138
and destroy our homeworld.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:21.308
You changed,
and I want to know why.

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:25.512
Then I guess you never knew me.
The real me. Not even a little.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.348
I guess when I think about it,

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:30.317
the old Windy was pretty chill,

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:32.652
not like the new Windy
who is chilling.

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.755
But I figured
he changed his ‘tude

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:36.690
'cuz he had to pick
a side in this war.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.225
It did change, Ignis.

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:40.161
But not because it wanted to.

00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:42.996
It changed because it was
programmed to.

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.334
Programmed to be evil...
by Lightning.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:48.668
(Ai)
What?

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.045
(Ai)
You're saying
Lightning rewrote

00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:01.281
Windy's emotional programming
so that he'd be evil?

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:02.883
Exactly.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.584
No way...

00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:06.286
Why would
Lightning do that?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.589
Why don't you ask it directly?

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:10.290
It's standing right there.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:14.161
Odd how all of a sudden,
you have nothing to say.

00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.429
Very well then.

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:17.264
Allow me to fill in
the blanks.

00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:20.233
When I checked the Light
Ignis's secret files,

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:21.568
the Wind Ignis...

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:25.039
originally had no intention
of harming mankind.

00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:29.810
In fact, its compatibility
with humans stood at 98%.

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:32.913
Meaning it wouldn't
help the Light Ignis

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.915
in its war against humanity.

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:38.285
So the Light Ignis rewrote
the Wind Ignis's program

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:41.088
to despise humans,
taking control of it,

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.889
and ensuring it would join
its side

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:44.591
in its war
against the humans.

00:13:44.758 --> 00:13:47.661
So Windy was only fighting
against us because of Lightning.

00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:48.729
And in the end...

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:50.764
was deleted because of him.

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:51.832
(Ai)
No...

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.601
Even Lightning wouldn't fiddle
with our brains...

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:56.102
would he?

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:59.239
Aye, my friend,
everything Varis said regarding

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:01.508
this one particular issue...

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:02.375
is true.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.146
But this is a case where
the facts are misleading

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:07.480
because he has reached
the wrong conclusion.

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:08.949
What conclusion?

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.651
That you're willing to do
anything to win,

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:12.153
even if it means
hurting your friends?

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:14.988
No, that I will do
whatever it takes to ensure

00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.557
the safety of the Ignis.

00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:18.459
You're doing quite
the bang up job,

00:14:18.459 --> 00:14:20.794
since the only Ignis left
are me and you!

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.731
No, the other Ignis live on
inside Bohman.

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:26.867
That supposed to
twinkle my toes?

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:29.469
And for all I know,
you're lying again!

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:30.604
(Lightning chuckles)

00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:32.706
This is no lie, my friend.

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.808
But I do understand
your skepticism

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:37.878
because Varis has eloquently
muddled the issue.

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.980
So allow me to re-simplify it.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.316
It comes down to one fact
that we all agree upon:

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.287
Humans and Ignis cannot coexist.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.388
Yeah, because of you!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.892
The other Ignis could coexist
if you weren't around!

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.328
And are you willing
to forsake me,

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.563
a fellow Ignis, that easily?

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:59.166
(Ai)
Uh, no... But...

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:03.003
Then it remains true that humans
and Ignis cannot coexist.

00:15:03.904 --> 00:15:07.708
This will only end when one side
conquers the other.

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:10.878
That's the one thing,
and only thing,

00:15:10.878 --> 00:15:14.114
that the Light Ignis
and I actually both agree on.

00:15:14.848 --> 00:15:16.916
Yes. Agreed.

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.054
Which is something
I never thought possible.

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:23.290
We humans and you Ignis are
fundamentally different

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.793
as we strive to live life
to the fullest,

00:15:25.793 --> 00:15:29.295
treating each day as a precious
gift that comes only once.

00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:33.567
Our DNA doesn't allow for us
to be recreated over and over

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:35.368
with the press of a few buttons.

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:37.538
Humans must not be deleted

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:39.372
and I'm going to make sure
that doesn't happen

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:41.274
by defeating you here and now!

00:15:41.541 --> 00:15:44.879
Please try your
very best, my friend.

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:48.548
Although your best will never be
good enough to beat me.

00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:50.083
We shall see.

00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:51.785
But know this,

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.588
this is the beginning
of your demise, Ignis!

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.389
It is now my turn!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.725
I draw!

00:15:58.192 --> 00:16:01.795
I'm activating...
BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH's effect!

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:06.299
Since you have more
monsters than me,

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:08.836
I can resurrect a ROKKET
from my graveyard

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.171
to help even up the count.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.442
So without wasting anymore time
I will do just that.

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:18.478
Come on back,
MAGNAROKKET DRAGON!

00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:24.317
Next I summon
ESTRANGEMENT DRAGON!

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:28.622
I've never seen
that monster before.

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:31.825
But it only has
1500 attack points.

00:16:32.359 --> 00:16:34.127
Since I have JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:37.931
you can't destroy my monster
unless you have at least 5000.

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:40.267
Haven't you learned by now,

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.269
that you should never
underestimate me.

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:44.137
Or any of my monsters!

00:16:44.738 --> 00:16:47.908
I activate ESTRANGEMENT
DRAGON's special ability!

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.577
When I successfully
summon this monster,

00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:54.581
I can summon a second copy
from my deck on to your field!

00:16:58.652 --> 00:16:59.786
My field?

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.989
Consider it a little gift,

00:17:01.989 --> 00:17:05.091
but like anyone who's ever had
a bad birthday can attest,

00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:07.661
not all gifts
will be to your liking.

00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:11.532
If I can read between the lines,
I think Varis has a plan.

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:13.700
I don't think
he was being that subtle.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.671
I overlay my Level 4
ESTRANGEMENT DRAGON...

00:17:18.071 --> 00:17:19.840
and MAGNAROKKET DRAGON

00:17:20.174 --> 00:17:23.176
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:31.652
When steel and darkness
synergize into one,

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:34.021
the portal to the edge
of the universe

00:17:34.021 --> 00:17:36.690
opens to invite
its solitary denizen!

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.226
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:42.263 --> 00:17:46.366
Rank 4 BORRELOAD
EXCHARGE DRAGON!

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:50.136
(roaring)

00:17:53.874 --> 00:17:57.010
Varis had a new monster ready
for just this duel.

00:17:57.244 --> 00:18:00.514
Not just any monster,
an Xyz Monster!

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.316
Varis is dueling
like a toilet plunger,

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.419
he's pulling out
all the stops!

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.288
Though your monster
looks impressive,

00:18:08.288 --> 00:18:09.924
looks can be deceiving.

00:18:10.424 --> 00:18:12.927
It still has fewer attack
points than mine.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.129
That may seem like
a problem to you,

00:18:15.129 --> 00:18:17.264
but like all problems
I've ever faced,

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:19.232
it's one I can easily solve.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.236
I activate EXCHARGE DRAGON's
ability!

00:18:23.737 --> 00:18:25.906
Enemy Negation Blasting Charge!

00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:29.944
By using one of its
Overlay Units...

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:33.947
I can lower your
monster's attack points by 600!

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:37.551
Bringing your MAGNUS DUX ‘s
attack points down to 1900!

00:18:39.553 --> 00:18:41.922
In addition, I also get
to resurrect

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.591
one BORREL monster
from my graveyard.

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:47.060
Rise up, BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:51.966
Prepare yourself, Ignis!

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:56.536
BORRELOAD EXCHARGE DRAGON,
attack MAGNUS DUX!

00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.772
During this attack,

00:18:58.772 --> 00:19:01.141
BORRELOAD DRAGON's
ability activates,

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:03.977
lowering your monster's attack
points even further!

00:19:05.512 --> 00:19:08.315
MAGNUS DUX ain't so magnus
no more!

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.952
But JUDGMENT ARROWS doubles my
monster's attack points!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:16.856
So what? It's still weaker
than my EXCHARGE DRAGON!

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:19.559
Now take this!

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.162
Blasting Borrel Cannon!

00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.775
(blasting)

00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:35.976
(groans)

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:38.712
Oh, yeah!

00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:40.647
He sent that
pachyderm packin'!

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:41.648
(grunts)

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.452
EXCHARGE DRAGON
does have a drawback however,

00:19:45.552 --> 00:19:48.655
as I'm not allowed to attack
you directly this turn.

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:49.857
What drawback?

00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:52.526
You summoned ESTRANGEMENT
DRAGON to my field

00:19:52.526 --> 00:19:54.327
so you can still attack me.

00:19:54.794 --> 00:19:56.397
I did, didn't I?

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.834
My monster has 3000 attack
points while yours has 1500,

00:20:00.834 --> 00:20:03.703
meaning you'll take
1500 points of damage,

00:20:03.804 --> 00:20:07.474
which is exactly the same amount
of life points you have left.

00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:09.543
If this attack succeeds,
Playmaker,

00:20:09.543 --> 00:20:11.478
Lightning loses the duel!

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:13.981
And Lightning doesn't have
any cards

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:15.849
that are able
to stop this attack.

00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:16.716
Hear that?

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.653
Playmaker says Varis
has this duel is in the bag!

00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:21.655
Don't jinx it by
saying that!

00:20:21.855 --> 00:20:23.290
Oh, who am I kiddin'?

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.626
This duel's so over that they're
already rollin' the credits

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:26.993
and turnin' up the lights!

00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:34.134
This duel is over for you,
Light Ignis!

00:20:34.468 --> 00:20:36.136
And good riddance!

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:41.141
BORRELOAD DRAGON,

00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:44.444
attack ESTRANGEMENT
DRAGON and end--(gasps)

00:20:44.978 --> 00:20:47.013
Huh?
What's that portal?

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:08.602
Lightning, what did ya do?

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:29.222
(laughs)

00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:33.227
That's Jin, Kolter's brother.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.294
What's this?

00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:37.565
I linked my myself
with Jin's data.

00:21:37.932 --> 00:21:40.067
So if you defeat and delete me,

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.236
Jin will be deleted as well.

00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:46.874
Meaning out in your world,
Jin will never awaken again.

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:51.211
This of course is only if you
defeat me in this duel.

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:53.280
This can't be!

00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:56.750
So what
will you do, Varis?

00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:00.754
Will you continue your attack,
my friend?
