00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.137
(Playmaker)
DECODE TALKER...

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:03.904
attack!

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:04.504
(grunting)

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.672
No ways,

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.608
we're gonna be fragged!

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:08.508
HEATLIO,

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.909
bring the heat!

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:10.844
BORRELOAD,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.313
end this now!

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.181
(Bit)
You bunglefied it, Boot!

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.982
(Boot)
No, you blew it, Bit!

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.753
Good riddance program.

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:20.186
(timer beeping)
(screaming)

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.490
It appears
we're in the clear now.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.927
But I'm sure Lightning has other
surprises in store for us.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:27.627
(gasps)

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.030
You mean like that?!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.466
Is that an earthquake?

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.001
Great, now what's going on?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.141
Mirror LINK VRAINS is merging
with the original!

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.646
And the signal just went down
because of course it did!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.182
Time to beta test that program

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:50.350
I installed
in Playmaker's Duel Disk...

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.354
Um... that's not good!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.090
Mayday! Mayday!

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.458
(grunting)

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.160
(groaning)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.761
What are we gonna do?!

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.499
Oh, that.

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:23.750
(grunts)

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:29.089
(sighs)

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.259
(Klarissa)
We've lost Varis' signal.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.027
(Alec)
And Genome will find it-

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.061
correct?

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.364
Of course I'll find it.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:38.999
It's just a matter of how.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:39.993
(electronic whirring)

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:42.562
Hey, Playmaker,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:45.265
you 20/20'ing
anybody out there?

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.202
I wonder if the others
had as smoother landing as ours?

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:48.969
Oh!

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.937
We got incoming from Kolter.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.139
(moaning)

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:55.810
Whew!

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.644
That's some intense code.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.046
Nice!

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.281
Looks like
everybody's back online

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.550
and in one piece.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.151
And now...

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.385
to spread the love!

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.555
Signals back!

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.023
Good work, Genome.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:11.392
I wish I could take the credit

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.393
but this was not my doing.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.162
It appears that
the signal was restored

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:17.031
by Playmaker's hacker friend.

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:19.032
And not a moment too soon.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.036
Who knows what threats
awaits Varis and Spectre.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.004
It's gonna be a lot harder

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.639
to track down Lightning by foot.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.341
I'm glad you're gonna be the one
doing all the walking.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:30.877
We're not going anywhere
for the time being.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.348
What is that?

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:36.550
(groans)

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:38.685
A barrier?

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.556
Somebody doesn't want us
joining up with the others.

00:03:43.324 --> 00:03:45.358
Does his name rhyme
with frightening?

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:46.393
Yes.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.562
Lightning must be
planning something.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:51.298
(Windy)
Those force fields
are a waste of resources

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.032
if you ask me.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:52.800
And you should ask me,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.301
you really, really should.

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.602
Duly noted, Windy,

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:57.771
but you don't understand humans

00:03:57.771 --> 00:03:58.838
like I do.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.773
In particular,

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.942
you fail to appreciate the need

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:04.778
that these humans have
to "bond" with each other.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:05.545
Bond?

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.281
You mean like
glue themselves together?

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.582
Not literally.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.117
It's a metaphor.

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:11.451
Yet these "bonds"

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.955
that humans form can
make them truly powerful.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:15.922
I see.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.357
Rather than letting them "bond,"

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:18.926
you're keeping the humans apart,

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:19.860
so we can pick them off

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.195
one by one by one by one!

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.228
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.063
Clever, clever.

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.231
There's one factor
you left out, though.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.034
What factor is that?

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:29.169
The fright factor, of course!

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.003
(laughing)

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.004
We should allow the humans

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.172
to tune in and watch along

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.174
as their companions
are deleted bit by byte.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:36.010
Shock and awe, yes?

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.743
Hmm...

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.946
an interesting proposition.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:41.748
It would require us
to broadcast the duels,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.184
however, which is highly
impractical.

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:46.420
Not if we use
outside consultants,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.788
freelancers if you will!

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.556
I recently apprehended
the perfect pair

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:50.691
for the job!

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:52.025
(screaming)

00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:54.895
I'm so scared, Boss!

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:56.697
What do y' think
this lot want from us?

00:04:56.697 --> 00:04:58.899
I dunno, ask them!

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:59.900
Ask away,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.268
but keep the questions quick.

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:02.802
Okay, then quick.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.405
What do you two
want from us two?

00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:06.473
Well judging from that camera
on your cranium

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.076
you two must be in the shoot
and show biz.

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:11.945
And we need to sneak some peaks
to a couple of peeps.

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:13.113
No, thanks!

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.749
We're desperate
but not that desperate!

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.085
Windy wasn't making a job offer.

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:19.353
No, no, no, not a job offer,

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:21.088
a job order!

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.589
(groaning)

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.957
He collared us!

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.992
Fail to follow our ABC's
and 123's

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.427
and those collars
will zap your traps!

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:28.461
Which would be
quite entertaining

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:29.763
but shocking to say the least.

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.198
(crying)

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.868
Okay, we're ready
to follow away!

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:34.568
For real?

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:35.735
It sure beats havin' our

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.905
bits and bytes blasted
all over this place.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:39.807
Yeah, I hadn't thought
of it that way.

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:41.075
Good! Then we have a deal.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:42.075
Let's get ready to roll

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.610
in five, four,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.312
three, two,

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:46.146
one!

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.817
(gasps)

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.853
(Playmaker)
That's Spectre.

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:56.423
It appears he's safe.

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:57.992
(Ai)
But for how long?

00:05:57.992 --> 00:06:00.761
I mean, what's with the look-see
of him and only him?

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:02.929
Something stinks here
and it's not me.

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:03.830
Yes, Ai,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.833
this situation is unsettling.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.801
Yeah, like off milk.

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.670
(Lightning)
<i>Greetings, Spectre,</i>

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.638
<i>and all those tuning in.</i>

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:12.873
It's Lightning!

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.474
He has Jin!

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.375
Ah, Lightning.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.812
I see you share my taste
for dramatic entrances.

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:19.914
Are you rolling?

00:06:19.914 --> 00:06:22.917
Don't you louse this up
or our data's done for!

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:24.884
Okay.
I'll do my best, Boss!

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.655
I take it you plan to duel
each of us separately?

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:29.723
Precisely.

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.259
And I chose you to be first,
my friend.

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:34.094
I see.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.364
Eradicate that Ignis
once and for all.

00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:39.866
The Knights of Hanoi
are counting on you!

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:41.635
I'm honored.

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:43.003
I assume you chose me

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.305
because I'm the most
distinguished duelist

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.540
in the group.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.641
Not at all.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:49.510
I chose to duel you first

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.311
because my analysis indicates

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.013
that you are the weakest.

00:06:53.013 --> 00:06:55.316
Then your analysis is incorrect.

00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:57.084
Regardless, though,

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:00.053
I'm still honored
to be the first chosen,

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:01.555
because I'll get to be the one

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:04.224
who crushes the leader
of the Ignis!

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.394
That outcome is
highly improbable.

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:08.729
In addition to indicating

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.799
that you are the weakest
of my human adversaries,

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:13.900
my analysis also indicates

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.802
the chance of my losing to you

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.704
is non-existent.

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:19.706
And it also indicates
that the chance

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.742
that I will enjoy defeating you

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:24.311
is quite existent.

00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:25.245
Bravo!

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.548
You're even more arrogant
than me.

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:30.483
I can see that we have
much in common.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.786
There is one
significant difference

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.621
between the two of us,
however.

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:35.922
Oh?

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:39.159
Believe it or not,
I wasn't always this way.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.795
As a boy,
I was shy and timid.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.731
I grew into my present
personality.

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.000
It's quite different for you.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.635
As an A.I.,
your personality

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.371
is a mere byproduct
of your programming.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:52.406
(Lightning scoffs)

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.774
(Lightning)
You know nothing about me.

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.643
Oh, but I do.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.713
I understand you
thoroughly, Ignis.

00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:01.115
Simply put,

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:04.485
I know you better than
you know yourself.

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.521
I can perceive your
many strengths

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.157
and your biggest weakness.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:10.825
(grunts)

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:13.227
Would you care to know
your fatal flaw?

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:14.895
It's this: as an Ignis,

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:17.564
you are incapable
of growth or change.

00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:19.533
No matter how clever you are

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.868
or believe you are,

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.004
you will always be limited
by your original programming.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.672
It's quite tragic really.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.109
(Lightning)
You expect me to believe
that you,

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:31.778
an enemy of the Ignis,
feel pity for us?

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.781
When the Ignis created
from me was erased,

00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:37.384
I unexpectedly
sensed its loss...

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:39.219
and to my great surprise,

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:41.154
I was stirred with emotion.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.191
Does he mean Earth?

00:08:44.224 --> 00:08:45.525
It seems so.

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:49.062
I didn't realize Spectre felt
an attachment to him.

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:52.299
Kinda like how you feel all warm
and fuzzy about me?

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:53.134
No.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:53.734
Oh.

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.704
I am still convinced
that the Ignis are a threat

00:08:56.704 --> 00:08:58.472
that must be eliminated.

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:00.474
But I am curious
what would have happened

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:02.910
if you had remained
hidden in the Cyberse.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.344
Not that it matters to me,

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:06.880
but would that Ignis
still be in existence-

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.916
Perhaps, perhaps not.

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:09.717
<i>You see...</i>

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.785
<i>if we had stayed
in the Cyberse,</i>

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:14.688
<i>sooner or later you
and your fellow Knights of Hanoi</i>

00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.390
<i>would have come to hunt us down.</i>

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.757
<i>It was inevitable.</i>

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.594
<i>Ignis and humans are
in a fight to the finish.</i>

00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:23.063
<i>Only one of us will survive.</i>

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:24.631
And in this duel,

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:26.433
I will be the survivor.

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:28.703
Shall we proceed?

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:31.172
Oh, yes, by all means.

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.840
Ready when you are.

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:34.075
Well, then...

00:09:34.442 --> 00:09:35.709
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:41.281
I'll go first.

00:09:41.281 --> 00:09:42.850
I'll start by summoning

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.852
ARMATOS LEGIO GLADIUS.

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:45.785
(computer chirping)

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:47.121
Next,

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:48.855
GLADIUS's special ability

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.425
allows me to draw
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.425
from my deck

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.894
and activate it!

00:09:56.197 --> 00:09:57.297
(rumbling)

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.441
Oh, my!

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.179
By playing this Field Spell,

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:14.447
I can draw an ARMATOS LEGIO card

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.782
from my deck.

00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:17.384
Now!

00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:19.753
I shall illuminate my circuit!

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.289
I Link Summon!

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:25.692
Link 1 ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:26.360
(grunts)

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.060
(computer chirping)

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:28.361
Next,

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:30.563
I can activate
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM's

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:31.699
second effect

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.134
to resurrect a monster
from my graveyard

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.570
and summon it next
to DECURION's link

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.205
in defense mode,

00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:40.740
all for the simple cost
of discarding

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.711
one ARMATOS LEGIO
from my hand.

00:10:43.877 --> 00:10:46.513
So I send ARMATOS LEGIO SICA

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:47.514
to the graveyard

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:49.183
to revive my GLADIUS.

00:10:49.183 --> 00:10:49.849
(computer chirping)

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:52.920
I now have two monsters in play,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.521
but I can have more!

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:57.057
By sending ARMATOS LEGIO SCUTUM

00:10:57.057 --> 00:10:59.026
from my hand to the graveyard,

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:00.127
I can summon

00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:02.596
ARMATOS LEGIO SPECULATA!

00:11:02.796 --> 00:11:04.631
And I'll use it and GLADIUS

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:06.200
to Link Summon again!

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.134
(shooting)

00:11:07.134 --> 00:11:08.001
Link 2

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.138
ARMATOS LEGIO CENTURION!

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:12.005
(grunting)

00:11:14.909 --> 00:11:15.742
(computer chirping)

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.579
Lightning's usin'
the same tricks

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:19.913
that beat The Shepherd!

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:23.817
I activate ARMATOS
COLOSSEUM's effect again!

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:27.254
I send this ARMATOS LEGIO
to the graveyard

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:29.623
to resummon GLADIUS and SICA

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:31.792
next to my CENTURION's links.

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:32.659
(computer chirping)

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.161
And I'll set

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.662
GLADIUS
in the Link Arrow

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:36.863
to Link Summon

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.301
another ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:11:40.301 --> 00:11:41.067
(computer chirping)

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.836
Hmm.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.805
And to cap off this sequence,

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.941
I play my spell.

00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:51.077
One I'm sure
you're quite familiar with.

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:52.846
Of course.

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:54.681
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.817
I was wondering when you would
play that card.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.453
You wouldn't be you
without it,

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:00.587
would you?

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:03.724
And I expected nothing less.

00:12:03.724 --> 00:12:06.327
Managing to play four monsters
and a Link Spell

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:08.729
in a single turn
is quite impressive.

00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:11.731
(Lightning)
Are you implying
that my turn is done?

00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.702
Your implications are incorrect.

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:17.203
I set ARMATOS LEGIO SICA

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:18.539
and CENTURION

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:20.874
in the Link Arrows.

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:22.643
I Link Summon!

00:12:22.643 --> 00:12:23.477
Link 2

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:26.914
ARMATOS LEGIO PRIMI ORDINES!

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:28.481
But that's not all.

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:30.818
PRIMI ORDINES's special ability

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:32.886
summons an ARMATOS LEGIO

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.554
from my graveyard.

00:12:35.156 --> 00:12:36.157
(computer chirping)

00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:38.859
And it allows me
to fulfill the requirements

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:40.761
to illuminate my circuit

00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:42.196
for a fifth time!

00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:42.996
(shooting)

00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:46.900
I Link Summon.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.135
Link 2

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:51.339
ARMATOS LEGIO PILUS PRIOR!

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:51.972
(computer chirping)

00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:55.041
When PILUS PRIOR
is Link Summoned,

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.244
I can banish a card
from my deck

00:12:57.244 --> 00:13:00.181
for every co-linked
monster on my field.

00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:01.882
And then on my next turn,

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:04.718
I get to add those
banished cards to my hand.

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:07.287
Therefore, I banish three cards.

00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.623
But that's only part one.

00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:11.224
Its second ability revives

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:12.793
an ARMATOS LEGIO

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.160
from my graveyard.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.963
Come, GLADIUS!

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:16.496
(computer chirping)

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:18.298
(gasps)

00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:20.567
Well, well, well...

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:23.204
You brought new monsters
for this duel.

00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:24.137
Yes.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.407
And the old ones
help just as well.

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.776
For my sixth and final
Link Summoning,

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:32.446
I set ARMATOS LEGIO GLADIUS

00:13:32.446 --> 00:13:33.713
in the Link Arrow

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:34.948
to Link Summon

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:37.384
ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:38.219
(grunts)

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:39.052
(computer chirping)

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:41.155
What's this?

00:13:41.555 --> 00:13:43.090
Ai, look at the field.

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:43.990
Huh?

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.393
What for?

00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:48.229
(Playmaker)
All of Lightning's cards
are connected together

00:13:48.229 --> 00:13:49.629
into an Extra Link.

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:53.434
That means Lightning occupies

00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.569
both Extra Monster Zones.

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.872
(Ai)
And that means Spectre
can't Link Summon

00:13:57.872 --> 00:13:59.406
even if he wants to!

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:02.509
He's wrapped Spectre up
like a birthday present!

00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.045
This isn't looking good
for Spectre.

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.214
(Aqua)
No, it isn't.

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:08.882
(groans)

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:10.851
Looks like this duel's
gonna end quick.

00:14:10.851 --> 00:14:11.819
No kiddin'.

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:13.787
Spectre hasn't
played a single card

00:14:13.787 --> 00:14:15.322
and he's already in trouble.

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:16.890
(Lightning)
As you humans say,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.391
practice makes perfect.

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:20.561
So I ran millions of simulations

00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.129
of your previous duels

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:24.999
and learned that even when you
load your deck with new cards,

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:27.234
you never alter
your core strategy

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.936
of summoning Link Monsters.

00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:31.371
And I've crushed your ability
to do so.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:32.806
Yes, you have.

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:35.175
But we humans have
another saying.

00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.544
Nobody's perfect.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.445
And that...

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:40.614
applies to you as well,

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:43.617
And you're about to learn
that firsthand.

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:50.657
My friend,

00:14:50.657 --> 00:14:52.359
you still think you can win

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:54.461
when logic says you cannot?

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:55.729
Yes, I do.

00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:59.366
Since Spectre's deck
relies on Link Monsters,

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:01.402
he has no chance
unless he breaks apart

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:03.537
that Ignis's Extra Link.

00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:06.707
But how is he supposed
to accomplish that?

00:15:06.707 --> 00:15:07.675
I don't know.

00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.176
So let's hope Spectre does.

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.112
It's my turn.

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:13.713
I draw!

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:14.781
First,

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:17.551
I summon SUNSEED GENIUS LOCI.

00:15:18.452 --> 00:15:19.119
(computer chirping)

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:23.390
Now that I have a Plant-Type
monster on my field...

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.058
I'm allowed to also summon

00:15:25.058 --> 00:15:27.761
SUNSEED SHADOW from my hand.
(computer chirping)

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.196
Now usually I would use these
two monsters

00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:31.031
to Link Summon,

00:15:31.031 --> 00:15:33.233
but I unfortunately cannot.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.535
Because I need an open
Extra Monster Zone

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:36.771
to Link Summon

00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.340
but your monsters
have occupied them both.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.775
Oh, well.

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:41.942
Yes,

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.245
if you can't summon
your Link Monsters,

00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:45.846
your deck is useless

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.715
because all your other monsters

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:49.517
have zero attack points.

00:15:49.517 --> 00:15:51.284
And that fatal flaw will,

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.887
logically, lead to your defeat.

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:55.522
You're absolutely right.

00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:57.457
If I analyzed my previous duels

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.560
as thoroughly
as you obviously have,

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.995
I'd have reached
the same conclusion.

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:03.496
Yes...?

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.633
So what if I did analyze
my previous duels?

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.002
Why, I would completely
rethink my strategy

00:16:09.002 --> 00:16:10.771
before facing you,
wouldn't I?

00:16:10.771 --> 00:16:13.307
I would come up with
new ideas and tactics.

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:14.441
For example,

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:17.111
JUDGMENT ARROWS
is a very powerful card

00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:18.912
that would surely help me.

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:19.613
Yes, it would.

00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.014
But you don't have one.

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:22.249
No, I don't.

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.817
But I have this!

00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.919
I pay 800 life points...

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:26.587
(timer beeping)

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.587
to activate the spell

00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.523
SUNVINE PLUNDER!

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.026
It allows me to take
control of your spell card-

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:35.762
meaning JUDGMENT ARROWS
is mine!

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:39.432
What?

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.268
What I don't own,

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:43.403
I'll just simply
steal from you.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.775
Nice, Spectre.

00:16:48.775 --> 00:16:49.977
Very well done.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:51.645
He just yoinked it?

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:52.780
It's a simple,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.648
yet effective tactic.

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:56.784
Now that JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:58.519
is in my possession...

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:00.020
it opens up new strategies

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.855
that I couldn't
possibly use before

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.991
because I never had this card.

00:17:03.991 --> 00:17:05.992
And it's all thanks to you.

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:08.262
You guessed that I would play
that card,

00:17:08.262 --> 00:17:10.998
so you were ready to turn it
to your advantage.

00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.399
(Spectre)
Guessed?

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:14.134
More like I knew.

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.138
You Ignis may pretend
to be sophisticated,

00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:19.539
calculating creatures

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:20.574
but in the end,

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:22.476
you're like all other programs-

00:17:22.476 --> 00:17:24.811
predictable and formulaic.

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:27.214
But there was one thing
I didn't anticipate.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.717
I didn't know
you could program arrogance.

00:17:29.717 --> 00:17:31.685
Because even a human
without a nose

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:33.854
would have sniffed
out this strategy.

00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:35.989
I mean, why are you so upset?

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:38.325
Isn't that the only
logical conclusion,

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:39.526
my friend?

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:41.561
No, it's not logical at all,

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.330
my friend.

00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:45.266
Oh, very well.

00:17:45.266 --> 00:17:47.367
Anyway since I now control

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.003
JUDGMENT ARROWS...

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:51.338
your monsters aren't
Extra Linked.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:52.706
Don't the rules state

00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:55.208
that I can Link Summon
if the Extra Link's broken?

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:56.577
Yes.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.312
That's Great!

00:17:58.312 --> 00:18:01.248
Then watch as I manifest
my circuit!

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.584
I Link Summon!

00:18:03.584 --> 00:18:06.319
Link 2 SUNAVALON DAPHNE!

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:09.055
(computer chirping)

00:18:09.623 --> 00:18:11.758
Now that I have
a SUNAVALON monster

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:13.326
on my field...

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:16.396
I can activate the spell
SUNVINE SHRINE

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.231
by sending a card in my hand

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:19.633
to the graveyard.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.236
Due to SUNVINE SHRINE's effect,

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:23.804
I can summon a Level 4

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:25.706
or lower Plant-Type monster

00:18:25.706 --> 00:18:27.374
from my graveyard.

00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:28.876
Now rebloom,

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.911
SUNSEED GENIUS LOCI!

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:33.080
However...
(computer chirping)

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.117
this seed won't be
sticking around for long.

00:18:36.117 --> 00:18:38.919
Since I'm using it
to Link Summon again!

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.289
I Link Summon!

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:44.591
Link 1 SUNVINE THRASHER!

00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:48.295
(computer chirping)

00:18:49.063 --> 00:18:50.331
When THRASHER is linked

00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:51.732
to SUNAVALON DAPHNE,

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:53.634
it gains 800 attack points

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:55.068
from each of its links.

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:57.705
SUNAVALON DAPHNE has two links.

00:18:57.705 --> 00:18:59.139
So my THRASHER gains

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:01.208
(timer beeping)
1600 attack points.

00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:02.509
Now go!

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:05.346
Attack ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:19:05.613 --> 00:19:06.847
Don't forget...

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:10.283
that I now have control
of your JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:13.119
So when my Link
Monster battles,

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.222
its attack points are doubled!

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:16.323
(grunts)
(timer beeping)

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:19.727
Oh, I haven't forgotten.

00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:20.861
That's why I'll activate

00:19:20.861 --> 00:19:23.630
PRIMI ORDINES's special ability!

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.699
For every co-linked monster
on my field,

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:28.703
I take 1000
fewer points of damage.

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:29.936
Add it all together

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:32.539
and I take no damage
from your attack.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:33.540
Yes, that's true

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.876
but your monster
will still be destroyed.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.210
(grunts)

00:19:38.879 --> 00:19:39.946
And when my THRASHER

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:42.015
destroys your monster
in battle,

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.786
I get to take control
of that monster

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:48.855
and summon it next
to my SUNAVALON's link!

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.491
(computer chirping)

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:53.461
And now I'll attack
your DECURION

00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:55.862
with the DECURION I stole!

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:59.900
The only difference is,
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.402
doubles my DECURION's

00:20:01.402 --> 00:20:02.936
(timer beeping)
attack points.

00:20:03.938 --> 00:20:04.938
(grunting)

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:08.809
But due to
PRIMI ORDINES's ability,

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:10.711
I still take no damage.

00:20:10.945 --> 00:20:13.680
Yes- that is your
one saving grace.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.282
But not anymore.

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:17.118
I activate my spell

00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:19.320
SUNVINE CROSS BREED!

00:20:19.887 --> 00:20:22.823
By tributing a Link Monster
on my field,

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.193
I can bring back a Plant-Type
monster from my graveyard

00:20:26.193 --> 00:20:28.462
by negating
its special abilities.

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:31.031
So I'm exchanging my DECURION

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:33.867
for SUNSEED GENIUS LOCI!

00:20:34.235 --> 00:20:35.335
And I'll use it...

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.704
to manifest my circuit!

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:42.643
I now Link Summon!

00:20:42.943 --> 00:20:45.679
Link 1 SUNAVALON DRYAS!

00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:49.449
And since you've analyzed
(computer chirping)

00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:51.385
-millions of my duels, was it?-

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:53.988
you must know that
whenever I take damage,

00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:56.290
DRYAS's special ability
lets me summon

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.226
a SUNVINE Link Monster
from my Extra Deck

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:00.727
and regain life points

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:02.929
equal to the damage that I took.

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:03.764
(gasps)

00:21:03.764 --> 00:21:05.065
Or in other words,

00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:08.068
Spectre stole control
of the duel with his DRYAS!

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.704
True,

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:12.572
but there's still
a lot of duel left.

00:21:12.572 --> 00:21:15.041
The outcome is far from decided.

00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.010
(laughs)

00:21:47.007 --> 00:21:49.075
(electronic whirring)
