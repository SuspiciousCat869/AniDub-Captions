"Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.674
(Zaizen)
I have confirmation, Bishop.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.944
It appears the Ignis
is lurking somewhere

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.612
within
the network system.

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.648

We finally have
a lead to the Cyberse.

generated new data material

or it used to.

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.626
Until that Ignis,
that rogue AI program,

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:28.695
hid the Cyberse from us
five years ago.

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:30.130
Without the Cyberse,

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:33.166
our network is
slowly deteriorating.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:34.768
We find the Ignis

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.503
and we find
the Cyberse.

If we capture this AI
before anyone else,

for the Knights of Hanoi,

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.578

You can only have up to

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:10.517
(Ignis)
Look worried?

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:11.718
How could you tell?

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:13.887
Half his face
is covered up!

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.624
That's why you're
just a program.

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.759
I end my turn,
so Cyberse Wizard

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:21.094
regains his attack points.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.798
So a monster's gotta be
at least a whopping Level 9

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:26.266
to even get a chance to
destroy that dragon?

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.402
Wonder who
programmed that thing!

00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:32.072
The Hanoi are a bunch of no-good
cheating cheaters!

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.074
It's my turn.

00:09:34.175 --> 00:09:36.843
And since we're battling
in a Speed Duel,

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.746
I am now allowed
to activate my Skill!

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.748
A Skill?

00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:42.516
(Ignis)
Oh yeah.

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.052
I would've told ya if you
weren't so for rude.

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.587
For an AI that's self-aware,

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.088
you don't seem to be
aware that I can

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.589
erase you anytime I want.

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:52.793
(Ignis)
Okay, fine!

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:54.461
During a Speed Duel,
you're allowed to use

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.731
a special ability called
a Skill once per duel.

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.432
Some Skills
give you more cards,

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.869
others raise your
life points.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.605
There's as many types as
transistors on a microchip,

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:07.174
but I know them all!

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:09.510
I activate my Skill
Double Draw

00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:11.278
to draw two cards!

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:12.746
No way!

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.548
(Ignis)
I never heard of
that Skill!

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:15.916
The Hanoi must
have created it!

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.054
If your chances were
slim before,

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:23.423
with these two cards,
you have no chance at all!

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.726
I activate
the spell DDoS Attack!

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.200
That lets me send two more
copies of DDoS Attack

00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:34.935
from my deck
to the graveyard.

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.609
And you'll now take
800 points of damage

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:44.411
for each copy of that
card in my graveyard

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.880
for a grand total of
1,600 points.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.122
(Ignis)
I'm too beautiful to go splat!

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:56.256
(gasping)

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.310
All right, Playmaker,
guess that makes us even.

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:21.148
(Shima)
Nice save, Playmaker!

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.483
Now don't wipe out,

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:24.318
wipe your
opponent out instead

00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:26.419
and save LINK VRAINS
for all of us!

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:28.455
(Ignis)
Sheesh!

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.857
Keep your head on a swivel!

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:33.327
The concrete's no cushion,
even in virtual reality!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.329
Lucky you had
a guardian angel,

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.765
but she can't save
you from this.

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:38.999
Wait!

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:40.000
What's that ahead?

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.110
♪♪♪

00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.311
(Playmaker)
What is that?

00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.313
(Ignis)
That's the eye of
the Data Storm!

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:56.317
And, boy, can it rip us
into bits and bytes!

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:58.152
So you're saying
we should avoid it.

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:00.320
(Ignis)
Well, maybe.

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.264
Forget the storm,

00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:12.399
you should worry
more about me!

00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:14.000
I place this facedown

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.171
and switch Cracking Dragon
to attack mode!

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:20.073
Then I equip this
spell on Cracking Dragon!

00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:21.474
Air Cracking Storm!

00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:27.481
Now when my dragon
destroys your monster,

00:12:27.548 --> 00:12:29.549
my dragon can attack
you again!

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.056
(Ignis)
If he destroys your Wizard,

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.391
the second attack
will eliminate

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.259
the rest of
your life points!

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.228
I know that.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.862
You never
stood a chance.

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:45.199
Just be happy you
lasted this long.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:46.400
Attack!

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.201
And never
bother us again!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.904
I activate my trap!

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:52.906
Three Strikes Barrier!

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:55.542
My monster cannot be
destroyed in battle!

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:00.714
But it doesn't protect
you from damage!

00:13:00.748 --> 00:13:02.616
(Ignis)
Switch to the other wave!

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.757
And with that,
our duel is now over.

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:11.758
You're wrong!

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.293
I still have
life points left!

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.931
Your life points
don't matter.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.332
Not in this Speed Duel.

00:13:29.276 --> 00:13:31.611
How could you be so dumb
to switch to the wave

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:34.114
directly in front
of the Data Storm?

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:35.715
(laughing maniacally)

00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:38.953
(yelling)

00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:39.953
(gasping)

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.454
It's GG for Playmaker!

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:45.626
(Kolter)
No!

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:47.127
Yusaku!

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:49.629
(yelling)

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.201
(grunting)

00:14:09.617 --> 00:14:11.218
(grunting)

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.325
You led me
into this Data Storm

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.827
on purpose,
didn't you?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.194
(Ignis)
Um, yup.

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:22.329
But why?

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:24.498
You said this storm
will rip us up.

00:14:24.532 --> 00:14:26.833
(Ignis)
No, I said "can,"
not "will."

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:28.635
Big difference.

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:30.671
But I have
a good reason why.

00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:32.506
And what's that?

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:33.773
(Ignis)
There are special monsters

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.443
that only live inside
the Data Storm.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.445
What do you mean,
special monsters?

00:14:38.512 --> 00:14:40.981
(Ignis)
Monsters that you
and only you can summon

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:43.016
with your unique
Skill!

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.052
And the more
intense the Storm,

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:47.188
the stronger the monster!

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:49.356
Which you'll need if you
wanna beat that hoodlum.

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:55.195
Your Skill lets you draw one
random card in the Data Storm

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.297
when you have a thousand
or fewer life points.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:02.035
Seize the wind, Playmaker!

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.576
(grunting)

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:19.954
Come on,
don't break down!

00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:21.088
I don't know
about you--

00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:22.522
and I don't really care--

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.791
but I don't wanna be
digitized to kilobits!

00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:30.064
♪♪♪

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.098
(Ignis)
I don't know about you--

00:15:31.132 --> 00:15:32.600
and I don't really care--

00:15:32.633 --> 00:15:35.002
but I don't wanna be
digitized to kilobits!

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:36.670
Just calm yourself.

00:15:36.737 --> 00:15:38.672
I have three reasons
why I cannot

00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:40.040
and will not be defeated.

00:15:41.842 --> 00:15:44.711
One: I must uncover
the truth about my past.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:51.184
Two: I must free Kolter's
brother from the darkness

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:52.753
that haunts him.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:57.591
And three: I must absolutely
save the one who saved me!

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:58.892
(boy)
Hey, you.

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:06.666
(Ignis)
You did it!

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:07.934
Go, Storm Access!

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:20.313
What?

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:23.483
No one's ever escaped
from the eye of the storm!

00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:26.020
There's a first time
for everything.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.454
It's my turn.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:29.323
I draw!

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.424
Go, Cyberse Wizard!

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.327
Cyberse Algorithm!

00:16:35.496 --> 00:16:37.464
Your monster switches
to defense mode!

00:16:40.301 --> 00:16:41.835
This changes nothing!

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:43.737
I activate my trap!

00:16:43.804 --> 00:16:45.306
Pulse Mines!

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:47.808
Your monster switches
to defense as well,

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:49.075
so you can't attack!

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:51.812
Oh really.

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.314
Then I summon
Stack Reviver.

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:58.285
Summon all
the monsters you want

00:16:58.318 --> 00:16:59.353
because Pulse Mines

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.987
will keep switching
them to defense!

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:07.394
And in fact,
summoning that monster

00:17:07.428 --> 00:17:10.331
has sealed my victory,
you fool.

00:17:10.397 --> 00:17:12.232
Because Cracking Dragon

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:15.536
will now deal you
400 points of damage

00:17:15.636 --> 00:17:18.539
and 400 is all
you have left!

00:17:18.639 --> 00:17:19.673
It's game over.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:24.478
No way!

00:17:24.545 --> 00:17:25.712
You're alive?

00:17:25.746 --> 00:17:27.248
Of course.

00:17:27.348 --> 00:17:28.715
It seems that
I know more about your

00:17:28.816 --> 00:17:31.484
Cracking Dragon's abilities
than you do.

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.586
It deals me damage

00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:34.254
equal to the amount of
attack points

00:17:34.355 --> 00:17:36.323
Stack Reviver lost.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.226
But this gizmo only
has 100 attack points,

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:41.495
so I only lost 100 life points,

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.063
keeping me
in this duel

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.932
and keeping victory
away from you.

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:46.933
Hmm...

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.235
But you still won't win

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.971
because you're just
focusing on defense!

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.374
You should probably stop
making assumptions.

00:17:53.474 --> 00:17:56.877
I activate the spell card
Effect Cowl from my hand.

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:01.115
Since I have
a Cyberse on my field,

00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:04.117
your effects can no longer
deal me damage!

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.287
And next I play...

00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:08.722
my trap
Cyberse Beacon!

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:10.124
Since I took damage,

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:12.893
this Beacon calls out
a Cyberse from my deck

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.928
straight to my hand.

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:17.430
Which I immediately
summon to my field!

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:24.438
With Backup Secretary, I have
three monsters on my side!

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:25.472
(Hanoi Knight chuckling)

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:27.274
Three would be
greater than one,

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:29.777
if my one wasn't so much
more powerful

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.611
than all your monsters!

00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:34.247
Then in that case,
I'll have my monsters

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.649
unite and fight.

00:18:35.749 --> 00:18:37.117
Say what?

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.118
Here I go!

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.087
Create the ultimate circuit!

00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:55.803
Link Arrows authorized!

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:57.371
The summoning conditions
are at least

00:18:57.438 --> 00:18:59.373
two Effect Monsters!

00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:02.008
I set Stack Reviver,
Cyberse Wizard

00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:04.611
and Backup Secretary
in the Link Arrows!

00:19:10.184 --> 00:19:11.318
Link the circuit!

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:15.689
I Link Summon
Link 3, Decode Talker!

00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:32.840
I promise that this
Link Monster

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.174
is unlike any creature

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:35.675
you've ever
seen in your life!

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:38.645
(Hanoi Knight)
But how?

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:39.646
How can this be?

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:44.985
(Ignis)
You mastered Storm Access
and Link Summoning already?

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:46.553
Not bad for a fleshy meatbag.

00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.325
Here's what makes
Link Monsters different!

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.360
Link Monsters don't
have Levels

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:56.230
and can't be put
in defense mode!

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.398
Which means
your cards' effects

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:00.200
don't work against
Decode Talker!

00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:04.671
Next, I activate
Stack Reviver's ability!

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.542
It revives Cyberse Wizard
from my graveyard!

00:20:13.847 --> 00:20:16.550
My Decode Talker
gains 500 attack points

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.119
for every monster
it's linked to.

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:20.387
Power Integration!

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:27.861
Now way,
3,300 attack points?

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:29.630
Decode Talker!

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:30.998
Attack!

00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:33.533
And with Cyberse Wizard's
help...

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:35.502
Decode Talker
can deal you damage

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:37.671
even if your monster's
in defense mode!

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:40.507
Decode Destruction!

00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:45.112
Hold on!

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:47.381
Cracking Dragon can't be
destroyed by a monster

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:48.982
with a lower Level.

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:50.183
Oh, wait!

00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:52.185
He said Link Monsters
don't have Levels!

00:20:58.359 --> 00:20:59.893
(yelling)

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:07.901
A thug like you has
no place in LINK VRAINS!
