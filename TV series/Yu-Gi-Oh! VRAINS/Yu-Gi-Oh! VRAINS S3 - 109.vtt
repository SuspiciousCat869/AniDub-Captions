WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.772
(Ai)
Previously
on Yu-Gi! VRAINS...

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.274
Now pummel 'em, EARTH GOLEM!

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.642
Boulder Blast!

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.482
Aah!

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.986
Oh no, Gore just got K.O'ed!

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.622
Now Ai has a straight
shot towards Zaizen!

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.491
And you three are
the only ones left

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:25.692
who can stop 'em!

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:28.695
We have no time to waste!

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:32.265
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!
Attack him directly!

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:36.303
VIOLET CHIMERA, go!

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.509
Attack!
BORRELSWORD DRAGON end this!

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.116
You may have beat us,
but we did our job.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.418
You won't get there in time,
Playmaker.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.761
I found you, Zaizen.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.003
I've been waiting
for you.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.007
Varis placed me here
to protect Zaizen,

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.374
and that is what I will do.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.410
Then what are we waiting for?

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.178
Let's take this outside!

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:23.550
It's a long way down, Pandor,
and you don't have a parachute.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.153
I can say the same for you.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.888
(Both)
Time to duel!

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:39.733
♪♪♪

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:35.155
(gasps)

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:36.557
What's wrong?

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.326
It was only
a matter of time.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.995
But the Dark Ignis
has found Zaizen.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.764
Ai was able to get
onboard his plane?

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:45.966
Yes.

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:47.601
And it's walked
right into my trap.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:48.969
Because now...

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.938
Pandor will destroy it.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:00.114
Curious.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.849
I have told you that I have
analyzed all of your duels,

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:04.518
but you still insist on using

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.787
those exact same
moves against me.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.957
That may have worked
against your previous opponents,

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.225
but they will not
work on me.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:15.496
You think they won't.
You don't know they won't.

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.130
(Pandor)
No, I do know.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.533
Every move has a counter.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.668
So if I know your every move,

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.671
then I know your every counter.

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:27.141
But what if I know
a counter to your counter?

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:31.111
Then I of course know a counter
to your counter to my counter.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.146
Quite the know-it-all.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.349
I have studied you
extensively to learn

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.783
everything about you.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.285
I know you well.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.554
What a logical way
to handle things!

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.890
But if you're digging
into my bits and bytes,

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.525
then you know why I'm
warring against the meatbags,

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.362
and why joining
my side is logical.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.064
There's nothing logical
about joining you.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.032
Really?

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.700
That kinda hurts my feelings,

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:56.169
but don't you worry
I'm quite over it now.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:59.874
But still, it is a shame
that you won't join my side.

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.209
It is the right
side after all.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.277
I disagree.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.845
Of course
you disagree.

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:06.780
Not because you
think you disagree,

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.082
but because you're
programmed to disagree.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:12.753
See, I did a little analyzing
of your bits and bytes too.

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:15.689
Varis put a unique bit
of code into your programming,

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:17.892
where you
automatically shut down

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.693
if you turn against humans.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.429
Now why would Varis do
that if he trusted you?

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:24.298
QED:

00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:25.632
Cuz he doesnnnn't.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.602
While the facts
you state are correct,

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:30.937
your interpretation
of those facts isn't.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.073
Be that way if you must.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.409
Don't say that I never
tried to help you.

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.911
But in the end,
only one of us is right.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.681
And there's only one way
to determine that.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:43.551
Whoever wins this duel
is the one who's right!

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.086
And that, Pandor, is logic!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.422
That is not logic.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:49.389
But so be it.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.591
It's my turn!

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.762
I activate the spell card
TOPOLOGINA HONEYCOMB BEEHICLE.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.932
BEEHICLE?
That name is a cutie.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:01.201
Is that what you're
focusing on?

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.470
You should care more
about this card's function

00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:05.672
than the relative
cuteness of its name.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:10.443
This spell allows me to draw
TOPOLOGINA BABEE from my deck.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.413
And I activate its ability.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.817
When both of our Life Points
are equal...

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.919
I can summon it from my hand.

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.358
Next I shall summon
TOPOLOGINA MAYBEE.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.661
I'll now use these
two TOPOLOGINA monsters

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:28.996
to Link Summon.

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:32.299
Since I do not keep repeating
the same strategies like you do,

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.334
you can't figure out
which monster

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:35.903
I'm going to bring out next.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:39.240
Oh yes I can figure it out,
now let me see.

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:42.075
You've summoned TOPOLOGINA
BABEE and MAYBEE...

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:43.843
Hey, that rhymes.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.679
I've figured you out, Pandor!

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:47.981
You only summon
monsters that rhyme!

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:49.750
And there's
only one word that rhymes

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:51.318
with BABEE and MAYBEE!

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.521
You're gonna summon
TOPOLOGINA... NABEE!

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:55.989
(grunts)

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.993
(wind blowing)

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:04.197
You're right
that my monsters rhyme.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:09.536
I Link Summon Link 2
TOPOLOGINA SASSABEE!

00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.906
SASSABEE?
Is that even a real word?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.809
It is. Go ahead
and look it up.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.010
But for now,

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.679
when I successfully
Link Summon SASSABEE,

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.384
I can retrieve the TOPOLOGINAS
I used to summon it.

00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:25.152
So TOPOLOGINA BABEE

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:28.022
and TOPOLOGINA MAYBEE
return to my hand.

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:31.558
Then by discarding
one TOPOLOGINA from my hand,

00:06:31.692 --> 00:06:34.228
I can summon a new
rhyming monster!

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.763
TOPOLOGINA GATSBEE!

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:41.401
And I'll use it to Link Summon
for a second time!

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.872
Link 3 TOPOLOGIC TRISBAENA!

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:55.649
TRISBAENA?

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:58.652
That card doesn't rhyme
so you broke the pattern!

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.220
That's a DQ

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.455
and you automatically
lose this duel!

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:04.291
(Pandor)
No, I do not!

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.427
That is not how dueling works!

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:08.462
But now you know that I possess

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:11.398
one of Varis's most powerful
monsters in my deck.

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:12.333
(grunts)

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.434
That's bad news for me.

00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:19.640
Varis programmed me
to defeat you,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.775
and that is exactly
what I intend to do.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:24.611
By discarding TOPOLOGINA MAYBEE,

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.447
I am allowed to summon
TOPOLOGINA GATSBEE

00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.250
next to TOPOLOGIC
TRISBAENA's link.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.486
So that is exactly
what I shall do.

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:35.890
And with this summon

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:38.992
my TOPOLOGIC TRISBAENA's
ability activates!

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:41.595
When a monster is summoned
next to its link,

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:43.897
TRISBAENA banishes that monster,

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.500
along with every spell
and trap card in play.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.036
And it deals you
500 points of damage

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.438
for every card you have
that's banished.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.079
(grunts)

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:02.148
I activate the trap A.I. SHADOW!

00:08:03.017 --> 00:08:04.685
Until the end of the turn,

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:08.622
it gives one of my @IGNISTERS
800 attack points.

00:08:08.956 --> 00:08:11.358
And when I play this
card during your turn,

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:14.462
every monster that you have
that's able to attack

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:16.363
must attack that @IGNISTER!

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.200
FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!
Ignite!

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.002
Even so,

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.005
all our spell and trap cards
will still be banished.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.107
Exile's Retribution!

00:08:30.511 --> 00:08:33.347
Since I banished three
of your spell and trap cards,

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.449
you take 1500 points of damage!

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.462
It's too bad.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.498
These cards could've
destroyed me.

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:53.033
Huh!

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.335
Oh but I have more
strategies up my sleeve,

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:56.937
cuz my shirt's pretty puffy.

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.471
(Pandor)
You may be playing it cool

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.207
but I'm detecting minor
fluctuations in your voice

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.943
that indicates
that you're worried.

00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:05.412
No, what you're
detecting is excitement.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:07.414
Cuz what do I hafta worry about?

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:11.251
My FIRE PHOENIX is the strongest
monster on the field,

00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:13.587
and your TOPOLOGIC TRISBAENA
is forced

00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:16.423
to attack it and self-destruct!

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:18.125
You'd be correct.

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:19.894
If I didn't have a counter.

00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:23.463
Since I banished my TOPOLOGINA
HONEYCOMB BEEHICLE,

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.932
its additional
effect activates.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:29.403
It lets me retrieve a TOPOLOGINA
that's been banished.

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.705
And that includes
this card itself

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.607
since there are no exceptions.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.377
So TOPOLOGINA HONEYCOMB
BEEHICLE returns to my hand.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.746
A cute trick.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.248
But I think I can
do you one better.

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:43.684
Because you're not
the only one who's capable

00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:45.852
of adding cards
to their hand, Pandor!

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:49.356
When A.I. SHADOW
leaves the field...

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:52.292
I'm allowed to draw
one card from my deck!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.028
I now activate

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:57.063
my TOPOLOGINA HONEYCOMB
BEEHICLE's effect.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:02.703
I am once again allowed to draw
a TOPOLOGINA from my deck

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.071
and add it to my hand.

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.441
So I acquire TOPOLOGINA BAMBEE.

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:11.011
By banishing two TOPOLOGINAS
from my graveyard

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:13.847
I can trigger BAMBEE's
special ability

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:16.917
allowing me to summon
this monster to my field.

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:21.021
So I banish TOPOLOGINA
BABEE and MAYBEE.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.592
Take to the field
TOPOLOGINA BAMBEE.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.093
Cool...

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:30.096
But when are you going
to summon TOPOLOGINA NABEE?

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:32.966
What if I inform you that...

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.538
there is no such monster
as TOPOLOGINA NABEE?

00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:39.706
Then what are we dueling for!

00:10:39.773 --> 00:10:41.742
(Pandor)
For the fate of the human race.

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.577
(Ai)
Ohhhhhh yeahhhhh.

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:45.512
I now manifest my circuit!

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.848
I set TOPOLOGIC TRISBAENA

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.750
and TOPOLOGINA BAMBEE
in the Link Arrows!

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:54.755
If it's not gonna be NABEE...

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:56.556
I mean what's the point.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.828
(Pandor)
I Link Summon!

00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:03.797
Link 4 TOPOLOGIC BOMBER DRAGON!

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.174
(Ai)
Oh I see.

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:16.677
The point is that she wants
to win this duel.

00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:19.279
And summoning
Varis's go-to monster

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.981
is a pretty good way to do that.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.353
Varis, who's
winning the duel?

00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:27.821
It doesn't matter,

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.991
what only matters is
who actually wins in the end.

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:32.426
And I designed Pandor

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:34.829
specifically to destroy
the Dark Ignis.

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:36.163
You misspoke.

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:39.332
You meant to say stop Ai,
not destroy.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:42.469
I know exactly what I said.

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:56.182
I have a second copy
of TOPOLOGINA BAMBEE in my hand.

00:11:56.984 --> 00:11:58.119
So like the first one,

00:11:58.185 --> 00:11:59.686
I can summon it by banishing

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.889
two more TOPOLOGINAS
from my graveyard.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.358
C'mon!

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:06.527
Haven't ya summoned
enough for one turn?

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.428
Clearly I have not.

00:12:08.562 --> 00:12:11.265
I banish the first
BAMBEE and GATSBEE

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.701
to summon my second BAMBEE
next to my BOMBER DRAGON's link,

00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:15.870
which in turn triggers

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.671
my BOMBER DRAGON's
special ability.

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:20.140
All the monsters

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:22.543
in our Main Monster Zones
are destroyed.

00:12:23.244 --> 00:12:26.046
Which means your
FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER

00:12:26.147 --> 00:12:27.581
will now be gone!

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.895
I won't let you get rid
of just my monsters!

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:45.065
When FIRE PHOENIX is destroyed,

00:12:45.199 --> 00:12:47.067
it takes another monster
down with it!

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.339
Bomb out her BOMBER DRAGON!

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.374
I don't think so.

00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:56.043
Because I can activate

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:59.346
TOPOLOGINA HONEYCOMB
BEEHICLE's effect.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.315
By banishing this spell card,

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.050
my BOMBER DRAGON
won't be destroyed.

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:08.656
Well...
So much for that.

00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:10.256
This duel's done.

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:12.626
When my BOMBER DRAGON
attacks you

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.096
it will destroy your
DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.397
Additionally,

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:20.133
whenever my BOMBER DRAGON
attacks a monster,

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:23.036
its special ability
deals you damage

00:13:23.103 --> 00:13:25.272
equal to your monster's
attack points.

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:28.275
See...

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:31.111
You have 2500 life points left.

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.248
But this attack will deal
700 points of damage,

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:38.152
and BOMBER DRAGON's ability
will deal an extra 2300,

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:39.953
meaning you lose this duel.

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:41.054
(grunts)

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:45.392
I activate DONYORIBO
@IGNISTER's ability!

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.895
When your big scary
dragon attacks

00:13:47.962 --> 00:13:49.262
my DARK TEMPLAR...

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:52.632
I can send this to the grave
to negate battle damage!

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.269
You can't get rid
of me that easily!

00:13:56.703 --> 00:13:59.807
But your DARK TEMPLAR
will still be destroyed.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.309
And though you take
no damage from the battle,

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:05.512
you will still take damage
from my DRAGON'S ability.

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.449
(grunts)

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.034
(giggles)

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:30.470
I gotta hand it to myself,
that's a handy little trick.

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:33.707
While you may have survived
from plummeting to your doom,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.176
your odds of surviving
this duel have plummeted.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.180
I'll place a card facedown
and cede the turn to you.

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:41.481
Note,

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:44.351
my calculations say
with 99% certainty

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:46.152
that you will not
succeed in winning.

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:48.855
99's not a hundred.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.626
That is not a margin of error
you should be banking on.

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.027
Let us look at the facts.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.730
You have no cards
in your hand or on your field,

00:14:56.863 --> 00:15:00.134
and you are down to 5%
of your starting life points.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.568
So what's the bad news?

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:04.038
Despite all the facts
to the contrary,

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.874
you remain confident
in the face of adversity.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.509
I would say that's
almost a human trait.

00:15:10.377 --> 00:15:12.445
So though you oppose humanity,

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.681
you have much more
in common with them.

00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:16.917
So it would be
a shame for a program

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.953
that is the most similar
to humanity

00:15:19.086 --> 00:15:21.087
to be erased by humanity.

00:15:21.956 --> 00:15:24.424
So I offer you a proposal.

00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:25.358
Oh!

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.794
This should be interesting.

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:31.131
If you end this war by returning
the code key you stole,

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.234
leave Zaizen alone
and leave this aircraft,

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.036
I will guarantee your survival.

00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:37.604
And trust you why?

00:15:37.738 --> 00:15:39.840
Aren't you programmed
to destroy me?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.909
I am, but I've determined

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:44.210
that "destroy" has
many definitions

00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.014
and the most common
is the eradication

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.382
of your total existence

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.418
until there is not a single
shred of your code left.

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:55.689
But the definition
I prefer is "to stop",

00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:59.193
which is to destroy you
by destroying your objective,

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.328
your war against
the humans.

00:16:01.462 --> 00:16:05.032
If you do not fight them,
then I do not need to erase you.

00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:07.000
So I will succeed
in destroying you

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.502
merely by stopping you.

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:11.805
And you will be able
to continue to exist.

00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:13.740
That is my proposal to you.

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.342
But don't forget,

00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:17.478
if you don't accept
my proposal,

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.179
I will be required
to destroy you

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.449
by erasing you from existence.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.917
Well, Pandor,

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.919
I've gone ahead
and made up my mind!

00:16:25.986 --> 00:16:27.454
So here's the 411...

00:16:27.754 --> 00:16:29.423
You have some
interesting points,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.925
but it all comes down
to one thing.

00:16:31.992 --> 00:16:35.462
It's this idea that you think
you're going to win this duel.

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:37.030
And that's one view

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.798
that I'm just not
willing to share.

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:40.768
So everything you
said beyond that

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.771
is just one big fan fiction
that's not gonna happen.

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:47.741
Even though I have no monsters,
and no cards,

00:16:48.142 --> 00:16:49.910
I do have a deck.

00:16:49.976 --> 00:16:53.080
And as long as I can
draw a single card,

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:55.249
I always have a chance.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.318
So I'm gonna go ahead
and draw and see...

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.756
what fate has in store for me!

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:06.326
Here goes!

00:17:06.393 --> 00:17:09.897
First, FIRE PHOENIX's ability
activates from my graveyard.

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:13.066
When it's destroyed
by a special ability,

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:15.669
it resummons itself
back into play.

00:17:15.736 --> 00:17:17.538
It is a PHOENIX after all,

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:19.573
resurrecting is kind
of its thing.

00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:22.342
Yes, I expected
you'd do this move.

00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:28.716
(Ai)
But did ya expect me

00:17:28.816 --> 00:17:30.750
to summon it
next to your DRAGON?

00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:32.519
No, I did not.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:36.490
Because doing so will trigger
BOMBER DRAGON's ability.

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:38.225
That's exactly right!

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:40.494
And that ability
will automatically destroy

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.195
my FIRE PHOENIX!

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:48.569
And when my FIRE PHOENIX
is destroyed...

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:51.538
it takes one of your monsters
down with it!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.341
You didn't really think

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:57.510
you'd hold on to BOMBER DRAGON
forever, did you?

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.414
My monster is gone,

00:18:00.547 --> 00:18:04.317
but I can activate my trap card
TOPOLOGINA BEESWAX.

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:06.253
This card gains a counter

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.423
for every Link that TOPOLOGIC
BOMBER DRAGON had,

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.491
which equals 4 counters.

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:14.294
It also gains a counter
for every TOPOLOGINA

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:17.064
that's been banished
for an additional 5.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.833
That equals a total
of 9 counters

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:20.968
placed on this card,

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:23.737
and these counters
provide protection.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:27.875
Each counter reduces the damage
we take in battle by 500.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.276
But after each battle,

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:32.213
I am required to remove
one counter from this card.

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:33.947
So I can't damage you

00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:36.950
unless I hit you
with over 4500 points.

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:38.652
Yes, that is correct.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.821
Well that's gonna
take a while.

00:18:40.955 --> 00:18:43.624
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're stallin.

00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:46.393
That is because I am stalling.

00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:48.261
This plane will now land

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:50.330
before this duel
can be completed.

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.500
So while you keep me
occupied with this duel,

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:55.936
SOL Tech's ground crew
can play hero

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.105
and whisk Zaizen away to safety.

00:18:58.439 --> 00:19:00.607
This is the most logical move.

00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:03.510
You sly little program,
you tricked me!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.612
And you said
you were going to win.

00:19:05.679 --> 00:19:06.713
(Pandor)
I didn't trick you.

00:19:06.847 --> 00:19:09.883
I said there was a 99% chance
of you not winning

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:11.519
but I never said I would win.

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:13.486
But every duel needs a winner.

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:16.189
So let's make sure
ours does as well.

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:17.190
(gasps)

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.665
We're rising into the air again?

00:19:24.731 --> 00:19:26.233
Why yes, Pandor, we are.

00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:28.502
Because I'm in control
of this plane.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.037
But how?
Since when?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.339
Since forever actually.

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:34.508
Before I even stepped
foot on to this plane,

00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:37.177
I had already hacked
into its flight control systems.

00:19:37.277 --> 00:19:39.046
So while you thought
the autopilot

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.147
was landing the plane,

00:19:40.214 --> 00:19:43.484
it was actually me
having a lil' fun.

00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:47.153
I recall you saying
that every counter has a counter

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.323
so perhaps you
should've applied it...

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.892
to real life instead
of just this duel here.

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:55.028
But if the outcome must
depend on this duel,

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.897
Know that I'll still
come out ahead

00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:58.666
because I have the advantage.

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:00.534
Nice that you think that,

00:20:00.668 --> 00:20:03.838
but duels aren't won
by having the 'advantage'...

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:06.840
They're won by having
the right card.

00:20:06.973 --> 00:20:09.509
Like the one I drew
at the start of this turn!

00:20:11.712 --> 00:20:15.849
A.I.DLE REBORN resurrects
an @IGNISTER from my graveyard!

00:20:15.949 --> 00:20:18.652
Rise again, FIRE PHOENIX!

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.991
FIRE PHOENIX,
attack Pandor directly!

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:27.194
Due to TOPOLOGINA
BEESWAX's effect,

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:28.829
I only take damage in battle

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:31.899
if your monster has
over 4500 attack points.

00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:34.502
But FIRE PHOENIX has 2300.

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:36.670
Uh-huh I know, I can count.

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:39.372
But when the amount
of battle damage

00:20:39.506 --> 00:20:42.009
that FIRE PHOENIX
deals is dropped to 0,

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:44.278
its special ability
deals you damage

00:20:44.344 --> 00:20:46.346
equal to its attack points!

00:20:47.848 --> 00:20:51.484
Since it's a special ability,
I'm unable negate the damage!

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:52.953
That's right.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.189
And I'll combo that
with DONYORIBO's ability!

00:20:57.057 --> 00:20:59.393
When I have an @IGNISTER
on my field,

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:01.962
and a special ability
will deal you damage,

00:21:02.096 --> 00:21:04.931
I can banish DONYORIBO
from my graveyard

00:21:05.031 --> 00:21:06.766
to double the damage!

00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:10.403
(scared)

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:13.874
You have all 4000
of your life points,

00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:17.778
but FIRE PHOENIX's
2300 times two equals...

00:21:17.912 --> 00:21:20.347
game over, Pandor!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.218
Impossible.

00:21:24.284 --> 00:21:26.753
There was no way the Dark Ignis
logically could've won,

00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:28.455
there's no logic
to this outcome.

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.430
Well, Pandor,

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.531
when you can out-logic, logic,

00:21:38.598 --> 00:21:43.236
my victory is clearly
the only logical conclusion.

00:21:53.113 --> 00:21:53.914
Hmmm.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.246
Hey, Zaizen.
Did you miss me much?

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.013
Cuz I missed you.

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:42.762
