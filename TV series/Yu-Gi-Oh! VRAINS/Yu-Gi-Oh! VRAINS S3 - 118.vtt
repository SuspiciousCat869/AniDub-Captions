WEBVTT

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.671
Well, Playmaker?

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.908
Don't just stand there
like a stumpy lump,

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:08.842
it's your turn.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.110
I know...

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.846
I just wish that I didn't
have to take it, Ai.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.514
To save mankind...

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:16.116
you must.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.117
Very well...

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.586
Then you're going
to get my best.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.521
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.123
It's my turn.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:24.291
I draw!

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.628
I'll start by activating
CYNET CLOSURE!

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.464
And then this
spell card banishes

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.265
one card from my deck.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.833
Hmmm.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.803
Next I summon FLAME BUFFERLO!

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:41.475
Then I activate
CYNET OPTIMIZATION's effect.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.277
This allows me to summon
FORMUD SKIPPER to the field!

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:49.115
With these two monsters,
I Link Summon!

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.085
Link 2 CYBERSE WITCH!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.288
(Ai)
CYBERSE WITCH...

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.957
I know just how to deal
with this monster.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.592
But he knows I know.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.828
So there must be something
he's planning I don't know.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.166
FORMUD SKIPPER's special ability
activates from the graveyard.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.167
When I use FORMUD SKIPPER
to Link Summon,

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.803
this ability lets me draw
a Cyberse from my deck.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.006
So I add DEGRADE BUSTER
to my hand.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.842
But that's not
the only card I'm getting!

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:18.745
When FLAME BUFFERLO
goes to the graveyard,

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.648
I can discard DOTSCAPER
to draw two cards!

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.386
And then DOTSCAPER's
very own ability activates,

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.888
resummoning itself
from the graveyard!

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:30.090
Next up, my CYBERSE WITCH

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.093
banishes CYNET CLOSURE
from my graveyard

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.562
to allow me to draw
CYBERSE MAGICIAN

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.697
and CYNET RITUAL from my deck!

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.167
(Ai)
Now I know what he's planning:

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.904
to summon one of his
most powerful monsters.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:47.508
(Playmaker)
By banishing two Cyberses
from my graveyard

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.043
I can summon DEGRADE BUSTER!

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.848
I now activate CYNET RITUAL!

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:59.753
I tribute DEGRADE BUSTER
to Ritual Summon!

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.989
CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:07.961
My, my...
You said I'd get your best.

00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:11.765
Now, I'm thrilled to see that
you're keeping that promise.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:21.708
♪♪♪

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.295
You wanted my best
so here it is.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.665
My CYBERSE WITCH
uses its ability

00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.400
to revive CLOCK WYVERN
from my graveyard!

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.337
And CLOCK WYVERN has
its own special ability!

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.474
By cutting its
attack points in half,

00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:28.508
it summons a CLOCK TOKEN!

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.815
Next, since I summoned a monster
next to CYBERSE WITCH's link,

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:38.518
SEA ARCHIVER resurrects
itself from my graveyard!

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.023
Now I'll Link Summon again!

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.625
Link 2 CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:49.663
CLOCK SPARTOI's
special ability...

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.166
allows me to draw
CYNET FUSION from my deck!

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.972
Then I'll Link Summon
a third time!

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.774
Link 3 TRANSCODE TALKER!

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.113
When TRANSCODE TALKER
is co-linked to another monster,

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:08.848
they both gain
500 attack points.

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.684
I must admit,

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.552
I'm really enjoying this!

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:13.954
These monsters!

00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:15.622
It's like your highlight reel!

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.390
And there's more to come!

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.694
I use CLOCK SPARTOI's
second ability

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.029
to revive a Cyberse
from my graveyard.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:25.198
CLOCK WYVERN!

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.705
And that's not the only monster
that I can revive.

00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:33.707
TRANSCODE TALKER can also bring

00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.009
a Cyberse monster
back from my graveyard

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.045
and summon it next to its link.

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.047
So return to the field,
DECODE TALKER!

00:04:43.384 --> 00:04:46.554
Next I use the spell...
CYNET FUSION

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:50.358
to merge my monsters into a new
and powerful creation!

00:04:50.725 --> 00:04:54.060
I Fusion Summon
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.070
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON's
ability now activates!

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.173
By sending five cards
in my deck to the graveyard,

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.976
it gains 5000 attack points!

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:12.412
Attack points
just shouldn't go that high!

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.981
But they have, Ai.

00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.116
Go CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON...

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.119
Attack FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:21.455
Actually,

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.091
when I said attack points
shouldn't go that high

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.593
it was for your sake not mine!

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.296
I activate my trap
A.I.'S SHOW!

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.798
I can summon monsters
from my Extra Deck

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.768
whose total attack points
are less than your DRAGON's,

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.403
so when you raised
its attack points,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.271
you enabled me to summon...

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.241
more monsters than before!

00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:41.174
Oh no!

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.643
So thanks for that!

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:47.113
Oh and as a bonus,
your attack is also negated!

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:48.983
Face it,

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:51.852
you're simply outmatched
in this duel, Playmaker!

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.187
Humanity's going down!

00:05:56.924 --> 00:05:58.024
(Ai)
Playmaker...

00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:01.662
I've known you longer
than a sad clown's saddest face

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:03.664
so I know your tactics.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.000
And how to counter
every last one of them.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:09.002
To stand a chance

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.638
you're going to need
to come up with a new tune.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.341
I'm done with my turn.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:17.845
Now that's a tune
I'm really familiar with.

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:21.314
It's the kind that you sing
when you're all out of options.

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.550
Really?

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.517
You think just because
I chose to end my turn

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:26.720
my path to victory
has ended, too?

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:30.524
OK... Ya got me, no I don't.

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.860
I was just trying to make
a little conversation.

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.762
I do miss our talks.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:37.497
Yes, yes, I know,

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.900
there was Roboppi
to pass the time with,

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:41.201
but we both know

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:44.004
he was a few pixels
short of a JPEG.

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.907
It's sounds as though
you were lonely, Ai.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:49.009
Me? Lonely?

00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:51.845
Oh stop it already,
you're being ridiculous!

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.848
You see, when the Cyberse
was destroyed,

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:57.517
I spent years being alone.

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.021
So just a couple o' weeks?

00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:01.655
That's nothing to me.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:03.156
Is it?

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.626
Okay, what are you trying to do,
Playmaker?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.995
Get in my head?

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.264
Well I hate to short circuit
your duel disk

00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.665
but it's just not going to work.

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.100
You see,

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:15.636
I know your duel tricks
and your mind tricks.

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.805
I'm not trying to trick you, Ai.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.474
Just to express that I know
about being alone.

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:24.278
Yes, I suppose you do.

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.379
You did suffer

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.214
throughout the Lost Incident
after all.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.482
I know that wasn't easy for you.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.619
It must've felt
like forever and a day.

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:33.954
Even longer than that
if you can imagine.

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.389
It was one of the most trying
periods in my life.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.225
But then I met you and--

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.661
Yes, yes, I know,
time really started to drag.

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:43.430
(gasps)

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:45.432
You really don't know, do you?

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.902
I'm usually ahead of the curve,
but here...

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.370
I'm clueless.

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:51.638
So please,

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:54.040
feel free to fill me in,
Playmaker.

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:55.876
(Playmaker)
Listen, Ai.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:58.112
What I was going to say

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:00.981
is that when were we a team
time just flew by.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:03.684
Well I must admit, Playmaker,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.286
didn't see that coming.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.654
Not at all.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.389
You're actually saying
that you had fun with me?

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:10.557
I am.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.392
And I know you had fun, too.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.161
But without humans
the fun's over,

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:15.162
you're alone.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.165
Which, like I said before,
I can deal with!

00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:19.166
And don't forget,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.802
I still have my vast
army of SOLtAis's

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.203
to keep me company!

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:25.939
And don't you dare
forget the squirrels!

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.442
With their chirping
and their nuts,

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.944
they're simply
charming companions!

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:31.779
Ai.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.346
Net net,
I have it all worked out.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.182
Instead of worrying about me,

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:38.652
what you should be doing
is worrying about yourself.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.788
Because after
this duel is over,

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.523
only one of us two is going
to be around to exist!

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:45.825
My turn!
I draw!

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:47.160
(shrieks)

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:49.129
Now that he's done yappin',

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.131
let's see where
I am in this duel.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:54.134
As long as Playmaker
has TRANSCODE TALKER,

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.103
I can't attack or use effects

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.339
on CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON
or CYBERSE MAGICIAN.

00:08:59.473 --> 00:09:02.175
That seriously
limits my options.

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:03.109
But then again,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.346
since I'm not really
the serious type,

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:07.114
that shouldn't be a problem!

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:09.249
I activate my spell card!

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:10.884
A.I. CONTACT!

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:14.288
I return IGNISTER A.I.LAND
from my hand to my deck

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.056
to draw three cards.

00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:19.426
Oh and they're good ones!

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:22.062
Due to WIND PEGASUS's ability,

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:25.032
I destroy a spell
or trap on your field

00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:27.234
for every @IGNISTER on my field.

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:29.737
So your CODE HACK

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.006
and CYNET OPTIMIZATION
are deleted!

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.074
(grunts)

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:37.377
Next I summon HIYARI @IGNISTER

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.412
And activate its ability!

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:42.382
By tributing FIRE PHOENIX
@IGNISTER...

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.385
I can draw A.I.'S RITUAL
from my deck.

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.721
HIYARI also gains a Level

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:49.923
for each of FIRE PHOENIX's
links.

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.392
Since FIRE PHOENIX has 3 links,

00:09:52.526 --> 00:09:55.395
HIYARI's level
rises from 1 to 4.

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.430
And last,

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:59.065
I get to draw a Ritual Monster
from my deck.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.836
I now have all the cards
to Ritual Summon!

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.274
When there's a Water Attribute
@IGNISTER on my field,

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.877
I can banish an @IGNISTER
from my grave

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.412
instead of tributing!

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.780
So I tribute HIYARI
from my field

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.550
and banish PIKARI
from my graveyard!

00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:19.052
I Ritual Summon!

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:24.024
WATER LEVIATHAN @IGNISTER!

00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:28.528
(grunts)

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:36.670
You're in big trouble now,
Playmaker.

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:39.607
When my WATER LEVIATHAN
is Ritual Summoned,

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.609
it scares away all your monsters

00:10:41.709 --> 00:10:44.711
with 2300 or lower
attack points.

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:48.215
So TRANSCODE TALKER
must return to your Extra Deck!

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:52.886
And now that
it's no longer in play,

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.256
I'm allowed to attack
your monsters again,

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:56.756
but which one shall it be?

00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.060
Hmmm.

00:10:59.193 --> 00:11:01.962
CYBERSE MAGICIAN does
have a powerful ability.

00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:04.364
And I don't like
how he's looking at me.

00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:06.466
I bet he thinks
he's better than me.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.834
That settles it!

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.439
WATER LEVIATHAN,
attack CYBERSE MAGICIAN!

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.475
And use your special ability

00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:17.510
to saw the MAGICIAN's
attack points in half!

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.782
But my MAGICIAN's ability...

00:11:21.916 --> 00:11:23.450
cuts the damage I take in half.

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:26.086
But your monster's
still destroyed!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.121
(groans)

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:29.489
Now, old friend,

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:33.460
I activate the ability
of LIGHT DRAGON!

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:36.129
When an @IGNISTER
deals you damage in battle,

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:39.266
it resummons another @IGNISTER
from my graveyard!

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.668
FIRE PHOENIX!
Resurrect!

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:46.273
This is not good.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.908
Not for you!

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:50.978
And now I'll have PHOENIX
attack CLOCK DRAGON!

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:53.113
Oh and take a looky look

00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.649
on where I chose
to summon PHOENIX.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:57.984
Smack dab in the center
of my field

00:11:58.118 --> 00:12:00.253
next to a certain Link Spell.

00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.022
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.390
Exactly!

00:12:03.524 --> 00:12:05.559
So its attack points
will double!

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.228
When FIRE PHOENIX
attacks your monster,

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:12.199
its ability deals you damage
equal to its attack points,

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:13.834
all 4600!

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:17.170
But you only have 3400
life points and change!

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.007
So it's game over, Playmaker!

00:12:20.207 --> 00:12:21.508
That's what you think, Ai!

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:25.145
I activate OVERFLOATER's ability
from my graveyard!

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:26.480
With this,

00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:28.214
when you have more monsters
in play than me,

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:31.051
I can banish OVERFLOATER
from my graveyard

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:32.686
to negate the special abilities

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:35.188
of every single
one of your monsters!

00:12:35.856 --> 00:12:36.923
You can what?

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.426
This means that
your PHOENIX's ability

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:40.527
cannot hurt me.

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.395
So the only one
who will be taking

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:44.698
damage from this attack is you!

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:53.373
(groans)

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:55.809
Tricky tricky!

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:59.046
You fooled me by playing a card
I've never seen before

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.415
and there's only one fitting
way to respond:

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:02.883
By now playing a card

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.152
that you've never
seen before as well!

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:06.419
Really.

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:07.655
Oh yeah.

00:13:07.755 --> 00:13:10.123
Presenting
for the very first time

00:13:10.424 --> 00:13:13.894
the spell card known
as FA.I.GHTING SPIRIT!

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:17.264
It resummons an @IGNISTER
from my graveyard

00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:18.599
back to my field.

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:21.468
So rise again, FIRE PHOENIX!

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.541
Each @IGNISTER
represents an Ignis,

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:31.912
so it feels like the family's
finally all back together.

00:13:32.412 --> 00:13:33.247
(gasps)

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:34.814
(Ai)
But the truth is we're not.

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:36.917
You're all still gone.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.218
But I'm here.

00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:41.454
And through me,
we'll fight as one!

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.391
Ready, Playmaker?

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:46.426
I'll now create my circuit!

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.763
And not just any circuit,

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:51.332
but one that's never
been created before

00:13:51.432 --> 00:13:53.500
or will ever be created again!

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.735
FIRE PHOENIX!

00:13:56.736 --> 00:13:58.405
WATER LEVIATHAN!

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.007
EARTH GOLEM!

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.311
WIND PEGASUS!

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:06.379
LIGHT DRAGON!

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.516
Unite with my DARK TEMPLAR!

00:14:09.817 --> 00:14:13.453
I set my six @IGNISTERS
in the Link Arrows!

00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:18.992
I now Link Summon!

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:22.562
The six of us
now merge into one!

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.666
The superior, splendid,

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.869
strong, stunning, super...

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:31.771
How many is that?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.008
I'm one word short.

00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:34.975
Okay.

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:37.278
Super super!

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:38.812
That makes it six!

00:14:38.945 --> 00:14:39.647
Rewind!

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.649
The superior, splendid,
strong, stunning,

00:14:42.783 --> 00:14:45.385
super, super super Link Monster!

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.489
The one that rules above all!

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:54.461
Link 6 THE ARRIVAL
CYBERSE @IGNISTER!

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:58.031
What? Link 6?

00:14:58.165 --> 00:14:59.667
(Ai)
That's right, meatbag!

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.102
And THE ARRIVAL gains
1000 attack points

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:04.705
for every monster I used
to Link Summon it.

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:06.706
Six monsters equals...

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:10.378
6000 attack points!

00:15:11.011 --> 00:15:14.581
The ARRIVAL also gains
an additional 1000 attack points

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:16.884
for every card
that I have on my field.

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:19.886
Since I have one-two-three-four,

00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:23.256
that's 4000 additional
attack points.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.060
And it also gains a counter,
once every turn!

00:15:28.695 --> 00:15:31.031
It has 10000 attack points?!

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:33.234
That's correct, Playmaker.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:36.871
But THE ARRIVAL is more
than just attack points!

00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:40.207
As you're about to find out,
a whole lot more!

00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:42.509
(laughs)

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:48.215
Quite the monster,
huh, Playmaker?

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.518
But THE ARRIVAL is more
than just attack points.

00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:54.087
It can destroy
any monster on the field!

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:56.523
And then it summons
an @IGNISTER TOKEN

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.225
next to one of its links.

00:15:58.358 --> 00:15:59.059
What?

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:00.961
(laughs)

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:02.529
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON...

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:03.831
Bye byeeee!

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.132
Your time has
officially run out!

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.271
Since I summoned this TOKEN,

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.941
that means there's
another card on my field.

00:16:14.008 --> 00:16:17.644
So THE ARRIVAL gains
1000 more attack points!

00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:22.516
However, you triggered
my CLOCK DRAGON's ability!

00:16:22.616 --> 00:16:25.452
Since THE ARRIVAL used
an ability to destroy it,

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:29.022
I am now allowed to draw
one spell card from my deck!

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:30.791
Ooh, I'm so scared!

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:33.760
But this is even more scary...

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:38.365
I Link Summon!
Link 1 DARKWIGHT @IGNISTER!

00:16:40.134 --> 00:16:41.769
No attack points is scary?

00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:44.471
Ugh, that's not the scary part.

00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:46.807
When DARKWIGHT's linked
to another monster,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.141
it can't be attacked.

00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:49.776
Meaning if you wanna defeat me,

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.512
you have to go
through THE ARRIVAL.

00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:54.281
And its eleven kay in attack.

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:55.849
Should be a piece of cake.

00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:57.918
All you gotta do
is summon a monster

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:00.520
with 11000
and one attack points.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.189
Perhaps, Ai.

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:03.757
Now... my turn!

00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:06.026
One thing is for sure:

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:08.362
if I don't do something
about those attack points,

00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:09.763
I have no chance.

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:12.999
First I summon CYBERSE GADGET!

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.703
When I successfully
summon CYBERSE GADGET,

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:18.839
I can revive a monster
from my grave!

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.974
And the one I pick is...

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.509
FORMUD SKIPPER!

00:17:24.177 --> 00:17:25.478
I Link Summon!

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.149
Link 2 CYBERSE WICCKID!

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:33.687
When I use FORMUD SKIPPER
to Link Summon,

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.089
I'm allowed to draw a Level 5

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:39.092
or higher Cyberse monster
straight from my deck!

00:17:39.192 --> 00:17:39.927
And then...

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:42.029
CYBERSE GADGET's
ability activates!

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:43.997
When it goes to the graveyard,

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:46.366
I get to summon
a GADGET TOKEN...

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:49.336
next to CYBERSE WICCKID's link!

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:52.506
And doing so will then
trigger its special ability!

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.075
By banishing my DOTSCAPER...

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.377
I'm allowed to draw
CYBERSE SYNCHRON

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:58.512
from my deck!

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.248
Which then triggers
DOTSCAPER's ability!

00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:05.252
When DOTSCAPER is banished,
it resummons itself!

00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:08.656
And that allows me
to Link Summon!

00:18:08.756 --> 00:18:11.224
Link 2 EXSLAYER!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:18.932
And if you think I'm done
summoning, think again!

00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:21.568
Because when I successfully
summon a Link Monster,

00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:24.704
I can summon PARALLEL EXCEED
next to its link!

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.542
Then I can summon
a second PARALLEL EXCEED

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:29.743
from my deck...

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:31.245
so long as I cut

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.880
both their Levels
and defense points by half--

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.216
So now their Levels
are down to 4.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:39.286
But that is exactly
what I'm aiming for.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.090
And the reason why
is now I can use these two...

00:18:43.157 --> 00:18:45.592
to build the Overlay network!

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:53.934
I will now Xyz Summon!

00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:57.604
Rank 4 FIREWALL EXCEED DRAGON!

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.012
I activate its ability!

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:07.514
When EXCEED DRAGON
is linked to EXSLAYER,

00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:10.817
it gains 500 attack points
for each of its Links.

00:19:12.987 --> 00:19:15.222
Then EXSLAYER's
ability activates!

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:19.393
When I Xyz Summon
a monster next to its link,

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.128
I can tribute another monster

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.363
to summon a different
one from my hand!

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.534
So I now tribute my GADGET TOKEN

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.703
to summon WIDGET KID!

00:19:30.604 --> 00:19:32.105
Hey, I know him!

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:34.174
That lil' fella
was our set up to summon

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:35.976
our most powerful mons--

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:37.711
Wait, this isn't cool.

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:40.181
But it is cool for me.

00:19:40.648 --> 00:19:43.817
WIDGET KID now summons
a Cyberse from my hand.

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:45.518
CYBERSE SYNCHRON!

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:49.523
Then CYBERSE SYNCHRON's
ability activates!

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:55.328
This Tuner Monster doubles
WIDGET KID's Level from 3 to 6!

00:19:57.331 --> 00:19:59.500
I tune my Level 1
CYBERSE SYNCHRON

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:01.801
with my Level 6 WIDGET KID!

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:07.841
Let's see...

00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:09.977
One plus six adds up...

00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:10.878
To five!

00:20:11.178 --> 00:20:12.612
Double check your math, Ai!

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.681
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:18.051
Level 7 CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON!

00:20:20.854 --> 00:20:21.955
(grunts)

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:24.057
If you said 5 instead of 7,
you woulda messed up,

00:20:24.157 --> 00:20:26.694
because your summoning
speech and been DQ'ed!

00:20:26.827 --> 00:20:28.329
Well at least that's
how I think it works

00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:29.396
but it probably doesn't

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:31.865
cuz truth is sometimes
I just make up rules.

00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:33.334
Here goes!

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.137
CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON,
attack THE ARRIVAL @IGNISTER!

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:41.942
QUANTUM DRAGON's
ability activates!

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:43.310
The monster it attacks

00:20:43.377 --> 00:20:45.445
automatically
returns to your hand,

00:20:45.512 --> 00:20:47.881
so THE ARRIVAL must now
leave the field.

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:51.652
THE ARRIVAL can't leave,
Playmaker.

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:54.355
Or else, its name
won't make any sense!

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:57.357
I mean, how can you be
departing when you're arriving?

00:20:57.824 --> 00:20:59.526
So let me fix that for you.

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:03.097
When THE ARRIVAL
has a counter on it,

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.632
it's immune to all your cards
and monsters!

00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:06.399
Wha-?

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.703
In other words, meatbag,
THE ARRIVAL is here to stay.

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.439
And when it destroys
your QUANTUM DRAGON,

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.708
you'll take enough damage
to lose the rest...

00:21:15.209 --> 00:21:16.877
of your life points!

00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:23.583
You're played, Playmaker.

00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:39.065
