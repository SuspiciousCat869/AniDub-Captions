WEBVTT

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.278
If this is all
just a nightmare...

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.180
Sure wish my alarm
would ring.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.082
And I def
won't push snooze!

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.356
People are getting
zapped again!

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.959
Yes-- and these blasts
are the worst ones yet.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.660
Bohman is using
his Neuron Link

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.662
so he can absorb
everyone's energy

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.597
in order to power his duel.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.766
We need to shut
this system down now.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.004
(Ai)
It's another Data Storm!

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:38.973
And that means more people
in LINK VRAINS

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:42.175
are having to suffer
because of Bohman.

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:49.450
It's time to elevate my Skill
to a whole new level!

00:00:49.483 --> 00:00:51.818
Master Storm Access!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.821
Now watch as I acquire
a new monster

00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:58.491
the likes of which
you've never seen!

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:08.001
(fainting)

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.874
So Bohman uses people's
brain waves to power its duel.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.243
But what we don't know is how
it's doing it--

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:18.479
that's what we gotta
figure out.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:23.016
Yeah, and I am just the person
to figure it out, too.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.152
No worries,
I've got this.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.921
Confident words.
Think you can back them up?

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.258
Absolutely-- 50% sure.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:36.056
I activate CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE
DRAGRID's ability!

00:02:36.123 --> 00:02:40.627
I use one of its HYDRADRIVE
Counters to roll a die.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:44.631
Now go Judgment Dice!

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.401
By returning my CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID

00:02:47.468 --> 00:02:51.739
to my Extra Deck, I can summon
a CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE DRAGHEAD

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:56.743
that has the same Attribute
as the one that I roll.

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.445
And it's Water!

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:02.016
So I summon HYDRADRIVE
DRAGHEAD AQUA!

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.717
(Ai)
Aqua...?

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:06.853
(Bohman)
Yes-- I'm using the Water
Ignis's power

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:12.692
to its full potential--
something even <i>she</i> could not do!

00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.733
(roaring)

00:03:19.834 --> 00:03:22.602
My AQUA's special ability
activates!

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.771
Any monster that
AQUA isn't linked to

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.207
loses its special
abilities.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.842
Not good.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.545
(Ai)
Our QUANTUM DRAGON's
abilities are kaput!

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.981
Wait, this means Playmaker
can't attack!

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:36.984
(growling)
And if he can't attack,

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:38.185
then he can't win!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.355
I'll place this facedown.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.623
Your turn.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.524
When your turn ends,
DRAGHEAD-AQUA

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:47.060
returns to my
Extra Deck...

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:49.830
and resummons
CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:52.632
back to my field.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:59.273
And DRAGRID regains
its HYDRADRIVE Counter.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.910
I knew you were going to summon
QUANTUM DRAGON all along,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.279
so I had
a counterstrategy ready.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.780
Yeah, right!

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.117
'Cause psychic powers is one of
your new abilities too?

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:12.553
No, because when I absorb
those human minds

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:17.291
with my Neuron Link,
I also absorb their thoughts.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.226
No way!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.862
It's quite helpful
that you're so popular.

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:25.432
For you see, humans know that
if they want to be the best,

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.368
they have to beat the best.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.404
And there is no one better
than you, Playmaker.

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:33.373
So they analyzed your moves
to devise strategies,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.243
counterstrategies
to defeat you.

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:37.744
<i>I've studied all of
Playmaker's duels!</i>

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:39.580
<i>I memorized his deck!
I'm training to duel him!</i>

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.081
<i>If he summons DECODE TALKER,
I bet I can play this spell...</i>

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.616
<i>How do I counter that trap?</i>

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:45.085
One single individual can't
think of every move

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:48.188
you would make,
but together they can.

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.257
I see-- since you were
able to gather

00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.259
all of their knowledge
by stealing it,

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:55.028
you think you're able
to predict my every move.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:57.231
(Bohman)
I don't think it,
I know it.

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:59.933
Isn't it funny that
those who most admire you

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.402
will end up being
your downfall?

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.239
As they make me stronger,
they make your duel weaker.

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:09.977
And there is no end to
how much stronger I can get.

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:12.780
(Ai)
Uh-uh! You can't get any
stronger after you soak up

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.848
every person in LINK VRAINS
and there's no one left

00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:18.685
to power you up--
not that that's what I want...

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:21.822
But that's just it, Ai,
I won't run out.

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:23.957
Because more and more
are logging into

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:27.127
LINK VRAINS as we speak.
They are?

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.595
You're pulling on my electrodes.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.465
It's true-- humans have
an emotional glitch

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:33.833
that is known as
"fear of missing out."

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:36.136
<i>A mysterious glitch has
prevented millions of duelists</i>

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.805
<i>from logging out of
LINK VRAINS.</i>

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.107
<i>And we're receiving reports
that players in the real world</i>

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.642
<i>have fallen unconscious.</i>

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:44.145
<i>As rumors spread of a possible
attack into LINK VRAINS,</i>

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:48.849
<i>SOL Technologies has so far
been unavailable for comment.</i>

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.584
Chief, I got bad news,

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.954
duelists are logging into LINK
VRAINS at ridiculous rates!

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:56.489
(Zaizen)
<i>Wha--!? No... Not now...</i>

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:58.425
(Hayami)
<i>Sorry sir, but they're
curious to find out</i>

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.061
<i>what's going on
in there.</i>

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.064
And they will--
the hard way, I'm afraid.

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.268
(male avatar 1)
<i>Whoa! Check it out!</i>

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.704
(male avatar 2)
<i>Wow! Look!</i>

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.707
It's a siesta fest!
Awesome!

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.709
Uh...
I wouldn't say awesome...

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.044
Yeah, they look like
they're sleeping,

00:06:17.144 --> 00:06:18.646
but who sleeps
with their eyes open?

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.415
Guys, I'm kinda getting
creeped out here...

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:24.718
Why are they logging in?
Don't they know the know?

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:28.989
(screaming)
Let's log outta here!

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.357
No! It's not working!

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:33.527
Ah!
This is never gonna end.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.331
Mommy! Get me outta here,
pretty please!

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.432
They're like moths
flying towards a flame--

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.568
they just can't
help themselves.

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.203
When Bohman took over
the system,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.306
it made sure people could
log in but not log out,

00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:50.377
trapping more and more to
exploit in its one-way street.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:53.380
(Ghost Gal)
More and more duelists
are still logging in.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.216
Meaning Bohman will get
even more powerful

00:06:55.316 --> 00:06:57.717
if we don't shut
this system down!

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.994
The supply I can draw from
is never ending.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.763
And I'll do so again!

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:12.833
It's my turn!

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.901
And with it, I use...

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:17.538
My Skill again!

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.474
And the next monster
I draw from the Data Storm

00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:22.943
will be the last, Playmaker!

00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:26.046
For it will be the one
to finish you.

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:38.793
Just gotta keep runnin'.

00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:44.164
Can't get zapped by lightning
if ya run faster than light--

00:07:44.264 --> 00:07:49.769
I use more humans to activate
Master Storm Access!

00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.442
We have to stop Bohman

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.711
before more people
get hurt because of him.

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.682
Yeah, but how?
It's not even our turn!

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:03.183
(Zaizen)
According to these logs,

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:04.985
Bohman's targeting
user accounts,

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:07.021
but not admin
accounts like mine.

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:09.523
So that means we're safe
from being deleted.

00:08:09.623 --> 00:08:11.024
Until he changes his mind

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.027
and starts targeting
the admin accounts.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.729
(Zaizen)
I was going to say
"safe for now."

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.699
For now, for later-- it's all
going to be the same in the end

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.835
if we're not able
to shut down the system.

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:24.938
(Genome)
I figured out how
the Neuron Link works.

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.841
The key to it is
the super-positioning

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.943
of LINK VRAINS with Mirror
LINK VRAINS.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.845
You could've just said
the two LINK VRAINS

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.448
are stacked on top
of each other.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.649
That's true,
I could've,

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.284
but I wanted to sound
intellectual like you.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.288
This perfect overlap is what
stabilizes the Neuron Link--

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.825
allowing Bohman to draw
energy from our world.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.961
<i>Then if we separate
the two LINK VRAINS,</i>

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:49.396
<i>wouldn't that destabilize
the Neuron Link?</i>

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:51.532
Yes, I believe it would.

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.867
<i>How do we split
the two LINK brains apart?</i>

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.803
(Genome)
Your guess is as good
as mine.

00:08:56.837 --> 00:08:59.706
Playmaker, I know
all your strategies

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.375
and how to stop them.

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.744
I know how to exploit
your weaknesses.

00:09:03.778 --> 00:09:05.412
I know everything!

00:09:05.446 --> 00:09:09.617
And I know-- and you know--
that you cannot win this duel.

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.585
(Ai)
And according to
the villain handbook,

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.721
this is where you
tell us to surrender

00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:15.756
because we can't win.

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.258
No, Ai, I would never,

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:21.394
because I know I'd
just be wasting my breath

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:24.131
because I know you
won't surrender...

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:26.200
even if it's
the right call.

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:30.403
As I said,
I know everything.

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:33.040
Besides, I would
never disrespect you

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:35.008
by uttering those words.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:37.844
Because I respect you,
Playmaker.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.115
Without you, I would
not be who I am today.

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:44.918
As my most formidable foe,
you forced me to improve.

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:47.555
You forced me to hone
and polish my skills

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:49.256
to become a better duelist.

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.792
And through all that
trial and tribulation,

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.294
I have achieved
perfection.

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:56.764
And that is why,
when I defeat you

00:09:56.797 --> 00:10:01.134
and absorb your data into me,
I do so with gratitude.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:03.904
Well, you can take
your gratitude and flush it!

00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:05.505
I know you're only
lashing out

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.441
because you're
scared, Ai.

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:09.510
But there's nothing
to fear.

00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:10.911
Once you're part of me,

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.413
your current existence
will be gone.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.615
Doesn't that
sound wonderful?

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:16.884
How is that wonderful?

00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.687
Oh, but it is, because if
you don't exist,

00:10:19.754 --> 00:10:22.423
then your memories
will be gone as well.

00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:25.192
I will never
let that happen.

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.928
Of course you will try,
I know you will fight me

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.931
to the very end to prevent
that from happening,

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:35.569
because that is the person
you are, and of all things,

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:39.406
that is what I find myself
respecting the most about you.

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:42.009
Um, thank you, I guess?

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.278
Let's get back to the duel.

00:10:44.378 --> 00:10:47.380
I activate my
DRAGRID's ability!

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.917
First I will roll
an Attribute.

00:10:50.017 --> 00:10:53.387
And the Attribute is...
Fire!

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.391
This means I can summon CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGHEAD-FLAME!

00:11:01.662 --> 00:11:03.663
(roaring)

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.268
(Ai)
Flame?

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.070
Why can't he just
leave us Ignis alone?

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:11.938
This duel is over.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.808
Because I play
FLAME's ability!

00:11:14.908 --> 00:11:18.012
It destroys all monsters
that it's not linked with.

00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:21.282
Meaning your QUANTUM DRAGON
is destroyed.

00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:23.584
Playmaker won't have
anything left to defend with!

00:11:23.651 --> 00:11:26.620
So he'll be wide open
to his next attack!

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:28.822
Oh, no!
It's really over!

00:11:28.922 --> 00:11:30.490
It's really, really over!

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:34.494
FLAME!
Destroy his DRAGON!

00:11:38.866 --> 00:11:42.135
(Bohman)
It's the beginning of the end
for you, Playmaker!

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:44.638
I wouldn't be so certain
about that.

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.842
By banishing CYBERSE SYNCHRON
from my graveyard,

00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:53.079
it prevents my CYBERSE QUANTUM
DRAGON from being destroyed!

00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:02.055
Impressive.
Very impressive.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.025
But though you and your monster
will survive this turn,

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.993
DRAGHEAD-FLAME's attack
will still deal you

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.030
a significant
amount of damage.

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:15.869
With that, I end my turn.

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.071
Phew-- that was close!

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:20.874
When my turn is over...

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:23.477
DRAGHEAD-FLAME returns
to my Extra Deck

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:28.982
and transforms back into
CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.652
This triggers
DRAGRID's ability,

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:36.557
allowing it to regain
a HYDRADRIVE Counter.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.260
(Klarissa)
<i>How do we split the two
LINK VRAINS apart?</i>

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.096
What is it?
Did you find something?

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.733
Maybe, maybe not.

00:12:45.766 --> 00:12:47.168
According to my
calculations,

00:12:47.234 --> 00:12:49.303
it will require more energy
than we can generate

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.205
to break the two
LINK VRAINS apart

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.541
because their overlap
is pixel perfect.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.310
<i>That's not surprising.</i>

00:12:56.377 --> 00:12:58.545
<i>Bohman's Neuron Link requires
a crystal clear connection</i>

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:01.482
<i>to work at optimal efficiency.
Any offset--</i>

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:04.919
<i>even a pixel--
would degrade the signal.</i>

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.788
Yes-- but to maintain
such a perfect overlap

00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:10.724
requires significant
energy from Bohman.

00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:12.959
So if Bohman
has to spend its energy

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:14.661
and focus
on something else,

00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:18.165
it may not have enough energy
to maintain the overlap.

00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.233
Giving us the
perfect opportunity

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.437
to split the two
LINK VRAINS apart.

00:13:23.537 --> 00:13:25.105
But when would it
need to use

00:13:25.205 --> 00:13:27.974
such significant energy
for something else?

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:31.245
When it uses its Skill
to create the Data Storm,

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.280
that will be our
moment to strike.

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.448
But we must be precise

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:37.451
because that Skill only
lasts for a moment.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.953
Sounds like
a perfect plan to me!

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:41.321
Yes, but I'm still
worried

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:44.124
because this plan of ours
depends on a lot of ifs.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.293
"If" Bohman choses
to use its Skill again,

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.795
and "if" that will divert
enough energy from the overlap

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:51.064
to weaken it enough
for us to break it.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.433
I would feel
a lot more confident

00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.301
if we weren't
the only ones trying

00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.769
to break the connection.

00:13:55.802 --> 00:13:57.772
<i>Then today's
your lucky day.</i>

00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:00.541
<i>I know someone who can help.</i>

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:02.776
Seriously--
Zaizen and Ghost Gal?!

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:04.545
What on earth
makes you think

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.847
that they'd ever consider
working with us?

00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:09.316
<i>Because they
don't have a choice.</i>

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.318
This should be interesting.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:14.521
(beeping)
Huh?

00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:17.024
<i>Ghost Gal. Zaizen.
Come in.</i>

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.225
<i>I repeat, come in.</i>

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.360
Uh, Ghost Gal here.
Who's this?

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.796
<i>This is Faust of
the Knights of Hanoi.</i>

00:14:22.863 --> 00:14:24.164
The Hanoi?

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.034
What do the Hanoi
want with us?

00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:30.837
<i>I believe we can help
each other for a common cause.</i>

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:37.845
I'm so close,
so close to creating

00:14:37.945 --> 00:14:41.047
a perfect world
of my own design.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.385
I have used my superior
intellect to calculate

00:14:45.485 --> 00:14:47.221
what would make
the ideal world

00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:49.356
by fixing
what does not work

00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:54.495
and improving on what does
to build a utopia.

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:57.197
A utopia built
by using humans!

00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:59.566
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.770
As I said before,
sacrificing you is not the same

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.005
as the end of
your existence.

00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:08.875
Because you will all
continue to live on, inside me.

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:12.245
And give me the opportunity
to fix your flaws.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:14.681
Because humans are
far from perfect.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:17.918
Why, just looking at
your world is proof enough.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:21.221
Wars, inequality, poverty,
pollution, crimes--

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.189
none of these
problems would exist

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.426
if humans just made
the right choices.

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:29.130
But you do not, and that
is what I-- and only I-- can,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.866
and will, fix, and when
I say fix you humans,

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:35.936
I aim to fix you as well,
Playmaker.

00:15:36.036 --> 00:15:38.939
There's no need for that.
But there is.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.241
Remember, I know
the struggles you've had

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:42.876
since the Lost Incident.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.613
But I can fix that--
by erasing your memories.

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:49.382
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to be free of the memories

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.518
that haunt you, Playmaker?

00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:54.254
You don't have to relive
the Lost Incident ever again.

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:57.024
You don't have to
relive those lonely days.

00:15:57.091 --> 00:15:59.092
You will be... free.

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.794
That's where
you're wrong, Bohman.

00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:02.429
I don't want to be free
of those memories,

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.464
because as painful
as those times were,

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:07.000
those memories
make me who I am.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.436
If it hadn't been
for the Lost Incident,

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.772
I wouldn't have met someone
who would stick by me

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:14.141
through thick and thin,
even when I didn't think

00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:17.177
I wanted him to.
And he led me to others--

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:19.079
those who would
become my allies--

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:20.814
and even become
my friends.

00:16:20.914 --> 00:16:23.450
Why would I ever want
to forget that?

00:16:23.483 --> 00:16:24.985
This world may not
be perfect,

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.121
but that doesn't mean it needs
to be destroyed and rebuilt.

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.690
Because we can
all work together

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.525
to fix the parts
that are broken.

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:34.195
And I am living proof.

00:16:34.295 --> 00:16:37.164
What you are saying,
sounds oh, so very nice--

00:16:37.198 --> 00:16:40.868
but it's a fairy tale
and it can never happen.

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:43.003
There's nothing wrong
with fairy tales, Bohman--

00:16:43.104 --> 00:16:45.439
and just because
it's a fairy tale to you

00:16:45.473 --> 00:16:48.075
doesn't mean it's not
a true tale for me.

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:49.977
And we will
prove it to you...

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.779
by winning this duel!

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:57.951
So you think you can
sever Bohman's Neuron Link

00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:01.055
by pulling LINK VRAINS
and Mirror LINK VRAINS apart?

00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:03.023
<i>Yes, but only with
your help.</i>

00:17:03.057 --> 00:17:04.991
<i>We need to simultaneously
attack the system</i>

00:17:05.058 --> 00:17:07.494
<i>from both inside
and outside LINK VRAINS</i>

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.564
<i>at the precise moment
when Bohman uses its Skill.</i>

00:17:10.598 --> 00:17:14.568
Uses its Skill?
That's super precise.

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:18.806
<i>Yes, it won't be easy,
but it's the only way.</i>

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.040
Unbelievable.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.811
The Hanoi actually expects me
to work with them,

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.413
after all they did?
Oh, lighten up, Akira.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:27.714
It's not like
they're asking us

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:29.549
to spend quality time
together.

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:32.719
They just want our help
in stopping a common foe.

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.323
'Cause we all lost someone
in this battle.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.894
But, hey, running LINK VRAINS
is your baby, not mine.

00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:45.332
So in the end, it's your
decision to decide.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.268
Tell the Hanoi
that the plan is a go.

00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:48.702
It's the right call.

00:17:48.802 --> 00:17:51.805
And I have just the right tool
to get this job done.

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:55.643
What is that?

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:58.578
Oh it's just a little something
I've been working on...

00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:02.316
And it should be a real
"blast" for Bohman.

00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:05.285
<i>Zaizen's in. We may only
get one chance at this,</i>

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:07.755
<i>but at least we're
giving it our best chance.</i>

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:09.457
And let's hope it works,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.760
because if it doesn't,
it's game over.

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:13.960
Ready, Ai?

00:18:13.994 --> 00:18:16.397
Though Bohman may have
the lead right now,

00:18:16.463 --> 00:18:19.233
this duel's far
from being over.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.636
It's my turn-- ha!

00:18:22.736 --> 00:18:25.105
I summon CLOCK WYVERN!

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.110
And when CLOCK WYVERN
is successfully summoned

00:18:30.144 --> 00:18:32.579
to my field, I can cut its
attack points in half

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.114
to summon a CLOCK TOKEN.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.052
And I'll use it
to create my circuit

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:41.621
by setting it
in the Link Arrow!

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:48.128
I Link Summon!
Link 1 LINK SPIDER!

00:18:49.563 --> 00:18:51.298
LINK SPIDER's
special ability

00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:55.803
allows me to summon
a monster next to its link!

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:59.039
I summon PROTRON
in defense mode!

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:05.512
And I'll follow that up
by setting two Cyberse monsters

00:19:05.612 --> 00:19:10.784
in the Link Arrows
to create my circuit again!

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:15.789
I Link Summon!
Link 2 CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:19:17.457 --> 00:19:19.993
In addition, when CLOCK SPARTOI
is Link Summoned,

00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:22.396
its special ability activates,
allowing me

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:26.333
to draw CYNET FUSION
from my deck!

00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:30.303
Then I'll create
my circuit for a third time!

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:35.042
I set my PROTRON
in the Link Arrow!

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:39.679
I Link Summon!
Link 1 LINKURIBOH!

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:44.518
Link Summon as many
monsters as you please.

00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:47.054
Those little monsters
have absolutely no chance

00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:51.025
against my CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID.

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:53.860
Oh, yeah? Well you have
no chance of being invited

00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:57.230
to our victory party,
even if you bring a cake!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.533
Well, you can bring it,
but ya can't stay!

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.301
Or how about,

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.705
I activate CLOCK SPARTOI's
special ability instead!

00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:08.375
It lets me re-summon
a Cyberse from my graveyard!

00:20:08.475 --> 00:20:12.312
So welcome back
CLOCK WYVERN!

00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:14.014
Then I activate
this card--

00:20:14.114 --> 00:20:18.152
the spell
CYNET FUSION!

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:20.387
It lets me fuse
CLOCK WYVERN...

00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:21.688
LINKURIBOH...

00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:25.459
and CLOCK SPARTOI
together into one!

00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:28.328
Ah, a Fusion Monster.

00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:29.864
That's right!

00:20:29.897 --> 00:20:32.832
(Playmaker)
By fusing my monsters,
I merge them into a new,

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:36.803
even more powerful
creation!

00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:42.342
I Fusion Summon!

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:48.848
Rise up!
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:00.493
We're back
in business!

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:05.265
Oh? But your monster has fewer
attack points than mine.

00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:09.170
Oh!
But that's only temporary.

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:11.939
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON's
ability activates!

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.840
Since the monsters
I used to summon it

00:21:13.907 --> 00:21:16.544
had three Link Arrows
in total,

00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:18.579
by discarding three cards

00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:20.548
from my deck
to the graveyard,

00:21:20.581 --> 00:21:24.084
my DRAGON gains
1000 attack points per card.

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:27.221
Three cards equals
3000 attack points

00:21:27.254 --> 00:21:29.055
and that adds up to
a whole lot of trouble!

00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:35.095
5500 attack points.

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:36.564
(Ai)
Yep, which means
it's now

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:40.300
stronger than
your DRAGRID.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.769
You said you prepared
for everything,

00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:45.772
but it seems you didn't
prepare for this!
