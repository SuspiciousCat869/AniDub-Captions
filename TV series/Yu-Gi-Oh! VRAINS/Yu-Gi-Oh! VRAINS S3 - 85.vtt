WEBVTT

00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:07.641
(groans)

00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:09.009
I've got you!

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.809
Thank you.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.745
Tough riding.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.980
And it's only going
to get tougher.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.848
After all, once we exit
this portal,

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.318
there'll be plenty more
obstacles for us to face.

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:20.254
Then heighten your haunches
cuz there's our exit!

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:20.921
Okay.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.355
Everyone, get ready!

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.659
It's time for us to do
what only we can do.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.960
Stop Lightning!

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:39.272
(electronic whirring)

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.688
(electronic whirring)

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.594
(Playmaker)
Here we are,

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.062
Mirror Link VRAINS.

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.897
Ya think we'll get
seven years bad luck

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.432
if we break this place?

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.901
Okay, you two,
it's the end of the road!

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.369
(both)
What?

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.838
Relax, I don't mean that
I'm going to terminate you.

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:46.140
Just that you're both
on your own now.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.042
Hope you enjoyed
the free ride.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.576
(groaning)

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.544
(screaming)

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.546
Free ride?
More like free fall!

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.047
(grunts)

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.382
Things sure are wonky here.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.217
Wonder how LINK VRAINS is.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.820
Kolter, status update?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.821
It's wigging out a bit

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.890
but it's nothing too crazy.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.593
At least not yet.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.063
(Avatar A)
Awesome!
A new event must be starting!

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:11.632
(Avatar B)
Or someone uploaded
the wrong color patch!

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:12.966
I dunno, guys,

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.769
something just feels
a little off about all this.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.605
(Zaizen)
Hayami, take charge.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.207
(Hayami)
Going somewhere, chief?

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:21.108
LINK VRAINS.

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.077
To find out what's going on.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.445
(Playmaker)
Keep us in the loop, Kolter.

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:25.913
If anything changes...

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:27.281
be sure to let us know.

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:28.648
(Kolter)
<i>Well here's a change.</i>

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.317
<i>Buncha blips
headed your way!</i>

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:30.751
What?

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.819
(all)

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.787
You hacksters
ain't welcome here!

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:35.289
Aww, glitch!

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.122
Bitboots!

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.292
They're closing in, spread out!

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.794
(Lightning)
Humans are such fools.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:42.730
Why would they enter my world

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.565
knowing I have
every advantage here?

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.868
<i>As proof,
Bitboot's initial attacks</i>

00:02:47.868 --> 00:02:49.636
<i>have already
scattered them.</i>

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:53.140
<i>They will now be simple
to pick off one by one.</i>

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.774
<i>And we shall start</i>

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.709
<i>with this one:</i>

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.077
<i>Blue Maiden.</i>

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.412
I'll go.

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:00.280
<i>Are you certain
you can handle her?</i>

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.981
<i>Blue Maiden or shall I say</i>

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.717
<i>Skye Zaizen</i>

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:06.820
<i>is the younger sister
of Akira Zaizen.</i>

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.188
Heh, big deal.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.657
<i>Correct. He
is a big deal.</i>

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:14.327
<i>He is in charge of
SOL Technologies' security.</i>

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.529
<i>With connections
like that,</i>

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.898
<i>she's sure to be
quite formidable.</i>

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:20.234
What, don't you trust me?

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.169
<i>Now, now, I
didn't say that.</i>

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.305
<i>I'm just concerned for you,
my friend.</i>

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.108
<i>After all, now that Blue
Maiden has partnered with
Aqua,</i>

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.210
<i>she's stronger than ever.</i>

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.013
<i>I would prefer to send Bohman
to deal with her</i>

00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:37.217
<i>but alas, he's still in
no condition to fight.</i>

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.853
<i>However, be
that as it may.</i>

00:03:39.853 --> 00:03:41.021
<i>It's only a
matter of time</i>

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.957
<i>before Bitboot
is defeated so...</i>

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.826
<i>yes, seems I
have no choice</i>

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.362
<i>but to rely on
you, my friend.</i>

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.964
And at the very least
I can buy us some time

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.832
for Bohman to recover.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.002
<i>Don't talk like
you'll lose.</i>

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.271
<i>Win and return safely.</i>

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.171
For sure!

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:03.577
Although, in battle
there are no sure things.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.347
What if Blue Maiden does win?

00:04:06.347 --> 00:04:08.081
I mean she won't,
I'll beat her no problem

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.518
but if for some reason I can't,

00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:12.586
then right now would be...

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.955
my last chance to see Bohman.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.925
(growls)

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.198
(Bohman)
What is it, Harlin?

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.700
Hey there, Bohman,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.702
just thought I'd stop by
to see how you're feeling.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:30.036
Stronger by the minute.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.905
As I synchronize further
and further,

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.707
I am becoming one
with this world,

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:35.609
becoming immortal.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.077
Glad to hear.

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:37.845
But you didn't

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.913
come simply to check on me,

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:40.414
did you?

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:41.248
Tell me what

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.750
's truly
on your mind.

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:48.589
Playmaker's squad is here.

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.024
Yes, I know.

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:51.125
To stop us.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.092
Yeah.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.927
But I'll take care of 'em.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.630
No, Harlin, do not engage them.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.798
Why not?

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.366
It's too dangerous.

00:04:59.366 --> 00:04:59.699
But...

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.734
it

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:01.801
's not like
you can fight them.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.271
Now, Harlin, you and I both know

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.307
you're not skilled enough
to beat them by yourself.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.077
What are you saying,
you don't believe in me?!

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:12.513
If you lose in this world,
you'll be deleted.

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:13.447
So I'd rather hurt

00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:15.916
your feelings than lose you.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.918
(Harlin)
Well, maybe
it's better that way.

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:21.088
After all, it's not like you and
Lightning need me anymore!

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.956
Once you synchronize
with this world,

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.459
you'll basically
be unstoppable!

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.828
It's not about need,
it's about want.

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.531
And I don't want
to lose my brother.

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:31.665
Enough of that Bohman.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.834
I mean, you know we're not
really brothers.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:34.801
You're wrong.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.971
Just because we're both AI...

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.307
doesn't mean that
we aren't brothers.

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:42.743
That's exactly what it means,
Bohman.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:44.311
Accept it.

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:46.647
From the very start,
everything we did,

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:49.249
we did just cuz
we were programmed to do it!

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:50.817
And you only have
a bond with me

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.019
because you were so helpless
at the beginning

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.922
and needed me to look after you!

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.156
And let me tell ya,

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:58.191
it got annoying!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.361
Can I help you
with something, Bohman?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.265
No, I just enjoy being
in your company, Harlin.

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:06.033
I hope you don't mind.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:08.335
As a matter of fact, I do!

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:09.736
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.640
Would you like me to follow you
from even farther back?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.507
How 'bout

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.676
just don't follow me at all!

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.178
But we're brothers, Harlin,

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:19.646
and brothers are supposed
to be together.

00:06:19.646 --> 00:06:22.082
(sighs)
Just gimme some space!

00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:23.517
Harlin!

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.485
And I'm thinking right now...

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.320
I need more space.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.722
Please, Harlin!

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.256
Don't go.

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:30.056
This is a mistake

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.392
that will cost you everything!

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.194
You're wrong!

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:37.330
I may not have all the
fancy upgrades that you have.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.265
But these old parts of mine...

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.701
still have plenty
of life in 'em.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:45.539
Harlin.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:49.376
(Harlin)
Brothers?
(scoffs)

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:49.876
Lightning created Bohman

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.246
to replace me.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:55.015
But I'll show 'em
that I'm irreplaceable!

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.651
Bitboot, you're booted!

00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:58.719
(grunts)

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:59.719
(groaning)

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:01.322
(timer beeping)

00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:03.957
(sighs)
And that's the last of 'em,
Aqua.

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.093
But someone new is approaching.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:06.760
(gasps)

00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:10.497
It's the end of
the line for you!

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:11.832
Let's duel!

00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:13.133
Who's that?

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.868
According to Playmaker's intel,

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.604
that's Bohman's brother Harlin.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.940
Bohman has a brother?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.275
A brother that's
taking you down!

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.744
If I defeat him,
I may be able to learn

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.782
where Bohman and Lightning
are hiding out.

00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.283
Are you ready, Aqua?

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:30.284
Yes!

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.552
(both)
Let's duel!

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:36.823
I'm going first!

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.759
First off...

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.795
I summon HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER!

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.297
(computer chirping)

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.000
And I'll use it
to generate my circuit!

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.639
I Link Summon!

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.108
Link 1 COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:55.609
(computer chirping)

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:56.710
He summoned a HYDRADRIVE.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.811
Looks like h

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.513
e's using
the same deck as Bohman.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.815
Uh, excuse me!

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.484
You mean Bohman uses
the same type of deck as me!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.688
I'm the one who taught Bohman
how to duel!

00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:09.055
Seriously?

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.858
Yeah, so anything that he does

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:12.693
I can do even better!

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:16.529
I use HYDRADRIVE REBUILD
to destroy my monster!

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.631
And by doing so,

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:18.131
its special ability activates

00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:20.201
and summons

00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.470
a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN!

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.004
(computer chirping)

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.873
Then HYDRADRIVE REBUILD's

00:08:25.873 --> 00:08:27.608
second effect activates,

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:28.108
allowing me to resummon

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.177
a HYDRADRIVE

00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:31.812
from my graveyard!

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:34.815
Return to the field,
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:36.050
(computer chirping)

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.552
Next, I activate a spell
Bohman never had,

00:08:38.552 --> 00:08:40.520
HYDRADRIVE UTILIZATION!

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.522
For 500 life points.
(timer beeping)

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.658
I can banish HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:45.859
from my graveyard

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:49.162
to draw out a second copy
from my deck.

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.833
Then I'll use my Skill...

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.669
Marker's Portal!

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.839
It lets me play
a Link Spell from my deck!

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.441
And I know you won't like it!

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:02.776
Say "hey" to The Link Spell

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.878
JUDGEMENT ARROWS!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:07.014
No! Not that card!

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.249
I'll follow that up...

00:09:09.249 --> 00:09:11.184
by summoning
the HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:12.386
(computer chirping)
I just drew

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.789
and use it to generate
my circuit again!

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.090
I Link Summon

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.127
a second COOLANT
HYDRADRIVE! (computer chirping)

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.028
Then I'll use
my HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.931
to Link Summon for a third time!

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.269
Link 1 FLOW HYDRADRIVE!
(roaring)

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:30.337
(computer chirping)

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.906
And I'm still not done
Link Summoning!

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.240
The summoning conditions

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.510
are two HYDRADRIVE
Link Monsters!

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.079
I Link Summon!

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.247
Link 2

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:43.250
TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!
(computer chirping)

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.384
My KNIGHT

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:46.086
gains the Attributes
of the two monsters

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.387
used to summon it.

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:48.455
Water...

00:09:48.455 --> 00:09:49.623
and Wind!

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:51.425
And any other monster
on the field

00:09:51.425 --> 00:09:52.960
that share those Attributes

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.130
has their special
abilities negated!

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.432
Lastly, I place
one card facedown.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.934
And end my turn.

00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:06.106
That's the same strategy
Bohman used against Playmaker.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:06.874
Not exactly.

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:07.741
While Bohman did summon

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.210
that KNIGHT on his first turn,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.413
Harlin has the KNIGHT
and COOLANT HYDRADRIVE in play.

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.182
He's playing better than Bohman!

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:15.916
Well...

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:18.085
isn't that perfect?

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:19.119
Here goes!

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.087
I draw!

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:23.290
I summon MARINCESS SEA HORSE!

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:25.593
(computer chirping)

00:10:25.593 --> 00:10:26.860
Guess what, Harlin,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.863
you're not the only one
who can Link Summon!

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:31.766
Link 1

00:10:31.766 --> 00:10:34.468
MARINCESS BLUE SLUG!

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:35.503
(computer chirping)

00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:36.737
MARINCESS?

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:39.006
What happened
to your TRICKSTARS?

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.375
If you think changing decks
is gonna help you,

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:42.376
it's not.

00:10:42.376 --> 00:10:45.712
Cuz My KNIGHT negates
Water monsters.

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.047
Not saying that doesn't hurt,

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.249
but that's not enough
to put a stop to our game!

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.185
By activating
the special ability

00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.521
of a second MARINCESS
SEA HORSE in my hand,

00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:54.754
(computer chirping)

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.258
I can summon her
next to my BLUE SLUG's link!

00:10:57.258 --> 00:10:58.392
And with these two,

00:10:58.392 --> 00:10:59.960
I'll build the circuit...

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.864
that turns dreams into reality!

00:11:03.864 --> 00:11:04.999
The summoning conditions

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.801
require two Water Attribute
monsters,

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.504
so I set MARINCESS BLUE SLUG
and SEA HORSE

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:12.172
in the Link Arrows!

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.341
I Link Summon!

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:14.975
Link 2

00:11:14.975 --> 00:11:15.642
MARINCESS CORAL ANEMONE!

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:18.144
(screaming)

00:11:18.813 --> 00:11:20.815
(computer chirping)

00:11:20.815 --> 00:11:23.250
Then I place one card
facedown and activate

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.584
MARINCESS SEA STAR's

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:26.820
special ability from my hand!

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.923
By discarding this card,

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:30.157
CORAL ANEMONE gains

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:32.960
an extra 800 attack
points! (timer beeping)

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.094
(sighs)

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:36.330
Her strongest monster
got even stronger!

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.163
Now go!

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.331
My CORAL ANEMONE

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.168
is attacking your
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.303
Hold up!

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:43.838
That attack of yours triggers
the effect of

00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:45.239
my JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:48.442
When this spell is linked
to my Link Monster,

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:50.644
(timer beeping)
it's attack points are doubled!

00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:51.478
So what!

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:52.146
My monster's still

00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:54.114
stronger than yours!

00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:56.650
(blasting)

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.517
(groaning)

00:11:57.517 --> 00:12:00.020
(timer beeping)

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.056
But when COOLANT HYDRADRIVE
is destroyed in battle...

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.092
I can summon a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.393
to take its place!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.762
Is that supposed to impress me?

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:09.529
Blue Maiden,

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:10.231
you're dueling

00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:12.232
exceptionally well today!

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:13.233
Thanks, Aqua.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.669
I bet my brother
would be impressed too

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:16.237
if he was watchin'.

00:12:16.237 --> 00:12:17.137
Hmm.

00:12:17.137 --> 00:12:18.639
Your brother, huh?

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.974
Huh?

00:12:19.974 --> 00:12:21.876
But Akira's not
your real brother now,

00:12:21.876 --> 00:12:24.211
is he, Blue Maiden?

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:24.811
(groans)

00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:25.579
Since you two

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.648
don't share the same DNA,

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:28.983
that would make you both

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.351
complete strangers
now, wouldn't it?

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.487
You're wrong.
Akira and I are family.

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:34.722
And always will be.

00:12:34.722 --> 00:12:35.756
How sweet.

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:37.857
I used to be just like you.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.995
Is my brother going to be okay?

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.196
(Lightning)
Brother?

00:12:43.196 --> 00:12:45.732
Bohman will be fine
when he awakens,

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:46.400
but every time

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.369
he reboots, his code,

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:53.040
his DNA so to speak,
is rewritten.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.142
He becomes a new individual.

00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:57.878
So this Bohman is not the same
as the last Bohman.

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:58.546
That's why he never

00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:00.780
remembers your name

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.149
when he awakens.

00:13:02.149 --> 00:13:04.384
So if he's an entirely
new individual,

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:06.453
would he still be your brother?

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.656
Well, uh, I guess not then?

00:13:08.656 --> 00:13:11.558
No, because he is not.

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:15.128
Harlin, family isn't
about your DNA

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.798
or your code
or your programming.

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:20.801
Ya know Aqua's really
on point here.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.972
What matters is what lies
in your heart, Harlin.

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.974
That's why even
though Akira and I

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.776
aren't related by blood,

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:30.744
we're still family.

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:34.414
And I'll fight in order to
protect the one's that I love...

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:37.951
and defeat any threat
that dares to come in my way!

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:43.557
Ha!

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.792
If you actually think
you're gonna win this duel

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:47.794
just because
you have a family...

00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:48.995
you're wrong!

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.131
I draw!

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:53.500
I'll start by setting
my HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.602
in the Link Arrow
to Link Summon

00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:58.905
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!
(computer chirping)

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:01.375
Next up, I activate
the equip spell

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.044
HYDRADRIVE IMPACT!

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.547
By equipping it
on my COOLANT HYDRADRIVE...

00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.349
it can now deal double
the damage,

00:14:08.349 --> 00:14:10.684
but it's forced
to attack this turn...

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:13.487
which may sound bad cuz your
monster's stronger than mine.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:16.023
But COOLANT's ability
allows it to attack

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:18.058
your life points directly!

00:14:18.058 --> 00:14:20.460
If this attack hits,
I'm done for!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.728
Got that right!

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:24.665
Because dueling has nothing
to do with family.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:27.400
It's about who can play
the better game.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.770
So then, bye, bye, Blue Maiden.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.472
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:14:31.472 --> 00:14:34.040
Go and end this duel!

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.276
Oh, no, you're not
ending anything.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:40.146
I play MARINCESS WAVE!

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.850
This trap will negate your
monster's special abilities!

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.851
(sighs)
No way!

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:46.353
This means your
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE

00:14:46.353 --> 00:14:49.189
isn't able to attack me
directly anymore.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.692
But since your monster
is still required to attack,

00:14:51.692 --> 00:14:54.528
it has to attack
my monster instead!

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:55.663
Fine!

00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:57.231
Then I'll have my
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE

00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.333
attack your CORAL ANEMONE!

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.035
And JUDGMENT ARROWS's effect

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:04.237
doubles COOLANT HYDRADRIVE's
attack points during battle!

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:04.871
(timer beeping)

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:05.706
Twice as strong is

00:15:05.706 --> 00:15:07.574
still not strong enough

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.745
so your monster's taking
a quick trip to the graveyard.

00:15:10.745 --> 00:15:11.778
(computer chirping)

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:14.047
Along with 800 of
your life points!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.085
(blasting)

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:20.086
(timer beeping)
(groaning)

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.188
But like before,

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:23.056
when COOLANT
HYDRADRIVE's destroyed,

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:25.926
I can summon a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN!

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:28.395
(computer chirping)

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.063
Your guppy may've been stronger

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:31.532
than my COOLANT HYDRADRIVE,

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:32.867
but it's not stronger than

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:34.902
my TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:36.336
Not when JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:15:36.336 --> 00:15:38.872
doubles its attack points!
(timer beeping)

00:15:39.372 --> 00:15:40.240
(growls)

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.943
(groaning)
(timer beeping)

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:46.013
But, when my
CORAL ANEMONE's destroyed...

00:15:46.013 --> 00:15:48.716
I'm then allowed to retrieve
one MARINCESS card

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.717
back from my graveyard.

00:15:50.717 --> 00:15:53.287
And this trap'll come in handy!

00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:56.256
It's MARINCESS WAVE!

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:58.025
But that card is useless...

00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:00.027
(timer beeping)
if you never get to play it.

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:02.963
Unlike my trap
HYDRADRIVE NIGHTMARE!

00:16:02.963 --> 00:16:06.133
By tributing my
HYDRADRIVE TOKEN...

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:09.470
I can resummon
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.737
(computer chirping)

00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:12.106
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE

00:16:12.106 --> 00:16:15.175
will automatically be destroyed
at the end of my turn.

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:16.911
But that's still leaves me
plenty of time

00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:18.746
to deal you damage!

00:16:18.746 --> 00:16:21.748
Double the damage,
thanks to JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.250
(timer beeping)

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.753
(roaring)

00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:26.586
(groaning)

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:27.254
(Harlin)

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:27.988
How ya like that!

00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:29.823
(timer beeping)
(grunts)

00:16:29.823 --> 00:16:30.690
Ya know what?

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.926
I liked it just fine actually.

00:16:32.926 --> 00:16:34.628
You did?

00:16:34.628 --> 00:16:36.763
Yes, because by taking damage,

00:16:36.763 --> 00:16:39.499
Blue Maiden is able
to use her new Skill.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.600
Not my new Skill.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.436
Our new Skill.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.972
Cuz we created it together!

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:47.274
(screaming)

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.343
Shape of Sea!

00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:50.644
When I take battle damage,

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:52.813
I can summon
a Water Attribute monster

00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:55.482
from my graveyard with
equal or fewer attack points

00:16:55.482 --> 00:16:57.518
than the amount
of damage I took!

00:16:57.518 --> 00:17:01.187
Resurface, MARINCESS
CORAL ANEMONE!

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.657
(computer chirping)

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:04.525
(groans)

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.427
I'm gonna end my turn now.

00:17:06.427 --> 00:17:09.696
Which means COOLANT HYDRADRIVE
is destroyed.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:10.998
But it also means I get

00:17:10.998 --> 00:17:12.999
to summon a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN!
(computer chirping)

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:14.902
Do you see now, Harlin?

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.570
Family can change
the course of a duel.

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.907
Because without Aqua,
I wouldn't have this new Skill!

00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:22.543
So you're calling Aqua
family now?

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.311
What a complete joke.

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:25.879
Family also makes us stronger

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.682
because it gives us
something to fight for!

00:17:28.682 --> 00:17:30.984
Gives you something
to fight for?

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:33.387
(gasps)

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:34.888
Is that why
I'm fighting for Bohman?

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.089
Cuz he really is family?

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:36.690
All right, i

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.558
t's my turn!

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:39.059
I draw!

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.895
I summon MARINCESS SEA HORSE!

00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:41.928
(computer chirping)

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:43.430
And with her,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.931
I can now go and build

00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:46.032
my circuit!

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:48.201
I set MARINCESS CORAL ANEMONE

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.204
and MARINCESS SEA HORSE
in the Link Arrows!

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.574
I Link Summon!

00:17:53.574 --> 00:17:54.675
Link 3

00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:56.710
MARINCESS MARBLED ROCK!

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:57.712
(screaming)

00:17:57.712 --> 00:17:58.745
(computer chirping)

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:03.450
(Blue Maiden)
I Link Summon!

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.118
Link 3

00:18:04.118 --> 00:18:06.286
MARINCESS MARBLED ROCK!

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:06.753
(screaming)

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.788
(computer chirping)

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:09.723
And since I used
my CORAL ANEMONE

00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:10.791
to summon her,

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:12.659
her special ability
lets me regain

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:16.397
MARINCESS SEA STAR
from my graveyard!

00:18:16.397 --> 00:18:18.431
Next, I activate
MARINCESS WAVE

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.133
from my hand!

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.369
I'm allowed to play
this trap card from my hand

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.738
when I have a Link 3
or higher MARINCESS

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.073
on my field!

00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:27.440
And I'll use it to negate

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.211
your TWIN HYDRADRIVE
KNIGHT's special abilities!

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.246
(grunting)

00:18:33.246 --> 00:18:34.315
Now my MARINCESSES

00:18:34.315 --> 00:18:37.117
can start using
their abilities again!

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:40.221
And my MARINCESS WAVE
has another effect!

00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:41.488
It prevents you from using

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:44.124
any spells, traps
or special abilities

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.927
against my MARBLED ROCK!

00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:47.895
That doesn't matter,

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.330
my TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.132
will have 3600 attack
points during battle...

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.768
making it stronger
than your monster.

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:55.936
That's true.

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:57.704
But I can change that
by sending my SEA STAR

00:18:57.704 --> 00:18:59.106
to the graveyard

00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:01.675
to raise MARBLED ROCK's
attack points by 800.

00:19:01.675 --> 00:19:04.845
(screaming)
(timer beeping)

00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:07.380
Then I activate MARBLED
ROCK's special ability!

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.818
I get to retrieve a MARINCESS
from my graveyard.

00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:13.186
So my SEA STAR's
back in my hand!

00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.222
And by discarding
SEA STAR again,

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.791
MARBLED ROCK gains 800
more attack points!

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:18.959
(timer beeping)

00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:22.729
Oh, no, 4100 attack points?

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:23.964
That's right!

00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:25.699
And she's going to use them all
to take down

00:19:25.699 --> 00:19:27.767
your TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:29.603
But JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:31.137
will lower the damage
that I take!

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:32.772
(timer beeping)

00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:35.142
Go MARBLED ROCK!

00:19:35.142 --> 00:19:36.043
Attack!

00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:38.612
(screaming)

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:42.849
(groaning)

00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:45.518
(timer beeping)

00:19:46.554 --> 00:19:47.521
So sorry!

00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:49.356
But I still have life points!

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.691
(Blue Maiden)
Yes you do, but not for long!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.994
(groans)
Oh no, now what?!

00:19:53.994 --> 00:19:55.229
I'm glad you asked.

00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:56.730
I activate my trap card

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.199
MARINCESS CURRENT!

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.001
When a Link 3
or higher MARINCESS

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.837
destroys your monster in battle,

00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:04.938
then I'm allowed
to activate this card

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:07.974
directly from my hand!

00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:10.377
For every link
that MARBLED ROCK has,

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.379
you take 400 points of damage.

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:15.282
So since MARBLED ROCK
is a Link 3 monster,

00:20:15.282 --> 00:20:17.785
that adds up to 1200 points!

00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.819
But that's not all!

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:21.021
You also take 500 points
of damage

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:23.524
for every Link
that your KNIGHT had!

00:20:23.524 --> 00:20:24.792
Put it all together

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:27.727
and that's a total
of 2200 points of damage.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:28.962
And guess what,

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:30.631
that total is more than
the amount of life points

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.166
you have remaining, Harlin!

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:33.166
Oh, no!

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:35.835
(electric buzzing)

00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:42.609
(screaming)

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.547
Hi, Bohman.

00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:47.514
My name is--

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:48.115
Harlin.

00:20:48.115 --> 00:20:48.982
(gasps)

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.786
You-- You remember?

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:53.487
Why are you crying?

00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:54.555
(crying)

00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:55.989
Crying?

00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:56.856
I dunno.

00:21:00.894 --> 00:21:02.295
Lightning may be smart,

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:04.597
but he doesn't know
what's in our hearts.

00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.201
As long as the sun
rises in the east

00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:09.569
and sets in the west,

00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:12.439
I will always be your brother.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:15.575
And you will always be mine.

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:17.078
Isn't that funny?

00:21:17.078 --> 00:21:18.879
Bohman said that
family's about heart,

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:20.681
just like Blue Maiden.

00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:24.885
Maybe us AI and humans
aren't so different after all.

00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:26.854
We both fight for those we love,

00:21:26.854 --> 00:21:29.189
even if it means
risking everything.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.524
Bye, Bohman.

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:33.760
You were the best brother
anyone could ever have.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.928
(timer beeping)

00:21:41.601 --> 00:21:44.938
I can't sense Harlin anymore.

00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:45.539
(growls)

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:47.607
Harlin!

00:21:47.607 --> 00:21:50.844
My brother sacrificed himself...

00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:53.914
to give me the time
I needed to heal.

00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:57.617
And now that I have healed
completely...

00:21:57.617 --> 00:22:00.754
I promise revenge will be mine.

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:31.318
(electronic whirring)
