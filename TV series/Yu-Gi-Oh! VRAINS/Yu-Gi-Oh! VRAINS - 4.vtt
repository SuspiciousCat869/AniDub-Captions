00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:33.834
attack points by 800,
more than enough to wipe out

00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:35.802
all your life points!

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:38.505
And that completes my comeback!

00:20:38.538 --> 00:20:41.275
Great Ogre, hit 'em
with your finisher!

00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:43.176
(Gore cackling)
