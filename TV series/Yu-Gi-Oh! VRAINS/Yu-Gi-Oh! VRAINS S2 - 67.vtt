WEBVTT

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.904
(Ai)
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.975
(Kolter)
The Earth Ignis says
he wants to meet Playmaker.

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:09.510
On a message forum.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.578
(Yusaku)
I know that it could be
a trap Kolter.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.180
But it's our only lead.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.183
(Ai)
You wouldn't phone
if it wasn't important.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.484
So what do you want?

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.952
To challenge you...

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.988
to a duel Playmaker.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.290
Because I want to see...

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.993
what humans are truly like.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:28.695
(Both)
Let's duel!

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.034
(Earth)
Why...

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.269
do you side
with the humans?

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.140
Ah! Can't it wait until
after the duel?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.677
You do realize that humans...

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:44.678
destroyed the Cyberse.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.079
But without 'em,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.248
we'd never have been
created in the first place.

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:50.651
Link 2...

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:53.987
G GOLEM CRYSTAL HEART!

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:54.988
(computer chirping)

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.623
Bring life...

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.626
to this wasteland.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.597
(Ai)
That looks like Aqua's monster.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.665
So why does Earth have it?

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.268
Aqua...

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.669
I do not trust these humans.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.005
But I will keep...

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.573
my mind open.

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.743
As I promised you...

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:16.810
I would.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.223
(electronic whirring)

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:24.978
Hi.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:25.645
Hey.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.981
You wanted to see me?

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.150
Yeah, I did.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:31.551
Alone?

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:32.552
(Aqua)
Uh, huh.

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:34.988
Why?

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.624
Because there's something
I want to tell you.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:39.093
And only you.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:39.826
Duh?

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.929
Are you going to say
what I think you are?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.632
The Cyberse is splitting in two.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.067
Oh.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:48.969
You weren't.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.803
What?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.105
N-Nothing.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.975
There are those who believe that
we can coexist with the humans.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.377
And there are others who don't.

00:02:58.446 --> 00:02:59.647
Yes.

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:02.015
And I don't know if we can
remain neutral.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.550
The time is coming

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.652
when we must decide
which side to join,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.888
the humans or the Ignis.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:10.023
And that time is soon.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:13.059
Which side will you join?

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:14.695
Why do you ask?

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:16.397
Because I'll join...

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:18.899
the side you choose.

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.167
Then I can't tell you.

00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:21.735
Such an important decision

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.537
is one you have to make
on your own.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.039
And I'm sure
you'll make the right one.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.377
Here,
this should help you decide.

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:32.879
Oh!

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.383
This is your...

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.351
CRYSTAL HEART.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:43.023
Go to their world and see
what the humans are really like

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.624
before you make your decision.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.861
Because what you choose
won't only affect you,

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.363
but the future of us all.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.434
But don't be gone too long
because I'll miss you.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.336
(computer chirping)

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.106
Aqua...

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.042
I activate...

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.444
CRYSTAL HEART's ability...

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.247
to resurrect an Earth...

00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.116
Link Monster

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.218
from my graveyard...

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.053
and co-link it with...

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.188
my CRYSTAL HEART.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.757
Elevate G GOLEM...

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.026
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.062
(roars)
(computer chirping)

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.565
By bringing this monster back,

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:27.500
CRYSTAL HEART gains one...

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.169
G Golem Counter.

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:31.705
And for every Counter,

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:33.106
CRYSTAL HEART...

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.010
gives 600 attack points...

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.213
to all Earth monsters
it's linked to.

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:40.614
(timer beeping)

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.515
Time to battle!

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.085
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.688
Attack ZOMBIE...

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:48.788
PROSABER!

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:53.561
(blasting)

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:54.794
(timer beeping)

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:55.729
(grunts)

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.297
I end my turn.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:04:59.366
C'mon Playmaker!

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:01.669
You already lost over
half your life points!

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.069
Yes, I know.

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:04.437
Draw!

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:07.107
I'll start by summoning
CLOCK WYVERN!

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.579
(roaring)

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:12.679
(computer chirping)

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.848
And by cutting its
attack points in half...

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.852
CLOCK WYVERN summons
a CLOCK TOKEN in defense mode.
(timer beeping)

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:20.921
(electronic whirring)

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.925
And that's exactly what I need

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:26.493
to create my circuit

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.365
The summoning condition requires
one Level 1 monster,

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:34.168
so I set my CLOCK TOKEN
in the Link Arrow!

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.435
(shooting)

00:05:35.736 --> 00:05:36.603
I Link Summon...

00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:39.139
Link 1 LINKURIBOH!

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.340
(indistinct language)

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:43.510
Next, I activate
the spell card LINK BACK!

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.680
This card allows me
to move LINKURIBOH

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.650
from the Extra Monster Zone
to the Main Monster Zone

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.684
that it points to.

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.853
But then,
I have to send one card

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.623
from the top of my deck,
directly to the graveyard.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.027
And next,

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:02.529
I'm going to activate
the spell card CYNET FUSION

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.597
from my hand.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:06.600
Usually I'm only allowed
to Fusion Summon...

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.069
using monsters that are
in my hand or on the field.

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:12.739
But when I have no monsters
in my Extra Monster Zone...

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.575
I can banish
a Cyberse Link Monster

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:16.710
from my graveyard

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.712
and use it
to Fusion Summon as well!

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.047
I fuse LINKURIBOH...

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.215
and CLOCK WYVERN

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.018
with ZOMBIE PROSABER
in my graveyard!

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:26.086
(electronic whirring)

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.190
I Fusion Summon!

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:31.859
Rise up!

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.827
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:34.895
(blasting)

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.266
(growling)

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:41.801
(computer chirping)

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:46.040
(Playmaker)
I Fusion Summon!

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:47.207
Rise up!

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.242
(growling)
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:51.178
(computer chirping)

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:53.413
You can Fusion Summon?

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.883
Sure can!

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:58.519
Don't mean to brag
but boss move, right?

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:00.488
(Playmaker)
If I use Link Monsters

00:07:00.488 --> 00:07:02.889
to Fusion Summon
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.792
I can send a card
from the top of my deck

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.562
to the graveyard
for each of their Link Arrows.

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.931
And my DRAGON gains
1000 attack points

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:11.998
for each card.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.801
So by sending two cards
to the graveyard...

00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:19.773
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON
gains 2000 attack points!

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:20.741
(timer beeping)
(growling)

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.809
Forty five hundred...

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:24.711
Time to battle!

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:26.646
Alright, CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.149
attack CRYSTAL HEART
and end this duel!

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:33.053
Looks like
you're gettin KO'ed, Earth.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.622
If you got anything to say,
say it now!

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:37.791
It... now.

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.725
(clangs)
Sorry!

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:40.995
DOLMEN's ability...

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:42.462
activates.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.966
Your monster can only attack...

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.567
my DOLMEN.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:48.469
Say what?

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:49.369
What.

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:50.470
(evil laughter)
(shooting)

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:53.307
(explosion)

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.975
(timer beeping)

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.148
And when DOLMEN is destroyed...

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.117
all your face up cards...

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.853
lose their effects

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:08.055
and special abilities.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:08.722
So...

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:11.458
your CLOCK DRAGON's
attack points...

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.393
(rumbling)
drop back down.

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:15.862
(yowling)

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.298
(timer beeping)

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:22.469
Well, that didn't go
as I imagined it would.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.171
Obviously... not.

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.007
(grunts)

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:28.542
(Playmaker)
That was an interesting move.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:30.211
It's as if Earth's deck
is designed

00:08:30.211 --> 00:08:31.545
to protect CRYSTAL HEART.

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:33.547
Hmm... you're right.

00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.350
Why would Earth sacrifice
his own monster for Aqua's?

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.988
Ah! It all makes sense!

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:41.888
What makes sense?

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.658
There was this one time
back in the Cyberse

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:46.393
when I had to risk my life.

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:47.328
(Playmaker)
Really.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:48.696
(Ai)
Yes, really!

00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:51.665
I was testing
how to fish... without a pole!

00:08:51.665 --> 00:08:54.034
There! I see a CITADEL WHALE!

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.202
Dive, Linky!
Wo-hoo!

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:59.106
I'm catching me a big one!

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:01.274
(Aqua)
Wait, no you're not!

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.744
There are no fish in this river!

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:05.712
Huh? You're right.
The whale's a rock.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:06.446
(splash)

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.185
(Ai)
Don't worry, Linky.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:14.120
The stream will carry us
to safety.

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:16.456
Oh, no!

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.458
(screaming)

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.627
Wo-hoo!

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:23.863
Ah! Wo-hoo! Ah!

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.266
Phew. That was close.

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:28.601
(Aqua)
You have to be more careful.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.438
You're making me
worried about you.

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.508
Aww, you're worried about me?

00:09:34.508 --> 00:09:37.844
(Aqua)
Of course.
There's only six of us Ignis.

00:09:37.844 --> 00:09:40.014
Losing anyone
would break my heart.

00:09:40.114 --> 00:09:41.448
(grunts)

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.683
(singing)

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:47.454
Don't break her heart!

00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:48.455
Huh?

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.124
Don't break her heart!

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:54.294
And I assume you didn't
follow his advice?

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:56.964
Of course not,
but you're missing the point.

00:09:56.964 --> 00:09:59.800
He doesn't want Aqua's heart
to be broken.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:01.702
So he'll do everything it takes

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:04.438
to protect Aqua's CRYSTAL HEART
from destruction.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:05.439
Yeah.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.275
But if we don't destroy it,
I don't know if we can beat him.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:10.277
It's my turn!

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:18.118
(Earth)
I won't let you destroy...

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:20.955
Aqua's CRYSTAL HEART.

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:24.792
Its special ability
resummons...

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.860
an Earth Link Monster...

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:28.962
from my graveyard...

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.130
next to its link.

00:10:30.865 --> 00:10:31.531
Ascend...

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.099
G GOLEM...

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.101
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:39.840
(computer chirping)

00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:41.741
(Earth)
By summoning...

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.010
this monster...

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.711
CRYSTAL HEART gains...

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.747
another G Golem Counter.

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.883
And it gives...

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.119
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.354
600 attack points...

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.356
for each of its Counters.

00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:57.390
(timer beeping)

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:01.127
4K attack points? That's hi-def!

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.998
Yes... It is!

00:11:04.432 --> 00:11:06.033
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:08.668
Attack his CYBERSE...

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:10.003
CLOCK DRAGON!

00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:11.238
(blast)

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:13.573
(timer beeping)

00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:16.476
Phew, we're still alive.

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:18.078
Barely, but still.

00:11:18.278 --> 00:11:19.679
How lucky...

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.448
But your luck...

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:22.983
won't last.

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.818
Earth's right, you know.

00:11:24.818 --> 00:11:26.520
You really gotta
step your game up.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.321
I hate to be that guy

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.923
that tells people
what to do, but--

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:31.625
(Playmaker)
Then don't be that guy.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.494
I will be that guy!

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:35.362
And this guy says just win!

00:11:35.529 --> 00:11:37.864
They do not seem...

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.766
to be getting along.

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:42.769
Why would they team up?

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.839
I must be missing something.

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:48.675
Let me put them...

00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:50.510
to the test.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:54.514
When CRYSTAL HEART
has at least...

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:56.150
two counters...

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.818
my INVALID DOLMEN...

00:11:58.252 --> 00:12:00.554
can attack twice.

00:12:00.854 --> 00:12:02.656
Whaaaat? Attack again?

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:05.025
When I booted up this morning,

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.094
losing a duel wasn't
in my schedule!

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.362
That's... too bad.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.764
Go...

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:12.432
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:14.901
Attack Playmaker directly!

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.471
I don't think so.

00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.072
I activate SPOOL CODE!

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.042
When I have at least
three Cyberse monsters

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:23.343
in my graveyard...

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:25.879
this spell card negates
your direct attack

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.649
so that my life points
will remain safe and sound.

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.350
(rumbling)

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:34.588
Then I'm allowed to summon
up to three SPOOL TOKENS

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.223
on my field in defense mode!

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:37.357
(electronic whirring)

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:42.863
Impressive, Playmaker.

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:45.432
Not only did you survive...

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:49.403
but you improved
your defenses as well.

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:52.673
But that puzzles me
even more.

00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:54.574
I thought you two...

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:56.810
teamed up so you could...

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.547
share your dueling knowledge.

00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:02.549
But it is clear...

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.784
that Playmaker is doing

00:13:05.586 --> 00:13:07.321
all the dueling...

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:11.224
while Ai is just being Ai.

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:12.993
Hey!

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:15.629
What's that supposed to mean!

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:16.997
(Earth)
You know...

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.832
what that means.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.101
I do know what that means!

00:13:21.969 --> 00:13:24.304
Is that something
to actually be proud about?

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:25.940
No.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.074
Maybe yes?

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.944
Earth, there are three reasons
why I've teamed up with Ai.

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.814
One: Though he is rarely
helpful in a duel--

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.981
(Ai)
Hey!

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.650
He is helpful in
gathering information.

00:13:37.718 --> 00:13:41.054
Two: if the one who hurt Jin
is also involved

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:42.823
with the destruction
of the Cyberse,

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:45.058
then we both have
a mutual enemy.

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.161
And three: Because we chose to,

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.964
and that is more than
reason enough.

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:53.166
I will not abandon those
who did not abandon me.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:56.604
And that's all there is to it.

00:13:57.238 --> 00:13:59.806
Aww, you're gonna make me cry!

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.209
You with your emotions, you!

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.478
But those reasons...

00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.046
won't help you win.

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:07.714
Are you sure?

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:09.182
Draw!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.151
He only has...

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.886
100 life points.

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:16.156
Why is he still confident?

00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:20.193
I'll start my turn
by creating my circuit!

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:25.065
The summoning conditions
are two Cyberse monsters.

00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:28.435
So I set two of my SPOOL TOKENS
in the Link Arrows!

00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:30.370
(shooting)

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.706
I Link Summon!

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.875
Link 2 CLOCK LIZARD!
(roaring)

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.043
(computer chirping)

00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:37.777
But I am not done there!

00:14:37.777 --> 00:14:39.646
I'm going to Link Summon again!

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:42.283
The summoning condition requires

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:45.719
one Level 4
or lower Cyberse monster!

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:46.519
(shooting)

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:48.989
I now Link Summon!

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:50.658
(electronic whirring)

00:14:50.658 --> 00:14:53.661
Link 1 LINK DEVOTEE!

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:54.695
(computer chirping)

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.031
Then I'll activate this...

00:14:57.031 --> 00:14:58.465
my spell LINK DRIVE!

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.967
By tributing
one of my Link Monsters...

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.005
You'll take 500 points of damage

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:07.174
for every one of its
Link Arrows!

00:15:07.174 --> 00:15:08.041
(electronic whirring)

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.511
(blasting)

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.745
(timer beeping)

00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:13.113
And next up...

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:15.783
Since I tributed LINK DEVOTEE

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:17.951
while it was co-linked
with another monster,

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:18.886
(electronic chirping)

00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:20.887
I can summon two LINK TOKENS

00:15:20.887 --> 00:15:22.088
in defense mode!

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:23.590
And with them...

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.026
I can Link Summon
for a third time!

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.963
Earth, time to hike up
your big boy pants!

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.798
What pants?

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.768
The summoning conditions
require two monsters.

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:38.171
So I set my two LINK TOKENS
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:39.739
(shooting)

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:41.908
I Link Summon!

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.778
Link 2 SECURITY DRAGON!

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:49.950
(computer chirping)

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.886
SECURITY DRAGON's
special ability

00:15:52.886 --> 00:15:55.255
allows me to return
one of your monsters

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:56.289
back to your hand,

00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:59.359
so your G GOLEM INVALID DOLMEN

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:00.694
leaves the field!

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.996
I think not.

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:05.765
When INVALID DOLMEN...

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.767
is co-linked

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.903
your monsters' special abilities

00:16:10.304 --> 00:16:11.404
can't affect it.

00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:15.676
Was that it?

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:18.345
If that was your very best...

00:16:18.846 --> 00:16:22.415
this duel is as good as over.

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:30.824
If that was your very best...

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.927
this duel is as good as over.

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:35.529
Wait. Did you sass us?

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:37.030
Because I think you sassed us.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.433
And no one gets away
with sassing us!

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.768
(Playmaker)
By tributing CLOCK LIZARD
from my field...

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.073
I can return a Fusion Monster
that's in my graveyard...

00:16:46.073 --> 00:16:47.674
back to my Extra Deck!

00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:51.111
Specifically,
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.181
And I can Fusion Summon
this DRAGON

00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.083
by banishing
the required monsters

00:16:56.083 --> 00:16:57.518
from my graveyard!

00:16:57.518 --> 00:16:59.152
So here I go, Earth!

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:02.255
Oh! Not good.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.558
I banish CLOCK WYVERN...

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:06.326
CLOCK LIZARD...

00:17:07.093 --> 00:17:07.994
LINKURIBOH...

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.164
and LINK DEVOTEE
from my graveyard!

00:17:13.066 --> 00:17:14.301
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:16.703
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:25.145
(computer chirping)

00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:27.014
Ooh, yeah!

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:29.583
(Playmaker)
Since I once again
used Link Monsters

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:31.651
to summon my
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:34.054
I can send a card
from my deck to the graveyard

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.223
for every one
of their Link Arrows...

00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.558
and my DRAGON gains
1000 attack points

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.526
for each card.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.496
I send four cards
in my deck to the graveyard

00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:44.565
to gain 4000 attack points!

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:45.765
(timer beeping)

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.635
That's more than
a lot of attack points!

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:51.638
That's we're-winning-this-duel
level of attack points!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.741
It would be...

00:17:53.974 --> 00:17:57.044
If I didn't have the trap...

00:17:57.044 --> 00:17:59.079
GRAVITY FLUCTUATION!

00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:02.983
By destroying my Earth monster,

00:18:02.983 --> 00:18:04.818
you must destroy

00:18:04.818 --> 00:18:07.654
one of your monsters...

00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:10.056
with equal or fewer...

00:18:10.056 --> 00:18:11.291
attack points.

00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:14.494
I destroy G GOLEM...

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.663
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:18.732
Now...

00:18:18.732 --> 00:18:21.067
destroy your monster!

00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:23.403
Very well.

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.706
I destroy my SECURITY DRAGON!

00:18:28.742 --> 00:18:31.378
Since my INVALID DOLMEN...

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:33.480
was destroyed,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.615
its ability activates...

00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:39.286
and lowers your
DRAGON's attack points.

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.754
(timer beeping)

00:18:41.822 --> 00:18:43.490
Aww! Its attack points went

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:46.760
peeeeeeeeewkerplunk.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.329
But it's not all bad.

00:18:48.329 --> 00:18:51.331
CRYSTAL HEART
is now defenseless!

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:53.300
Go!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.801
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:57.137
attack and destroy
his CRYSTAL HEART!

00:18:57.638 --> 00:18:59.773
No... you will not!

00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:02.042
I activate...

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.343
LOVE GRAVITY!

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:06.012
It resurrects INVALID DOLMEN...

00:19:06.546 --> 00:19:08.382
from my graveyard

00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:10.851
and summons it next to...

00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:12.853
CRYSTAL HEART!
(computer chirping)

00:19:12.853 --> 00:19:14.888
You really don't want
Aqua's CRYSTAL HEART

00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.123
to be destroyed, huh?

00:19:16.123 --> 00:19:17.791
(gasps)
Aww!

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:20.460
Do you have
the smoochies for her?

00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:25.065
That's none of your business!

00:19:25.566 --> 00:19:27.234
But this is!

00:19:27.234 --> 00:19:29.837
For each of its counters...

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:33.340
CRYSTAL HEART gives
INVALID DOLMEN...

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.542
600 attack points!

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:37.110
(timer beeping)

00:19:38.446 --> 00:19:41.048
I'll never let anyone

00:19:41.048 --> 00:19:42.716
break Aqua's heart.

00:19:43.384 --> 00:19:46.219
And that includes you!

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:48.388
I see. Then I won't.

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:49.689
Hu?

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.393
Instead, I'll just have to take
a different tactic to win!

00:19:53.727 --> 00:19:55.395
Since I banished CLOCK LIZARD,

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.231
its special ability activates

00:19:57.231 --> 00:19:59.733
and lowers your
INVALID DOLMEN's attack points

00:19:59.733 --> 00:20:02.168
by 400 for every Cyberse monster

00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:03.337
in my graveyard.

00:20:03.337 --> 00:20:04.438
How many was that again?

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:06.873
Six, seven, eight, nine ten.

00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:08.675
Oh, my! That's all my fingers!

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:10.644
Your INVALID DOLMEN loses

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:12.680
4000 of its attack points!

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.047
(timer beeping)

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.650
No!

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.551
Yes!

00:20:17.551 --> 00:20:18.885
So now we can win this duel

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.553
without destroying
CRYSTAL HEART!

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.555
(gasps)

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:23.724
This is the end!

00:20:24.225 --> 00:20:26.160
All right CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.828
finish off G GOLEM
INVALID DOLMEN!

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:31.398
Pulsating Surge!

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.566
(electronic whirring)

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:34.968
(shooting)

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:36.870
(blasting)

00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:38.672
(Earth groans)

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.041
(timer beeping)

00:20:52.453 --> 00:20:55.689
(grunts)
I lost...

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.826
But at least I succeeded...

00:20:59.393 --> 00:21:02.563
in protecting CRYSTAL HEART.

00:21:02.563 --> 00:21:03.797
Well, yeah.

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:06.099
Only cuz Playmaker
didn't want to destroy it

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:08.101
after seeing how attached
you were to it.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.436
Not now, Ai.

00:21:09.436 --> 00:21:12.272
But as you promised us, Earth,
since we won the duel,

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.774
tell us everything
that you know about Bohman.

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:18.511
Oh. That's right. Bohman.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.280
Uh, huh? Uh, huh?

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.215
(Earth)
There's nothing to tell.

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:24.918
(grunts)
What do you mean?

00:21:24.918 --> 00:21:28.054
I never heard his name...

00:21:28.689 --> 00:21:29.623
'till today.

00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:31.959
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.294
Earth, you said that
if we won the duel,

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:36.696
you would tell us everything
you know about Bohman!

00:21:37.097 --> 00:21:37.932
Yes.

00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:39.099
And I'm saying...

00:21:39.467 --> 00:21:41.635
that I know nothing.

00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:45.105
(Ai)
Ah! Then why didn't you say that
before we dueled?

00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:46.107
Because...

00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:48.876
I'm socially awkward.

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:50.611
This guy... Am I right?

00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:53.046
I've learned much from you...

00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:53.847
today.

00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:55.682
Thank you.

00:21:55.949 --> 00:21:57.617
And goodbye.

00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:00.120
(screaming)

00:22:02.122 --> 00:22:03.023
(Ai)
Whoa!

00:22:05.258 --> 00:22:07.127
It's like we didn't go anywhere.

00:22:07.461 --> 00:22:09.130
We didn't learn anything!

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.498
About anyone! Or anyplace!

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:13.166
I can't take it anymore.

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:16.136
It was a wild goose
chase with no goose!

00:22:16.337 --> 00:22:18.939
Earth said the Cyberse
was splitting in two...

00:22:19.807 --> 00:22:21.474
Why does that make me worry?

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.681
Aqua, humans are interesting.

00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.683
But which side...

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.319
should I join?
