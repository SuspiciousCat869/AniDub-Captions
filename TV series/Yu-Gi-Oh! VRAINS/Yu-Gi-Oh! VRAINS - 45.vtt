WEBVTT

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:03.937
(Ai)
Previously on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.113
I Link Summon...
Link 4 Borreload Dragon!

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.751
Next Borreload
attacks Transcode Talker!

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.122
It lets me gain control
of the monster that it attacks

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:25.191
meaning your Transcode Talker
is mine!

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.495
Allow me to give you
the pleasure of learning
how it feels

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:32.332
to be attacked by
your own monster!

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.000
(grunting)

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.473
(laughing)

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.743
You're out
of monsters, Playmaker.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.254
♪♪♪

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:51.211
♪♪♪

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.923
So I calculated our odds
of winning this match

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.894
and they're one in a too big of
a number I'm comfortable with.

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.295
That's right!

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:09.896
And before you know it...

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:13.334
You will be on your knees
begging for mercy!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.302
But I will not give you any!

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.638
Make no mistake, Playmaker...

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:20.273
My father's wish
will come to pass!

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.976
I will annihilate that
8-bit menace!

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.211
(grunts)
Hey!

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:26.981
I'm at least 16-bit
on my worst day!

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.816
I activate Miniborrel Dragon's

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.152
special ability
from my graveyard!

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.222
Since I have
Borreload Dragon on my field,

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.324
I can resurrect
Miniborrel Dragon

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.994
by tributing a Link 3 monster.

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:44.231
So I'm exchanging your--
well my-- Transcode Talker

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:48.802
for Miniborrel Dragon!

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:51.538
But with Transcode Talker
no longer in play,

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.309
Topologic Bomber Dragon's attack
points return to 3000.

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:57.477
Next, I activate...

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.913
the trap
Link Turret's effect!

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.816
After battle, I can remove
a Rokket Counter from

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.052
Link Turret to bring
back a Rokket monster

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.187
from my graveyard
in defense mode

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:10.057
as long as I negate
its special abilities.

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.792
And since I have five Counters,

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.462
I can summon
up to five monsters!

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:17.531
He already has three monsters
on his field--

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.400
when is enough enough?

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:21.635
For Varis? Never.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.971
Not really the answer
I was hoping to hear,

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.040
but at least we'll get a
turn before he's able to attack!

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.377
Oh, that's what you
think, do you? Ha!

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.112
Do you actually think
I'll let you

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.346
have another turn?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.349
So, you mean...

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:37.551
You're planning
to win this right now?

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.019
But how?

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.888
He can't
attack anymore this turn.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:42.856
He's just pulling your chain
to see if you'll

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.060
start perspirin' drips,
drabs, and drops.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.797
I remove two Rokket Counters
from Link Turret

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:51.632
to summon Metalrokket Dragon

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.333
and Shelrokket Dragon!

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:04.211
And then my field
spell Boot Sector Launch

00:04:04.278 --> 00:04:08.349
gives both my Rokkets 300
attack and defense points.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.717
Not that it matters...

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:14.454
because I'm going to use those
two to Link Summon!

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.127
That means he's gonna
bring out another Link Monster.

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.796
(Varis)
The summoning
conditions require

00:04:21.896 --> 00:04:24.198
at least three Effect Monsters

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.301
so I set Shelrokket Dragon,
Metalrokket Dragon,

00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:31.571
and Miniborrel Dragon
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:34.775
Link the Circuit!

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.044
A Link 4!

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.678
I Link Summon!

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.681
Link 4 Borrelguard Dragon!

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.026
Eeeek!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.695
That looks like
three thousand tons

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:56.697
of get me out of here!

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.032
Your fluctuations
in courage

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.033
never cease to amaze me.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.770
(Varis)
Borrelguard Dragon
activates its special ability!

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:07.107
By sending one of my spell
or trap cards to the graveyard,

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:08.575
I can summon a monster that was

00:05:08.642 --> 00:05:10.477
destroyed in battle
this turn

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.014
even though it returns without
its special abilities.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.449
I send Mirror Force Launcher

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:19.920
to the graveyard
to summon Powercode Talker!

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:22.189
(maniacal laughter)

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.591
He keeps stealin'
our monsters!

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.827
(Varis)
"Borrow" is more correct,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.365
because I'm tributing it to
resurrect Miniborrel Dragon!

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.435
Now I'll use Link Turret's
effect again!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.004
I remove two more Rokket
Counters to summon

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.239
Magnarokket Dragon
and Shelrokket Dragon!

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:48.748
And I'll use them to
Link Summon for a fourth time!

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.751
The summoning conditions
require three or more

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.853
Effect Monsters!

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:56.323
So I set Magnarokket Dragon,
Shelrokket Dragon,

00:05:56.357 --> 00:05:59.459
and Miniborrel Dragon
in the Link Arrows!

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:05.766
I Link Summon...

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.736
Link 4
Borrelsword Dragon!

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:22.916
(Varis)
I Link Summon...

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:26.253
Link 4
Borrelsword Dragon!

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:29.423
Four Link Monsters?
How OP can you get?

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:32.159
Oh, no! Playmaker's
in more trouble

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:34.695
than a slug slitherin'
in a salt field.

00:06:34.762 --> 00:06:36.763
He's got my blood pressure
throttled so high--

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:39.099
I'm feeling like my heart's
beatin' right
outta my chest!

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.367
Oh, get a grip!

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:42.669
And just keep that
camera rolling, would ya?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.372
Or else you'll be dealing
with one furious frog

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:47.341
who'll really get
your pulse pounding!

00:06:47.408 --> 00:06:49.810
Oh, man,
this is so flash.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.912
C'mon, PM, you can do this.

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.647
I mean, you're only
facing four of the strongest

00:06:53.714 --> 00:06:56.984
dragons ever, but if anyone
can do it, it's you!

00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:57.984
(Varis chuckles)

00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:00.654
Playmaker, I want
to thank you.

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:02.723
You wouldn't be in this
situation if you didn't

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.226
try to counter my Topologic
Bomber Dragon's ability.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:09.496
In other words, you put
yourself in this mess.

00:07:09.563 --> 00:07:13.099
And this is one mess
you won't get out of!

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.070
By sending my
Mirror Force to the graveyard

00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:18.138
Borrelguard Dragon's
ability revives your

00:07:18.238 --> 00:07:20.473
Excode Talker to my side!

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.112
He got rid
of Mirror Force?

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:28.148
But I thought that
was his best card.

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.749
Me too.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:33.220
However, if Varis feels he
doesn't need that card anymore,

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:36.823
he must have something
even stronger...

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.325
Could it be?

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:39.560
Yes.

00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:40.827
Yes, it could.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.629
Here I go!

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.664
I now activate Link Turret!

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:47.501
By removing its final
Rokket Counter,

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:50.637
I summon Anesthrokket Dragon
from my graveyard!

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.643
And I'll use it
to manifest my circuit!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.247
A Fifth Link Summon!

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:01.848
Are we a calendar?

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.150
'Cause our days
are numbered!

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.052
The summoning conditions

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:08.388
require me to use at least
two Effect Monsters!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.859
So I set Anesthrokket Dragon
and Excode Talker

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.894
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:21.201
Link the circuit!

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:22.636
(Playmaker and Ai groan)

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.373
Normally a player
is only allowed to use one

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.610
of the Extra Monster Zones,
however...

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:31.378
there is an exception.

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:35.215
Since I linked my monsters to
the second Extra Monster Zone,

00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:38.285
I'm allowed to summon a monster
there as well to create

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.887
what is known as an Extra Link!

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.129
Here it comes...

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.198
Playmaker...

00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:54.201
prepare to come face to face
with your maker!

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.203
Because this monster...

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:59.673
will make the
introduction!

00:08:59.707 --> 00:09:01.274
I Link Summon!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.342
Link 4

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.277
Topologic Gumblar Dragon!

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:14.721
Behold the Extra Link!

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.626
(Ai yelps)

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.395
Aww, man...

00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.030
This isn't good at all!

00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:25.799
Uh, boss?

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.767
Are you, uh, crying?

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.437
Like, no way!

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.440
No way's right, 'cause I'm just
sweatin' from my eyeballs.

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:35.108
But not because I think
Playmaker's

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.077
gonna lose and we'll
all be destroyed

00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:38.912
or that I'll be out of a job,
and I'm gonna have to cancel

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.081
my Action Figure of the Month
membership.

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.050
Why does Playmaker's
first defeat have to come

00:09:43.117 --> 00:09:45.018
in the most crucial duel ever?

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:46.854
I've never seen him
lose before...

00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.857
and no stinkin' way
am I gonna start now!

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:50.857
Click!

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:52.125
Ignorance is bliss!

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:54.628
When my monsters
are Extra Linked,

00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:56.964
they infuse each other
with renewed strength!

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:59.266
So my Topologic
Gumblar Dragon can now

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:02.403
unleash its ultimate power
upon you!

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:05.172
It not only destroys every
card in your hand,

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:09.043
you also take 3000 points
of damage!

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:12.613
And there's nothing you can do
to stop it because...

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.449
This ability cannot be negated!

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:17.418
I-I-It can't be negated?!?

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:20.287
B-B-But we only have 800
life points left!

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:22.189
I know.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:26.192
Game over.
Battering Blast!

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:36.370
Playmaker!

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:38.205
You are through!

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:39.773
Farewell!

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.508
And good riddance!

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:48.515
Yusaku!

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:51.952
Ya know, Playmaker's never lost
whenever I watched him duel...

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.455
Like, maybe I have a
special psychic power that gives

00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:56.691
Playmaker the victory as long as
I'm watching!

00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:59.793
Yeah, that must be it!

00:10:59.893 --> 00:11:02.763
As long as I watch him duel,
he'll come out on top!

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.931
Or not!

00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:06.633
(Varis chuckling)

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.736
Playmaker is no more.

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:13.007
And along with him goes
all of Link VRAINS.

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:15.009
'Fraid not.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:16.109
(gasps)

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.444
Surprised?

00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.846
I still have 50
life points left.

00:11:19.946 --> 00:11:21.682
This duel isn't over.

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:23.951
No-- How is this possible?!

00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:26.253
Simple.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.823
I had one last trap card
remaining on my field.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.793
By discarding a card from
my hand, Drop Frame Wedge

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.696
cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:40.267
Or by discarding two cards,
I reduce the damage even more

00:11:40.334 --> 00:11:43.236
leaving me with just enough
life points to survive!

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:47.775
But surviving doesn't
mean you're thriving.

00:11:47.842 --> 00:11:50.844
Perhaps, Varis,
but what's truly important

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.680
is that I'm still
in the game.

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:55.483
And I will never let you
destroy Link VRAINS!

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:58.085
Drop Frame Wedge
has a second effect--

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:02.089
for my next two turns,
no monster on the field
can attack!

00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:04.424
And that means your
monsters are frozen out

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:07.027
for the foreseeable future.

00:12:07.094 --> 00:12:08.996
And I'll use this time
to figure out a strategy

00:12:09.063 --> 00:12:10.931
to break through
your defenses.

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:14.101
Time... Time is all you have

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:16.870
and even that
you're running out of.

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:20.473
Do you remember what I told
you all those years ago?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.676
Of course you do.

00:12:22.743 --> 00:12:25.312
I told you how three
simple reasons can get you

00:12:25.379 --> 00:12:26.913
through any hardship.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.684
That all you need are three
simple reasons to survive.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.354
One: If you give now,
there won't be a next time.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:38.526
Two: You can't win
if you don't believe
you can win.

00:12:38.592 --> 00:12:42.028
And three: Just because
it's tough now doesn't
mean it will always be.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.598
But now allow me to give you
three simple reasons

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:46.433
why you will not survive!

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:49.069
One: I hold the advantage

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.571
in life points, monsters,
and cards.

00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:54.408
Two: My desire to win
is greater than yours

00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.143
for while you fight
for revenge,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.480
I fight to save the whole
world from the threat
of the Ignis.

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:03.950
And three: I'm just
a better duelist than you.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:07.488
I now end my turn which means
my Autorokket Dragon's

00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:10.223
special ability
activates from my graveyard

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.160
allowing me to summon
a monster from my deck.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.998
Join me Magnarokket Dragon!

00:13:18.065 --> 00:13:20.334
You really love dragons,
don't you?

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:24.138
(Varis)
And now that Link Turret
has used up all of its counters,

00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:28.943
this card is sent
to the graveyard.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.111
Now!
It's your turn...

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.579
Playmaker!

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:35.916
Not that you can do anything.

00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:37.651
(Playmaker groaning)

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:38.819
Whoa!

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.121
Uh, your stabilizers okay?

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:44.725
I...I'm fine.

00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:48.061
Perfectly fine... (groans)

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.497
Playmaker!

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.999
C'mon...

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:56.303
After all you've gone through,
it can't end like this.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.439
(Ai)
Listen to me,
you gotta get up!

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:00.674
I'd give you a hand,
but ya know,

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.142
three inches tall here...

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:03.711
Fine, I'll try!

00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:06.213
(groans)

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:09.983
How heavy
is your cranium?!

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.018
You okay?

00:14:11.052 --> 00:14:13.987
I said I'm... fine.

00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.355
Well, then show it!

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:17.391
I know you think you're
fighting for yourself,

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:19.559
but you're also
fighting for Blue Angel!

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:20.561
And Gore!

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:22.062
Your friends!

00:14:22.163 --> 00:14:25.499
Blue Angel and Gore...
My friends, eh...

00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:27.434
Yeah, and not just
your friends!

00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:30.003
My friends, too!

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:32.673
My five buddies
back home in the Cyberse!

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.342
See, the Cyberse is great
for us Ignis

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.544
because it was made
by us Ignis.

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:39.313
Six of us to be exact--

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.715
And each one of us
had a unique zing.

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:45.820
Aw, I'm getting the tingles...
And from the Cyberse

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.322
came all these new
and awesome monsters,

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.125
that you've been using
by the way, so you're welcome.

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.159
I mean, it took
a lot of sweat and effort

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:57.131
to create this paradise, and
none worked harder than me.

00:14:57.198 --> 00:15:00.701
Day after day
just grinding away...

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:04.338
The other Ignis would come to
me and say, "You work too hard!

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:06.440
Why don't you take
a break?"

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.208
And I'd say,
"No, sir, or madam,

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:10.443
it's my pleasure to toil
the soil!,"

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.715
and I'd fly away in search
of the next task to complete.

00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.349
Varis says that us Ignis

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:19.753
are a threat to humanity,
but that's cuckoo like a clock.

00:15:19.787 --> 00:15:22.089
Why would we destroy your world
when we have

00:15:22.122 --> 00:15:24.792
a perfectly nice world
of our own to call home?

00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.460
But if Varis wins,

00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.963
there will be no world
to call home,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.635
not for us and
not for you either, Playmaker.

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:37.437
And if there's no place
to call home,

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.339
I guess we're all lost.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.177
Yusaku!

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:45.712
C'mon, pal.
Get up and fight!

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.115
Well, that was my good cop,
time for my bad cop.

00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:50.184
When you talk girls
and say you're in the zone,

00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:52.185
you're right-- the friend zone!

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.286
(chuckles)

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:55.556
Oops!
Too real?

00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:56.623
You know, Ai...

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:58.058
Huh?

00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.227
I still have...

00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:03.497
cards in my deck...

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.599
...that I haven't
played yet.

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.402
(groans)

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.938
(Ai)
You got that right!

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:14.308
Yeah!
I knew you had it in ya, bud!

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:15.676
My, oh, my.

00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:17.744
It certainly appears to me
like you still have some

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:20.314
spirit left within you,
Playmaker.

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:23.350
But spirit alone will
not win you this duel.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.687
You'll learn that the
greatest mistake in life
isn't giving up.

00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:29.356
It's not giving up
and still failing.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:35.662
You're only delaying
the inevitable, Playmaker.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.097
You can't win.

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.199
(Ai)
Uh, getting a bit ahead
of yourself?

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:42.136
Our trap card Drop Frame Wedge
won't let you attack

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:45.439
for two more of our turns,
so you can't win yet!

00:16:45.506 --> 00:16:47.508
I know.
That's why I said

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:49.676
you're only delaying
the inevitable.

00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:52.345
That's the very
definition of the phrase.

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.181
Ooh...
Well...

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:56.683
At least my name doesn't
rhyme with embarrass!

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.118
(chuckles) Got 'em!

00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.453
You're so helpful.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.521
It's my turn.

00:17:00.587 --> 00:17:02.823
I draw!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.524
I place one card facedown

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:05.759
and end my turn.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.732
We only have
one turn left,

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:14.668
until Varis's dragons
can attack us again!

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:16.904
And when they do,
we'll be more toast

00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:18.873
than a baker's breakfast!

00:17:18.906 --> 00:17:19.973
Yeah.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.809
Just pathetic.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.577
I draw!

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:26.580
First, I summon
Autorokket Varret Dragon!

00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:30.417
(Ai)
A seventh monster?

00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:35.188
Next, Borreload Dragon
can use its special ability

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:36.890
to lower the attack and
defense points

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:40.761
of one monster
on the field by 500.

00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.929
So I'll weaken
Autorokket Dragon!

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:47.667
(roars)

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:51.805
But when a Link Monster uses
its ability on Autorokket...

00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:54.174
it's automatically destroyed,

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:57.744
and it takes one of your spell
or trap cards along with it!

00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:01.314
So whatever card you've just
placed facedown is gone!

00:18:10.624 --> 00:18:13.060
He really won't let us
do anything!

00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.396
Of course I won't..

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:17.998
And though your cards may be
useless-- mine aren't.

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:21.869
I now place a card
facedown and end my turn!

00:18:21.936 --> 00:18:23.270
By doing so...

00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:26.873
Autorokket Dragon's ability
activates from the graveyard

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.809
letting me summon
another Rokket monster

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:30.277
from my deck!

00:18:30.311 --> 00:18:33.880
I summon Anesthrokket Dragon
in defense mode!

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.818
I can't think
of an example,

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:39.319
but you've gotten
out of worst scrapes

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:40.420
than this right?

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:41.922
Heh, no...

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:42.923
Never.

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:45.326
And is that
making you worry?

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:46.660
You know, it should.

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:47.762
Logically.

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:50.397
But logic never applies
to you, Playmaker.

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:52.432
Hm. Glad to hear.

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:53.467
Muh?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.536
Uh, what's that
weird thing you're

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:56.903
doing with your mouth?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.939
Are you actually...

00:18:58.973 --> 00:19:00.674
smiling?

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:02.042
Heh...

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.677
Don't be so surprised.

00:19:03.711 --> 00:19:05.212
Even if no one
has ever come back

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.881
from this big of a deficit
in a duel...

00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:11.718
Well, there's
always time for a first.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.353
Playmaker's in so
much hot water,

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.789
I don't how much longer
he can stay afloat!

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:17.992
Don't go swimming
to any conclusions!

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:20.493
He's gonna make waves!
And ride this out!

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.897
And get the win!
That's a promise!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.732
I hope it's one
he keeps for you!
Me too!

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.870
(grunting)

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.204
It's my turn.

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:32.305
I draw!

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:34.108
(Ai)
I hope you drew
a nice one

00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:35.876
'cause it's that one card
against his horde

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:37.811
of bajillions.

00:19:37.877 --> 00:19:38.945
Have faith.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.547
Since my field
is nearly empty,

00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:43.317
it means that an infinite amount
of possibilities await.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.786
Yeah, with most
of 'em being bad.

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:47.455
So what'd you draw?

00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.790
This one-- the spell card
Arrow Charge!

00:19:53.861 --> 00:19:55.128
Since the two monsters

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.330
in the Extra Monster Zones

00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:58.966
have the same number
of Link Arrows,

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:02.469
I get to draw
two cards from my deck.

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:04.872
Oh, I'm really, really, really
hoping the pair you pull

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:06.874
get us outta this jam!

00:20:06.974 --> 00:20:10.144
'Hoping' isn't a viable
duel strategy, Ai.

00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:11.211
How about begging?!

00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:13.980
Please, please,
please, please, please...!

00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:18.819
The two cards I drew were

00:20:18.886 --> 00:20:22.490
Disconnect Linker
and Transaction Rollback.

00:20:22.556 --> 00:20:24.625
And I'll activate one
of them right now!

00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:27.061
The spell card
Disconnect Linker!

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:28.528
With this card...

00:20:28.562 --> 00:20:31.498
I can resummon a Link Monster
from my graveyard

00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:33.967
as long as its Link
is 2 or less.

00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:36.703
And then I'll use it
to Link Summon again!

00:20:36.803 --> 00:20:38.939
So I return my Link 2

00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:43.444
Restoration Point Guard
back to my field!

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.546
And use it
to create my ultimate circuit!

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:50.184
The summoning conditions

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:52.786
require one
Cyberse Link Monster,

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:57.658
so I set Restoration Point Guard
in the Link Arrow!

00:20:57.725 --> 00:20:59.126
I Link Summon!

00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:01.762
Link 1 Secure Gardna!

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:04.297
And due to Disconnect Linker's
additional effect

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:08.536
Secure Gardna isn't affected
by any of your monsters'
special abilities!

00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:11.772
(Ai)
That means Varis can't use his
Magnarokket's special ability

00:21:11.872 --> 00:21:13.106
to destroy it!

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.275
(Playmaker)
But that's all...

00:21:14.341 --> 00:21:16.610
As long as Secure Gardna is on
the field,

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.445
the two monsters
in the Extra Monster Zones

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:19.613
can't attack!

00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:22.282
(Ai)
Whoo-hoo!
Nice!

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:27.287
Varis's two best monsters
are now as useless as body hair!

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:30.124
Lastly, I place
Transaction Rollback facedown

00:21:30.224 --> 00:21:32.259
and end my turn.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.296
Well, you maximized
everything you had.

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:37.864
And I can only hope
that it was enough.

00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:41.134
Because Drop Frame Wedge
will now be destroyed

00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:44.571
allowing Varis to attack
with his monsters once again.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.016
♪♪♪

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:06.860
Well...

00:22:06.927 --> 00:22:08.995
It was a long journey,
Playmaker,

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:11.198
but we've ended up
in the same spot.

00:22:11.298 --> 00:22:14.668
These tiny obstacles you
just put in my path?

00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:17.337
Minor nuisances at best.

00:22:17.404 --> 00:22:19.673
Or so you claim.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.341
(chuckles) That I do.

00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:23.744
Your greatest failure
is not realizing

00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:27.748
how much
of a failure you are.

00:22:27.815 --> 00:22:30.150
Yeah?!
Then prove it!

00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:34.821
