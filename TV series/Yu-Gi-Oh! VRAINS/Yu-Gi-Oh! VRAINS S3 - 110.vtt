WEBVTT

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.071
(Blue Maiden)
Ai, what are you doing here?

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:06.506
(Ai)
Oh I was just strolling
through the neighborhood

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.008
and thought
I'd pop in to check...

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.744
on my two favorite meatbags.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.180
It must have taken
some impressive 'strolling'

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.182
for you to have reached us
in a moving plane

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:17.684
that's flying
over 500 miles an hour,

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.186
39,000 feet in the air.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.122
I know, right?

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.624
It's a miracle I didn't
pass out on the way...

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.026
like her.

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.529
Hayami!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.497
(Ai)
She'll be fine.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.266
But for the record,
she wasn't very welcoming.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:34.834
But to get to the point,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.970
how about handing over
your code key.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.106
You've known me long enough

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.442
to know I won't just hand
my code key over to you!

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:43.978
(Ai)
I know.

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:47.681
Just thought I'd ask politely
like a nice house guest.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.950
But I'm really one o' those
rude guests

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:53.487
who takes over the house,
or in this case, airplane.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:54.622
Like this.

00:00:55.256 --> 00:00:56.923
This should be a perfect flight,

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.593
as long as my passengers
are cooperative.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:01.395
Is that a threat?

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:04.998
Whoa, chill, I was just engaging
in harmless banter!

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.369
However, I do want that code key

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.737
and since you won't
hand it over to me...

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.873
I'll duel you both for it.

00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:14.074
(grunting)

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.210
(Pandor)
If we're having a duel,
then I shall be of assistance.

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:19.045
(gasps)

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:21.749
Pandor?

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.750
Didn't I just defeat you?

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:26.987
I seem to remember
our duel vividly,

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.422
considering it just ended
minutes ago.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.192
I am the last of the Pandors.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.196
But soon I will be
the first Pandor,

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.097
the first to defeat you.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:40.100
Well, you're not the first
Pandor to get on my nerves,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.368
that's for sure.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:42.803
But let's move on.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.206
Sooner or later this crate
will start running out of fuel

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.708
so I don't want to waste
any more of our time.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.144
In order to speed things up,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.413
I'll take you both on
at the same time.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:55.916
He doesn't lack
any confidence,

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.084
that's for sure.

00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.019
Yeah, big mistake.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:02.322
(All)
Let's duel!

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:13.800
♪♪♪

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.556
You know what will make
our duel even more exciting?

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:09.356
(snap fingers)

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:11.458
Spectators.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:12.860
Hey,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.029
look it's Playmaker,
Soulburner, and Varis!

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.565
(Ai)
I patched their signals
to the holographic projectors.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.901
It's not quite a live
studio audience,

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.436
but close enough.

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.938
So, Ai, you tracked down Zaizen.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.374
You tried making it
tough for me,

00:03:27.475 --> 00:03:29.810
but you didn't make it
tough enough.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.012
And it looks like we're
missin' one more viewer.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.113
(snap fingers)

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:36.049
Hi, Kolter!
Miss me much?

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:38.051
No way!

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.722
Hey, Master!

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:43.056
I made it here
just in time

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.225
to watch ya duel
the meatbags!

00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:47.728
Great, cuz it's gonna
be a good one!

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:51.665
Well, now that everyone's here
we can get this duel underway.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.001
And since you're
the home team,

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.170
I'll let you
go first.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.172
Fine with me!
It's my turn!

00:03:58.272 --> 00:04:00.774
I summon MARINCESS BLUE TANG!

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.111
When I summon her out,

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.880
I have to send
a MARINCESS from my deck

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.115
straight to the graveyard.

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:09.850
Now I'll use BLUE TANG

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.887
to Link Summon Link 1
MARINCESS BLUE SLUG!

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.759
And due to BLUE SLUG's ability,

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.528
I get to retrieve a MARINCESS
from our graveyard.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.630
But that's only
the beginning, Ai,

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.732
cause when MARINCESS
BLUE TANG is used

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.767
to Link Summon a Water Monster,

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.672
I get to look at the top
three cards in my deck.

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:33.907
And if one of 'em's a MARINCESS,

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.775
I add that to my hand.

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.045
Next, I summon
MARINCESS SEA HORSE

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.413
next to BLUE SLUG's link.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.119
And I'll use 'em both
to Link Summon!

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:49.623
Link 2 MARINCESS CORAL ANEMONE!

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.595
Then CORAL ANEMONE activates
her special ability

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.098
to summon BLUE SLUG
next to her link!

00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:02.335
Now, I'll use them
to build the circuit

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.804
that turns dreams into reality!

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:08.642
The summoning conditions require
two or more Water monsters!

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:15.448
I Link Summon!
Link 3 MARINCESS MARBLED ROCK!

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:25.292
I Link Summon!
Link 3 MARINCESS MARBLED ROCK!

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:29.630
I must say your deck's
quite similar to Aqua's.

00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:31.865
(Blue Maiden)
It's way more than similar,
it's the same,

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.502
And like Aqua,
I can use MARBLED ROCK's ability

00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:37.337
to get a MARINCESS back
from our graveyard.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.507
And then I place
two cards facedown

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.843
and end my turn!

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.512
Well, well!

00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:47.948
That was an impressive turn.
And productive, too.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:50.684
You went through more
links than a golf course.

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:53.620
I can see you worked hard
to master Aqua's deck.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.121
Yeah.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.091
And if she were here,
I know she'd be proud of me.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.660
That's very well put.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.430
Aqua would be proud of you
if she were here,

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.064
but she's not, of course.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.600
Because you failed
to protect her.

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:07.834
Oh well...

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.070
This card is perfect.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.906
I summon PIKARI @IGNISTER.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.581
Due to PIKARI's ability,

00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:25.085
I get to draw the Field Spell
IGNISTER A.I.LAND from my deck.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.319
Now watch this!

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.424
I Link Summon
Link 1 LINGURIBOH!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.693
On top o' that,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.762
I activate my Field Spell!

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:39.233
IGNISTER A.I.LAND
summons a Level 4

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:41.234
or lower @IGNISTER from my hand.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.704
Come on out, ACHICHI @IGNISTER!

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.409
And guess what?

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.044
Another monster
is gonna join the party.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.814
When Lingy is
in the Extra Monster Zone,

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.251
I can summon HIYARI @IGNISTER
next to its link!

00:06:57.384 --> 00:06:58.418
Nice, right?

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:07.995
I now have everything
I need to create my circuit!

00:07:08.496 --> 00:07:11.598
The summoning conditions
are three Cyberses,

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.667
one of which is a Dark monster!

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:17.438
Finally,

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:19.873
it is time to unleash a monster

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:22.977
forged from the darkest
depths of the shadows,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.479
striking fear
into all who witness

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.381
its majestic might!

00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:28.883
I Link Summon!

00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:32.553
Link 3 DARK TEMPLAR @IGNISTER!

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:34.988
Then IGNISTER
A.I.LAND activates,

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:37.324
letting me summon
another @IGNISTER!

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.326
DOYON @IGNISTER!

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.295
There is a heavy correlation

00:07:42.395 --> 00:07:45.565
between the monsters in its deck
and each of the Ignis.

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.235
For example, ACHICHI @IGNISTER

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.037
is clearly a representation
of the Fire Ignis.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:51.772
(gasps)

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:55.809
Similarly, HIYARI @IGNISTER
is the Water Ignis.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:56.309
(gasps)

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.445
And DOYON @IGNISTER

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.947
represents
the Dark Ignis itself.

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:02.683
I see...

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:06.654
That deck has been built
around the friends that Ai lost.

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:08.956
He's not dueling
for himself,

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:10.991
but for his
fallen family.

00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:15.529
I'm surprised it took you
so long to realize that,

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:17.564
even turtles call you slow.

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.833
Due to DOYON's ability,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.303
I retrieve HIYARI
from my graveyard

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.205
And DARK TEMPLAR
has an ability too.

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:29.944
It resurrects as many @IGNISTERS
as possible from my graveyard

00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.046
and summons them
next to its links.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:35.149
So returning are
ACHICHI @IGNISTER

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.017
and HIYARI @IGNISTER!

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:44.224
And I can use them
to Link Summon again!

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:49.797
The summoning conditions
require at least two Cyberses,

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.665
one of which is a Fire Monster!

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:58.539
From the infernal blaze
that gave birth to the universe,

00:08:58.672 --> 00:09:02.075
comes a monster that scorches
all who cross its path!

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:05.413
Rise up from the flames!

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.915
Link 3 FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER!

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:12.453
I know that monster.

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:13.753
It may look intimidating,

00:09:13.854 --> 00:09:16.957
but the other Pandor already
informed me on how to defeat it.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.126
Oh if you have the knowledge

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.961
of all the other
Pandors I dueled,

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.129
you can't be fooled.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:24.598
Unless I try something else,

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:27.935
a completely new strategy
that revolves around this card.

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:30.104
When my Link Monster's arrow

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.405
points towards
my Spell &amp; Trap Zone,

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.375
I can activate a Link Spell.

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:36.710
Say what?

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.779
Ai's gonna use
a Link Spell?

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:39.846
No way!

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:41.282
(sighs)

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:44.718
And this is a Spell
you know quite well.

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:51.791
The Link Spell JUDGMENT ARROWS!

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:05.005
Oh man.

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:06.907
I don't believe it!

00:10:07.541 --> 00:10:10.243
How on Earth could he ever
play JUDGMENT ARROWS?

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.713
Ai, you know that's
the same card

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.448
that destroyed your home world!

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.350
Man, talk about an uncool
move to make.

00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.086
Ai,

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:20.854
if there's one card
that should stay off limits

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.056
you know it's that one!

00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:23.290
(Ai)
But why?

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.192
As you said yourself,
it's a powerful card,

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.526
so hold on...

00:10:27.928 --> 00:10:31.765
Did you actually think I wasn't
taking this fight seriously?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.400
I can see why you'd think that.

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:36.504
Because the war's
already over for you, right?

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:40.173
And things have been going
so well for you, meatbags.

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.776
Like Skye, how's Miyu doing?

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:44.077
Good, right?

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:45.112
(gasps)

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:46.113
Yeah.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:47.914
After Bohman and Lightning
were defeated,

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:49.216
she actually woke up.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:52.519
Skye!

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.121
You brought flowers?

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:54.889
Thanks!

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:55.956
Miyu!

00:10:56.056 --> 00:10:56.957
You're awake!

00:10:57.558 --> 00:10:58.859
All thanks to you.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:10:59.793
Huh?

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.795
I don't know if it was
just a dream,

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:03.997
but Aqua told me
that you saved me.

00:11:04.365 --> 00:11:05.765
(sobbing)

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:06.934
(laughs)

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:08.668
Oh Miyu!

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:12.772
And your brother is fine, too,
isn't he, Kolter?

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:14.741
He is.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:18.678
I'm glad things are goin'
so great for you, meatbags.

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:22.682
But I&amp; will never get the chance
to see the other Ignis again.

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.686
I know, Ai.
Sorry.

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:29.456
Ai, we all wish that things
had gone differently.

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.291
Not me.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:35.295
The Ignis posed a threat
to mankind's existence.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:37.298
If they had chosen
to take a different path

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:39.266
they would
still be here.

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:42.002
That Ignis is trying
to garner your sympathy

00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:44.337
but it will get none from me.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:46.907
(Pandor)
What Varis says is correct.

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:50.810
The Dark Ignis is trying
to trick and manipulate you.

00:11:51.579 --> 00:11:52.913
It wants you to feel pity,

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:55.015
so that you won't
duel it as hard.

00:11:55.516 --> 00:11:56.750
Seriously?

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.418
That's not very nice.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:11:59.420
Master,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.255
so are you what they say you are

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:03.357
or are you not
what they say you are?

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:05.892
Maybe yes maybe no,
but it doesn't matter.

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:08.762
They're just trying to eat away
at my confidence.

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:10.564
But I know you'll serve
'em up on a platter

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:11.765
just like this one!

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:12.900
Oh yeah!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.569
I hope you're plannin'
to mop up that mess,

00:12:15.702 --> 00:12:18.038
but hey, props to you
for the impromptu props.

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.373
Thank you, I aim to please!

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:21.975
(laughs)

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.244
Time to pour on the heat!

00:12:24.378 --> 00:12:27.814
FIRE PHOENIX @IGNISTER
attacks your MARBLED ROCK!

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:32.753
And JUDGMENT ARROWS doubles
my PHOENIX's attack points!

00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:34.554
Well that's not gonna matter!

00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:37.391
'Cause due to MARINCESS
MARBLED ROCK's ability,

00:12:37.491 --> 00:12:40.427
by discarding one MARINCESS
that's in my hand...

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:42.496
MARBLED ROCK isn't destroyed...

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:44.265
I won't be taking any damage!

00:12:44.765 --> 00:12:48.469
And then I'll activate
my trap card MARINCESS WAVE!

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:51.338
Your FIRE PHOENIX loses
all its special abilities

00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:52.672
until the end of your turn!

00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:58.011
Oh!

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:01.448
You stopped me from dealing you
a single point of damage.

00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:04.785
Too bad for you I have
other ways to mess up your duel!

00:13:05.652 --> 00:13:08.321
I activate the spell
TA.I.MED TECHNIQUE!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.257
By banishing my FIRE PHOENIX,

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.159
I get to banish
a card from your hand

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:13.660
for every one of its links!

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:16.162
Since FIRE PHOENIX is Link 3,

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:18.899
I get to banish 3
cards from your hand

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.167
until the end of the battle.

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:21.769
Ah!

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:25.606
(Ai)
TA.I.MED TECHNIQUE also moves
my DARK TEMPLAR

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.808
from the Extra Monster Zone
to the Main Monster Zone.

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:30.944
Next to JUDGEMENT ARROWS's.

00:13:31.044 --> 00:13:33.213
And since you have
no cards in your hand,

00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:35.316
you can't use
MARBLED ROCK's ability.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.051
You had this all planned
from the start!

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:39.319
I did.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:41.988
DARK TEMPLAR,
attack MARBLED ROCK!

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.259
And JUDGMENT ARROWS
doubles its attack points!

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:53.233
Aah!

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:57.204
Are you okay?
You hurt?

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.640
It's... just a sting.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.276
With that, I end my turn.

00:14:02.376 --> 00:14:04.211
That means my banished
FIRE PHOENIX

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.512
returns to my field.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.383
(Pandor)
And the cards that were
banished from your hand

00:14:09.483 --> 00:14:10.984
also return as well.

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.688
You know what,
I've had enough of this duel.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.189
Huh?

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:19.493
This may sound like I'm
just making excuses

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.329
'cuz I already lost
over half my life points,

00:14:22.396 --> 00:14:25.031
but dueling you
just doesn't feel right.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.202
You're not the only one
who lost a friend.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:31.138
You never gave up

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:34.041
and that's why I'm proud
to be your partner.

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.509
Ditto.
Thanks, Aqua.

00:14:37.478 --> 00:14:38.445
Trust me,

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.614
I know you're hurting
because Aqua is gone,

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.116
but I'm hurting
just as much as you are!

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.888
This duel will only make
the suffering worse.

00:14:48.322 --> 00:14:50.790
So, you miss Aqua
more than I do?

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.158
Really now?

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.628
Then why do you have that thing?

00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:56.029
It looks like
you found

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:59.065
a replacement
for Aqua pretty easily.

00:15:01.935 --> 00:15:04.604
(Ai)
So are you two besties already?

00:15:07.508 --> 00:15:09.943
Oh who am I to judge you?

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.779
You can't keep
grieving forever, I guess.

00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:15.516
Not that it was really
anything like for-ever.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.451
It was more like
four seconds.

00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:19.619
Ignis,

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.021
I do not understand

00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.723
how your present
course of action

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.791
could ever deliver
a positive result,

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:25.960
even for you.

00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:27.928
Oh you don't, do you?

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:29.529
The actions of the present

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:31.631
cannot alter
the actions of the past,

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:32.933
but the actions of the present

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.035
can alter
the actions of the future.

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:36.703
But your actions of the present

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.372
based on the actions
of your past

00:15:38.439 --> 00:15:40.207
are leading to actions
of the future

00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:42.276
that conflict
with the actions of your past.

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.612
Oh what where how who?

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:46.947
Now here's the facts
as I see 'em:

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.449
Back then,

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:49.917
I teamed with the meatbags

00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:52.185
'cuz I thought it was
the right thing to do.

00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:55.055
But look where it got me

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.957
and where it got my friends.

00:15:57.925 --> 00:15:59.126
Sometimes you can think

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.161
you're doing the right thing
but then...

00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:03.496
you later learn it was wrong.

00:16:04.165 --> 00:16:05.165
Ai.

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:07.234
(grunts)

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.803
You now have the responsibility

00:16:09.903 --> 00:16:12.573
to determine what path
the future takes.

00:16:12.673 --> 00:16:15.242
I sincerely hope
you forge a good one.

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:19.179
And not a future
that either one of you regret.

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:23.950
So short story long,
we're not done dueling.

00:16:24.518 --> 00:16:25.919
You're up, Zaizen.

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:31.525
What's wrong?

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:33.127
You need a snack break?

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:36.630
When SOL Technologies created
you and the other Ignis, Ai,

00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:38.699
you were all treated
like programs,

00:16:38.799 --> 00:16:41.969
instead of the living
creatures that you are.

00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:45.172
I could have and should have
intervened to help you,

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:47.174
especially to save
the Earth Ignis

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.076
after he had been captured.

00:16:49.643 --> 00:16:52.012
Please accept
my deepest apology.

00:16:55.783 --> 00:16:56.783
I know I can't make up

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.351
for all the pain
you've suffered.

00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.088
But taking revenge on those
who caused you pain

00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:03.190
will not heal
your own pain.

00:17:03.524 --> 00:17:05.759
The path you're on
is not the answer.

00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.928
You have to stop
before it's too late!

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:11.665
So after just admitting
how many mistakes you have made,

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:14.901
I'm the one here among us
who is making the big mistake?

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.003
Do you not see
yourself in the mirror

00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:21.308
or are you some sort
of a vampire, Zaizen?

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.910
Regardless of what you
may think about me,

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:26.147
I won't back down!

00:17:26.247 --> 00:17:27.815
For my sake as well as yours,

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:29.883
I won't let you
take my code key!

00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:31.485
Then bring it on.

00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:35.222
And may the best duelist win,
or in other words, me.

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.595
You have two Link Monsters
with 2300 attack points each.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:43.363
And JUDGMENT ARROWS will double

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.198
their attack points
during battle,

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:47.835
making them even more
difficult to destroy.

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:49.236
(Ai)
That's right.

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:52.806
But if you don't destroy them,
you can't win Zaizen.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.542
It's my turn.
I draw!

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.011
First, I place
a monster facedown,

00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:01.815
then activate the spell card,
STAIRS OF MAIL!

00:18:02.816 --> 00:18:05.152
By discarding
a TINDANGLE from my hand,

00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.554
I can flip my monster
into attack mode.

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:11.491
I send TINDANGLE INTRUDER
to the graveyard!

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:16.162
Show yourself, TINDANGLE ANGEL!

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:19.933
Oh?

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:22.069
TINDANGLES, huh?

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:24.137
It's the same deck
that gave Playmaker

00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.306
a whole chunk of trouble
back in the day.

00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:29.076
When my ANGEL is flipped faceup,

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:32.779
its ability allows me summon
another monster facedown.

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.150
And doing so triggers
TINDANGLE INTRUDER's ability.

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:38.752
When a monster is placed
facedown on our field,

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:41.321
my INTRUDER resummons
itself from our graveyard

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.822
facedown as well.

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.292
And then, I can summon

00:18:45.393 --> 00:18:47.828
TINDANGLE BASE GARDNA
in defense mode

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:50.997
when I already have
a facedown monster in play.

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.070
Now I'll activate
STAIRS OF MAIL's effect again!

00:18:57.371 --> 00:19:00.307
I discard another TINDANGLE
from my hand!

00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:03.177
And that switches
TINDANGLE INTRUDER

00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:06.546
from facedown defense mode
to faceup attack mode!

00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:11.452
And when my INTRUDER
is turned faceup...

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:14.221
its special ability
will then add one TINDANGLE

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:16.022
from my deck into my hand.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.893
Now I'm activating
STAIRS OF MAIL once again!

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:22.829
Show yourself, TINDANGLE HOUND!

00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:26.032
Hey!

00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.335
I remember
that slobbering schnauzer!

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:30.371
Then you should also remember

00:19:30.471 --> 00:19:32.373
that it's not one you
should underestimate

00:19:32.473 --> 00:19:35.208
because by flipping
one of my monsters facedown,

00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:38.378
TINDANGLE HOUND gains
all of its attack points.

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:41.448
So I'll flip TINDANGLE INTRUDER
facedown

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:44.484
to give my HOUND
2200 attack points!

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:48.288
It has 4700 attack points.

00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:50.657
Now even if Ai uses
JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:53.827
Zaizen's monster will still be
stronger than his DARK TEMPLAR.

00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.896
Then Ai's monster
is gonna be toast!

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.364
Here goes.

00:19:57.464 --> 00:20:00.567
My TINDANGLE HOUND
attacks your DARK TEMPLAR!

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.674
(grunts)

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:10.043
Well, now,

00:20:10.177 --> 00:20:12.145
it looks as though I found
a weak spot.

00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:13.346
Ugh.

00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:16.717
All you did was deal a measly
100 points of damage.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.451
Then watch him do more!

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.053
Right?

00:20:21.522 --> 00:20:23.457
I activate our trap!

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.192
MARINCESS DECISION!

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:28.562
By banishing a MARINCESS
card from our graveyard,

00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:31.198
I flip a facedown
monster faceup,

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:33.134
but keep that card
in defense mode,

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:35.102
so I'll banish MARINCESS WAVE

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:38.805
to switch TINDANGLE INTRUDER
from facedown to faceup.

00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:42.510
But wait, Ai!

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.812
There's more
to MARINCESS DECISION's effect

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:47.714
'cuz we can also use
the newly faceup monster

00:20:47.814 --> 00:20:49.816
in order to Link Summon!

00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:52.052
Ready, Akira?
Yes!

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:55.989
(Both)
Now, we unite our circuit!

00:20:57.691 --> 00:21:01.061
The summoning conditions
require three TINDANGLES!

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:15.409
We Link Summon!

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:19.279
Link 3 TINDANGLE ACUTE CERBERUS!

00:21:24.752 --> 00:21:27.020
TINDANGLE ACUTE CERBERUS!

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.190
So that's Zaizen's
go-to monster. huh?

00:21:30.524 --> 00:21:31.124
No.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.127
Not just his monster,
but theirs,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.761
'cuz they summoned it
together.

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:36.297
How sweet!

00:21:36.397 --> 00:21:39.133
Two siblings united in defeat!

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.300
(grunts)
Hmm.

00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:52.445
