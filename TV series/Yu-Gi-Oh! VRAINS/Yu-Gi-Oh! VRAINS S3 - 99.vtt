WEBVTT

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.271
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:05.939
(Lightning)
It's my turn!

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.674
I use JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.143
to double my monster's
attack points.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.312
Even if I can't destroy
your monster,

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.414
you still take damage.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.982
(groans)

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.486
Fire!

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:23.457
I also now activate
BORRELOAD DRAGON's ability

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:24.091
No!

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.827
I refuse to let you win!

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.295
When ARMATOS GLORIA

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.497
is the target
of a special ability

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:31.599
while it's on my field,

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.802
all my monsters
in play are destroyed.

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.971
We both take
3000 points of damage

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.574
which is more than enough
to wipe out your life points...

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.975
and mine.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.477
No way!

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.478
I refuse to lose
to any human!

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:50.150
And if that means
sacrificing myself, so be it!

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.955
(grunts)

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.524
(groans)

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:59.994
(Playmaker)
Bohman has absorbed
Lightning.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:02.596
(Ai)
Now Bohman has five
Ignis inside him,

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.565
all of ''em except me!

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:05.866
(Bohman)
When this is over,

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.836
you will also become
a part of me.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:11.038
It is time, Playmaker.

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:12.205
Let's duel!

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:16.303
Let's duel, Bohman!

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.272
Yes. Let's.

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:19.940
But I think we need
a setting more

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.109
befitting of this
very special moment.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:29.649
(Ai)
Something tells me he's not
taking us to a fancy restaurant.

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:33.954
Look, Ai...

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:34.622
This is the courtyard

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:37.258
at Central Station.

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:40.327
Correct,
the epicenter of Link VRAINS.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.229
This is where we'll end things.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.133
The final battle
is about to begin.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.870
Yes and let's hope
it leads to Bohman's end.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.038
Focus Playmaker...

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:51.772
Don't let Varis's sacrifice

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:54.708
be for nothing...

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.276
Win this.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.779
I can't believe Varis
was defeated...

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.880
Not just Varis...

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.848
But also Sheppard,

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:05.218
Specter, Soulburner and...

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.120
Your... sister...

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.360
Poor Skye...

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.163
And we can't let her sacrifice
go to waste.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:18.699
So it's time we stop standing
around doing nothing

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.700
and start doing something.

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:25.539
Now whaddya say you
and I get back to work

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:29.276
and start figuring out how to
log everyone out of LINK VRAINS.

00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:31.011
But with Bohman blocking us

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.846
from using this
emergency log out

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.882
it's not gonna be easy.

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:37.718
What if we hack Link
VRAINS' core OS...

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.320
Shut down everything,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.888
And then restart?

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:41.988
Well...

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.124
Theoretically that would
log everyone out

00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:46.460
but logging out people
without their knowledge

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.861
could leave them
in a deep sleep

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.697
for like, forever.

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.198
That's true.

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.533
But that's a risk
we must be willing to take.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.001
Now let's move.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:03:58.705
(Pigeon)
Check it out boss

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.841
it looks like we got
the best view in the house

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:04.411
for the final faceoff
between Playmaker and Bohman!

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.013
(Frog)
And we gotta
take advantage of it

00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.615
cuz it's our journalistic duty
to record this battle

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.584
and share it with the public!

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:13.086
And cuz we could go kablam!

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.090
That too, there's always
a chance of that happenin' too.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.125
However this ends,
it could end up our end!

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:20.694
Well if this is
our last story

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.129
let's go out with a bang!

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.267
Ahh! Speak for yourself boss,
speak for yourself!

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:28.068
You there, up in the sky.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:31.071
This duel has nothing to do
with either of you.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.007
You two are now free to leave.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.110
Huh?!

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.743
Huh?!

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.078
Thank goodness!

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.947
We can go, we can go,
we can go!

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.382
So where to, best friend?

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:43.417
Huh?!

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:46.119
I'm not your best friend,
you bird brain!

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.455
I'm your boss bub
and as your boss,

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.759
I say we continue
sticking it out right here!

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.628
Funny, didn't know
that I wanted to stay...

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.029
Until I could leave!

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.030
(Bohman)

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.965
When I defeat you
in this battle,

00:04:58.965 --> 00:05:01.335
no one will be able
to oppose me

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:05.172
from building a new world
of my own design.

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:08.476
Similar to this world
you see before you.

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:12.646
You said ""when" you defeat us
when you should have said ""if."

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:16.517
And that's one ""if" we won't
allow come to pass Bohman.

00:05:16.517 --> 00:05:22.156
No, I did not misspeak
when I said ""when," Playmaker.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:23.990
So then let's begin.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:29.463
(gasps)

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:30.764
Whoa.

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:38.439
I'm ready to test out my
new strategies whenever you are.

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:41.275
Bohman just built himself
a brand new deck.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.475
Yeah,

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:45.679
out of Flame, Aqua,
Earth, Windy, and Lightning.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.950
Bohman is using their powers
to power his deck!

00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:55.155
What is that?

00:05:55.155 --> 00:05:57.190
It's an Ignis algorithm.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.759
So what do you think
it can do?

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.093
I'm not sure.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.230
But I doubt it's good.
Let's hurry...

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:06.933
The sooner we can
hack into the core,

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.703
the sooner we can save
everyone in Link VRAINS.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:10.871
I'm on it.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.043
I used to be a pretty decent
hacker back in the day...

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.879
Time to see
if I've still got it.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.680
(Klarissa)
Hmm. Hey guys.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.184
It seems like we're not the
only ones hacking the system.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.088
Hey, ya big tool!

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:31.325
Stop using the Ignis as tools
to power up your duel!

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:33.060
It's just not right!

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.396
(Bohman)
You misunderstand my
intention.

00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:37.098
They are not tools.

00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:40.167
I'm honoring them
by using their strength.

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:41.569
And do not fret, Ai,

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.238
you will join your friends
soon enough when I defeat

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:46.740
Playmaker and absorb you.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.041
Now then...

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.244
It's time to duel, Playmaker.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:51.378
And...

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.047
End this war once and for all!

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.218
(both)
Let's duel!

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:06.660
What in the world is that?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.262
It kinda looks like a
portal...

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:14.534
A portal.. that's gonna
get us all outta here!

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:20.107
(crowd screaming)

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.942
This is so unflash!

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.545
(both gasp)

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:25.979
You hear that, Playmaker?

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.649
It was like the whole world
screamed at once!

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:29.750
You're right.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.886
Something is going wrong
in LINK VRAINS, Ai.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:37.291
Hello?
Anyone in there?

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.461
It's like the lights are
on but no one's home.

00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.762
Am I next?

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:42.963
(screams)

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:44.465
I don't wanna be next!

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:45.733
Mommy!

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:46.933
What's this?

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.136
This isn't good.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.438
That's an understatement
if I've heard one.

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:52.540
You're right...

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.609
This really,
really isn't good...

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:56.376
(Roboppi sighs)

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.611
Poor Roboppi...

00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.948
Left home
all alone again.

00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:02.516
But lucky for Roboppi,

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:05.319
Roboppi can still watch
his master duel.

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.487
And watch his master win.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.858
Roboppi doesn't remember having
this function installed,

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:13.327
unless it's a malfunction!

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:17.364
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no--

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.499
unless!

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:21.768
Of course, it must have been
master's doing!

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.204
Yay, master!

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.874
(Ai)
If we heard everyone
screamin' in LINK VRAINS,

00:08:26.874 --> 00:08:29.376
it must be cuz our Link
Sense is tinglin'.

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:30.544
You're right.

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:32.012
Even though
we can't see them,

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.847
I can still feel them
around me.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.716
Confused and afraid.

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.885
(Bohman)
So you have Link Sense.

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:39.987
The ability for
a human to sense

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:41.655
what is happening
within the network.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:42.456
I'm sure this ""sixth sense"

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:44.725
is quite a useful,

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:46.293
but in this circumstance,

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:49.296
hearing the suffering
of every human in LINK VRAINS

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:51.231
must be distracting.

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.700
And distractions are what
you cannot have

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.536
in a duel against me,
Playmaker!

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.205
(grunts)

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.140
I shall go first.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.277
When neither of us
have any monsters in play...

00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:07.714
I can summon HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER
from my hand.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.949
And with it...

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:11.885
I'll generate my circuit!

00:09:13.353 --> 00:09:17.090
The summoning condition
is one HYDRADRIVE.

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.695
So I Link Summon...

00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:24.964
Link 1 GRAND HYDRADRIVE!

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:29.769
Next, I summon a second
HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER from my hand!

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.574
And use it...

00:09:33.574 --> 00:09:35.776
to Link Summon again!

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:39.580
I set HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER
in the Link Arrow.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.584
I Link Summon Link 1
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.754
(Ai)
Hmm...
Even with a new deck,

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.589
he's making
the same ol' moves.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:51.758
Yes but it's still early, Ai.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.260
Now behold!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.596
What I have already
managed to do twice,

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:58.632
I can do thrice, Playmaker!

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:04.604
I Link Summon!
Link 2 TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:05.906
(growls)

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.409
And I won't stop here!

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:14.748
I set my HYDRADRIVE
KNIGHT in the Link Arrow!

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:18.552
I Link Summon
Link 1 BURN HYDRADRIVE!

00:10:18.552 --> 00:10:20.721
(snarls)

00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.391
(Ai)
He used a Link 2 monster
to summon a Link 1 monster?

00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.526
It may appear
as a downgrade Ai,

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.861
but he now has three

00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:31.231
Link monsters with
different Attributes.

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:32.766
(Bohman)
Very perceptive.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:36.269
Next, I'll summon
another HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:43.911
And I'll use it to
Link Summon another HYDRADRIVE!

00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:47.080
Link 1 FLOW HYDRADRIVE!

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.682
(growls)

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:53.420
That has a fourth Attribute!

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.690
Next I activate the spell card

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.025
HYDRADRIVE REBUILD!

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.530
By destroying BURN HYDRADRIVE
I can summon a different

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.099
HYDRADRIVE from my graveyard by
negating its special abilities.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:10.136
Rise, TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:13.607
In addition, when
BURN HYDRADRIVE is destroyed,

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:15.609
it triggers
its special ability

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.777
allowing me to summon
a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.512
in defense mode.

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:24.284
A TOKEN I'll use
to generate my circuit

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:26.086
for a sixth time!

00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.520
Gooooo!

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:34.961
I Link Summon Link 1
ALTERATION HYDRADRIVE!

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:39.833
I activate ALTERATION
HYDRADRIVE's ability!

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.636
I select one HYDRADRIVE
on my field,

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:44.905
and if any HYDRADRIVE
in my graveyard

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.674
has fewer Link Arrows
than my chosen monster,

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.145
I can resurrect
as many of them as I want.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:51.812
What?

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:54.281
As many as you want?

00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:57.751
So I select my TWIN
HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:11:57.751 --> 00:11:59.119
Since it's Link 2,

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.889
I can revive Link 1
BURN HYDRADRIVE

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:03.891
and COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:06.493
But in exchange,
I must destroy

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.895
TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT.

00:12:10.064 --> 00:12:13.066
What surprise does
Bohman have for us?

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:17.204
(Pigeon)
Spoiler alert, Boss!

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.206
If Bohman's got four
Link 1 monsters,

00:12:19.206 --> 00:12:22.576
you know he's gonna use ''em
to summon a Link 4 monster!

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.079
Yeah! Because
those monsters

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.247
are the most powerful ones
in the game!

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:30.984
I'm summoning
HYDRADRIVE ELEMENTS!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.089
(both scream)

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.923
(Pigeon)
So much for the spoiler.

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:41.195
And I'll use my
HYDRADRIVE ELEMENTS

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.863
to generate my circuit!

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.735
And so I Link Summon

00:12:47.735 --> 00:12:51.038
Link 1 GRAND HYDRADRIVE!

00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:54.341
He summoned another
Link 1 monster...

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.344
When I use HYDRADRIVE ELEMENTS
to Link Summon,

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.746
its special ability activates.

00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:01.915
Allowing me to select
a monster

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:04.484
that's on the field
and change its Attribute

00:13:04.484 --> 00:13:08.321
to one of my choosing
until the end of the turn.

00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.056
(grunts)
He has two
Earth monsters,

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:12.993
so he's probably gonna
change one of ''em.

00:13:12.993 --> 00:13:14.661
And you're probably right.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:17.998
I'm changing ALTERATION
HYDRADRIVE from Earth...

00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:19.233
to Light.

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.768
(Ai)
Now he has the Attribute
of every Ignis,

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:23.370
except for me.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.307
Not to mention the five
Link 1 monsters on his field.

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:26.941
Which would theoretically

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:28.875
allow him to summon

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:30.310
a Link 5 monster.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.913
Good thing Link 5
monsters don't exist cuz

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.715
they'd be super OP.

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:36.450
(chuckles) Oh, Ai...

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.121
One could fill an entire book
with what you don't know.

00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:42.590
If a particular monster
doesn't exist...

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.925
Then I'll just create it.

00:13:44.925 --> 00:13:47.328
I activate my Skill!

00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:48.128
His Skill?

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.163
His Skill.

00:13:55.636 --> 00:13:57.137
(crowd screaming)

00:13:57.137 --> 00:14:00.708
Everybody look out,
another wave's comin'!

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.142
(whimper)

00:14:02.142 --> 00:14:04.177
(gasps)

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.779
(screaming)

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.682
The first mind blasts
occurred simultaneously

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.317
with the start of the duel.

00:14:10.317 --> 00:14:13.687
And this second wave
when Bohman activated its Skill.

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.289
That means this duel...

00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:18.025
and the mind blasts
are connected.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.828
Then we need to figure out
how they're connected.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:25.299
(thunder rumbling)

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.667
(grunting)

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:28.669
You heard that?

00:14:28.669 --> 00:14:31.772
Yes...
How could I not.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:33.940
(whooshing)

00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:38.012
Bohman's whippin' up
one storm of a Data Storm

00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:41.047
the biggest one
I've ever seen!

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.116
My Skill allows me to acquire

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.519
a Cyberse monster
from the Data Storm

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.688
and add it to my Extra Deck!

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.623
And the stronger the storm,

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:51.725
the stronger the monster!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.603
(whimpering)

00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:05.405
(sreams)

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.074
You guys ok?

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:08.409
(both gasp)

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:10.277
This is not
a good development!

00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:11.245
No kidding!

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:14.581
And we're next,
ya just know we're next!

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:15.416
(Avatar A)
Run!

00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:16.450
(Avatar B)
Hide!

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.085
Get ready, Playmaker.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.387
(grunts)

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:21.755
Because now...

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:26.126
I generate my optimal circuit!

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:29.262
The summoning conditions
require five Link Monsters

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.598
with five different
Attributes!

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.899
Five?!?

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:42.242
Witness the greatest
Link Summoning...

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:43.210
ever!

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.912
(all gasp)

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:52.352
(Bohman)
Link 5 CHIMERA
HYDRADRIVE DRAGRID!

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:55.188
(growls)

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:07.835
Aww glitch!
A Link 5 monster!

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:12.306
(Bohman)
CHIMERA HYDRADRIVE DRAGID's
special ability activates.

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.808
When it's summoned
from my Extra Deck,

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:19.146
it gains one HYDRADRIVE Counter.

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:21.682
There's no way Bohman
should've been able to summon

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:23.516
a Link 5 monster!

00:16:23.516 --> 00:16:26.654
I agree, that would take power
beyond the capabilities

00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:28.622
that any AI can generate!

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.190
You may think it's impossible,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.526
but as you can see,
it's clearly not.

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:34.861
So the question is...

00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:38.199
How was it able to draw out
so much energy?

00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:40.367
Ahh! Me and my big mouth!

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.936
Why'd I have to open it,
even though I don't have one,

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:46.072
and say that it's impossible
to summon a Link 5 monster.

00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:48.809
I jinxed it, didn't I,
Playmaker?

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:52.512
I don't believe in jinxes,
but if there was such a thing...

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.316
Then yes, Ai,
you did go and jinx it.

00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:59.085
What you call a jinx,
I call careful planning.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:02.055
For, I alone did not possess
the power to summon

00:17:02.055 --> 00:17:05.825
a Link 5 monster,
so I tapped into another source.

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:07.762
Another source?

00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:09.897
You mean other humans!

00:17:09.897 --> 00:17:11.398
What else would I mean.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.533
I don't know, a hamster wheel?

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:17.137
I've said before that
LINK VRAINS and I are one.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:20.540
Therefore, so is everyone
within LINK VRAINS.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.243
My Neuron Link
allows me to tap

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:25.645
into their mental energies
like batteries.

00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:29.383
So that's how you were able
to create a Data Storm that big?

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:33.687
Wow, you must've tapped into
a ginormous number of noggins!

00:17:33.687 --> 00:17:35.188
That's correct.

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:38.892
One individual is not capable
of generating much energy...

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.562
but when there's a source
with millions of minds

00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:43.063
that I can tap into...

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:47.033
that Data Storm is only the
beginning of what I can achieve.

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:48.836
You think this Link 5 monster

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.304
is the apex of my abilities

00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:53.173
when I only see it
as the starting line.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.709
So, then that explains
why everyone in LINK VRAINS

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.511
is being targeted
with mind blasts

00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.846
Bohman is draining
all of their brainpower.

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:03.451
And using it
to then fuel his duel.

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:07.154
The longer this duel goes on,
the more victims there will be.

00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:10.090
We have to do something,
but is there anything we can do?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.158
Bohman!

00:18:11.158 --> 00:18:12.726
I know you have a thing
against cheaters,

00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:16.496
and what you're doing here is
prime triple A grade cheating!

00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:17.564
Cheating?

00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:18.999
How so?

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:20.467
You absorbed
like a bazillion

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:23.270
and a half minds into ya
to power you up, right?

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.538
And your point?

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:25.972
My point?

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:29.576
My point is that dueling
is supposed to be one-vs-one,

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.980
not one-vs-
a-bazillion-and-a-half!

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.414
But Ai.

00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:37.785
You and Playmaker have been
dueling against me all this time

00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:39.987
and that is 2-on-1.

00:18:39.987 --> 00:18:43.057
And you did not hear me
complaining.

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:45.626
Well--
(Bohman)
But to address your concern,

00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:48.228
let me assure you
that it's more than fair.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:48.896
The power of their minds

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:52.299
may fuel my strength,

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:55.602
but I'm still the one
making all the decisions.

00:18:55.602 --> 00:18:56.269
That still doesn't

00:18:56.269 --> 00:18:58.305
sound fair to me!

00:18:58.305 --> 00:18:59.774
Cuz you just gave yourself

00:18:59.774 --> 00:19:03.010
a performance-enhancing power
boost in the middle of a duel!

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.712
How is it any different
than the humans?

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:08.048
As humans use food
to nourish them,

00:19:08.048 --> 00:19:10.217
I'm using them
to nourish me.

00:19:10.217 --> 00:19:12.452
There is no difference.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:16.189
In fact, you can say
that I'm doing them a favor.

00:19:16.189 --> 00:19:18.358
Because now that
they are a part of me,

00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:23.898
they can share in the glory of
creating a new world, a utopia.

00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:25.198
You cannot create a utopia

00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:27.534
by destroying the lives
of those around you.

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:30.670
Yeah, while we don't want
anyone to be erased anymore,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.340
you're still willing to add to
the count to get what you want!

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.776
And that's why we
don't see eye-to-eye!

00:19:35.776 --> 00:19:37.177
Obviously...

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:40.014
I know that we
don't see eye-to-eye.

00:19:40.014 --> 00:19:41.849
Isn't that the very reason

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.518
why we're having this
dueling right now?

00:19:44.518 --> 00:19:47.287
Stop being so... logical!

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:48.989
In the end, Ai,

00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:52.293
whatever we may say,
whatever we may feel,

00:19:52.293 --> 00:19:55.529
one side is correct,
and the other is not.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:19:56.063
And the one who wins

00:19:56.063 --> 00:19:58.165
this duel is the one

00:19:58.165 --> 00:20:00.300
that will be deemed
to be correct.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.837
So if you truly think
that I'm in the wrong

00:20:02.837 --> 00:20:04.638
prove it by defeating me.

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:08.542
But I believe you will find that
this task is all but impossible.

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.043
Argh!

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.513
I've never been more pumped
to put a program in its place!

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:16.350
Stay calm, Ai, don't let your
emotions overwhelm your focus.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.784
It's our turn!

00:20:19.352 --> 00:20:20.688
Ooh, nice draw!

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:22.222
Yes, it is.

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:25.058
But I'll save it
for later and summon...

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.226
WIDGET KID!

00:20:27.862 --> 00:20:30.164
And due to WIDGET
KID's special ability,

00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.466
I'm now allowed to summon
my Tuner Monster,

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:34.000
CYBERSE SYNCHRON!

00:20:36.003 --> 00:20:37.938
Next I activate
CYBERSE SYNCHRON's

00:20:37.938 --> 00:20:39.840
special ability to double

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.544
WIDGET KID's
Level from 3 to 6!

00:20:43.544 --> 00:20:45.179
And that gives us the sauce

00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:48.148
to allow us to
Synchro Summon, Bohman!

00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:50.851
I tune my Level 1
CYBERSE SYNCHRON

00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:53.687
with my Level 6
WIDGET KID!

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:00.861
Watch as the flash
of lightning

00:21:00.861 --> 00:21:03.464
strikes from the far reaches
of the universe!

00:21:03.464 --> 00:21:09.069
(electronic whirring)

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:12.740
I Synchro Summon!

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.676
Rise!
CYBERSE QUANTUM DRAGON!

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.212
(growls)

00:21:22.216 --> 00:21:24.418
(Ai)
Your HYDRADRIVE may
have more attack points

00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:25.952
than our QUANTUM DRAGON,

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.421
but when
our DRAGON battles,

00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:29.389
its special ability kicks in

00:21:29.389 --> 00:21:31.758
and sends your monster
back to your deck!

00:21:31.758 --> 00:21:34.227
So all your work's
goin' bye bye!

00:21:34.227 --> 00:21:37.564
Hm, did you think
I wouldn't be ready for this?

00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:38.798
(both gasp)

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.402
I already have a counter
strategy prepared for you!

00:21:42.402 --> 00:21:45.605
I activate my
Skill again!

00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:49.710
Again?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.745
(both groan)

00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:55.448
Now you will experience...

00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:58.385
The true and terrible extent...

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:00.954
Of my power!
