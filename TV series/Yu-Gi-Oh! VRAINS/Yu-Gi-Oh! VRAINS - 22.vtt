What's that?
An eclipse?

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:22.956
I've never seen one in here.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.925
Did they announce
a special event?

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:25.960
Not that I've heard.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.594
Does everyone
else see that?

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.296
Maybe it's a bug
in the programming.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.769
What's going wrong this time?

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.773
A bug? A virus? Unreal!
How am I supposed to nap?

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.274
I want this fixed yesterday!

<i>Back in ancient times, solar
eclipses were super evil omens,</i>

<i>foreshadowing total destruction
and the end of civilizations.</i>

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.423
<i>So you got that going for you.</i>

there is something to this.

the world a message.

<i>Like what?

soon enough.

Or this could be the start
of a new beginning.

It's because they've become
one of The Deleted.

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.683
See, there's an evil ghoul
that's going around

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.053
putting curses on Duel Disks.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.555
And if you're unlucky
to own one of 'em,

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:44.291
it snatches your soul and traps
it inside Link Vrains.

Duh!

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.663
Why would I bother lying
to ya? Come on, now.

And the scary thing
is you don't even know

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.735
if your Duel Disk is cursed
until it's too late.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.337

at the stroke of midnight.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:01.675
Its gangly ghoulish arms
creep out of the disk

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.044
and snatch
the owner's soul away!

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.013
Ahh!

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:09.550

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.586
never to be seen again!

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.855

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.858
still alive but lifeless.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.575
Just one last thing.

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.744
Peeps are saying that
the curse only affects

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.946
duelists with talent,
so you know what, Yusaku?

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.515
You got nothing
to worry about.

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:45.218
But me? Chances are
I'll be the next victim!

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.855
Well then, you better sleep
far away from your Duel Disk.

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.192
I do, but, I'm hopin'
Playmaker shows up

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.927
and busts that ghoul ASAP

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.130
before it drags me away and
leaves me lyin' like a lump.

00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:58.198
Huh?

00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.900
Anyway, be careful!

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.470
In case you get mistaken
for a skilled duelist!

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:04.938
You too, Shima... I guess.

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:10.777
(Kolter)
Yusaku, I got an inside tip
on this security cam footage.

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.780
Check it out!

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.114
(Yusaka)
How exciting.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.115
It will be.

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:18.452
It shows the exact moment
someone gets deleted.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.621
<i>Really? This I gotta see!</i>

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.260
<i>Ugh, six more minutes?
Hit the fast forward!</i>

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:29.029
<i>Hit the fast forward!</i>

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:32.132
No, keep watching.
Why?

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:33.466
You'll see.

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:38.471
Is that an energy field?

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:44.411
<i>Whatever it is, it's no ghoul.</i>

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:47.147
<i>But it's definitely bad news.</i>

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.250
That Duel Disk
activated on its own.

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:53.587
So he must've been forcibly
logged into Link Vrains.

00:05:53.621 --> 00:05:56.823
And now he's one of The Deleted.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.664
Whoever's deleting
these people

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.833
isn't waiting around
for midnight anymore.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.168
He or she's speeding
up the timetable.

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:10.137
And that's filling up
the ICUs around the city

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.639
faster and faster, see?

00:06:12.672 --> 00:06:14.741
They're like
frozen in time.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.678
Not a single eye
flutter among them.

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.680
<i>It's like Blue Angel
all over again!</i>

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.680
That's right.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:27.888
If that's the case that
means there's a real
strong possibility

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:29.824
that the Knights
of Hanoi are the ones

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.726
behind all of this
late night madness.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.595
(Yusaku)
But for what purpose?

00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:37.698
And why these people?

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.500
That's the bigger question.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.568
Hmm...

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.237
<i>Uh, duh, because
the Hanoi are bad guys!</i>

00:06:43.304 --> 00:06:46.073
<i>Bad guys do bad stuff.
Don't overthink it.</i>

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.875
I just don't think
it's that simple, Ai.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.744
Perhaps we can
find a common thread

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.680
running through
all the Deleted.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.881
That way, we may
be able to anticipate

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.352
who the next victim will be
and get ahead of the Hanoi.

00:06:58.352 --> 00:07:01.388
<i>Is it that they all like
wearing blue pajamas?</i>

00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:03.623
(Yusaku)
I see three other commonalities.

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:07.094
One: Their duel rankings
are elite level.

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:10.431
Two: they utilized
older model Duel Disks.

00:07:10.464 --> 00:07:13.401
Three:
They're all well-known hackers.

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:16.570
All those details
sound mighty familiar.

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.439
<i>Yeah!
They're looking for Playmaker!</i>

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:22.476
To be more accurate they're
looking for what Playmaker has

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:24.611
and that's you, Ai.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.813
<i>It's so hard to be popular.</i>

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.248
Is it now?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.718
Well, there's no worry
about the Hanoi finding you

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:34.221
'cause I scrubbed you out
of every database out there.

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:36.056
But that's not
necessarily
a good thing.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.925
Because the Hanoi
don't know that,

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.260
so they're only
going to create

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:41.762
more and more Deleted
in the coming days.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:43.997
But we can turn that
to our advantage.

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.766
The more they expose themselves,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.103
the easier it'll be to find the
mastermind behind this scheme.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.237
However...

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.474
<i>So you're turning this
tragedy into a strategy?</i>

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.076
<i>You know what?
I gotta say, not bad.</i>

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.544
<i>Look at you,
using your brain</i>

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:59.112
<i>for the first time
in your life.</i>

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.781
<i>Don't pull a brain hammy!</i>

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.349
Don't touch me
with that elbow.

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:03.350
<i>How 'bout the
other elbow?</i>

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.185
Now behave, children.

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.055
Anyway, I fed my profile
algorithm the traits

00:08:08.122 --> 00:08:11.058
to see who's likely
to become the next victims.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:14.562
And at the top of the list,
one of your classmates, Yusaku.

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.197
<i>Mackendrick Kellenbocker.</i>

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.331
<i>Parents musta robbed
the consonant store.</i>

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.667
<i>Well, what are we waiting for?</i>

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.568
<i>Let's go check
his syllables out.</i>

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.704
(Kolter)
According to his school records,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.339
Mackendrick lives on the top
floor of that building.

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.041
But it doesn't say
which apartment.

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:45.158
Mackendrick? You okay?

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:47.294
<i>Hey! Look there!</i>

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.502
That's Mackendrick's avatar
somewhere inside of Link Vrains.

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.837
<i>And the other guy's
totally Hanoi!</i>

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.340
(Genome)
This is your last chance
to fess up, Playmaker.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.609
I'm running out of patience.

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:06.012
I already told you!
I'm not Playmaker!

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.851
I suppose next you'll
tell me you don't have

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.754
an Ignis stashed
inside your Duel Disk.

00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:15.956
I don't even know
what an Ignis is!

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:17.391
I believe you.

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.893
That is most unfortunate.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.895
For you, that is.

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:23.898
Because if you're
not the duelist
I'm looking for,

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:26.467
your existence
serves no purpose.

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:27.668
(cackling)

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:30.503
(cries out)

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:35.609
(Gore)
Mackendrick!

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.013
(AI)
<i>Well, crack my code!</i>

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.046
Wait, is that Gore?

00:09:50.458 --> 00:09:54.561
Mac K, naptime's over pal.

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.264
Come on, wake up!

00:09:57.298 --> 00:10:01.402
(Genome)
Are those tears
or is that the ocean?

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:04.938
Hard to tell since I'm staring
at a washed-up has-been hack.

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:06.673
Truth be told, I do
wish I had the pleasure

00:10:06.707 --> 00:10:09.843
of meeting The Gore,
when The Gore was actually
worth meeting.

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:12.546
Yeah, great.
Now what did you
do to my bud here?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.916
Infected him with
a lil' ol' virus, that's all.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.050
A virus?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.553
You better hand
over the antidote, pal!

00:10:19.553 --> 00:10:21.722
Oh, I'll gladly
give you the cure,

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:24.025
if you bring
me Playmaker.

00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.725
You want Playmaker?

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.061
(Genome)
Yes, I'm a big fan of his.

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.697
But I'm looking for more
than just an autograph.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:33.033
Bring him to me,
and we, the Hanoi,

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:34.701
will reward you
with this antidote.

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:36.703
Sounds tempting.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:39.673
If I was dumb enough to be
tricked by you slime balls!

00:10:39.707 --> 00:10:41.708
How unfortunate.

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.410
You've made another
bad decision.

00:10:43.444 --> 00:10:46.380
No wonder you've lost
so many duels recently.

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:50.383
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep quackin', you quack!

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:53.586
Doctor, actually.
Dr. Genome.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.289
Spread the word
among your friends.

00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:59.426
If you don't want any more
individuals to be deleted

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.330
get Playmaker to face me
voluntarily or not.

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:04.998
<i>You gotta give it to 'em.</i>

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:07.702
<i>The Hanoi are really
good at blackmail.</i>

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:10.604
Who knows who'll be
the next to be deleted?

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:14.141
Perhaps someone even more
near and dear to your heart.

00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:16.243
Not that I actually care.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:17.777
Happy hunting.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.114
(groaning)

00:11:21.148 --> 00:11:22.949
The Hanoi will pay.

00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:25.285
They're willing to ruin
everyone else's lives

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.254
just to capture me.

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.122
But they'll soon learn
that it's their lives

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.091
that are going to be ruined.

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:38.432
(Varis)
Once we execute our plan,

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:41.602
all records of the Lost Incident
will be erased.

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:44.271
(Kogami)
<i>Varis...</i>

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:46.673
<i>We've entered the final stages.</i>

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.776
How soon will we be ready
to launch the program?

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.947
<i>Anytime we desire.</i>

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.648
Ahh...

00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:57.150
<i>What's wrong?
Are you not pleased?</i>

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:59.286
Yes, but I require some time.

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:02.189
<i>Time?
Time for what?</i>

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.558
For unfinished business.

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:07.527
<i>Business?
Or Playmaker?</i>

00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:09.195
Tempest Terahertz!

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.969
Our last duel
will gnaw at me
until I defeat him!

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:17.171
<i>I see.</i>

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.006
<i>But we cannot
delay forever.</i>

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:21.508
I know.

00:12:29.817 --> 00:12:31.718
How's Mr. Kellenbocker?

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:33.921
He's still down
for the count.

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:35.022
I'm sorry,
but it's good

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:37.224
you called
the paramedics
so quickly.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.226
It wasn't me,
they were already

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.328
at his place
when I showed up.

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:42.929
I don't know
who rang 'em up,

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:45.265
but I'd sure love
to shake their hand.

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:48.835
You and Mr. Kellenbocker
have known each other
for a long time, correct?

00:12:48.868 --> 00:12:51.038
(Gore)
Since the orphanage days.

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.374
Me and Mac K, we were
like yin and yang.

00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:57.344
While I could handle
myself with the bullies,

00:12:57.344 --> 00:12:59.980
the kid wouldn't hurt a fly.

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:04.284
But they learned not to mess
with him on the quick if they
didn't wanna get Gored!

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:07.388
I still don't know how
he survived on the streets

00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.457
for so long
without gettin' jaded.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.460
He was always thankin' me
for savin' him,

00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:15.929
but it was the other way around.

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.832
'Cause he made those
hard days easier.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:22.736
Showin' me that life
wasn't all fists and trash.

00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:27.641
As if we'd one day fly out
of this mess to a better life.

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:30.744
And ya know, we did...

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:38.752
Until today.

00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:41.955
This is all my fault.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.425
How is it possible
that it's your fault?

00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:46.426
'Cause I taught him
how to duel.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.930
The Hanoi would've never gone
after him if he was no duelist.

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.832
With all due respect,
those my friend

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:54.501
are the thoughts
of a buffoon.
(groans)

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:55.735
Now, just for the record,

00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:57.971
I did say with
all due respect.

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:01.842
(Gore)
You care to clear that up
before you lose your job?

00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:04.144
Now, now,
easy does it.

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:06.613
Mackendrick derived great
pleasure from dueling,

00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:08.949
learning the strength
to stand up for himself.

00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:12.686
If there's anyone to blame,
it's the Hanoi, not you.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.188
So don't go beating
yourself up.

00:14:17.391 --> 00:14:18.725
Mac K!

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.231
Doc, is he gonna be okay?

00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:27.401
I wish I was able to provide
you with good news but...

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:31.271
Our tests have confirmed
he is one of The Deleted.

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.806
So you're sayin'

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:35.142
Mac K's never gonna
wake up again?

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.310
I didn't say that.

00:14:36.343 --> 00:14:39.513
The last thing you want
to do is to give up hope.

00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:40.714
If you'll excuse me.

00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.984
(groaning)

00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:46.053
There's nothing you can do.

00:14:46.119 --> 00:14:48.856
That's where
you and the MD's
are all wrong.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:50.557
Genome has the cure,

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:53.326
and I'm gonna
get it from him!

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.067
Hey, you!

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:03.571
I recognize those duds.

00:15:03.604 --> 00:15:06.540
You go to school with Mac K?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.409
That's right.
We share a few classes.

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:12.413
Well, thanks
for comin', uh...

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:15.515
Yusaku.
Yusaku Fujiki.

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:16.850
Be seein' ya.

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:24.224
You can't outrun the Hanoi.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.559
Hey Losers!

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.394
Watch out!
Ohh!...

00:15:29.863 --> 00:15:31.065
We gotta log out!

00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:33.367
Too late, kid!
Ahh!

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.035
(laughing)

00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:36.237
No!

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.238
(laughing)

00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:39.372
Ahh!

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:42.876
You're not goin' anywhere!
Till we've had our fun.

00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:47.914
Since when did
we lower our standards?

00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:50.517
These new recruits don't
deserve to be Hanoi.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.053
They've only joined our ranks
to prey on the weak.

00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:56.290
These boorish individuals know
nothing of our core beliefs.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:58.592
They're tarnishing the name
of the Knights of Hanoi,

00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:01.962
and these behaviors
of theirs are unacceptable.

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:05.332
Most true...
So it is upon ourselves

00:16:05.365 --> 00:16:06.766
to complete our mission.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.669
I agree, Faust.

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:12.439
I swear to you that we will find
Playmaker and his Ignis.

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:16.410
Not just find them
but we shall erase them
from existence, Varis.

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.846
Dr. Genome is already
making his move.

00:16:18.913 --> 00:16:22.315
And we provided him
with a special weapon.

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:27.921
Two hot dogs.
Bon appétit.

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.793
You going?
Yeah.

00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:34.961
Look there.
Huh?

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:37.664
<i>Go, Hack Worm!
Strike him down now!</i>

00:16:37.698 --> 00:16:39.933
The Knights of Hanoi
are on a rampage

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:41.935
all across Link Vrains.

00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:44.938
They claim that they're
only huntin' for Playmaker,

00:16:44.938 --> 00:16:47.941
but they're attacking every
duelist they run across

00:16:47.941 --> 00:16:50.610
and turning them
into The Deleted.

00:16:50.644 --> 00:16:52.112
All the more reason to go.

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:53.948
Or more reason not to.

00:16:53.948 --> 00:16:56.516
They're ganging up
two, three, ten to one.

00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:57.918
They have
you outnumbered.

00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:59.253
(AI)
<i>Kolter's right.</i>

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.888
<i>These guys aren't dueling fair.</i>

00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:02.856
Since when did that stop me?

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:05.859
<i>Well, never... But there's
always a first time.</i>

00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:08.028
<i>I can give my usual speech
about not putting</i>

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:10.730
<i>my life in danger,
but it won't work, will it?</i>

00:17:10.764 --> 00:17:11.865
Of course not.

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:13.400
(man)
There he is!
(woman)
It's him!

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.174
I knew you wouldn't
let us down, Playmaker!

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.844
Sweep those dirty dirtballs
out of Link Vrains!

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.012
Who is that?

00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:26.980
<i>I think I've seen
him before.</i>

00:17:27.014 --> 00:17:29.149
<i>Who can forget
a face that ugly?</i>

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:31.318
Don't make me delete you.

00:17:31.352 --> 00:17:34.355
I heard you punks were
out here lookin' for me.

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.257
Well, here I am!
Bring it!

00:17:37.324 --> 00:17:38.992
It's brought!

00:17:39.026 --> 00:17:41.028
Surround him!

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:42.363
(laughing)

00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:43.363
You're trapped!

00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:44.731
Nuh-uh, you're trapped!

00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:23.870
Don't you dare think
that you can hang us
out to dry, Playmaker!

00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:25.605
I can't hear you!

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:27.073
You're barking
up the wrong tree!

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.912
Playmaker's always so flash!

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:38.752
(Genome)
Very impressive, Playmaker.

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:44.825
If that's who you really are.

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:47.394
But something informs me
otherwise.

00:18:49.063 --> 00:18:52.833
That something being your DNA,
your dueling genome if you will.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.569
Every duelist possesses
their own unique style,

00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:58.738
uncopiable
by any other player around.

00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:00.407
So, no matter how hard you try,

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:03.810
your avatar can't disguise
who you really are.

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:06.279
What are your lips
flappin' about?

00:19:06.313 --> 00:19:09.784
You're not who you say
you are, Playmaker.

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:12.319
Or should I say, The Gore!

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:13.854
Oh, man, I thought it was him.
(all grumping)

00:19:13.887 --> 00:19:15.322
That's not Playmaker?

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:19.026
<i>I'm surprised Gore
could squeeze himself
into that jumpsuit.</i>

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:20.360
Ya got me!

00:19:20.393 --> 00:19:22.496
But since I tricked
ya into comin' here,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.666
it looks like
I'm the one who got you!

00:19:25.666 --> 00:19:29.136
(MC)
<i>Whoa! Either Playmaker has been
pumpin' iron or that really</i>

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:32.206
<i>is the one who rules the ring,
the mountain of muscle...</i>

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:33.307
<i>The Gore!</i>

00:19:33.307 --> 00:19:35.809
<i>The dueling world's beefiest
brawler is back!</i>

00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.845
Well, since you're not
the real Playmaker,

00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:41.215
you're just
wasting my time.
I'm leaving

00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.984
You sure? 'Cause I brought
you something you want.

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:45.386
Oh, really now.

00:19:45.452 --> 00:19:47.154
What could you have
that I'd want?

00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:49.356
I only want Playmaker.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.126
Yeah, I know.
So instead, I got you

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:55.195
the next best thing...
Playmaker's identity.

00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:57.131
<i>The Gore is dropping bombs!</i>

00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:01.168
<i>He claims to know the answer
to dueling's biggest mystery:
who is Playmaker?</i>

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.803
<i>And why pray tell should
I believe your claim?</i>

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:07.808
(Gore)
<i>Can you afford not to?</i>

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:10.477
I'm stakin' Playmaker's
real world ID

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:13.647
for Mac K's antidote.
Are you game, punk?

00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:17.151
How very delightful.
It's a deal.

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:18.352
Great!

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:21.488
(MC)
<i>Whoa!Dr. Genome
will face The Gore</i>

00:20:21.488 --> 00:20:23.624
<i>in a battle
of mind versus muscle!</i>

00:20:23.657 --> 00:20:27.061
<i>Just when it seemed
the shimmer of his celebrity
dueling days were fading,</i>

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:29.296
<i>Gore is back
to ignite his light!</i>

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:32.032
<i>How'd he figure out
your secret identity?</i>

00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.167
Don't know.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.668
You accidentally
drop some hints

00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:36.804
when you saw him
at the hospital?

00:20:36.837 --> 00:20:38.371
Maybe.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.310
You will fail
to win this duel, Gore.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.213
For I wield Hanoi's
newest weapon!

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.815
(cackling)

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:50.016
I unleash the Data Gale!

00:21:05.699 --> 00:21:07.534
(laughing)

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.373
Data Gale?

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:24.885
♪♪♪
