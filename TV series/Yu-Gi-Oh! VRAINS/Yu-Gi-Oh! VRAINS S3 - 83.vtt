WEBVTT

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:12.146
(Frog)
Lights,

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:12.980
camera...

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.148
Take ten!

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.149
Let's hope
this one's the keeper!

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.484
Hey, yoooo!

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.518
It's ya boy,

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.086
the one who put the fab in dab,

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.189
your host, the Brave Battler!

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.291
Here with another
flash episode of

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.326
"LINK VRAINS,
The Road to Glory!"

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.295
Where I travel
throughout LINK VRAINS

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.664
and reveal all
the hidden secrets and tricks

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.033
of becoming
a champion like me!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.368
(laughing)

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:35.635
Secrets are everywhere.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.437
(laughs)

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:37.304
Huh?

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:38.338
Like there!

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:39.974
Look here!

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:41.642
It's a garbage can!

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.243
Now,

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.579
it may look like an ordinary
garbage can on the outside,

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.780
but in LINK VRAINS,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.116
what you see
isn't always what it seems.

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.485
It can be a secret entrance
to a hidden lair

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:52.586
or a rare card shop,

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.154
or in this case,
it can be

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:55.990
an ordinary garbage can!

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.191
With a bag of garba--
(beeps)

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.728
This video is garbage.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.230
Total garbage.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.699
You're not actually
thinking of airing this, are
you?

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.401
What choice do I have?

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.236
We haven't seen
Playmaker in weeks,

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.670
and we gotta air something.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.039
But, boss,

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.674
we'd probably get higher
ratings showing a squirrel

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:15.709
dining on a piece
of cheese than him.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:16.510
Ya think I

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.412
'm not upset too?

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.347
The Brave Battler tricked us

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.816
but mostly you into
giving him his own show!

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.384
"Since I'm Playmaker's
best friend,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.586
"I can give ya total access
to Playmaker.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.088
Ain't that flash dab de dab?"

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.222
(laughing)

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:31.925
But all he did was give us

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.928
access to the lowest ratings
in history!

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.563
Then I don't get it.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:38.932
Why do ya keep putting
the Battler back on the air?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.434
Why don't you just fire him?

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.768
It's not like
you owe him anything

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.138
so why not just
cut our losses, move on

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.339
and then we can start
fresh tomorrow, boss.

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:47.575
I wish I could but I signed him

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:49.343
to an exclusive contract.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.211
So?

00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.312
It was for fifteen years.

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.346
Fifteen years!

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.048
Remember that exclusive footage

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.985
we had of Playmaker
vs. the Knights of Hanoi?

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:01.055
That clip was viewed
six hundred million times!

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:02.789
But our latest episode?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.158
Only a thousand!

00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:06.660
Well, a thousand views
isn't that bad.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.329
Yeah it is,
if you check the logs.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.665
One view was by me to make sure
the clip was up,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:12.900
another was by you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.434
cuz you wanted to make sure
the clip was up.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.971
And the remaining 998 times

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.206
was by the Brave Battler!

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.808
(screaming)

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.743
So we're the only ones
who watched it?

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.044
(panting)

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.081
So basically we're doing
journalism for no one!

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.449
If we don't get some
clicks and get 'em soon,

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.619
we're gonna have to turn off
the lights in this place.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:33.754
(grunts)

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.890
And there sure are a lot
of lights in here.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.124
I bet it's gonna
take you forever

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:39.126
to screw out
all the light bulbs.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.961
What? Me?

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.830
Yeah, cuz I can't do it.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.800
I have wings,
not opposable thumbs like you.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.435
Well you know what?!
I oppose that idea!

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:50.604
Because we're not
going out of business!

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:51.939
Oh yeah?

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.741
Let's get back to doing
what we do best,

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.976
and that's finding
Playmaker on our own!

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.410
So go out into LINK VRAINS

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.947
and find him,
even if takes you all night!

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:02.015
(screaming)
You're crushing my feathers!

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.016
(both screaming)

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.628
(electronic whirring)

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.542
(electronic whirring)

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.913
(Hayami)
Umm, Mr. Zaizen,

00:04:05.913 --> 00:04:07.247
shouldn't you get
the Queen's permission

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.582
before changing
the security protocols?

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:11.952
And deal with
all that red tape?

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.520
Not when LINK VRAINS' systems

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.921
can be attacked at any moment.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.589
(Hayami)

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.591
Attacked? By who?

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.694
The situation with the Ignis
has evolved and unfortunately,

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.963
I cannot say
it's for the better.

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.532
The Ignis declared war
on humanity?

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:26.767
(Ai)
Not all of us...

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.901
but more than one.

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:28.569
So yeah.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.169
That

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.404
's not good.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.273
Like you, I hoped humans
and Ignis would come together.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.075
An all-out war between us

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:37.845
is the last thing
I wanted to see happen.

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:40.714
We'll do everything
we can to stop Lightning.

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:41.916
In the meantime,

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:44.518
I suggest you
beef up security in LINK VRAINS.

00:04:44.518 --> 00:04:45.719
If the Ignis attack,

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.587
the destruction could be
even worse

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.256
than what
the Knights of Hanoi did.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.759
The Knights of Hanoi destroyed

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.727
everything in LINK VRAINS.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.695
Could the Ignis
be worse than that?

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.298
Beats me.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.301
(Kolter)
Ghost Gal sent us footage
of Earth's final moments.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:04.971
I'm warnin' ya, it's not pretty.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.110
What's going on?

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.246
Let's get to work, shall we?

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:13.813
(electronic whirring)

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.018
What's that?

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.299
This is awkward.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.474
It's more horrible
than I imagined.

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:43.677
Afterwards, SOL
Technologies put Earth's data

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.312
into Gore's brain.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.447
And messed him up too.

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:48.915
Yes.

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:51.852
Destroying two lives
in the process.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.120
(Ai)
I'm not gonna say I'm angry...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.689
cuz I'm furious!

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.492
They think it's fine
to treat us like this?

00:05:58.492 --> 00:05:59.860
(Yusaku)
No. It's not fine.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.061
Huh?

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.263
It's not fine to hurt anyone...

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.198
and it still isn't.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:06.867
Yusaku...

00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:15.742
(Theodore)
You okay, Yusaku?
(gasps)

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.512
You forgot this.

00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:20.714
(sighs)

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.718
I never heard you yell before...

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.253
well, your version of yelling.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:26.887
I think your volume went up

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:30.224
by like one Yusaku.

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:31.525
But I totally get it,

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:34.227
losing your friends
and allies isn't easy.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.731
I don't know how I'll deal
if I ever lose Flame.

00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:37.398
And I know you feel

00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:39.700
the same way about Ai.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.068
Now before you answer,

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:43.237
it's ok to not answer too.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.204
Good.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:45.839
I'll take your silence as a yes.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.840
You'll miss me.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.508
I'll miss ya too, buddy.

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:51.511
But even if we wanna hang out
together forever,

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:53.880
not everyone ends up that lucky.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.982
When I gobbled up
some of Gore's data,

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.718
I also got
some of Earth's memories.

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:01.221
The Cyberse is splitting in two.

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.723
There are those who believe

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.125
that we can coexist
with the humans.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.094
And there are others who don't.

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:09.729
Yes.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.466
And I don't know
if we can remain neutral.

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.534
The time is coming
when we must decide

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:15.869
which side to join,

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:18.439
the humans or the Ignis.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.607
And that time is soon.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.643
Go to their world and see what
the humans are really like

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.979
before you make your decision.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:25.813
Because what you choose
wo

00:07:25.813 --> 00:07:28.415
n't only affect you,

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:30.317
but the future of us all.

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:32.653
I've hacked my brain

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.289
so that I can calculate
moves faster and better

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.324
than any human or Ignis.

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:40.460
Your defeat is only
a matter of time.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.729
This human...

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.898
has no qualms
about hurting me...

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.333
or Aqua.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.901
It's my turn!

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:50.204
It's hard to make peace

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.272
when we're already
at each other's throats.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:53.607
Yeah...

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:55.775
But on the bright side,
we can't make peace

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.978
unless we are fighting, right?

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.514
You do know how silly
that sounds, don't you?

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:01.948
Yes, I do!

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.818
Well, Ai, as much as
I hate to admit it,

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.521
it's turning out
just as Varis predicted.

00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.691
That war between the Ignis
and the humans was inevitable.

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.192
It's not just Varis,

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:14.361
Lightning thought
the same thing.

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:17.297
Humans want to destroy us,

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:20.367
so we want to destroy
the humans.

00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:22.002
It's nice and clean.

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.804
What other
possible solution is there?

00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:24.471
How about not fighting

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:26.273
each other at all!

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:28.509
Ya know, trying to live
together in peace?

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:29.944
Like me and Playmaker.

00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:31.544
Sure we got our ups
and downs...

00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.479
mostly downs.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.614
But it's working out...

00:08:33.614 --> 00:08:34.481
mostly.

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.184
You mean coexistence.

00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.686
While that sounds plausible,
it's impossible.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:40.487
Even your coexistence

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.791
with Playmaker will not last.

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:44.625
Well...

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:46.059
that doesn|t sound good.

00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:47.894
Understatement.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:51.298
And then Varis showed up
and threw oil on the fire.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:55.803
Varis!

00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:57.971
Are you here to help us?

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:59.106
Of course not.

00:08:59.106 --> 00:08:59.606
You see I only came here

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:02.108
to do one thing.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:04.244
And that's to destroy the Ignis.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:06.113
Quite the introduction.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:08.916
Then allow me to
introduce myself in return.

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.584
Watch yourself, Varis!

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:18.191
(electronic whirring)

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.894
Hmm, seems he was ready
for your lightning, Lightning.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.096
Didn't even faze
or daze him at all.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:25.366
Unlike some other fool
that I know...

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:26.767
I came here prepared

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:29.403
knowing that you'd try
something underhanded.

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:30.104
Huh?

00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:31.772
Is he talking about me?

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.240
Who else could it be?

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:35.575
I'm surprised you made it here.

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:36.843
You shouldn't be,

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:39.246
the Hanoi have eyes
all over the network.

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:40.580
You can hide from us,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.716
but you can't hide
from us forever.

00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:44.084
No, no, no, no,

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.052
I meant that you made it here
past my security detail.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.621
Since I had Echo standing guard

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.223
to ward off all intruders.

00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:50.057
Your so-called securit

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.092
y's
not good enough

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.794
to guard an empty piggy bank.

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:56.129
My team's mopping them up
as we speak.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.231
Isn't it crazy...

00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.468
that more folks
want to fight than not?

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.937
Actually, it isn't that crazy.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.339
As AIs evolve,

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:08.175
humans fear that
they will take over our lives.

00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:11.011
And the AIs fear
that we will destroy them...

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:13.613
in order to prevent
that reality from happening.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.582
And when we're scared and angry,

00:10:15.582 --> 00:10:17.718
we don't always make
the right decisions.

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:19.353
Believe me, I know.

00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:20.187
Huh?

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:21.622
(Yusaku)
After the Lost Incident,

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:22.857
the only thing I desired

00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.258
was revenge
for those who wronged me.

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:26.059
And in the end,

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:26.727
all of the hate

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:28.429
that I was filled with

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:29.930
added up to nothing.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.565
And it cost me years
of my life

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:33.133
which I can never get back.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:36.002
Well, I don't intend
on wastin' years or days

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.404
or even seconds!

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:40.374
Cuz remember what you said
when you were about to face off

00:10:40.374 --> 00:10:41.608
against Bohman...

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.577
Listen, Bohman.

00:10:43.577 --> 00:10:45.746
The peace you're talking about,
isn't really peace at all.

00:10:45.746 --> 00:10:47.347
Because you want
to force it on us

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.016
instead of letting us choose.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.751
I view things
differently than you.

00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.252
I believe we
can co-exist in peace

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:54.955
because we want
to co-exist in peace.

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:56.957
Not by force but by choice.

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.427
What you speak of is impossible.

00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:00.527
(Playmaker)
No.

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.162
The impossible is just
the possible

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.997
that has yet to be done.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.499
(Flame)
I'm impressed, Ai.

00:11:05.499 --> 00:11:08.802
You actually remembered
something worth remembering.

00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:10.837
Yeah, so keep them
challenges coming!

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.273
And the harder they are
the better they are!

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:14.808
Sure.

00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:16.911
I appreciate
the enthusiasm, Theodore

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:17.945
but wouldn't we prefer it

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:20.013
if the challenges
weren't so hard?

00:11:20.013 --> 00:11:21.348
Oh, yeah, you're right!

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.315
(laughs)

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:23.650
(laughs)

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:25.586
It's fine.

00:11:25.586 --> 00:11:27.955
Whether things
are easy or hard...

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:29.957
our sole objective
is to bring this war

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.158
to a quick conclusion.

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:31.692
That

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.160
's right!

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.128
(Yusaku)
And then me and you
will go our separate ways, Ai.

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:36.763
Huh? Come again?

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.865
I said that
when the war is finally over,

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.634
we will go our separate ways.

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:41.768
No, I heard you,

00:11:41.768 --> 00:11:43.470
but I don't think
I heard you correctly.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.739
It's something that's been
weighing on my mind

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:46.807
for quite some time.

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:48.141
If you stay with me,

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:51.145
then other people will
always try to hunt you down.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:53.480
You'll never have
a single moment of peace.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.082
But if you rebuild your Cyberse

00:11:55.082 --> 00:11:57.484
somewhere
where humans can't reach,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.319
somewhere far from LINK VRAINS

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:01.655
in the infinite of
the digital network...

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.024
some place even I don't know,

00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:03.757
so I can't reveal it

00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:05.191
to anyone...

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.261
then you, Flame

00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:09.730
and the other Ignis
will be safe.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:10.897
But doesn't that mean

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.166
we'll never see
each other again?

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.302
I never said you can't visit.

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:16.904
As long as your visits
are occasional

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:18.539
and not all the time.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:19.639
Oh-oh.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.208
He's doing
the mouth thing again.

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:22.742
Still freaks me out.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.545
Sounds like a plan.

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:25.312
Hmm?

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:26.380
But all this going away talk

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.015
is making me kinda misty.

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.551
I haven't gone away yet,
you know.

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.853
Yeah, I know that, Flame.

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:35.256
And I know that someday,
people will grow up

00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:38.225
and learn that humans
and AIs can coexist.

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:40.894
It's just sad that
that day isn't today.

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:42.229
So until that day comes,

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:42.830
the only thing I
care about is that yo

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.565
u're safe.

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:47.868
And I'll do anything
to keep you safe...

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:50.170
even if that means
you have to go away.

00:12:50.704 --> 00:12:51.671
Cuz I know...

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.874
that even if we're apart,

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.343
we'll always be friends
to the end.

00:12:56.676 --> 00:12:58.812
Yes. Friends forever.

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:01.948
Wow, that was some sunshine

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.084
wrapped up
in a storm cloud tortilla.

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:05.953
Yes, Ai,

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:07.954
our future is comprised
of many unknowns

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:09.756
which can darken its outlook...

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:11.791
But to ensure that
a future exists,

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.593
we must never stop
believing in it.

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.465
(grunting)

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:19.633
Elbows loose.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.635
I'm ready to get things rolling.

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:24.771
But, where's my camera crew at?

00:13:26.607 --> 00:13:29.109
When did we become "his"
camera crew?

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:31.445
Once I saw that
your bank account

00:13:31.445 --> 00:13:32.546
was unaccounted for.

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.213
(gasps)

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.481
What's up?

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.115
What's up

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.984
is right up there, boss!

00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:37.584
Huh?

00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:41.388
(gasping)

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.457
Cha-ching! It's Playmaker!

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:44.959
After them! ASAP!

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:45.993
(laughing)

00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:47.895
Wait, but what about
Brave Battler?

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:48.929
(Frog)
Brave who?

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.831
C'mon! Get your rumproastin'!

00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:51.798
Coming!

00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.903
(Pigeon panting)

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:57.771
They're too fast, boss!

00:13:57.771 --> 00:13:59.406
Can't catch up.

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:00.740
(groans)

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.643
Seems like they've upgraded
their Duel boosters

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:04.978
but I got upgrades too!

00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:05.645
What?

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:06.313
(laughs)

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:09.015
(grunts)

00:14:10.217 --> 00:14:11.318
(screaming)

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:16.189
(laughing maniacally)

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.857
Nice, boss!

00:14:16.857 --> 00:14:18.559
This is super fast!

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.893
And it only cost us

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.229
your next month's
paycheck to purchase!

00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:24.031
But I couldn't afford
the brakes.

00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:24.898
Say what?

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.000
(Pigeon screaming)

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:32.506
Hey, you two.

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:35.042
Why did you call us here?

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.309
(all)
Huh?
(distant screaming)

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.049
Who was that?

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.451
When Lightning says
he's smarter than humans,

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.887
he may actually have a case.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:49.389
So what's up, Playmaker?

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:51.024
Varis sent me a message saying

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.693
he wants to meet with us here.

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:53.894
(gasping)

00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:54.661
Varis?

00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:56.229
For real?

00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.198
That's right.

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:01.067
(gasps)

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:03.336
(Yusaku)
Is that a card?

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:06.506
No, it's too thick to be one.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.274
(gasps)

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.345
(Ghost Ghal)
He wants to meet us for what?

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:13.848
He didn't share any information.

00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:15.850
Maybe he's holding
a family game night.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.384
Can't play charades solo.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.720
But how exactly was
Varis able to find you

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.921
in the real world?

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:23.523
Because he knows
Playmaker's secret identity.

00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:24.625
Crazy, right?

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:25.425
(gasps)

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:26.427
What?

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:28.762
You thought you were
the only one who knew?

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:29.763
What? No way!

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.932
Settle down, Soulburner.

00:15:31.932 --> 00:15:33.533
It's not that surprising.

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.402
Since the Hanoi
were deeply involved

00:15:35.402 --> 00:15:36.670
in the Lost Incident,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.039
it's only natural
that he knows the identities

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:41.275
of all the unfortunate victims.

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.242
Yeah,

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:43.610
I guess you're right.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.911
(Ai)
But on the flip side,

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:47.081
Playmaker and I know
Varis's identity,

00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.883
so like the numbers
4, and 9 and 16,

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:51.285
we're all square!

00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:52.419
(gasping)

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.253
Well?

00:15:53.253 --> 00:15:54.755
Come on, tell us, who is he?

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.123
Whoa, whoa,

00:15:56.123 --> 00:15:57.791
you can ask him
who he is directly

00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:58.692
when we meet him.

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:00.427
But should we?

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:02.763
He's made it clear that he wants
to destroy all the Ignis.

00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:04.031
Including us.

00:16:04.031 --> 00:16:05.465
Yeah, true.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:08.135
But I know this is gonna
sound really, really weird,

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:10.237
and it's gonna be really,
really, really weirder

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:11.638
for me to say,

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.573
but we couldn't have gotten
this far without his help.

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:15.409
Varis?!

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.910
(Ai)
What are you
doing here?

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:18.779
And when are you leaving?

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:19.312
I saw that you let

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.615
Bohman escape.

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:23.984
We didn't "let" him
do anything.

00:16:23.984 --> 00:16:25.519
If history is any indicator,

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:28.021
Bohman is sure to come back
stronger than before.

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:30.090
So you need to be prepared.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:31.625
Whoa!

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:33.760
And what is this?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.162
(Roken)
Just a little something.

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:36.596
Consider it a gift.

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:38.432
Looks like some kinda program.

00:16:38.432 --> 00:16:40.534
It'll protect you
from the Ignis' attacks

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:41.635
in the real world,

00:16:41.635 --> 00:16:42.837
so you don't end up
mind controlled

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:44.405
like your friend Jin.

00:16:44.405 --> 00:16:45.972
Just load it
into your Duel Disk.

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:46.774
Ha! Like w

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:48.609
e'd ever trust you!

00:16:48.609 --> 00:16:50.510
No way we're
running this program.

00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:52.112
Huh?!

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.148
(moaning)

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:56.817
Exhilarating.

00:16:56.817 --> 00:16:57.184
(Yusaku)

00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:57.918
Well?

00:16:57.918 --> 00:16:59.119
It's the real deal!

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.055
Well, then, see you around.

00:17:04.057 --> 00:17:06.693
Wait, why are you helping us?

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:08.495
You're like our super villain.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.399
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:14.268
Well, at least for now.

00:17:14.268 --> 00:17:15.802
So he's both our ally

00:17:15.802 --> 00:17:17.872
and our enemy.

00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:19.540
Yes, but the question is,

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.875
which one is he currently?

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:23.310
An ally? Or an enemy?

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.212
Who knows.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.381
What do you think?

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.683
I don't think it hurts
to meet Varis.

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:32.552
And if he gets out of line,
let's put him in his place.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.055
What do you think, Soulburner?

00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:34.588
Whatever you decide,

00:17:34.588 --> 00:17:36.756
I will follow.

00:17:38.726 --> 00:17:39.860
All right.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.996
It looks like we caught up
to Playmaker.

00:17:42.096 --> 00:17:43.197
Caught up?

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:44.764
We almost got blown up!

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:47.568
By buying that rocket,
we almost bought the farm!

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:48.235
You're lucky that I was able

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.738
to unstrap myself in time

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:52.506
or we'd be singing
our swan song.

00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:54.541
Shush! Stop squawking!

00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.677
Don't ya see
we hit the jackpot?

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:59.046
Cuz it ain't just
Playmaker goin' solo.

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:02.116
Ghost Gal and some
turquoise lady's here too!

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:04.918
I know an exclusive scoop
when I see one!

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.653
So, get your camera rollin'!

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:07.988
Aye, aye!

00:18:07.988 --> 00:18:09.890
(Ai)
Where is Varis anyway?

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:11.958
(gasps)

00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:23.604
What's this?

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:26.806
We're trapped inside
some form of barrier.

00:18:27.374 --> 00:18:27.941
(gasping)

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:32.946
Good. You're all here.

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:34.381
It's Varis.

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:37.817
What's the big idea
locking us up?

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.620
No need to worry.

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:42.156
This barrier's
to prevent outsiders

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:44.257
from snooping in
on our conversation.

00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:45.826
Or so you say.

00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:46.993
He's telling the truth.

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:47.594
My scans say that all signals

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:51.465
are being blocked.

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.300
I wish we could hear
what they were talking about.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.268
(grunts)

00:18:54.268 --> 00:18:56.136
If we only had a better mic!

00:18:56.904 --> 00:18:57.938
Varis,

00:18:57.938 --> 00:19:01.108
why did you reach out
and call us here?

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:03.477
I called you here
for a simple reason.

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:05.812
I request your assistance.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:07.614
(Ghost Gal)
Hold on a sec.

00:19:07.614 --> 00:19:10.017
The Varis is asking us for help?

00:19:10.017 --> 00:19:11.385
Why would that surprise you?

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:11.952
Though we are

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:13.687
on opposite sides,

00:19:13.687 --> 00:19:15.188
we do have the same goal,

00:19:15.188 --> 00:19:17.625
which is to defeat
the Light Ignis.

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:21.395
Therefore our interests
are quite aligned.

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:22.796
So if you help me,

00:19:22.796 --> 00:19:24.565
you're helping
yourselves as well.

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:26.066
Is he telling the truth?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.401
Yes.

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:28.869
He's not trying to trick us.

00:19:29.603 --> 00:19:30.704
I don't buy it.

00:19:30.704 --> 00:19:33.173
Cuz the Hanoi I know
never ask for help.

00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.941
And I mean never.

00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:37.811
That's where you're wrong,
Ghost Gal, very wrong.

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:39.813
Why just the other day
I tried to get

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:41.715
The Shepherd to join my side.

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:43.183
You asked my brother?

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.953
(Varis)
Though he didn't
accept my invitation,

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.387
I did give him a clue

00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:49.723
as to how to defeat the Ignis.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:52.893
From one hunter to another,

00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:56.630
allow me to give you some
professional dueling advice.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.665
Unless you up your
dueling skills,

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:00.700
you'll never defeat an Ignis.

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:04.438
Especially since they have
a powerful new card

00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:06.139
known as a Link Spell.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.342
A Link Spell?

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:11.312
It's a spell card that has
Link Arrows of its own,

00:20:11.312 --> 00:20:13.980
opening up whole new
dueling strategies.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.682
So unless your game is prepared

00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:17.851
to deal with a card
like that, Shepherd,

00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:20.320
you have no chance of winning.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.022
But even with that knowledge,

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:24.624
the Light Ignis proved
too much for him.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.795
Good bye, my friend.

00:20:28.795 --> 00:20:30.497
LEGATUS LEGIONIS,

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.699
attack FORTRESSDRONE BEEHIVE

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:34.701
and end this duel!

00:20:38.172 --> 00:20:39.873
(grunts)
(blasting)

00:20:41.609 --> 00:20:42.842
(grunting)

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:47.514
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:50.017
The Shepherd dueled
close to perfection,

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:53.053
and he still lost
against the Light Ignis.

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:56.190
So you want to know
why I'm asking for your help?

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.025
Because if the times
are changing,

00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.594
then I have to change
with the times.

00:21:00.594 --> 00:21:01.194
And le

00:21:01.194 --> 00:21:02.029
t's be honest,

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:04.632
you need my help as well.

00:21:04.632 --> 00:21:06.433
So long story short,

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.035
the big bad Varis is scared

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:10.203
of the teeny tiny Lightning!

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:12.039
You can believe
whatever you want

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.607
because what an Ignis thinks

00:21:13.607 --> 00:21:15.575
is no concern of mine.

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:18.044
(Soulburner)
I'll never team up
with you, Varis!

00:21:19.713 --> 00:21:23.283
After everything
you did to ruin my life?

00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:25.418
(Grandfather)
When you went missing,

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:28.222
your parents went out
to search for you...

00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:30.023
but they never returned.

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:31.959
They've gone missing.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.428
I'm so sorry, Theodore.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:36.296
We've searched and searched,

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.531
but we were unable to find them.

00:21:41.302 --> 00:21:43.070
If it wasn't for your
Lost Incident,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.572
my parents would still be
a part of my life!

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:48.008
Yes, I know.

00:21:48.008 --> 00:21:49.710
(Soulburner)
No, you don't know a thing!

00:21:50.177 --> 00:21:51.612
But I do know this,

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:53.714
now that we're face to face,

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.182
I'm gonna defeat you
in a duel!

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.051
Soulburner...

00:21:58.051 --> 00:21:59.352
(Soulburner)
Sorry, everyone,

00:21:59.352 --> 00:22:00.988
but this is one of those times

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.157
when I gotta do
what I gotta do!

00:22:03.157 --> 00:22:05.659
Or my soul will never
be at rest.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.627
I'm about to take you down!

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.298
Very well.

00:22:11.298 --> 00:22:12.365
Let's duel...

00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:14.634
Soulburner.

00:22:45.466 --> 00:22:46.466
(electronic whirring)
