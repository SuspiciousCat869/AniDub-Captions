WEBVTT

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:08.909
(Blue Girl)
Akira's counting on me

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:12.312
to bring back an ignis
and I won't let him down,

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.784
and I won't let myself down
by not giving it my all.

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:19.753
Alright, Soulburner,
just because you two

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.923
are buds with Playmaker doesn't
mean I'll go easy on you.

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.492
(Soulburner)
Yeah, we never
expected you would

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.193
but thanks for the
warning anyway.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.965
Blue Girl is looking
tough and I like it.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.034
(Blue girl)
I rebuilt my deck from scratch

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.435
to plug up the
holes in my strategy

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.805
and now is the time
to put it to the test.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.006
You ready to duel Soulburner?

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.942
(Flame)
According to
my dueling logs,

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:44.611
Blue Girl uses combos
to slowly whittle

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.480
her opponents life points
all the way down to zero.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.184
I heard, so then
we'd better not let

00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.318
her do that
to us, Flame.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:52.352
(Flame)
Agreed.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.254
We've gotta be sure
to set up our counter strategies

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.090
before she can
start her combo,

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.925
meaning we need to be the
ones to go first in this duel.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.398
Blue Girl, how about
whoever goes underneath

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.402
that arch first gets to
go first in our duel,

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.503
we got a deal?

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:10.670
Yeah, deal.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:35.395
I win.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.767
So I get to go first.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.338
(Flame)
Oh byte, that's the
last thing we wanted.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.236
(Both)
It's time to speed duel.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.275
Here I go, I'll
start by activating

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:56.543
my spell, Trickstar Vision.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.446
It lets me summon
Trickstar Lilybell.

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:02.850
(Aqua)
In addition, both players
draw one card

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.019
but Lilybell's attack
point are cut in half

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.121
and she loses her
special abilities.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.789
(Blue girl)
You know, I never realized
you were such a downer.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.825
You get to draw as well.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.293
Okay.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:18.132
Next, I can summon
Trickstar Lycoris

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.901
by returning a Trickstar
on my field to my hand.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.337
Come on back,
Trickstar Lilybell.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.775
But she won't be gone for long.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:30.477
Her special ability
automatically resummons

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.511
her to the field.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.183
And I'll now use her
to build my circus.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:42.622
I set Trickstar Lilybell and
Lycoris in the Link Arrow,

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:47.727
I link summon link-2
Trickstar Divaridis.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.833
When I summon Divaridis,

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.102
her special ability deals
you 200 points of damage.

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:04.044
I know 200 wasn't much

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.246
but trust that it'll
sting a mighty ton

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.615
when I get the
damage snowballing.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:11.552
I activate my field spell,
Trickstar Live Stage,

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.588
to return a Trickstar in
my graveyard to my hand,

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:16.423
like my Trickstar Lycoris,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.362
and Trickstar Live Stage
has another effect.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.966
When I have a Trickstar
Link monster on my field,

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.369
I'm allowed to summon
a Trickstar Token next

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:29.870
to her Link Arrow,

00:04:32.706 --> 00:04:34.207
and I'm tributing this token

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.678
to summon a brand new Trickstar.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.546
Trickstar Birdhelm,

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:42.449
and whenever I'm able

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.184
to successfully summon her,

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:47.354
her special ability deals
you 200 points of damage.

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:51.625
Plus I get
to draw a card.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.129
Unfortunately, my
Birdhelm can't attack

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.731
when she uses this ability.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:00.033
(Flame)
How is it unfortunate
when you're not allowed

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.236
to attack on the
first turn anyway?

00:05:02.236 --> 00:05:03.971
Hello, because I
was kidding but here's

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.274
what's not unfortunate.
I can resummon Lycoris again

00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.743
by returning
Birdhelm to my hand.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:14.081
This is great, she's
comboing her combos

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.483
just like I was afraid of.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.018
Now I activate
Birdhelm's special ability.

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:22.456
She transforms
into an equip card

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.659
and I equip her onto
Trickstar Divaridis.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.431
It's your turn,
show me what you got.

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.236
Be careful what you
wish for, Blue Gal.

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:36.504
Why?

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.072
You're not in control of this
duel and you never will be,

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.741
not even when it's
your turn, Soulburner.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.913
You're not in control of this
duel and you never will be,

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.582
not even when it's
your turn, Soulburner.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.518
Whenever you add a
card to your hand,

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.087
Lycoris deals you
200 points of damage.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.594
I'm taking all
this damage just

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.529
because I couldn't
go first.

00:06:02.563 --> 00:06:04.197
(Flame)
Perhaps Soulburner
should've invested

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:06.667
in afterburners
for his duel board.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.804
See, just as you did
your research on me,

00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.404
I studied up on you.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.407
Such as, your
skill Burning Draw,

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.141
which lets you draw
cards by lowering

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:17.044
your life points to a hundred.

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:18.312
But if I draw a card,

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:21.081
your Lycoris will
deal me 200 damage.

00:06:21.148 --> 00:06:22.816
Yep, that's correct.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.820
(Flame)
So if we use our skill,
we will immediately lose.

00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:28.422
That is a clever way
to limit our options.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.691
But there's still
plenty that we can do.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.326
By sending Salamangreat
Falco to the graveyard,

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.428
I can summon Salamangreat Meer.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.434
Yeah, but maybe
you shouldn't have

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.802
because you triggered
Divaridis' ability.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.138
Each time you summon a monster,

00:06:44.138 --> 00:06:46.339
she dishes out 200
points of damage.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:51.645
(Soulburner)
Each hit hurts barely
more than a papercut

00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:53.814
but she keeps
slicing and slicing.

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.849
I gotta destroy her
Trickstar Divaridis

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:59.419
before the damage stacks
up and get outta control.

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:02.889
I activate Salamangreat
Falco's special ability.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:05.959
I can now revive my Falco
by returning a Salamangreat

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:08.729
on my field straight
back to my hand.

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.831
So my Meer burrows back to make
way to make way for the sky.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.604
That one move of
yours triggered two

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.773
of my monster's
special abilities.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:23.210
Lycoris and Divaridis
deal you 200 damage each.

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.446
Well check this
next move out,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.715
if I add my Salamangreat
Meer to my hand

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:29.883
without having
to draw it,

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:31.251
I'm allowed
to resummon it.

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:35.890
You sure talked
a whole lot

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:38.492
but all I heard
was 200 damage.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.895
Yeah, yeah, yeah, next I
summon Salamangreat Wolvie.

00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:47.401
And by summoning that,
my Divaridis deals

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:48.535
you damage again.

00:07:50.604 --> 00:07:53.373
(Blue girl)
There's only one reason
to do that.

00:07:53.373 --> 00:07:54.407
To link summon.

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:57.377
(Flame)
Go Soulburner.

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:00.213
Yeah, I blaze the
circuit that scorches

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.782
the path to the future.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.451
The summoning conditions require

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.620
at least two
fire-effect monsters.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.955
So I set all three in
of my Salamangreats

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:10.624
in the Link Arrows.

00:08:13.127 --> 00:08:17.564
I link summon Link-3
Salamangreat Heatleo.

00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:26.774
Big cat but your kitty
just dragged 200 more points

00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:28.842
of damage right into
your living room.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.546
But now that I have
Heatleo, I can--

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.882
Stop right there!

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:36.717
I know you went through
all that trouble

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:39.820
so you could use
Heatleo's ability but no.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:40.854
You knew?

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:41.788
Yep.

00:08:41.822 --> 00:08:43.290
Your Heatleo can usually destroy

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.792
my spell or trap card, right?

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.893
But when Divaridis is
equipped with Birdhelm

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.162
that ability gets shut down.

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:52.166
(Flame)
She truly has prepared
for all our tactics.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.434
Yeah, but guess who
did their homework too.

00:08:56.436 --> 00:09:00.774
Heatleo, pounce and destroy
her Trickstar Divaridis.

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.542
Every deck has their strengths

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.211
but they also have
their weaknesses

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:05.613
and I found yours.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:07.380
While your deck
has great combos,

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:10.017
it doesn't have monsters
with a lot of attack points.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:13.353
So I can run you over
with sheer power.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.588
You're right.

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.523
Well, you would've
been a few weeks ago,

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:19.560
but you see I've been fixing

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.795
the holes in my
game, Soulburner.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.897
By sending Trickstar
Calobane to the graveyard,

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.367
Trickstar Divaridis'
attack points double

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:27.667
until the end of the turn.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:31.571
That's crazy.

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.173
Yeah, crazy awesome.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:35.208
She jumps to 3600 attack points

00:09:35.242 --> 00:09:38.178
which is more than plenty
to destroy Heatleo.

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:48.054
Okay, well that didn't
work out too good.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.023
At least my Heatleo
is still alive.

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.759
How?
Since I used

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:54.761
my Salamangreat
Wolvie to summon it,

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.031
its special ability protects
Heatleo from being destroyed

00:09:58.031 --> 00:09:59.633
and now I end my turn.

00:10:02.336 --> 00:10:03.570
We're behind the eight ball

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:04.839
but at least we're still alive

00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:06.107
and as long as we're alive,

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:07.674
we still have a chance.

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:13.547
(Flame)
Hm, Soulburner?

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.848
What's up there buddy?

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.416
(Flame)
You only took one turn

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:20.187
and you're already down
over 3000 life points.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.288
I know.

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.390
(Flame)
So, I just wanted
to let you know

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:26.526
that I find that impressive
in its own unique way.

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:29.430
Weirdest pep talk I've ever
been a part of but whatever.

00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:31.198
(Flame)
No, you're
missing the point.

00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:33.367
What I'm saying is
that if we can recover

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.671
from such a drastic downfall
and win it would be an even

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:38.005
more impressive feat.

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.674
Well yeah but are you
like, actually worried

00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:41.942
that we're going to lose?

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.344
Why, of course not,

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:47.080
because you have
me to help you.

00:10:47.114 --> 00:10:48.848
How could
I ever forget?

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:50.751
It's my turn.

00:10:50.784 --> 00:10:52.019
I draw.

00:10:52.053 --> 00:10:55.289
I activate Trickstar
Live Stage's effect.

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:56.790
(Aqua)
When the opponent

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:59.292
has a face down spell or
trap card on their field,

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:02.762
you are allowed to summon a
Trickstar Token in defense mode.

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:07.767
And since my
Divaridis is equipped

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.971
with Trickstar Birdhelm,
she can deal you 200 points

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.407
of damage every time
I summon a Trickstar.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:17.611
(Flame)
So not only can she
deal damage when we summon.

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:20.647
She can now deal damage
when she summons.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:23.250
She has elevated her
game, so we're running out

00:11:23.284 --> 00:11:25.586
of weaknesses to exploit.

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:27.020
You're right, Flame,

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:30.090
but all we need to find is
just one flaw to break through.

00:11:30.124 --> 00:11:31.292
(Flame)
Find a way.

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:34.127
Maybe Gate of fire
will mess up her combo.

00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:38.198
I no longer take damage
outside of battle

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:40.367
if it's less than 300 points.

00:11:40.434 --> 00:11:43.804
(Flame)
Ah, all her damage
is 200 each.

00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:46.807
Uh huh, so Blue Girl
won't be pinging me anymore.

00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:48.275
Really, is that so?

00:11:48.309 --> 00:11:50.810
But what if I used my
newest skill, Soulburner?

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:52.579
Trickstar Gig.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:54.581
For every Trickstar
that's in play

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:58.285
I send a card from the top
of my deck to the graveyard.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:01.355
So that means I'm gonna
be sending three cards.

00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:03.323
Yeah, I know this
sounds bad for me

00:12:05.692 --> 00:12:07.160
but its not because I get

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.030
to retrieve one Trickstar
from my graveyard in exchange

00:12:10.064 --> 00:12:12.933
and this card here is
the perfect one for me.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:17.638
But there's a catch,
in order for me to play it

00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:19.540
I have to link summon first.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:23.376
So I'll build the circuit that
turns dreams into reality.

00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:26.846
The summoning conditions
are two Trickstars.

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:32.419
Link summon, link-2
Trickstar Holly Angel.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.327
Then my field spell Trickstar
Live Stage activates

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:44.231
to summon a Trickstar token
next to my link monster.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.470
Now I have what I need
to play my perfect card.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.572
I activate my spell,
Trickstar Fusion,

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.675
it lets me fuse
my Trickstar token

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.644
and Trickstar Holly
Angel together into one.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:03.150
Hey, Soulburner, when
you see my new Trickstar

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:05.285
you'll be changing your tune.

00:13:07.821 --> 00:13:09.790
I fusion summon.

00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:13.093
Rock on, Trickstar
Band Sweet Guitar.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.564
She can play fusion monsters?

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:19.566
(Flame)
It would seem so.

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:21.601
It's another new
wrinkle to her game

00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:23.737
and another new headache for us.

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:28.708
Since I summoned another
monster, Trickstar Divaridis'

00:13:28.742 --> 00:13:31.545
special ability activates
to deal you damage.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.215
Yeah, but that
damage is only 200

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:37.251
and my Gate of Fire
will block anything

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:38.785
that's less than 300.

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:41.155
Yeah, but Sweet
Guitar's special ability

00:13:41.222 --> 00:13:43.890
can double the damage
that my Divaridis deals.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.461
Oh no.

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.564
The last time I checked no
matter how you do the math,

00:13:50.598 --> 00:13:52.566
400 is still greater than 300.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.639
Then my Sweet Guitar
gains attack points equal

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:04.445
to the damage I just dealt
raising her from 2200 to 2600.

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:07.948
Next, by banishing Trickstar
Fusion from my graveyard,

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:10.384
I'm then allowed to retrieve
a different Trickstar

00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:12.719
and then add it to my
hand but I'm not allowed

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.654
to summon that
monster this turn,

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.790
but I think Trickstar
Calobane would rather hang

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:18.558
with me than sleep in the grave.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.996
It's time to bring
this duel to an end.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.463
Here goes.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.967
Sweet Guitar, attack and
destroy Salamangreat Heatleo.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.801
Power cord.

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:31.605
I don't think so,

00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:32.473
because by discarding

00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:35.108
Salamangreat Raccoon
from my hand,

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.177
I gain life points
that are equal

00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:39.112
to your monsters attack points

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:42.215
but that's only the start,

00:14:42.282 --> 00:14:44.284
you also can't
activate any spells,

00:14:44.284 --> 00:14:47.320
traps or special abilities
during this battle, Blue Girl,

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:49.990
and my Heatleo cannot
be destroyed this turn.

00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:51.291
What?

00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:52.793
I mean why would
you wanna destroy

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.494
a monster this
cool, anyway?

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:55.462
That be hate.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.665
At least you still take
damage from my attack.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:06.106
My Trickstar Divaridis
also attacks your Heatleo

00:15:06.173 --> 00:15:09.176
and like last turn, I can
discard Trickstar Calobane

00:15:09.176 --> 00:15:12.379
from my hand to double
Divaridis' attack points

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:13.880
and do big time damage.

00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:23.723
But one thing you didn't do

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.458
was bring this duel to an end.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.262
You got me there, Soulburner.

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:29.897
But lose now or lose later,

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.065
in the end you're
still going to lose.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.568
Okay, I'm ending my turn,

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.605
and by doing so, Sweet
Guitar's attack points

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:41.175
drop back down to 2200 but
her special ability lets

00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:44.778
me get one Trickstar
back from my graveyard.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.280
Well Flame, we're surviving
but we're not thriving.

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:49.417
(Flame)
Quite true,
but having one life point

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.417
is better than zero

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.285
and two life points
are better than one

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:54.588
and three, well
that's triple of one.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.257
So that's three
times better and--

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.024
Your point?

00:15:57.057 --> 00:15:57.858
(Flame)
As long as

00:15:57.891 --> 00:15:59.926
it's not zero,
there's always hope.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.928
Right in here.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.964
Yeah, there is that one card.

00:16:03.997 --> 00:16:08.068
(Flame)
Yes, and all you need to do
is draw it.

00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:10.637
Then that's what I'll do,

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.573
and I didn't get it.

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:16.911
Well it looks like luck
just isn't on my side today.

00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.412
(Flame)
Oh, I do so
disagree Soulburner.

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:21.749
Luck is always
by your side.

00:16:21.782 --> 00:16:23.584
But I didn't draw
the right card.

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:24.651
(Flame)
Of course you didn't,

00:16:24.684 --> 00:16:26.587
I never expected
you to succeed.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.923
The odds of drawing
the one exact card,

00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:32.292
the one exact time, is
infinitesimal at best.

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.527
And your point?

00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:35.128
(Flame)
When I said
luck is by your side

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:38.331
I was talking about me,
because before we met

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.435
you didn't have the ability
to use a certain skill.

00:16:41.435 --> 00:16:45.005
A skill that only requires
your courage to use it.

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.807
Well now, if you're trying

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.975
to courage shame me,
you succeeded.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.648
What's he doing?

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:58.085
I use my skill.

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:00.487
(Flame)
Bring the
heat, Soulburner.

00:17:02.322 --> 00:17:05.325
By lowering my life
points to a hundred,

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.495
I then get to draw a card for
every thousand life points

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:10.163
that I sacrifice.

00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:12.433
I'll set the world aflame.

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.034
Burning draw.

00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:20.641
(Flame)
Well done, Soulburner.

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:21.842
Thank you, Flame.

00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:25.045
I activate the spell
card, Fusion of fire.

00:17:26.513 --> 00:17:28.315
I can fuse monsters on the field

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:31.485
or in my hand into a new
Salamangreat monster.

00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:33.053
If you wanna
summon a new monster,

00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:34.655
go right ahead,
Soulburner.

00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:37.658
The moment you do, Divaridis
and Sweet Guitar's abilities

00:17:37.658 --> 00:17:39.894
will deal you damage
and end this duel.

00:17:39.927 --> 00:17:41.661
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.499
I'm going to use my
Salamangreat Heatleo

00:17:45.532 --> 00:17:48.301
and one other link
monster to fusion summon.

00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:50.137
One other one?

00:17:50.137 --> 00:17:52.039
Even if I was
blindfolded in the dark

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.174
I could see that you don't
have another link monster

00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:55.175
on your field.

00:17:55.209 --> 00:17:57.744
You're right about that,
but with fusion of fire

00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:00.480
it doesn't have to
be my link monster.

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:02.316
I'm allowed to use
your link monster

00:18:02.382 --> 00:18:07.387
to fusion summon too, like
your Trickstar Divaridis.

00:18:08.222 --> 00:18:09.055
No way.

00:18:10.057 --> 00:18:12.159
When the flames
consume the old,

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:15.128
a new creature emerges
to reign supreme.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.265
I fusion summon,

00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:23.270
Salamangreat Violet Chimera.

00:18:34.715 --> 00:18:39.719
I fusion summon,
Salamangreat Violet Chimera.

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:42.890
I gotta admit, that's
certainly one surefire way

00:18:42.923 --> 00:18:44.724
of dodging damage.

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:47.328
If not a scoosh overboard,

00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:48.895
but hey, it worked.

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.900
When Violet Chimera is
successfully summoned,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.369
it gains half the attack
points of the two monsters

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:56.704
I used to summon it.

00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:59.539
So my Heatleo and your
Divaridis power it up.

00:19:01.875 --> 00:19:04.678
Go, Violet Chimera!

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:06.646
Attack Sweet Guitar!

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:11.718
You won't deal me as much
damage as you think you will.

00:19:11.785 --> 00:19:14.888
By sending Trickstar Calobane
from my hand to the graveyard,

00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:18.725
my Trickstar Band Sweet Guitar's
attack points are doubled.

00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:22.329
I so knew
you'd do that.

00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:23.163
Oh yeah?

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:25.532
You said it yourself
that one flaw

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:27.133
in your deck is
that only contains

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.136
monsters with low attack points.

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.371
So you'd naturally
try to patch that up

00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:33.373
by using Trickstar Calobane.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.275
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:35.275
So?

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:37.377
So you shouldn't've done that.

00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:40.613
You activated Violet
Chimera's additional ability.

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:43.450
When it battles a monster
who's attack points change,

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:45.852
Violet Chimera's
attack points double.

00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:50.290
9700 attack points?

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.959
Now go, Violet Slash.

00:20:03.603 --> 00:20:06.873
No way, she lost all her
life points in one attack.

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.613
Hey, Blue Girl,
I really thought

00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:14.348
that you had me
there for a sec.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.116
(Flame)
But what you
didn't have was

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:19.487
an excellent ignis
like me to aid you.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.155
You know what they say,
team work is what makes

00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:23.390
the team work.

00:20:23.457 --> 00:20:25.458
(Flame)
On the nose,
but true.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.796
Look, I know you won fair
and square and everything

00:20:28.829 --> 00:20:30.965
but maybe we could still
help each other out.

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:33.066
My brother is trying
to find out all he can

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:34.668
about the ignis
to, you know,

00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:36.836
stop bad things
from happening.

00:20:37.705 --> 00:20:39.639
Pass, maybe next time.

00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:43.143
Did you just
log Blue Girl out?

00:20:43.176 --> 00:20:44.844
Figured she
could use the rest.

00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:51.618
Looks like you're in
need of a siesta too.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:53.888
Guess our duel's
for another day.

00:20:53.954 --> 00:20:55.689
So if you can remind me where

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:57.725
the quickest exit
out of here is.

00:20:57.792 --> 00:20:59.860
I'm going to go
check on Blue Girl.

00:20:59.893 --> 00:21:00.894
(Flame)
Use this.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.864
What's this thing?

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:05.966
(Flame)
It's the emergency
logout program

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:07.868
to leave this
world instantly.

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:09.669
Here.

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:14.941
Hey now, aren't you just
the sweetest thing, hon?

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.947
Well, until we meet
again Flame.

00:21:20.013 --> 00:21:21.581
Stay you and stay cute.

00:21:22.883 --> 00:21:24.685
(Flame)
No, you stay cute.

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:26.786
Where's the barf
bag when you need one?

00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:32.726
(Ai)
Look over there.

00:21:35.729 --> 00:21:38.598
It's the edge of this world.

00:21:38.632 --> 00:21:42.002
Yes, and it's also where
Bohman is hiding out.
