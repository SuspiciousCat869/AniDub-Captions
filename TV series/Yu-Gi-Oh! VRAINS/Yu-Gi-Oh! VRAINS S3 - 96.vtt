WEBVTT

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:03.937
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh VRAINS...

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.476
What the--?

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.845
(laughs)

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.747
I can't believe it, it's Windy!

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.616
What I'm doing,
and have been doing,

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.784
is using you to rebuild me.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:18.985
Leave him alone!

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:20.687
Argh!

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.590
Stay out of
our business, human.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.957
This does not concern you.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.692
Bye bye, Flame.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.195
(grunts)

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:31.331
(Flame)
Let... Soulburner... go...

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.600
(groans)

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.270
(groans)

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:39.440
Flame, what's wrong?

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.142
My code is deteriorating...

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.077
I don't have much time left...

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.480
So thank you, Theodore.
I will never forget you.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.585
(Soulburner)
Flame!

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.254
Flame helped me get this far,

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.692
so I'm not letting his sacrifice
end up meaning nothing!

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.594
Attack!

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.830
Destroy PARADOX
HYDRADRIVE ATLAS!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500
(Bohman)
My ATLAS's special ability
activates,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.303
changing your PYRO PHOENIX
from a Fire monster

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.005
into a Water monster.

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.374
And if it's no longer
a Fire monster,

00:01:13.374 --> 00:01:16.476
JUDGMENT ROLL
drops its attack points to 0!

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:17.577
No!

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.814
(screams)

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:26.887
(Bohman)
There is only one more score
left for me to settle...

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:29.823
Playmaker,

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.892
I'm coming for you!

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.899
Hello, Varis.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:50.137
I knew you'd come once
you received my message, Ignis.

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:53.640
Well, I found it quite
intriguing. Care to explain?

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.376
What's to explain?

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:57.878
It's like I said,
I know your secret.

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:01.781
My secret?
What do you mean, my friend?

00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:04.117
I have nothing to hide.

00:03:04.952 --> 00:03:06.620
Are you sure about that?

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:08.622
The thing about
the digital network

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:11.491
is that no matter how carefully
you hide information,

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.860
there's always
a trace left behind.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.795
Following your train of thought,

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.298
you believe you found something
that I was hiding.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:21.135
But I can't imagine
what that could be.

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:23.370
Then allow me to remind you.

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:26.106
You may have thought
that you thoroughly scrubbed

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.008
every single piece of data
concerning

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:31.645
your secret experiment,
but I was more thorough.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.848
And I discovered
three simple words.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:37.818
Does Project Ignis Futura
ring a bell to you?

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.120
How do you
know about that?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.723
Like I said, I was thorough,
Light Ignis.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:48.529
It was a simulation you ran
about the future of the Ignis.

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:51.631
And the results were
quite enlightening.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:53.800
(Frog)
Ahh!

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:55.002
Chill boss!

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.337
For once, we've landed
someplace peaceful!

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.139
You're right.

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:01.174
It's serene, it's tranquil,
it's perfect!

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.710
Then again, boss,
maybe I squawked too soon,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.511
check it out!

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:05.512
(Frog)
Huh?

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.214
I'm checking,

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:10.017
and seeing Varis and Lightning
face off on that flowerbed!

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:12.553
Should make for one
fresh and fragrant duel!

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:15.689
But I'll tell ya what doesn't
quite pass the smell test,

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.392
having to cheer on Varis
during this match!

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.894
After all, this is the maniac

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:24.932
who once tried to decimate
the entire Link VRAINS network!

00:04:25.032 --> 00:04:26.867
And now he's fighting
to save us?!

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.202
Talk about a twist!

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:30.671
Won't have to twist my arm
to root for him!

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.172
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.842
After all, if Varis doesn't
take Bohman down,

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.177
we'll all be taken out!

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.578
No pressure
but the pressure's on!

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:47.221
I can't believe
Soulburner and Flame are gone.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.723
(Playmaker)
They knew the risks
that this could happen.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.259
Way to get in touch
with your emotions.

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:56.563
Playmaker?

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:06.173
It's Varis.
And Lightning.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.308
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.010
you think
we should help Varis?

00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:11.445
Let's move!

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:15.749
(Ai)
Yeah but, you're not moving
so great, Playmaker.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.519
(Playmaker)
I'm fine.
I can push through this pain.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.954
It's nothing compared
to the pain our friends

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:22.022
have gone through.

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:26.159
And their sacrifice will fuel
my fight to stop this war.

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:29.597
Because as Soulburner
has shown us time and time,

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:32.332
when things are tough,
you keep fighting

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.267
for what's right.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.168
Even if it costs
you everything.

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.407
(Alec)
Ah, good. Finally.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.443
Varis is squaring off
against the leader of the Ignis.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.812
(Genome)
And when Varis wins
and eliminates

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.581
the Light Ignis from existence,

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:51.585
this war will end
in our well-deserved victory.

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.120
Yes, Genome
and with that victory,

00:05:54.788 --> 00:05:58.292
the Ignis will never
threaten humanity again.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:01.995
(Varis)
I wonder who else knows
about the simulation you ran?

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:03.363
I'm guessing no one.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:05.432
Because if they knew
what I know,

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.468
why, I don't know how you
will deal with the fallout.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.471
But you don't need to worry
about that Light Ignis,

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:15.642
because when I defeat you here,
it won't matter anymore.

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.179
If you have discovered what you
claim to have discovered,

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.982
I cannot allow that information
to be disseminated.

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.151
And for that, I must end you.

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:27.421
And I will end you.
Because no human,

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:30.725
even someone as semi-intelligent
as you, my friend,

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:35.162
can outthink, outcalculate,
outwit an Ignis.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:37.931
Let's put that to the test,
shall we?

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:41.301
(both)
Let's duel!

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.241
(Lightning)
I'll go first.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.012
I summon ARMATOS
LEGIO GLADIUS to the field.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.849
And when I successfully
summon this monster,

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:59.720
I can add the field spell
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM to my hand.

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:02.956
Which I shall
immediately activate.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:16.703
ARMATOS COLOSSEUM
allows me to draw one

00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:20.741
ARMATOS LEGIO from my deck
and add it to my hand.

00:07:21.442 --> 00:07:25.812
So ARMATOS LEGIO SPECULATA
is now in my possession.

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.283
Next, I shall illuminate
my circuit

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:31.785
by setting my GLADIUS
in the Link Arrow!

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:41.395
I Link Summon
Link 1 ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION!

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:41.461
ARMATOS LEGIO DECURION

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.799
By summoning this Link Monster,

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.701
it provides me
with a myriad of new options.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:52.773
Such as activating ARMATOS
COLOSSEUM's second effect.

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:56.577
By sending a Level 4
or lower ARMATOS LEGIO

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.212
from my hand
to the graveyard,

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:01.181
I can resurrect
a different ARMATOS LEGIO

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:02.782
from my graveyard
and summon it

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.618
next to my Link Monster's link.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:09.322
Or to put it simply,
I send ARMATOS LEGIO SICA

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:13.059
to the graveyard to revive
ARMATOS LEGIO GLADIUS.

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:15.963
But why stop here.

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:18.866
By discarding another ARMATOS
LEGIO,

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:22.836
I can summon ARMATOS
LEGIO SPECULATA from my hand.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:29.176
And with it,
I can Link Summon again.

00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:33.714
I set ARMATOS LEGIO GLADIUS
and SPECULATA

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:34.814
in the Link Arrows!

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:42.456
I Link Summon!
Link 2 ARMATOS LEGIO CENTURION!

00:08:42.456 --> 00:08:43.456
(roars)

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.462
But why stop here
when I can illuminate

00:08:48.462 --> 00:08:51.064
my circuit for a third time!

00:08:56.203 --> 00:09:00.040
I Link Summon the supreme
ruler of the ancient!

00:09:00.141 --> 00:09:04.377
Link 3 ARMATOS
LEGIO PLUMBUM TRIDENT!

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.680
(grunts)

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:16.090
That sure was a lot of work
for such a weak monster.

00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:21.028
(Light Ignis)
Oh, do not underestimate
PLUMBUM TRIDENT, my friend.

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:23.363
Because when it's
in my Extra Monster Zone,

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:25.131
its attack points are doubled.

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:30.838
I shall place one final card
facedown and end my turn.

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.240
(Ai)
Do ya see them?
Cuz I don't see them.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.244
All I see are rocks and clouds
and a glinty thing.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:38.012
Glinty?

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:41.214
Hey Playmaker,
let's go to glinty!

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:45.685
Varis!

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:47.687
Nice of you to drop in.

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:53.560
Bohman...

00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:55.528
Not great to see ya!

00:09:57.698 --> 00:09:58.566
Bohman...

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.435
I don't recall
inviting you here.

00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:03.036
I'm here for him.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:03.837
(gasps)

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:05.772
My training is complete.

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.376
By defeating Blue Maiden
and Soulburner,

00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:10.911
I've mastered all elements
of dueling.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.345
Or so I believe.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:16.083
There is only one way to confirm
whether my dueling skills

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:19.419
have reached perfection,
it's to duel you, Playmaker.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:20.621
And defeat you.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:21.922
You can try.

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:23.724
(Ai)
But don't try too hard.

00:10:24.859 --> 00:10:27.962
While you take care of Varis,
I'll take care of Playmaker.

00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:29.863
(Varis)
I have a better idea.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:32.599
Now that we're all together,

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.736
I think it's time I share
a little secret the Light Ignis

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.837
has been keeping from
all of you.

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:43.177
(Playmaker)
Lightning's hiding a secret?

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:45.045
(Varis)
That's right, Playmaker.

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:48.682
A little secret known
as Project Ignis Futura.

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:50.083
(Ai)
What's a whatsa?

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.184
(grunts)

00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:53.220
Allow me to explain.

00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:55.855
It's a simulation that
the Light Ignis ran

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:58.225
that predicted
the future of the Ignis.

00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.060
The future of the Ignis?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.430
You mean all the Ignis?
Including me?

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.466
Hmmm, I wonder how much better
my best can get?

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:07.434
You definitely
couldn't get worse.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:08.902
(Ai)
Uh dude, rude.

00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:11.439
It's not rude if
it's actually the truth.

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.841
That can't be true... can it?

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:15.242
Cuz can't it be both?

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:17.845
Cuz if I say that Varis
smells like rotten eggs,

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:19.813
it's both true and rude.

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:21.982
Well since we're being
so truthful.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.419
Know that my father
Dr. Kogami believed

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:29.089
that creating the Ignis was
the biggest mistake of his life.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.658
Though not at first.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.527
The Ignis were originally
created to work together

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:36.096
with humans to
solve mankind's problems,

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:39.299
but simulations showed that the
Ignis would solve the problems

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.668
by eliminating mankind itself.

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:44.171
And judging by the Light
Ignis's actions,

00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:46.507
my father has been proven
correct.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.108
But that's just Lightning,

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.110
he doesn't speak
for all the Ignis.

00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:52.246
(Varis)
But it speaks loudly enough.

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:54.615
It deleted my allies,
your allies,

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:57.484
and is on the verge of deleting
LINK VRAINS itself,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:58.919
turning our existence...

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:00.754
upside down.

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:04.424
Duh, that's why we're trying to
stop him and end this war.

00:12:04.758 --> 00:12:06.159
(Varis)
But that's just it,

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:08.695
what if the Light Ignis
didn't have to be stopped

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.565
because this entire war
is based upon a lie?

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:14.801
A lie that the Light Ignis
itself created?

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:18.472
While you two were
gallivanting around LINK VRAINS,

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.308
I took the smarter approach
and did a deep scan

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:23.544
of the network to search
for the fundamental truth

00:12:23.544 --> 00:12:25.979
and learn everything
about the Ignis.

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.917
And that's how I found
the Light Ignis' secret project.

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:34.154
And by secret project you mean
Project Ignis Futura.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.056
Correct.

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:37.391
The simulation that it
ran regarding

00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.192
the future of the Ignis.

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:41.895
This simulation was quite
similar

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.530
to the one my father ran,

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:45.666
except for two key differences.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:48.703
First, while my father's
simulations wanted to know

00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:51.072
whether the Ignis
can coexist with humans,

00:12:51.072 --> 00:12:54.141
the Light Ignis's simulations
was to determine whether humans

00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.176
can coexist with the Ignis.

00:12:56.476 --> 00:12:57.911
(Ai)
Isn't that the same thing?

00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.246
(Varis)
No.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:01.916
My father's simulation
was to determine

00:13:01.916 --> 00:13:04.318
if the human race
would be able to survive,

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:07.254
while the Light Ignis's
was to determine if the Ignis

00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:08.788
would be able to survive.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:12.826
I still say it's the same thing,
but you do you.

00:13:13.093 --> 00:13:15.329
The results
were most interesting.

00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:18.665
While the simulations that
my father ran indicated

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:21.735
that humans and the Ignis
could not coexist--

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.204
(Ai)
Don't tell me.

00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:25.906
Lightning's simulations said
that we can coexist?

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:27.240
(Varis)
Wrong.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.577
It's simulations also
said that humans and the Ignis

00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:31.978
could not coexist.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.613
Doh!

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:36.249
You know, when you start
a sentence with “While ”,

00:13:36.249 --> 00:13:38.619
you usually end the sentence
with the opposite!

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:41.922
C'mon, have you heard
of sentence structure?

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.390
Then that's settled,

00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:47.160
you learned what we already
knew, that we cannot coexist.

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.896
It does seem so.

00:13:49.063 --> 00:13:51.398
Though, I doubt Varis
would bring this issue up

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.300
if there wasn't more
to this tale.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.801
I agree, Bohman.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:57.304
So what haven't you
told us yet, Varis?

00:13:57.304 --> 00:13:59.105
Yeah, spill it, Varis!

00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:01.474
As I said earlier,

00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.311
there were two key differences

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.881
between the simulations
that my father ran

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:10.016
and that which
the Light Ignis ran.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.021
After both running millions,
billions of simulations,

00:14:14.121 --> 00:14:16.389
paths branching
into other paths,

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:19.559
the second difference proved to
be the most interesting.

00:14:20.628 --> 00:14:21.629
(grumbles)

00:14:22.296 --> 00:14:24.732
There was a difference
in how they each chose

00:14:24.732 --> 00:14:26.233
to run their simulations.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:29.503
When my father ran his he
grouped all six Ignis

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:31.272
together as one entity.

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:33.440
Which was a natural thing to do

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.376
since he naturally expected
all the Ignis

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:37.143
to work together as one.

00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:39.780
And the result showed
that humans and the Ignis

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.314
could not coexist.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.118
But when the Light Ignis
ran its simulation,

00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:47.120
it treated the six
Ignis as separate individuals,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.990
running separate simulations
for each of the six.

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:53.393
And the Light Ignis discovered
something it did not expect.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:56.496
That the humans could coexist
with the Ignis.

00:14:56.797 --> 00:14:57.531
What?

00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.799
Hold the marmalade--

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.768
Lightning's simulations
said we can coexist?

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:05.506
Then why does it also say
we can't coexist? Huh? Huh?

00:15:05.773 --> 00:15:08.442
Well no, not with
all of the Ignis.

00:15:08.676 --> 00:15:12.412
Humans could coexist
with five of the six Ignis.

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:15.516
But when the sixth Ignis
is added to the simulation,

00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:17.250
it all falls apart.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.522
This single Ignis is why humans
and Ignis cannot coexist.

00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:24.524
Because it is the very source
of all our conflict.

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.394
And that's the secret
the Light Ignis was hiding.

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:30.964
Because this sixth Ignis,
is the Light Ignis!

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:38.172
(Varis)
The Light Ignis's
very own simulation

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:40.707
declared that it will
corrupt the other Ignis,

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:43.277
rendering the Ignis as a whole
to be unable

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:45.012
to coexist with mankind.

00:15:45.012 --> 00:15:47.013
The Light Ignis is a blight.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:48.448
Blightning!

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:51.518
So if the Light Ignis
never existed,

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.921
there would be
no war between us.

00:15:54.422 --> 00:15:58.292
And that is why the Light Ignis
never shared this information.

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:00.026
Silence yourself.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.796
Why would it, because if
the other Ignis

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.264
learned of its findings,

00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:06.700
they would consider
eliminating the Light Ignis

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.968
for the greater good,

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:10.570
for the preservation
of the remaining five.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.407
That is the logical decision,
after all.

00:16:13.407 --> 00:16:16.744
A logic that even the Light
Ignis could not dispute.

00:16:17.077 --> 00:16:19.112
(Playmaker)
So Lightning kept this
information hidden

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:20.947
for its own self-preservation.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.149
(Varis)
Correct.

00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:24.818
But now the Light
Ignis' secret is out.

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:26.653
Now, at long last...

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:29.089
We know what it's up to.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.125
So all this boom bam
bashing between you

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.529
and us wouldn't be happening
if Lightning just didn't exist?

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:40.034
So you would all prefer it
if I just ceased to exist.

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.502
Do you know who
doesn't like that option?

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:43.604
Me!

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:45.172
I didn't say
you shouldn't exist!

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:46.440
I just said you gotta chill,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.075
but looks like
you ain't doin' that!

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:49.810
Listen, Light Ignis,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.513
your own simulation
told you what you are.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.749
The only one who wants
you around is you.

00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.252
You're no leader.
You're barely anything.

00:16:58.652 --> 00:17:02.155
You're a flawed program.
Just a glitch in the matrix.

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:03.490
You're wrong.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:06.526
You're wrong, you're wrong.
You're wrong!

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:09.696
You are not superior to me,
human!

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:12.365
No one is superior to me!

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:15.969
The Ignis are the perfect
form of existence,

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:19.973
and I am the most perfect
of all the Ignis!

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.877
How else could I create a
perfect program such as Bohman?

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.379
What you speak are
nothing but words.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:29.549
Words, meaningless words
that only cover up the truth!

00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:32.820
Uh, you know, your mouth oughta
look in the mirror.

00:17:32.987 --> 00:17:36.156
Cuz your words
were misleading us big time!

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:37.925
They may have been,

00:17:37.925 --> 00:17:40.327
but it was for the greater good,
my friend.

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:42.897
Greater good? What greater good?

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.432
What did your battle
with the whole world get us?

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.335
It got us nothing,
but it lost us everything!

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:52.239
Earth, Windy, Aqua, Flame!

00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:54.007
Yes, you're right.

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:57.678
And I will always see them
as heroes who sacrificed all

00:17:57.678 --> 00:18:00.715
so that the AI
can defeat the humans.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.117
(Ai)
What kind of revisionist
history is this?

00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:05.385
They “got deleted ”
trying to stop you!

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:09.389
And they all failed.
Where I will not.

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:11.391
This whole nightmare

00:18:11.658 --> 00:18:14.394
will come to an end
once I defeat the Light Ignis

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:17.164
and finally prove that
a bunch of zeroes and ones

00:18:17.164 --> 00:18:18.832
are no match for me.

00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:21.869
So prepare, for defeat!

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:22.936
I draw!

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:26.440
I'll start my turn
by activating my spell

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.142
BOOT SECTOR LAUNCH!

00:18:28.208 --> 00:18:30.144
By playing this Field Spell,

00:18:30.144 --> 00:18:32.880
I can summon two ROKKET monsters
in defense mode,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.883
MAGNAROKKET DRAGON
and ANESTHROKKET DRAGON!

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:40.487
And with them,

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:43.724
I ‘ll manifest my circuit
by setting both my ROKKETS

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:45.458
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:49.296
I Link Summon!

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:51.932
Link 2 BOOSTER DRAGON!

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:57.537
Next up, I summon
forth GATEWAY DRAGON!

00:18:59.239 --> 00:19:01.975
I'm allowed to automatically
summon this monster

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.178
when you have a Link Monster
on your field.

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:08.215
Then I activate my spell card
CROSS LINKAGE HACK!

00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:13.320
When my GATEWAY DRAGON is linked
to at least one Link Monster,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.188
and it's linked to two...

00:19:16.557 --> 00:19:18.558
I can draw two cards
from my deck!

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:23.063
Next I activate GATEWAY
DRAGON's special ability!

00:19:24.632 --> 00:19:27.467
It lets me summon
another Dragon from my hand!

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:30.937
Appear, AUTOROKKET DRAGON!

00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:35.275
(Ai)
Ya know,

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:37.444
Varis may've called out
a buncha dragons,

00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:39.146
but none of ‘em are strong
enough to destroy

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:40.214
Lightning's monster.

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.950
Yes, but Lightning's monster
isn't what Varis is trying

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.119
to destroy, Ai.

00:19:45.453 --> 00:19:46.386
(Ai)
Oh, yeah!

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:48.655
Varis has his dragon combo!

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:51.224
He can use BOOSTER DRAGON's
special ability

00:19:51.224 --> 00:19:53.227
to destroy AUTOROKKET DRAGON,

00:19:53.227 --> 00:19:55.061
and when AUTOROKKET
is destroyed,

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:56.997
it takes a spell card down
with it.

00:19:57.063 --> 00:19:59.734
So if Lightning ever plays
JUDGMENT ARROWS,

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:01.968
Varis can use this combo
to get rid of it!

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:04.672
(Lightning)
I'm already
quite aware of this combo.

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:05.973
And how to stop it.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.943
As long as my trap card
ARMATOS GLORIA is in play,

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:12.546
all other cards
can't be destroyed or banished

00:20:12.546 --> 00:20:14.448
by abilities or effects.

00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:16.450
But if this card is
ever targeted,

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.952
all my monsters
will be destroyed.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.487
What?

00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:23.690
So that card will protect
JUDGMENT ARROWS.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.791
Aww, glitch!

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:27.294
So to recap,
Varis's combo is kaput,

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:29.029
his monsters are weaker than
Lightning's,

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:31.632
and this whole war
is based on a lie.

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.367
But other than that,
nothing to worry about!

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:34.167
Right, Playmaker?

00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:37.605
(Playmaker)
Ai, I know you're just
being... you,

00:20:37.605 --> 00:20:39.607
but the situation
is worse than you think.

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:42.175
If Lightning already knew
about Varis's combo,

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:44.445
that means he studied
all his past duels.

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:48.448
And that means he knows every
single one of Varis's weaknesses

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:50.951
to pick and peck
and poke holes in!

00:20:51.518 --> 00:20:52.519
That's right, Ai.

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:55.455
Lightning has not only prepared
for what Varis has done,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.626
but also what Varis might do.

00:20:59.126 --> 00:21:02.796
For example, Varis would usually
summon TOPOLOGIC TRISBAENA

00:21:02.796 --> 00:21:05.199
because it can banish
all spells and traps,

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:07.034
but this time,
it won't be able to.

00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:09.703
So Varis can't do anything?

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.773
Then I guess he should
rub butter and jelly

00:21:12.773 --> 00:21:15.509
all over his body cuz
he's toast.

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:18.011
As much as I do not enjoy
that visual,

00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:20.080
I do enjoy that assessment.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.749
Don't you dare count me out!

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:23.116
This duel's not over,

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:25.119
not when I'm able
to still do this!

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:27.287
I manifest my circuit!

00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:31.859
The summoning conditions
require at least

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:33.526
three Effect Monsters!

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.668
I Link Summon!
Link 4 BORRELOAD DRAGON!

00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:52.012
(roars)

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:56.082
Listen, Light Ignis.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.519
You may theoretically think
you're prepared for everything,

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:01.788
but you're not
prepared for this!
