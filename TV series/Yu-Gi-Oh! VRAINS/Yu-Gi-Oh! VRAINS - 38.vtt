00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:04.170
♪♪♪

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.685
Spectre, you fought valiantly.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.688
I will not let
your defeat be in vain.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.658
(theme music playing)

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.218
(Varis)
My four lieutenants
may have fallen,

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:26.887
but I still stand.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.922
And I will not allow
Playmaker to stop me

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.758
from completing
the Tower of Hanoi

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:32.693
and destroying the Ignis!

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:35.429
The Ignis are
the bane of humanity,

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.064
the greatest threat
to all mankind.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.767
If I only had succeeded
in destroying the Cyberse

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:44.571
five years ago,
we wouldn't be in this mess

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.709
The Cyberse... will be...
no more!

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.512
Cracking Dragon,
destroy this world!

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.982
He's gonna wipe us out!
We gotta do something!

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:58.218
He's got us trapped!
But not me!

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.421
Because no one can
catch this fella!
And I mean no one!

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:04.091
(Blue Ignis)
Watch out!

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:07.794
Well, Cyberse,
it was good seein' ya.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.497
(Varis)
No! That Ignis
is cutting the Cyberse

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.666
from the rest of the network!

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.708
Find every fragment
of that Ignis!

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.477
It's the only one who knows

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:26.247
the precise location
of the Cyberse!

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:28.982
That rogue Ignis
hid from us for years

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.785
but I knew it couldn't
hide forever.

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:33.253
I found you, Ignis!

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.488
Or not!

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.658
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm trapped!

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:39.659
(Varis)
We finally tracked it down,

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.064
but there was one anomaly
we didn't account
for-- Playmaker.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.834
Though he's been fighting
against the Hanoi
for quite some time,

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:49.269
he was more of a nuisance
than a threat,

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.238
until he made himself
into a target

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:52.740
by capturing the Ignis.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.444
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:59.312
Now arise,
Cracking Dragon!

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.952
How do you like
that, Playmaker?

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.988
Go Storm Access!

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.896
I Link Summon!
Link 3, Decode Talker!

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.444
DECODE TALKER, attack!

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:31.378
Decode Destruction!

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:39.019
(shouting)

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.556
So Playmaker escaped
with the Ignis.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.859
Spectre!
Master Varis.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.394
We tried tracking
him again, but...

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.530
Even with
our best hackers,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.064
we're no closer
than before

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.400
to learning who he is
in the real world.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.202
On the contrary, Spectre.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.038
I believe that we are
honing in on Playmaker.

00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:00.207
And there are three reasons
why I am certain

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:01.708
it's only a matter of time.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.344
One: Only a select
few duelists

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.847
play Cyberse cards,
so we can narrow our search.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.550
Two: We're improving
our search algorithms daily,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.952
if not hourly.

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:15.789
And three: If all else fails,
he will come to me,

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.393
to duel the hated leader
of the Knights of Hanoi.

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:21.795
Quite observant, sir.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.965
And I guarantee
that our first meeting

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.234
will also be our last.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.039
(thinking)
The Hanoi weren't
the only ones

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.440
searching for Playmaker,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.776
and it was less than difficult
to make them work for us.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:38.778
<i>Hey, True Blues!
I need your help!</i>

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.547
<i>All of you!</i>

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:42.683
<i>If any of you see Playmaker.</i>

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.519
<i>tell him that Blue Angel
is challenging him
to a Speed Duel.</i>

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.954
<i>I'm ready to face
my biggest test, Playmaker,</i>

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:53.027
<i>but... the question is,
are you?</i>

00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:56.263
<i>Central Square one hour.
Be there!</i>

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:59.466
(chuckling)
An interesting
turn of events.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.701
I believe she'll be
quite useful

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.403
in our battle
against Playmaker.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:08.008
(thinking)
It's been three hours.
Where is he?

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:09.643
(Spectre)
Doesn't a gentleman know

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.245
he should never
stand up a lady?

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.648
You're a...
A Knight of Hanoi!

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.116
Indeed I am.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:19.419
But I'm first
and foremost
your biggest fan.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.323
I can bring Playmaker
straight to you, Blue Angel.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:27.260
In fact, I can even
guarantee you victory.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.462
Ohh!

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.765
If you should ever
find yourself

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.433
in peril during a duel,

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.302
do not hesitate
to put into play

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:37.771
the card I just provided you.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:41.809
May you duel well,
Blue Angel.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:43.244
(moaning)

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:45.579
Here I go!

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:49.616
I Draw!
(gasps)

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.652
That card belongs
to the Hanoi.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:55.122
That naive girl drew
the card we gave to her.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.324
Once she plays it,
she belongs to us.

00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:01.095
(Blue Angel)
I don't know why,
but I don't feel so good.

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:04.031
I have to end this duel.
I Link Summon!

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.736
Link 3 Encode Talker!

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:12.038
I have no other options
left than to... Wha?!

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:17.478
Play the card, Blue Angel!

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:18.912
Don't do it!

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:22.149
I discard Dark Angel
from my hand

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.986
to activate
its special ability-- Aah!

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:28.756
This is bad news
The Hanoi have her.

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.559
Unh!

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.694
Encode Talker!
Attack!

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.508
Excellently executed,
Varis.

00:06:47.508 --> 00:06:50.477
If Playmaker wishes
to save Blue Angel,

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.479
he has no choice
but to face us.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.081
Along with the Ignis.

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.550
Yes, the Ignis...

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.918
They must be destroyed.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.054
But can you?

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:02.456
When the time comes,
I will do

00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:03.823
what needs to be done.

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.626
I understand.

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:08.262
I know very well that it
won't be easy to do,

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:11.097
but doing what is
right never is.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:16.069
(Varis)
With the whole network
searching for Playmaker,

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:19.072
it was only a matter of time
until they caught him for me.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.376
(Playmaker)
Varis!

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:24.444
Ohh!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.913
I'm challenging Playmaker
to a duel.

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:38.491
(chuckles)
I'll be waiting, Playmaker.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:48.102
So, Playmaker,
remember that if I win

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:49.870
I gain control
of your AI.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.139
When I defeat you Varis,
the Knights of Hanoi

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.608
will never threaten
anyone ever again!

00:07:54.608 --> 00:07:55.976
You seem quite certain

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.612
that you will emerge
victorious, Playmaker.

00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.113
But in the end,
you will fail

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:02.382
like all
who have opposed me.

00:08:02.382 --> 00:08:04.651
This is not an opinion.
It's a fact.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.554
And for someone
who sees us as a threat,

00:08:06.554 --> 00:08:08.222
why do you harbor an Ignis,

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.856
the greatest threat
to mankind?

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.325
What do you mean?
(grumbling)

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:16.296
Are you truly unaware of what
you have in your possession?

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.565
And are you unaware
that it's impolite

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.668
to answer a question
with a question?

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:24.004
Which I also did, true,
but, you know,
I can explain.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.640
I emphatically think
more mathematically
than grammatically.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.975
Enough.

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:31.212
You don't need to give me
extra reasons to delete you.

00:08:31.212 --> 00:08:33.880
Hrr! Playmaker,
glitch this guy.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.717
So much contempt
for such a tiny AI.

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:39.386
What did you say?
Come at me, bro!

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:42.022
You act like I deleted
your bank account
or something.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.556
Which gives me
an idea...

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.059
Your very existence
is the problem.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.328
AIs are not to be trusted.

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:50.865
I don't even include one
in my Duel Disk.

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:54.200
You programs, in fact
this whole network world,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.171
is an illusion that will
lead to the end of humanity.

00:08:57.171 --> 00:08:59.706
And my mission is
to stop that!

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.510
People have to wake up
before it's too late.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.778
Uh, exaggerate much?

00:09:04.778 --> 00:09:07.180
And what kind of hacker
hates programs?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.250
Especially one
as handsome as me?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.219
I will destroy the Ignis
to save the world.

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:14.955
And if that means
destroying you as well,

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:17.724
so be it.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:21.595
But I can promise you
the last duel you ever fight

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.129
will be a memorable one.

00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:40.180
Playmaker, this is where
you will crash and burn.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.015
I think not.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:44.118
If he wants a firefight,
that's what he'll get!

00:09:44.118 --> 00:09:47.121
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:48.789
As you already know,

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.058
I can wield the incredible
power of the Data Storm

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.959
in the palm of my hand.

00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:59.566
These winds rage for me...
and me alone.

00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:11.778
I activate my Skill!

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.047
(growling)

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.549
That's the monster
that I'm looking for!

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:18.885
Storm Access!

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:23.957
You're mine now.

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.360
I Link Summon!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.529
Behold the power of Link 4

00:10:28.529 --> 00:10:31.431
Topologic Bomber Dragon!

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.800
Get your act together,
Playmaker!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.105
If I had sweat glands,
I'd be swamped
waist-deep in AI juice!

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:41.208
Face the facts.
You're backed
into a corner.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.876
But you still
got a way out!

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:46.280
By using my Skill.
Exactly!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.783
You may have retrieved
a Link Monster,

00:10:48.783 --> 00:10:51.618
but it's useless
if you can't summon it.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.887
I activate the trap
Remote Rebirth!

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:56.523
(roars)

00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:02.796
Ahh!

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:13.773
What's going on?!

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.676
I've intensified the strength
of the Data Storm.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:19.179
So you're using
the data storm against me?

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.481
Yes, precisely.

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.684
A Speed Duel isn't enough
to settle our differences.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:28.355
We need more... much more!
(laughing)

00:11:31.992 --> 00:11:34.028
Ahh!

00:11:34.028 --> 00:11:36.630
(laughing)

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.201
(Ai yelping)

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:44.004
(Varis)
Our Speed Duel
ended in a draw,

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:46.940
but I wouldn't let my prey
escape that easily,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.743
not after everything I went
through to hunt them down.

00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:52.680
Found you Varis!

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.815
Speed Dueling is done.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:56.517
It's time to Master Duel.

00:11:56.517 --> 00:11:58.485
Really?
A Master Duel?

00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:00.154
As you know, the Monster,

00:12:00.154 --> 00:12:05.526
Spell, and Trap Zones
expand from three to five.

00:12:05.526 --> 00:12:08.428
So Link Monsters will now
have more opportunities

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.097
to connect
with other monsters,

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:12.566
allowing them to
strengthen their abilities.

00:12:12.566 --> 00:12:15.068
So you'll find out what
they're truly capable of.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:20.141
Well then, are we going
to talk or duel?

00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:23.310
(both)
Let's duel!

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.179
I will make the first move.

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:29.149
Ah, good.
I activate Fire Prison.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.690
Now I have you trapped
in here with me,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.257
and there's no escape.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.660
This looks like
bad news, Playmaker.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.896
Knowing Varis, it's bound
to get even worse.

00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:46.099
Yes... All the pieces
are in place.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.809
Authorizing Link Arrows!

00:12:55.809 --> 00:13:00.180
I need at least three Effect
Monsters to Link Summon.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.483
And that's exactly
what I have!

00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.318
I set Twin Triangle Dragon

00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:08.455
and my two Sniffer Dragons
in the Link Arrows!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.490
Link the circuit!

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:16.429
And with their combination
comes your doom, Playmaker!

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.064
I Link Summon!

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:19.733
Rise up!

00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:23.236
Link 4 Borreload Dragon!

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.979
(thinking)
I was on the verge
of certain victory,

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:36.216
but even a psychic
couldn't have predicted
what happened next.

00:13:36.216 --> 00:13:39.319
I tore through
your entire playbook.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:41.088
You're like a pebble
in my shoe

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.223
Annoying
and uncomfortable, yes,

00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:45.659
but ultimately
small and worthless.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.595
not giving a second thought
once it's tossed away.

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.598
And when you lose,
you'll be lost to history.

00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:53.934
You're wrong.
I must win.

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.469
And there happen to be

00:13:55.469 --> 00:13:57.471
exactly three
reasons why I will.

00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:59.039
Oh!

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.607
For one...

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.143
I must avenge the horrors
that the Knights of Hanoi

00:14:03.143 --> 00:14:05.312
put me through
a decade ago.

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:08.148
Two: Defeating you
is a step towards

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.684
uncovering the truth
about that incident.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:15.289
And three: I must rescue
the one who rescued me.

00:14:15.289 --> 00:14:17.357
Did you say three?

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.892
No way.

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:20.894
Can it be you?

00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:22.529
After all of these years?

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.832
Ten years to be exact.

00:14:24.832 --> 00:14:28.436
But I'm back
to get justice!

00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:32.339
(Varis)
Those three simple statements
changed everything.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.974
They revealed to me
that Playmaker

00:14:33.974 --> 00:14:37.378
was one of the six children
involved in the Lost Incident,

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:40.648
a special project
started by my own father.

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:43.550
I was witnessing
with my very own eyes

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.389
my father's actions
coming back to haunt me.

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:53.026
Despite the setback,

00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.228
my desire to defeat him
could not be quenched.

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.530
But I was
running out of time.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.232
Once the Hanoi's master plan
was executed,

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.635
LINK VRAINS would cease
to exist,

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.105
along with
any leads to uncover

00:15:04.105 --> 00:15:07.407
Playmaker's true identity.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.676
<i>Varis.</i>

00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:12.012
<i>We've entered
the final stages.</i>

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:15.215
How soon will we be ready
to launch the program?

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:17.785
<i>Anytime we desire.</i>

00:15:17.785 --> 00:15:19.953
Ahh.

00:15:19.953 --> 00:15:22.790
<i>What's wrong?
Are you not pleased?</i>

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.925
Yes, but I require
some time.

00:15:24.925 --> 00:15:27.461
<i>Time? Time for what?</i>

00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:29.930
For unfinished business.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.599
<i>Business? Or Playmaker?</i>
Grr!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.603
Tempest Terahertz!

00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:37.904
Ahh!

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:41.408
Our last duel
will gnaw at me
until I defeat him!

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:42.776
<i>I see.</i>

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:44.778
<i>But we cannot
delay forever.</i>

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.746
I know.

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.953
(Varis)
With a renewed urgency,
I sought out Playmaker,

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:55.923
but I was no longer alone
in my quest.

00:15:55.923 --> 00:15:57.691
Three of my most
trusted lieutenants

00:15:57.691 --> 00:15:59.626
decided to help me
take him down,

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:03.096
along with his allies,
starting with Dr. Genome.

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:06.033
(both)
Now let's Speed Duel!

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:10.437
Watch as I unlock
my monster's true potential!

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:14.074
Witness genetic perfection!

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:19.179
Link 2 Helixx
Necro Darwin!

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:22.315
Go and drop kick
Necro Darwin
into next week!

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.588
(both roaring)

00:16:31.592 --> 00:16:33.828
Ahh!

00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:35.596
And next and last...

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:39.165
Carve up Helixx Gothiclon
and end this duel!

00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:44.671
(roaring)

00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:50.411
Aah!

00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:52.846
(grunting)

00:16:52.846 --> 00:16:55.582
(moaning)

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.185
(Varis)
Next was Baira,

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.988
who sought
to delete Blue Angel.

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:04.191
(both)
Let's Speed Duel!

00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:09.229
Surgical Forceps, incise
Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:13.067
(Blue Angel)
Trickstar Holly Angel can't
be destroyed in battle!

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.369
You may have
saved your monster,

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.371
but can you
save yourself?

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.408
Have a nice fall,
Blue Angel!

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:23.210
(grunting)

00:17:26.013 --> 00:17:30.418
You're not shaking me off!

00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:33.553
Well, Bella... what say
we end this duel?

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:36.723
Destroy Dark Mummy
Surgical Forceps!

00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:39.526
Scimitar Stream!

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:46.833
(Varis)
And finally, Faust,
who battled Playmaker

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:56.043
(both)
Now let's Speed Duel!

00:17:56.043 --> 00:18:01.115
I activate my Skill...
Double Bite!

00:18:01.115 --> 00:18:03.817
And I bet it bites.

00:18:03.817 --> 00:18:07.254
Heh! My Skill allows
my Spreader Queen

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:10.057
to attack twice this turn
instead of just once!

00:18:10.057 --> 00:18:12.159
Wha?!
That's right!

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:14.394
Now go!

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:17.297
Thanks to Motor Worm Gate,
this attack will be

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.666
a direct attack
to your life points!

00:18:19.666 --> 00:18:21.402
Uh, Playmaker...

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:23.437
does he know
the definition of direct?

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:26.774
Because that attack
went directly nowhere.

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:28.275
(buzzing in distance)

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:30.244
Uh, what's buzzing?

00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:32.812
Huh?! Ah!

00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:39.586
Finish him!

00:18:39.586 --> 00:18:41.655
Not so fast!

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:44.658
I activate my trap card
Urgent Link!

00:18:44.658 --> 00:18:47.394
It cuts the damage
I take in half!

00:18:55.902 --> 00:19:00.074
Only 50 life points?
Guess that's better
than 0.

00:19:00.074 --> 00:19:02.376
Good to know
you can still count, Ai.

00:19:02.376 --> 00:19:04.844
Let's go!

00:19:10.283 --> 00:19:11.618
Grr!

00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:14.355
Go! Power Smash!

00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:16.289
(roaring)

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.831
Aah!

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.900
(thinking)
Even though I didn't
ask you to,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.503
you were willing to
sacrifice yourselves for me

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:32.539
that is an honor
I will never forget.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.475
Spectre, Dr. Genome...

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:38.045
Baira, Faust...

00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:40.180
I will not let you down.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.982
(Kogami)
So...

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:46.386
Did you manage to uncover
Playmaker's true identity?

00:19:46.386 --> 00:19:49.222
No.

00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:57.731
Hmm.

00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:01.234
Well, it some secrets
must remain a secret.

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:04.037
But given time,
your obsession will recede

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.873
until it's nothing more
than an itch

00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.342
in the back of your mind.

00:20:08.342 --> 00:20:12.046
(Kogami)
Never forget
that we cannot sacrifice

00:20:12.046 --> 00:20:14.281
the greater good
for a single duelist.

00:20:14.281 --> 00:20:17.384
The Ignis must be destroyed,

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:23.324
even if that means destroying
all of LINK VRAINS.

00:20:23.324 --> 00:20:26.293
If that makes us villains
in the eyes of the public,

00:20:26.293 --> 00:20:28.228
so be it.

00:20:32.866 --> 00:20:35.936
The Ignis are
my single greatest failure.

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:39.373
I should've never created AIs
with free will,

00:20:39.373 --> 00:20:42.810
but I did.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.112
So for humanity to exist,

00:20:45.112 --> 00:20:47.647
the Ignis must not.

00:20:51.718 --> 00:20:54.988
(thinking)
The Tower of Hanoi
will soon be complete,

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:56.991
but I'm sure Playmaker
will have something

00:20:56.991 --> 00:21:00.360
to say about it,
and I'll be waiting.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.797
Playmaker,
like many clueless heroes,

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.132
you don't realize
you're fighting

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:07.200
on the wrong side
of history.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.936
And if it's
our destiny to duel,

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:13.673
it's also my destiny
to end you.

00:21:13.673 --> 00:21:15.942
This I swear!

00:21:20.047 --> 00:21:22.949
