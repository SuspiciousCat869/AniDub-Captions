(Emma)
You're a mystery, Playmaker.

00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:10.610
And I do love a good mystery.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.649
When I have less
than a thousand life points,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.985
I can draw a new Link Monster
out of the Data Storm!

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.933
(Emma)
His Skill-- Storm Access-- is
unlike anything I've ever seen.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:37.438
He can manipulate data material
as if he's one with LINK VRAINS.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.406
But how does one get
such a skill?

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.175
I mean he couldn't
just learn it overnight.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.347
Maybe the secret lies
in his past,

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:48.849
but that's
an even bigger puzzle.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.918
Did you say three?

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.619
No way.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.455
Can it be you?

00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:55.956
After all of these years?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.592
(Playmaker)
Ten years to be exact.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.094
But I'm back to get justice!

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.896
Ooh, interesting.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.899
(Emma)
If there's an answer
to be found,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.235
it'll be in SOL Technologies'
data bank.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:11.004
They store everything
about everything.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:15.008
I like how they keep updating
their cyber security

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.843
to try to keep me out.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.079
(chuckling)
It's adorable.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:31.558
Just need to hack through a few
more access controls.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.526
Oh, yeah!

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.531
Wait, something's blocking
the core files.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.668
A Data Storm?

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.004
Why in the world is that
swirling around in here?

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.673
There's gotta be a way through.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.980
(gasping)

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.754
They really don't want me
snoopin' around in there.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.422
(sighing)

00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:05.159
Oh, well.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.927
That could've
gone better.

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:08.562
But whatever.

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:10.097
I'm not giving up.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:12.099
No system's every kept me out,

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:15.202
and the one thing I love more
than a mystery is a challenge.

I thought you'd never ask!

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.896
I'm a Pisces and I'm totally
free Saturday night!

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.564
I was going to ask
how long

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:53.667
you've been working
for SOL Technologies.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.968
Of course you were.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:56.870
But I'm still single,
just sayin'.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.672
Let's see one, two...

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.774
I joined the company
three years ago.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.544
So then you wouldn't
remember any data files

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.113
from a decade ago,
or am I wrong?

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:09.083
No, my security clearance
isn't really high enough

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:11.551
to be able to access
something like that anyway.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.721

I'm so close,
yet so far away.

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:16.757
I know how you feel.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:20.894
Due to my demotion,
I can't access those files.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.933
But I do happen to know
someone who can.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.870
Uh, thank you for
the extremely hot coffee.

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.438
Yes, sir!
You're welcome!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.742
I think that went really well!

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:38.178
What an amazing story to tell
to our grandkids!

00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:41.047
(Emma)
I heard they kicked you down
the corporate ladder.

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.186
So tell me, how small
is your office now?

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.222
Do you even
have an office?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.225
If those are the consequences
for saving my sister,

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.894
I would do it all
over again in a heartbeat.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:57.932
Even if it means having to work
my way up from the very bottom.

00:04:58.032 --> 00:04:59.900
Yeah, but it's still
gotta burn

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.938
that your bosses replaced you
with that toady Kitamura.

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.839
As difficult as he may be,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.508
he must have impressed
the higher-ups

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:09.442
with his dueling AI prototypes.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.814
Faster, people, faster!

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.683
Starting today your lunch hours
are cut to three minutes!

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:17.818
Understood?

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:20.320
If I even see you blink,
I'll fire you,

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.323
rehire you,
and fire you again!

00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:25.359
When my AI duelists
are 100% complete,

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.295
they'll hack up any hacker
hacking into LINK VRAINS!

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:30.931
And I'll hack myself a raise!

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.866
Say what you want
about him,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.836
but Kitamura always
shamelessly gets the job done.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.170
Ha!

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.607
A loyal company man
to the end, Akira.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.909
Well, I just don't know
how you do it.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:45.446
If it were me,
I'd be deleting files.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:48.014
But maybe you couldn't 'cause
they blocked your access.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.617
Too bad, I wanted you
to look up something for me.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.920
But seems that's
a non-starter.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:55.155
I wouldn't even
if I could.

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.290
Yeah, I knew
you'd say that.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.092
You'd surprise me
if you didn't.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.961
That's why I already tried

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:04.198
breaking into SOL Technologies'
databank earlier this morning.

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:05.532
Of course you did.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.167
Not to humblebrag,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.003
but I wrote a new backdoor
program and got pretty far.

00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:12.006
Just not far enough.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.975
But maybe someone else
can put it to better use.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:17.545
Fine, I'll share
what I uncover.

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:20.647
Oh, please, I wasn't talking
about you, Akira.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.183
You know I don't give
anything away for free

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.519
and some musty ol' files
won't cut it.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.153
(groaning)

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:31.058

Thought so.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.362
Besides, hacking
your own company's

00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:36.196
not good on your résumé.

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.699

some mysterious person helped me
get inside the Data Storm.

Looks like I'm not
the only hacker around here.

That's a security bypass.

the Ignis do whatever
they want to do,

because the Ignis,
they have free will.

And what the Ignis want to do

is bring an end
to the entire human race.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.550
Why would the Ignis bring
an end to humanity?

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.651

it's written in a cipher
that only I use.

So she sent you a code
using your code?

Yeah.

That makes it
extra super secure...

or she's just
showing off.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.871
Either way, it means
no snooping snoopers

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.940
can intercept and read
this message.

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:01.708
So what's it say?

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.677
She's challenging
you to a duel.

00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.046
Well not you you,
but Playmaker.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.414
And if she wins the duel,

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:09.282
she gets to take
possession of Ai.

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:10.717

No way my pal
Yusaku

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:14.455

Right, best friend

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:15.469
so I activate
Altergeist Protocol!

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.137
By destroying this trap,

00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.139
my Marionetter
pulls the strings

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:21.508
of a second Marionetter
in my graveyard

00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:23.143
to re-summon
her to my field!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.016
But she won't be
sticking around for long.

00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:32.153
Primebanshee tributes
my Marionetter!

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:34.488
Allowing me to summon
a different Altergeist

00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.157
from my deck next to
Primebanshee's link.

00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:40.860
Rise, Altergeist Meluseek!

00:17:44.932 --> 00:17:47.033
Next, I place one card
facedown.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:49.470
(Ai)
Is this for real?

00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:50.904
I thought she was
playing defense,

00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:53.240
but she summoned, like,
20-and-a-half monsters

00:17:53.307 --> 00:17:54.808
in one turn!

00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.409
What trick is she
gonna pull next?

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:01.048
(Frog)
How's the footage?

00:18:01.115 --> 00:18:02.583
(Pigeon)
Aces, boss!

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:05.386
But it's hard to stay in focus
while I'm carryin' ya.

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:07.487
Hey... no one's
payin' ya to complain.

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:10.724
With that,
I'm all set.

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.727
Now to get down to business.

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:14.995
I've analyzed your strategies,
Playmaker,

00:18:15.062 --> 00:18:17.664
and you're winning
these days using your new Skill,

00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:19.933
Storm Access.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.536
Sure it's one tough Skill
to beat,

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:25.772
but you can only
activate it during your turn.

00:18:25.872 --> 00:18:27.441
So...

00:18:27.541 --> 00:18:29.976
I'll make sure you never
get the chance to use it!

00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.615
(Ai)
My trash-talk translator

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:37.718
says she's aiming
to win this turn.

00:18:37.751 --> 00:18:40.888
But since we have this stylin'
Wizard to protect us,

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.322
she can't deal
enough damage

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:44.725
to wipe out all
of our life points.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:48.128
She's like a hot-air balloon--
full of hot air!

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:49.597
How's that
for trash talk?!

00:18:49.663 --> 00:18:50.731
(chuckling)

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:53.233
I refuse to believe
a duelist of her caliber

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.768
would be so careless.

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:56.870
Humans do dumb stuff
all the time!

00:18:56.937 --> 00:18:58.973
Are you calling
me dumb?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.442
I've never been
so insulted in my life.

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:02.943
At least I can count!

00:19:02.977 --> 00:19:03.977
You may have grown a body,

00:19:04.044 --> 00:19:05.346
but you sure have
a thin skin.

00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:07.047
Yeah, well...

00:19:07.114 --> 00:19:08.949
maybe--
wait, I have skin?

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.117
She traded monsters
with higher attack points

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.486
for weaker ones.

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.355
There's only
one reason for that.

00:19:14.455 --> 00:19:16.724
For their unique
special abilities.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.126
At least he's not dumb.

00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:20.694
That's right,
my Meluseek

00:19:20.794 --> 00:19:23.196
can attack you directly
even when you have a monster!

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:25.399
But that's not enough
damage to win!

00:19:25.465 --> 00:19:26.400
Humph!

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:28.435
Go, Altergeist Meluseek!

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:29.703
Ectoplaster!

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:38.645
(Ai)
That barely tickled!

00:19:38.712 --> 00:19:41.315
True, but when Meluseek
deals you damage,

00:19:41.381 --> 00:19:43.883
one card on your field
gets sent to the graveyard.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.953
And since you only have
one card out,

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:49.056
even that silly AI
can figure out which one.

00:19:49.123 --> 00:19:50.824
Ta-ta, Cyberse Wizard.

00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:52.859
We'll have nothing
to defend with?

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.328
This could've gone
better by, like, 100%.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.467
Her remaining monsters

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.703
have a total
of 3,700 attack points,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.272
while we only have
3,500 life points left!

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.274
37 is more than 35!

00:20:07.308 --> 00:20:10.544
Nice-- your AI can do
kindergarten math.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.213
But no formula
will save you!

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.049
Altergeist Marionetter,
attack Playmaker!

00:20:22.289 --> 00:20:23.356
(yelling)

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.128
(Pigeon)
Oh, Playmaker's gonna lose!

00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:29.529
He's actually gonna lose!

00:20:29.629 --> 00:20:30.898
And you know
who's gonna win?

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:32.132
We're gonna win!

00:20:32.165 --> 00:20:33.500
And our
bank accounts!

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.269
Yeah, but still,

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:36.703
I know we ought
to be celebrating,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.771
but I don't know how to feel

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.806
seein' LINK VRAINS's
hero going down.

00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:42.009
Our careers
are gonna be back on track

00:20:42.109 --> 00:20:44.811
but Playmaker's gonna get
ditched and dismissed.

00:20:44.878 --> 00:20:50.117
<i>Ghost Gal, your odds
of victory are at 99.9%.</i>

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:52.652
I thought you were something
special, Playmaker.

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:54.455
I'm disappointed.

00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:55.789
Oh well.

00:20:55.856 --> 00:20:57.124
I'll just
have to comfort myself

00:20:57.157 --> 00:20:58.325
with the pile of cash

00:20:58.392 --> 00:21:00.527
I'll get from
selling that AI.

00:21:01.695 --> 00:21:03.029
(Ai)
Come on, Playmaker,

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:05.398
you have one last trick
up your sleeve, right?

00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:06.400
Right?!

00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:07.400
Please?!

00:21:12.172 --> 00:21:14.407
