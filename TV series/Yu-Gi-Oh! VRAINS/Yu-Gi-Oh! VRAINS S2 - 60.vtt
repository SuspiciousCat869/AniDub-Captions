00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:04.304
(Narrator)
<i>Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh Vrains,</i>

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.106
(Bohman)
I've been ahead of you

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.308
(Bohman)
every step of this
duel Playmaker.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.577
(Bohman)
Haven't you figured it
out yet?

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:14.648
(Bohman)
Why it is that I'm able
to predict your every move.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.651
(Bohman)
It's because I am you
Playmaker.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.820
(Bohman)
And in turn you are me.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.621
Are you ready.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:21.822
I am.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:23.490
(Bohman And
Playmaker) Let's duel. I

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.326
(Playmaker)
Fusion Summon.

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.998
(Playmaker)
Rise up, Cyberse
Clock Dragon.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.001
(Cyberse Clock
Dragon roaring)

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.269
This is bad.

00:00:35.302 --> 00:00:37.304
If he attacks Bohman loses.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.145
(boom)
(Bohman screaming)

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:46.914
Playmaker.

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.982
You may have beaten
Bohman this time,

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.484
but next time things are
gonna end differently.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.822
Bohman's a powerful adversary.

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:57.791
So who could be strong
enough to control him.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:01.561
(Playmaker)
Whatever may come I will find
the one behind all of this.

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.501
(high energy music)

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.054
(chiming)

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:05.826
(Kolter)
So let me get this straight,

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.928
Bohman thought he was you?

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:11.731
Well I believe someone
manipulated his memories.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:12.967
Who would want to be
you?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.535
With all of your baggage.

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.370
Ah, no offense.

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:17.637
And finding out who,

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:19.607
will be the key to
saving your brother.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.808
That's easier
said than done.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.878
Yeah Flame's
babysitter is right.

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:26.781
Bohman was our only lead
and he vanished along

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.282
with Wendy's world.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.650
That's true.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:31.885
But Bohman will never stop
trying to hunt me down.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.554
We'll see him again.

00:02:33.587 --> 00:02:36.490
Then I guess all we can do
is sit tight and be patient.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.158
Would rather have
ended this asap,

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.993
but sometimes it's slow-sap.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.633
Come on bud, if you
got time to mope

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.535
you got time to check
out what I was working on

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.971
while you were
vacationing in Wendy land.

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:54.608
I did a little bit of renovating
and upgraded our systems. And

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:57.611
the crown jewel's
that baby over there.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.113
Now Playmaker and Soulburner

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.715
can log into link
Vrains simultaneously.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.684
I had to take out an
ice cream dispenser,

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:05.018
but I think it's worth it.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.287
Thank you.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.022
It's even in my
color Kolter.

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.356
You know it.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.458
Anyway, you might not
have captured Bohman

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.660
but you did gather
a lot of data.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.862
Maybe there's
something buried here.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.164
Let's roll up our
sleeves and start
digging.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.869
Say what?

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:24.471
There's a portal that
leads out of Link Vrains?

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:27.541
It'd be more accurate
to say there was a portal.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.642
But yes.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.111
What's that got to do
with finding Playmaker?

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:32.713
Everything in fact.

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.315
That's where Playmaker
was heading the other day.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.817
When you failed in your mission

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.886
to capture him or the Ignis.

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:40.520
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.689
But I believe you will be
afforded a second opportunity

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.624
to rectify this matter.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.694
As long as you remain patient.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:50.030
Our technicians predict the
portal wasn't a one-time event.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.798
And it will reopen.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:54.068
So the moment the
portal reappears

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.503
that's where Playmaker
will go, and so will you.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.773
So instead of
hunting for Playmaker

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:01.341
you expect me to wait
for a grand opening

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.676
that may never come.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.545
What I expect is for you
to behave like a professional

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.947
and be patient.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.281
Why does it sound like

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.350
you don't want me
to find Playmaker.

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.386
You can believe
what ever you like,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.855
but my orders are my orders.

00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:17.892
And I order you to
stand down Shepard.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:18.892
Understand?

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.394
Oh I understand.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.295
But I don't take orders.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.733
And I don't stand down.

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.435
Shepard we're not done here.

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:30.604
Yes we are.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.841
You hired me to hunt down
Playmaker and his Ignis.

00:04:33.874 --> 00:04:36.543
How I do it is my business.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.782
Way to keep your
troops in check Zaizen.

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.950
I don't think that
you'd do any better.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:50.290
(dramatic music)

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:04.437
SOL technologies may
have placed me in charge

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:08.175
of the bounty hunters, but
the very last thing I want

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:11.011
is for them to succeed
in capturing Playmaker.

00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:14.615
I can't say that'll look good
on your performance review.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:17.151
Be that as it may, I
believe that I've successfully

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:18.985
stalled them so that
we can try to find

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.355
Playmaker before they do.

00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:22.523
That's nice and all,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.624
but the one thing I
know about Playmaker

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:28.128
is that he can't be found, if
he doesn't want to be found.

00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:29.864
Yes but find him we must.

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:32.633
He still is the key to
finding the other Ignis.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.834
Well if he's not
showing up in Link Vrains,

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.837
we have to find him
in the real world.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.673
And that's like searching
for a needle in a hay stack.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.609
Except I'd recognize a
needle if I found one.

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.344
We've narrowed
his signal to within

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.679
the borders of Den city.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.648
But we can further
narrow down the search

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.683
by what we know
about his profile.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.621
We know he's a highly
skilled duelist and a hacker.

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.356
Remind you of anyone?

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.091
Other than me you mean?

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.627
There wouldn't be too
many of those around.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.627
Yes.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.430
And the players
avatar often mimics

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:03.831
their real life persona.

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:07.401
Their true persona that they
keep hidden from everyone.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:08.802
I'll keep my eyes open.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:12.039
For all we know Playmaker has
been right in front of us.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.575
But we just never
noticed him before.

00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:15.909
Did you get
your algebra test?

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:17.378
We're gonna be
late, forgot my lunch.

00:06:17.411 --> 00:06:18.511
Hey can I have some money?
(girls laughing)

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.480
Yusaku wait up!

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:20.313
Hey.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.585
(dramatic music)

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.887
Oh hey, what's up Sky.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.688
And you are?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.258
Ops my bad, I forgot
that me and you never met.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.226
I'm Theodore.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.827
And I'm late for class.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.562
And so are you Yusaku.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:36.396
Oh right.

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:39.766
I almost blew
my cover just now,

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.669
but pretty good save huh?

00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:43.303
I guess it wasn't the worst.

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:44.204
Hm.

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.239
Well that's good enough for me.

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.506
Yo, Sky!

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.576
Where have you been these days?

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:52.179
You skipped four duel
club meetings in a row.

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.081
I had stuff to do.

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:56.650
What's more important
than duel club.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:57.717
There's a duel club?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.587
Maybe I should go and sign up.

00:06:59.587 --> 00:07:01.489
Yeah you totally
should new guy.

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.624
It's the only club in
school where you could learn

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:05.659
pro-level strats
from yours truly.

00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:06.827
Learn from you?

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:08.495
What's with the skepticism.

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.164
You know you're talkin' to
Playmaker's sidekick right?

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:13.800
Ain't that so Yusaku?

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:15.102
So you claim.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.636
It's an established fact that

00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:18.972
he couldn't have beat the
Hanoi without my help.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.474
When we hung out the other day

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.977
he couldn't stop gushing
about how awesome I was.

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:27.214
So Shima says he's
Playmakers sidekick ah.

00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:29.950
He told me the same story
when I him in Link Vrains,

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.618
but I don't know
if I believe him.

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:34.788
I didn't know either, so
I double checked his story.

00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:36.457
Am I a sidekick?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.126
Well I'm actually more
than just a sidekick.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.228
You could call me
his best friend ever,

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.997
but I think that actually
cheapens the definition.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.465
(Sky) If you're that close

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:47.567
you must meet up
outside Link Vrains too.

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.604
Well, I didn't say that.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.273
But I didn't not say
that either (laughs).

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:56.576
So that means,
if we follow Shima,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.312
he could lead us to Playmaker?

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.380
That's possible.

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:02.550
Huh, I guess it really depends

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.852
on whether he's telling
the truth or not.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.720
If he really is
Playmaker's sidekick,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.522
you'd have the skills to match.

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:09.556
I agree.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:13.693
Hm, it wouldn't hurt to
put his skills to the test.

00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.963
And you're going to
help, or should I say,

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:18.732
Blue Angel is going to help.

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:19.566
Huh?

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:24.972
(crowd cheering)

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:25.872
Yeah!

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.042
I can't believe I got an invite.

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:30.977
A special fan fest for
only your most loyal fans.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.380
Meet and greet.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.714
Meet and greet.

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:36.216
Well if it isn't
The Brave Battler.

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:37.951
Playmaker's number one sidekick.

00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:39.453
Remember me hun?

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.688
How can I forget?

00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.557
Only one person
ever called me hun.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:46.527
And it wasn't my mother.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.830
It must be destiny that
we crossed paths again.

00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:51.131
I'm surprised
to see that you're

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:53.000
still in one piece superhero.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:55.703
Weren't you being hunted by
a bounty of bounty hunters.

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.371
You got a good memory.

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.541
But they all skedaddle once
they peeped my mighty muscles.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.209
You sure, how do
you know I'm not

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:03.511
one of those bounty hunters.

00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:04.544
Huh?

00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:06.680
Look who's scared.

00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.015
Well you should be.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.617
Playmaker's pal will
fetch a pretty penny.

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.453
Ah, no. Wait.

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:15.288
Unless you're actually
not Playmakers sidekick.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.957
So which is it?

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:19.026
The Brave Battler
is many many things,

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.695
but being a liar
isn't one of them.

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:23.730
You have to defeat me
if you want to catch me.

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:27.134
Let me warn you Ghost Gal,

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:30.337
I'd be lying if I said I
taught Playmaker all his tricks

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:33.707
because I only taught
him 99% of em' (grunts).

00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:35.342
Oh, impressive.

00:09:35.376 --> 00:09:38.078
(dramatic music)

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.715
(Ghost Gril And Brave
Battler) Let's duel.

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.016
(The Brave Battler laughs)

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:47.354
I'll go first.

00:09:47.388 --> 00:09:50.290
I summon Altergeist Silquitous.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.125
(Altergeist waning)

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.228
If you and Playmaker talk shop,

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:56.630
you must know
Silquitous has an
ability

00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:59.133
that let me return an
Altergeist to my hand,

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:01.735
to send one of your
cards back to your hand.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.105
Playmaker found a way to
deal with this monster

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:05.439
in our dueling and win.

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.773
So if you're really his bud,

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.943
he must of told you how to
take care of this nuisance too.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.613
Am I right Brave Battler?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.550
I mean this entire duel
must be a joke to you right?

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:21.121
I'll place these two cards
face down, and end my turn.

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.456
Hm, you're right.

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.558
This is no problem at all.

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.628
Because like you said, I
already knew (mumbling)

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:31.465
your Silquitous' has
a special ability

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:33.801
that lets you do that
thing against my thing

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.202
by you doing that thing.

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:38.439
But I can do my thing
to stop your thing

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:39.506
from doing that thing.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.541
All right ditch
the speak and duel.

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:42.943
Oh right. Um.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.611
It's my turn.

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:45.579
I draw!

00:10:52.253 --> 00:10:53.587
Hey.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.255
His opening move will prove

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.624
whether he's the
real deal or a fraud.

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:01.695
This is so flash.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.763
This is like the
perfect opening hand.

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.199
I can't believe it.

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:09.135
I got all the cards I need
to win on my very first turn!

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.339
No no no no no.

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:12.672
I gotta play it cool.

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:13.641
Here I go.

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.777
I'll start by summoning
my Scrap Kong.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.480
(Scrap Kong grunting)

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:20.514
Huh?

00:11:20.514 --> 00:11:22.816
And due to it's
special ability,

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.951
it immediately destroys itself

00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:26.787
and is sent to the grave yard.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.689
(Scrap Kong groaning)

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:29.790
(boom)

00:11:29.823 --> 00:11:30.691
Huh?

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:31.858
But when it's destroyed,

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:33.494
check this.

00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:36.030
I can summon Green Baboon
defender of the forest

00:11:36.096 --> 00:11:38.665
from my hand, by paying
1000 life points.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.070
That's a small price to pay
for a monster this flash.

00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.942
(Green Baboon grunting)

00:11:47.975 --> 00:11:49.577
But there's more.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.979
I activate this spell
card double summon.

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:58.018
Just like it sounds, I can
summon twice in one turn.

00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:00.987
So I summon another
Scrap Kong from my hand.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:03.824
(Scrap Kong grunting)

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:06.527
Like the one before,
it's also a scrap.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.828
(boom)

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.596
but I hit the replay switch,

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:11.899
to summon a second
Green Baboon.

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:13.534
(Green Baboon grunting)

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.535
I know those monsters
are pretty powerful,

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:17.637
but half your life
points powerful?

00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.206
Not sure.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.708
She must willing to
take some big risk.

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:23.644
That's a bold move.

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:25.245
You mean a brave move.

00:12:25.312 --> 00:12:27.715
A Brave Battler move.

00:12:27.748 --> 00:12:29.983
You know because of my name.

00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:32.586
(laughs) Nailed it, nailed it!

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:36.490
(Ghost Girl Voiceover)
He's acting really confident,

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.159
but I'm sure he knows that
since I have Silquitous

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:42.596
he can't win yet by attacking
with those two monsters.

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:44.198
No one's that foolish.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.934
Now you must know
that I can already win

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:49.203
by attacking with
these two monsters.

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.405
But I'd rather win in style.

00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:53.040
By Link Summoning.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:55.642
Watch me move my arm
up, and then down.

00:12:55.676 --> 00:12:59.413
And then to the side
to build my circuit.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.548
Oh yeah!

00:13:01.582 --> 00:13:03.651
You are so in for it now.

00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:05.952
The summoning conditions
are two level five

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.055
or higher beast type monsters.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:11.658
So I send both my Green
Baboon in the Link Garos.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:16.663
I Link Summon.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.067
Link two Metal Baboon,
ruffian of the forest.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.638
I Link Summon.

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:28.642
Link two Metal Baboon,
ruffian of the forest.

00:13:31.545 --> 00:13:33.314
I am not monkeyin' around.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.450
That's real live genuine
grade A Link monster

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.951
that's standing before yah.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:41.588
And all it took to get it, was
giving up everything I had.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.991
Oh.

00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.626
Why would he do that?

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.295
(Ghost girl Voiceover)
That wasn't a smart play.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.397
At all.

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:53.066
Ghost gal's totally
frozen in fear.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.236
She can't believe
what she's seein'.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:56.569
Ha!

00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:58.305
(Ghost girl Voiceover) I
can't believe what I'm seein'.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:13:59.606
Is this guy for real?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.309
He's done nothing to
counter my Silquitous,

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:06.113
and he gave up two Green Baboons
to summon one Metal Baboon.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:09.015
That cut his total
attack strength in half.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.651
These are potato level tactics.

00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:15.689
Unless these are superior
tactics that I can't comprehend.

00:14:15.723 --> 00:14:17.224
Just like with Playmaker.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:23.731
I won't say I'm gonna
win, but I'm gonna win.

00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:27.868
Metal Baboon force the
dark Silquitous to shreds.

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:31.539
I activate my trap.

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:34.374
Altergeist camouflage.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.310
I equip this trap
card on my Silquitous.

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.549
Since it's now camouflaged,

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:44.618
your monster isn't
allowed to attack it.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.720
Huh?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.623
And whenever I
activate a trap card,

00:14:49.656 --> 00:14:52.392
I can automatically summon
Altergeist Multifaker.

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:55.896
Now I have two monsters in play.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.668
But wait, I'm not
just stopping at two.

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:03.103
Multifaker's ability
allow me to summon

00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:06.606
a third Altergeist from
my deck in defense mode.

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.609
So here's Altergeist
Marionetter.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:14.948
Now I activate
Silquitous' ability.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:18.519
By returning an Altergeist
that's on my field,

00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.287
right back to my hand

00:15:20.287 --> 00:15:23.790
I can send your Metal
Baboon back to yours.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:25.359
Oh no you won't.

00:15:25.392 --> 00:15:28.462
Cause Link Monsters can't
be sent to the hand.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:29.729
Guess I out smarted you.

00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:33.734
Ah, he doesn't know the rules.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.103
(Ghost girl Voiceover) He
was never on Playmakers level.

00:15:36.103 --> 00:15:38.372
He was always potato.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.773
Sure looks like someone

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.075
should have cracked
open the rule book.

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.410
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:43.444 --> 00:15:46.280
With that certain
someone being you.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.783
I can still play my card
because if a Link Monster

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.554
is sent to the hand, it goes
to the extra deck instead.

00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:55.255
It does what to the what now?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.558
But my entire plan was
based on that technicality.

00:15:58.592 --> 00:16:00.461
That is so not fair.

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:02.362
(Brave Battler whining)

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:05.832
Oh wait, I can't let
her know I goofed.

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:06.533
That's right.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.501
Put on my poker face.

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.506
(clearing his throat) Yes,
I knew that would happen.

00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:16.510
I was just checking
if you knew the rules.

00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:18.511
And you passed
with flying colors.

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:21.014
If I was grading papers,
you wouldn't just get an A,

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.851
you get a smiley sticker too,
because that's what I do.

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:25.986
I don't just duel, I educate.

00:16:26.019 --> 00:16:27.621
I've heard enough.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:28.655
I draw.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.692
Oh oh.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.994
I think she's about
to teach me a lesson.

00:16:34.028 --> 00:16:37.297
Cause if she attacks me
with all of her monsters,

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.366
I won't just lose,
I'll get stomped

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.568
and womped like a bean bag.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.939
And that's the
last thing I want.

00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:47.641
If she only attacks me
with one of her monsters

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:50.644
instead of all of them, I'd
still have a fighting chance.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.646
But it's not like
she's gonna do that

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.414
unless I can convince her.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.150
You know Ghost girl.

00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.986
I intentionally put myself at a

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.722
disadvantage to teach
you about the rules.

00:17:01.755 --> 00:17:05.159
So even if you win, you
won't really win right?

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:06.060
(Ghost Girl moans)

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.594
So how bout making it fair?

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.697
Since I attacked you with
just one monster last turn,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.635
how bout you only attack me
with one monster this turn.

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:15.635
Sure!

00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:17.638
Only one attack.

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:18.705
No problem.

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.241
Seriously?

00:17:20.307 --> 00:17:22.075
Yes, you got yourself a deal.

00:17:22.142 --> 00:17:25.412
But that means I have to
make a few adjustments first.

00:17:27.748 --> 00:17:31.418
I set Multifaker and
Silquitous in the Link Arrows.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.522
I Link Summon.

00:17:34.555 --> 00:17:36.590
Link two Altergeist Hexstia.

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:47.568
(Altergeist Hexstia whining)

00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:49.069
1500 attack points.

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.705
Ha that's not
enough to beat me.

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.240
I bet you're
feeling comfortable

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.075
because you have
2000 life points.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:57.578
(Shima Voiceover) Shouldn't I?

00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:01.448
Well you shouldn't double
B, because Hexstia gains

00:18:01.482 --> 00:18:04.284
the attack points of the
Altergeist next to it's Link

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.654
and that's Altergeist
Marionetter.

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:08.889
With her 1600 attack points.

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.658
Oh yes, that would be a
slight problem (laughs).

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.561
I'm gonna lose.

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.896
I'm gonna lose, I'm gonna lose.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.165
I'm gonna lose.

00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:20.167
There's nothing slight
about your problem.

00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:23.203
But don't worry, it's
coming to an end.

00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:24.471
Here goes.

00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:28.475
Altergeist Hexstia
attacks you directly.

00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:30.477
No no!

00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:33.547
(boom)

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.585
(boom)

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:40.120
At least I stuck to landing.

00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:48.395
Instead of winning hands
down, I went belly up.

00:18:48.428 --> 00:18:49.830
I guess Playmaker
didn't teach you

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.599
all of his tricks did he?

00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.667
See you later Brave Battler.

00:18:56.136 --> 00:18:58.139
I don't think your
lead panned out.

00:18:58.139 --> 00:19:00.574
Yeah, if he really was
Playmaker's sidekick he would
have

00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:02.943
dueled you a whole lot better
than whatever that was.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.645
That's an understatement.

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:07.314
He lost so bad he
was almost in tears.

00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:08.215
Ah!

00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.683
Thanks for the
guilt trip.

00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:11.118
It's all my fault
in the first place,

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:13.120
cause I put you
on his tail.

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.389
Well I guess I can't
leave him broken.

00:19:15.389 --> 00:19:17.390
I better go do my
part and cheer him up.

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:20.027
No no.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.962
I let Playmaker down.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.064
If I didn't make
that one dumb mistake

00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:25.666
I could have won.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.567
I gotta train more.

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:28.502
And not let anything
distract me.

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:32.606
(electronic ringing)
Huh?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.641
Oh yeah!

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:35.676
Blue Angel's meet and greet.

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:36.543
Wa who!

00:19:36.543 --> 00:19:38.346
Training can come later.

00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:40.380
(laughs)
Yeah baby!

00:19:42.649 --> 00:19:44.651
Hey check this out.

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:47.688
The portal's reappeared,
but in a different location.

00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:50.524
Way up here among
the sky islands.

00:19:50.557 --> 00:19:53.360
It's a section of Link Vrains
that's still being built.

00:19:53.394 --> 00:19:55.162
So not many visitors go there.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.631
Well that's about to change.

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:00.734
It's imperative that
we arrive there first.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.503
Then let's get going.

00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:03.637
Sure thing.

00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:11.145
It's time.

00:20:11.178 --> 00:20:13.313
(Theodore And Yusaku)
To Link into the Vrains.

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:20.720
Well well well.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.223
It's the portal.

00:20:22.223 --> 00:20:24.525
This is about to
get interesting.

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:27.294
I heard the portal's
opened up Zaizen.

00:20:27.328 --> 00:20:28.895
So that's where I'm going.

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.799
(Zaizen) No that can wait,
the queen wants you back here

00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:34.367
at SOL tech for more
important matters.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.669
More important.

00:20:36.437 --> 00:20:38.271
Look there it is.

00:20:40.607 --> 00:20:43.877
Hm, doesn't that portal
look different than last time.

00:20:43.944 --> 00:20:45.812
We should still
go and check it out.

00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:49.483
(beeping from computer)

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:50.717
Wait.

00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:52.686
The Ignis didn't
create that portal.

00:20:53.687 --> 00:20:54.488
Oh man!

00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:56.290
It's a trap.

00:20:56.323 --> 00:20:57.324
(snap)

00:20:57.358 --> 00:21:00.494
(wind blowing)

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:03.797
(boom)
(Ignis screaming)

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.365
Hang on I.

00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:06.700
Hang on to what?

00:21:10.737 --> 00:21:11.538
Shepard.

00:21:12.606 --> 00:21:13.740
Playmaker.

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:18.211
(dramatic music)

00:21:21.882 --> 00:21:24.718
(Soulburner screaming)

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:25.552
Soulburner.

00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:30.523
Now watch this.

00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:33.860
(Takeru screaming)

00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:36.296
Soulburner, what's wrong?

00:21:40.468 --> 00:21:41.701
(Ignis)
Oh glitch.

00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:43.437
How are we gonna get to em' now.

00:21:43.504 --> 00:21:44.838
I wish that I knew.

00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:50.410
(dramatic music)
