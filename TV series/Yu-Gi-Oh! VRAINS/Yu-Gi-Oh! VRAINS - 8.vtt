00:08:44.916 --> 00:08:48.591
When the time comes,

I understand.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.066
I know very well that it

00:08:56.673 --> 00:08:59.846
(Kolter)
Bingo! The hospital's

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.083

So that means you don't
wanna know what I found?

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:13.507
<i>I didn't say that.</i>

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:15.076
Then it's settled.

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:16.479
Did you learn anything?

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.253
No. She barely has
any brain activity.

00:09:20.287 --> 00:09:21.756
Almost none at all.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.461
It's like her entire mind
has shut down.

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.866
<i>Shut down?
Aww, glitch!</i>

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.937
<i>I know what happened!
She has a virus!</i>

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.910
A virus?
<i>Yeah. A computer virus.</i>

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:34.481
<i>Your human brain
is your CPU,</i>

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:36.285
<i>so if it gets infected
with a virus</i>

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:39.626
<i>your whole body shuts down
like a PC in sleep mode.</i>

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:41.796
Humans can't get
computer viruses.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.167
<i>Oh, I didn't know
you had a medical degree,</i>

<i>Dr. Yusaku</i>

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:48.109
So Hanoi's card
was infected with a virus.

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:49.980
<i>Exactly!</i>

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:52.885
<i>Which Blue Angel activated
when she played that card.</i>

00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:54.889
<i>I knew something was off.</i>

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.864
<i>I had to reboot my taste buds
to get rid of the flavor.</i>

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:01.670
How do we get rid of
the virus?

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:03.940
<i>With an anti-virus,
of course.</i>

00:10:03.974 --> 00:10:06.045
<i>Since the Knights of Hanoi
created the virus,</i>

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:07.649
<i>they'll have the cure.</i>

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:10.119
<i>Not that they'll
hand it to us willingly.</i>

Perhaps, but there are
three reasons I must go.

One: This is our only lead
to curing Blue Angel.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.498
Two: I wish to learn
who would go through

so much of this trouble
and effort to deceive me.

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:44.509
And three: Just because
it's a trap

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:46.813
doesn't mean I will fall for it.

(wind rushing)

00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:36.264
(laughing)

00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:41.575
Hunh!
Uhn!

00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:53.031
Are you kidding?

00:18:53.064 --> 00:18:56.238
He can summon a data storm
at will?

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:58.209
(gasping)

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:01.516
I can destroy Link VRAINS
and everything in it--

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:03.252
including you.

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:06.458
But I only came here
for one reason.

00:19:06.492 --> 00:19:09.130
To acquire Playmaker's Ignis
from him.

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:11.035
And you think
I'll just stand by

00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:12.103
and do nothing?

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:14.007
That's exactly right.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.977
If you want to save
Blue Angel.

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:17.615
After all,
it was our card

00:19:17.648 --> 00:19:19.318
that infected her
with the virus.

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:21.321
It was?

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:23.492
But I am in possession
of an anti-virus

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:24.494
that can revive her.

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:27.534
If it's not too late, that is.

00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:29.437
Why did you do this?

00:19:29.471 --> 00:19:32.879
Why? Why did I infect
Blue Angel with a virus?

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:35.382
(chuckling)
Why not?

00:19:35.482 --> 00:19:39.057
I could have chosen to infect
anyone at all, really.

00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:42.030
But this target
was much too good to pass up.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.133
When she challenged Playmaker,

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:46.839
all it took was a simple
slip of a card.

00:19:46.872 --> 00:19:48.677
And look at the results.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.847
I couldn't ask for more.

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:53.520
You went and gift wrapped
Playmaker for me.

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:56.491
Ugh...

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:59.263
I'm challenging Playmaker
to a duel.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.201
And you will do
nothing but stand there

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.405
like a useless statue
and like it.

00:20:03.507 --> 00:20:05.176
If Playmaker wins,

00:20:05.243 --> 00:20:08.883
I'll give him the anti-virus
to cure Blue Angel.

00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:12.256
But if I win, not only
shall I take his Ignis...

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:14.662
she will never wake up again!

00:20:14.695 --> 00:20:17.702
That means Playmaker
controls her fate?

00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:19.872
But I do not trust Playmaker.

00:20:19.905 --> 00:20:22.110
You think you have a choice?

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.615
You do not.
You never did.

00:20:24.715 --> 00:20:28.589
You're not in control
of this situation.

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.564
Ugh, Akira...

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.505
Do not make me
regret this later.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.362
<i>Let's never
do that again, okay?</i>

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.701
Heh! I'll be waiting...

00:20:50.734 --> 00:20:51.702
Playmaker.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:53.472
(wind rushing)

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:59.885
<i>You know you're allowed to say
no to all this, right?</i>

00:20:59.918 --> 00:21:03.325
Varis must answer
for what he has done.

00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:07.500
Playmaker.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.205
I-I don't know
what to say.

00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:12.811
You're going to duel him
to save my sister,

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:15.650
even after everything
that I put you through,

00:21:15.684 --> 00:21:18.789
refusing to believe
anything that you said.

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:20.493
But you will still fight
to help me

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:22.664
when you really
should despise me.

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:24.668
I forgive you.

00:21:28.475 --> 00:21:31.015
♪♪♪

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.318
But I will never forgive

00:21:33.351 --> 00:21:35.322
the Knights of Hanoi.
