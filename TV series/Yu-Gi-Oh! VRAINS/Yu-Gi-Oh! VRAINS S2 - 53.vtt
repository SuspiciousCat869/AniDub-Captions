I need you to find the
whereabouts of all the Ignis.

I know where two of them are,
with Playmaker and Soulburner.

But as for the remaining four,
that's where you come in.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.613
They could have been
destroyed with the Cyberse

throughout the network.

out what happened to them.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:50.890
Didn't SOL Tech just hire a
whole bunch of bounty hunters?

You must have heard
that Playmaker

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.841
was attacked a few days ago
but what you may not have heard

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:11.345
was that his attacker fled
into the restricted area.

00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:12.680
But he didn't stop there.

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:15.081
He went beyond the
restricted area,

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.284
which we never
thought was possible.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.853
That would make it the
perfect place to hide out

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.088

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:25.359

hiding in there as well?

contact with them.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.331
That's better.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.201
Unlike you, blue's
so not my color.

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:55.202
Huh?

00:09:02.276 --> 00:09:03.777
Hey.

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:06.714
So what's the deal with the
new, updated look there?

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.016
I didn't come here
to entertain anymore,

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:10.517
I'm here on a mission.

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:11.685
Okay.

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:12.686
But without your wings,

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.289
you're not really a Blue
Angel anymore, are you?

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.457
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:17.524 --> 00:09:19.760
What if I call you Blue Gal?

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:24.064
Or what if you don't name
me after your own avatar?

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.465
Does that work for you?

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:27.201
Okay, whatever.

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:30.271
(The Shepherd) There's
nowhere to run, Playmaker!

00:09:30.338 --> 00:09:31.538
(Ai)
Yes, there is!

00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:34.208
But I don't feel like
running anymore, Ai.

00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.509
Let's duel!

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:36.543
(The Shepherd laughs)

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.112
(The Shepherd)
Yes, let's.

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:42.449
Running will only
delay the inevitable.

00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.017
(Both) Time to Speed Duel!

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:51.091
(The Shepherd)
I'm going first.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:53.961
I draw.

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:57.197
I'll start by
summoning Drone Pawn.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.467
(Ai)
600 attack points, that's it?

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:03.003
That drone is weaker
than a decaf latte.

00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:06.039
I'd hate to drone on
and on and on and on--

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.940
But you are.

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:11.745
(The Shepherd) I place one
card face down and end my turn.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:13.047
(Ai laughs)

00:10:13.047 --> 00:10:13.947
(Ai)
Nice!

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:16.283
He totally bricked his turn.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.053
We can summon any old monster
to take down that drone.

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:21.855
(Program) That
analysis is incorrect.

00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:24.458
When there are no other monsters
on The Shepherd's field,

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:27.227
Drone Pawn cannot be
destroyed in battle.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.096
The opponent's AI must
either be extremely outdated

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.765
or full of bugs.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.267
I recommend you
upgrade your duel disk.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.204
(Ai) And you should download
an app called nobody asked!

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:39.673
You can't upgrade perfection!

00:10:39.706 --> 00:10:42.042
But your analysis
was incorrect.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:43.611
(Ai) I know.

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:44.711
(The Shepherd chuckles)

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:47.548
(The Shepherd)
Looks like I have the advantage.

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:48.715
(Program)
Not necessarily.

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:50.617
Playmaker acquired
a new Link monster

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:53.453
in his most recent duel:
Shootingcode Talker.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.889
Its special ability
allows it to attack

00:10:55.922 --> 00:10:57.791
multiple times in
a single battle.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.262
So if Playmaker manages
to summon that monster,

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:04.264
it can attack Drone
Pawn twice in a row

00:11:04.297 --> 00:11:06.299
to deal you extensive damage.

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:08.135
(Ai)
Exactly!

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.402
(The Shepherd groans)

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:10.171
(The Shepherd)
Then it was a mistake

00:11:10.237 --> 00:11:12.740
to summon my Drone Pawn?

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:14.108
(Ai)
I was right!

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:19.479
I am smarter than you and your
Ai and even your sombrero!

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:21.582
Are you jelly?

00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:22.649
(The Shepherd) No.

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.151
(Ai) No one's ever jelly.

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.287
(Emma) According to my scans,

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:30.523
Playmaker's dueling,
great, The Shepherd.

00:11:31.158 --> 00:11:32.092
(Skye)
The Shepherd?

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:33.360
Sounds dangerous.

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:37.831
Blue Gal, you have no idea.

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:38.699
(gasps)

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:41.334
We worked together years ago.

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.437
Me, The Shepherd,

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.105
and your brother.

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:48.408
We tracked down this hacker on
the world's most wanted list

00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:52.145
and let me tell you, he really
didn't want to get captured.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.681
Go away!

00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:56.683
(booming)

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.720
Or I'm gonna set off
this digitizer right now!

00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:02.355
I mean it!

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.192
That cube has the power to
destroy this entire realm.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.860
(Hacker) I don't
see you leaving

00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:09.763
and my trigger finger's
getting really itchy.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:10.831
(Emma)
What do we do?

00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:12.032
Not sure.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.500
But we have to
think this through.

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:15.902
(The Shepherd)
I don't feel like thinking.

00:12:15.969 --> 00:12:18.171
You two can play peacemaker,

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:21.141
but I'm done wasting
my time on this joker.

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:22.676
(Hacker) Leave me alone!

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.510
(The Shepherd)
No.

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:26.880
Instead, we'll give you
until three to surrender.

00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.549
What?!
Or we're coming to get you.

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.152
One.

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:35.322
(gasping)
No, I have the power here!

00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.023
Not you, you hear me?

00:12:37.057 --> 00:12:40.093
(The Shepherd)
Oh, I heard you, two.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.695
We have no choice.

00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:42.696
Get set.

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:45.366
(The Shepherd)
Three!

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.399
Let's move.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.635
(booming)

00:12:49.503 --> 00:12:51.071
Shepherd?

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:53.707
Take this!
(blasting)

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.376
(Emma groans)

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.878
Oh, no!

00:12:57.912 --> 00:12:59.479
(blasting)
(yells)

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:01.315
(cackling)

00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:03.416
(booming)

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.451
Bye, bye!

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.321
(groans)

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.225
(blasting)

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:14.294
(booming)
(groaning)

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:16.563
(yelling)

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.236
I can't believe Shepherd used
us as a distraction.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:24.571
Watch out, he
activated the digitizer!

00:13:26.373 --> 00:13:27.708
(binging)

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:29.142
Can't get a clear shot!

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:32.279
(The Shepherd)
Amateurs.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:33.247
(Emma gasps)

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.916
Move, Emma.
(Emma grunts)

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.785
(whirring)
(explosion booming)

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:45.459
(glass shattering)
(groaning)

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.128
♪♪♪

00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:01.876
That was close.

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:03.176
Are you okay?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.878
(Emma)
Bit dusty, but I'll live

00:14:04.945 --> 00:14:07.481
Well, Shepherd,
you almost succeeded

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.350
in taking out both
your partners.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:10.684
(The Shepherd)
Partners?

00:14:10.718 --> 00:14:12.385
We're not partners.

00:14:12.452 --> 00:14:15.856
We were just hunting the
same target, that's all.

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:19.126
Now be a good boy and
handle the cleanup.

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:22.462
We are not done!
(whooshing)

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.332
Well, fine, and good riddance.

00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:28.268
I hope we never have to
see or hear from him again.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.773
Huh, my brother
was a bounty hunter?

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.110
He never talks about those days.

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:39.346
Eh, don't sweat
it, you know him.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.949
He keeps secrets to protect
others from getting in trouble.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.785
Although I think in this case,

00:14:44.818 --> 00:14:47.121
Mr. Prim and Proper was
embarrassed to admit

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:49.189
that he can loosen
up his suit and tie.

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:50.691
The Shepherd on the other hand?

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.159
Nothing loose about him.

00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:54.295
He'd rather risk
everything and everyone

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.029
than let his bounty escape.

00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:59.800
(Yusaku)
The path ahead splits in two.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:01.435
Which way, Kolter?

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:02.569
Give me a sec.

00:15:02.603 --> 00:15:04.070
(Ai)
We don't have a sec!

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.406
(Kolter)
Then you'd better find one!

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.741
Okay, take the left.

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:09.509
Understood.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.847
(Ai yells)

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:16.517
(Ai)
I'm gonna launch my lunch!

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.952
(Ai gags)
Now hit a 180.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.454
That'll take you
towards the core.

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:21.422
(Ai yells)

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:22.556
(Ai)
Okay!

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:25.859
Now let's get this
stinker off our tail!

00:15:25.893 --> 00:15:27.227
It's my turn.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.595
I draw!

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:30.897
I summon Clock Wyvern.

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:35.069
(roaring)

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:38.739
My Clock Wyvern's special
ability now activates.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:40.508
By cutting its attack
points in half,

00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:42.343
I can summon a Clock Token.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:44.244
(electronic whirring)

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:45.745
(Ai)
About time!

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.415
And when I have a Cyberse
monster on my field,

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.118
I can then summon Backup
Secretary straight from my hand!

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.120
Come on out!

00:15:53.187 --> 00:15:56.924
(cackling)
(beeping)

00:15:57.224 --> 00:16:00.527
That's just what
we need to Link Summon!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.529
The summoning
conditions are two

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:05.198
level three or higher
Cyberse monsters.

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:10.771
I Link Summon Link Two Elphase!

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:12.807
(beeping)

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.007
That one-two
punch is gonna

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:15.575
knock this guy to the curb.

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:18.645
Unless his
facedown card can counter us.

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:21.682
No, it cannot be
used against Link Monsters.

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:23.183
(The Shepherd)
Don't tell him.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.251
(Ai)
You heard 'em.

00:16:24.284 --> 00:16:26.620
The coast is clear
like a lemon-lime soda,

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.255
so let's pop 'em good!

00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:30.924
I create the ultimate circuit!

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:32.926
The summoning conditions require

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.462
at least two Cyberse monsters.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:40.367
So I set my Clock Token and
Elphase in the Link Arrows.

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:41.802
(whirring)

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.837
I'm Link Summoning.

00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:46.806
Link Three, Shootingcode Talker.

00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:49.676
(shouts)

00:16:52.346 --> 00:16:53.480
(whirring)

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.651
I'm Link Summoning, Link
Three, Shootingcode Talker!

00:16:57.685 --> 00:16:59.352
(beeping)

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:00.887
(Ai cackles)

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.390
(Ai) You're in
for it now, Sheppy.

00:17:03.424 --> 00:17:05.358
Shootingcode Talker's
the exact monster

00:17:05.392 --> 00:17:07.761
your Duel Disk warned you about.

00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.997
For every monster
it's linked to,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.733
Shootingcode Talker
gains one extra attack.

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:15.236
That means it can strike
ya twice this turn.

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:18.672
But when the opponent only
has one monster out like now,

00:17:18.706 --> 00:17:21.041
Shootingcode Talker
is going to lose

00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:23.343
400 of its total attack points.

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:24.711
(Program)
Analyzing.

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:27.347
When Shootingcode Talker
attacks Drone Pawn,

00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.983
you will take 1300
points of damage.

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.017
(Ai)
Ding ding ding!

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:33.253
(Program)
Then Shootingcode
Talker can attack again

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.355
for 1300 more points of damage,

00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:38.692
resulting in a total
loss of 2600 life points.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.995
However, Drone Pawn
has a special ability

00:17:41.028 --> 00:17:42.997
that restores all the
damage you receive,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.366
bringing you back
to 4000 life points.

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:47.500
Wrong!
(buzzing)

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:50.471
You won't get a chance to
use that special ability,

00:17:50.504 --> 00:17:52.839
not when I have Elphase!

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:53.707
(shouts)

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.375
Since I used it to Link Summon,

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:58.979
its ability let's me resurrect
a Cyberse from my graveyard.

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:01.314
Rise again, Clock Wyvern!

00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:03.450
(Program)
Reanalyzing.

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:04.985
There is now an
additional monster

00:18:05.052 --> 00:18:06.754
linked to Shootingcode Talker,

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:09.389
allowing it to attack
for a third time

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.392
and if Playmaker also attacks
with his Clock Wyvern,

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:15.462
you will run out of life
points and lose the duel.

00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:17.164
(Ai) And I know
you can't stop us

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.299
'cause your Duel Disk said
that your facedown card

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.135
can't be used against
Link Monsters.

00:18:22.202 --> 00:18:26.640
(The Shepherd)
Yes, my Duel Disk did say that,
didn't it?

00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:27.742
(Ai)
Huh?

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:30.543
(The Shepherd)
I activate my facedown card,

00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:32.379
Capture Drone!

00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:36.249
This trap card prevents
one of your Link Monsters

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:40.053
from attacking or using
its special abilities.

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:44.592
So your Shootingcode Talker
is rendered less than useless.

00:18:44.592 --> 00:18:45.592
(Ai)
What?!

00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:48.228
(whirring)

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.797
(The Shepherd)
I just laid out the welcome mat

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.167
and you walked
right into my trap.

00:18:54.468 --> 00:18:55.769
(Ai)
Hold it right there!

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.872
Your AI said it couldn't
activate that card.

00:18:58.872 --> 00:19:00.507
(The Shepherd)
It lied.

00:19:00.774 --> 00:19:02.676
(Ai)
It lied?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.146
You programmed your AI to lie?!

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.717
(The Shepherd)
Yeah and it wasn't that hard
either.

00:19:09.984 --> 00:19:13.620
(Ai)
That's, that's cheating, you
cheating cheater!

00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:15.122
(The Shepherd)
No, it's not.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:15.723
(Ai)
What?!

00:19:15.723 --> 00:19:16.990
Yes, it is!

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.692
(The Shepherd)
No, it's not.

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:21.495
It's your fault for
believing what it said.

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.564
(Ai)
You are giving
awesome and honest AIs

00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:24.899
like me a bad name!

00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:26.066
(The Shepherd)
Come now.

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:30.303
You of all things know that
an AI is not to be trusted.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:32.305
(Ai gasps)
And for that error,

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:35.141
you will pay the ultimate price.

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:39.479
I place a card
facedown and end my turn.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.948
I draw!

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:45.952
And forge a circuit
to hunt my prey.

00:19:45.986 --> 00:19:49.356
The summoning condition
is one drone monster,

00:19:49.389 --> 00:19:52.125
so I set Drone Pawn
in the Link Arrow

00:19:52.159 --> 00:19:55.662
to Link Summon Link One
Battledrone Sergeant.

00:19:57.464 --> 00:19:58.565
(beeping)

00:19:58.632 --> 00:19:59.900
(Ai cackles)

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.269
(Ai)
You may have chained
up our Shootingcode Talker,

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:04.605
but your biplane doesn't
have the firepower

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:07.107
to destroy it with
just 800 attack points,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.611
so all your lies still
left you high and dry.

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:13.380
(The Shepherd)
You really are the most
beef-headed AI

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:14.981
that I have ever met.

00:20:15.015 --> 00:20:16.316
(Ai)
Huh?

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:17.651
I don't know what that means,

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:20.988
but it did not sound
like a compliment.

00:20:21.021 --> 00:20:24.157
(The Shepherd)
I activate Capture Drone's
effect.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.694
For every Link Arrow that
your Shootingcode Talker has,

00:20:27.728 --> 00:20:30.497
I get to summon a drone token.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.200
(Program)
Shootingcode Talker
possesses three Link Arrows

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:35.669
so you can summon three tokens.

00:20:35.702 --> 00:20:39.706
(The Shepherd)
And this time, my Duel Disk
isn't lying.

00:20:39.773 --> 00:20:41.107
Come on out!

00:20:41.141 --> 00:20:43.476
(whirring)

00:20:44.511 --> 00:20:47.447
(Ai)
Uh oh, with
those three monsters,

00:20:47.481 --> 00:20:49.449
he can Link Summon again!

00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:52.152
(The Shepherd)
Congratulations.

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:54.555
You finally got something right.

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:58.358
The summoning conditions
require at least two drones.

00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:03.397
So I set all three drone
tokens in the Link Arrows.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.834
I Link Summon Link Three
Battledrone General.

00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:10.871
(booming)
(electricity crackling)

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:12.105
(beeping)

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.207
(Ai)
Aw, glitch!

00:21:13.207 --> 00:21:15.409
I thought we had
victory in our sights,

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:18.745
but now I'm seeing
he's got us in his!

00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:23.183
♪♪♪

00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:29.723
