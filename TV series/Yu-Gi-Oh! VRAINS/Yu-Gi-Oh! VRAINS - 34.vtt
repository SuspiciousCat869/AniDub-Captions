WEBVTT

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.437
(Ai)
Previously
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.608
(Spectre)
I know everything about you.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.843
(Blue Angel)
There's no chance I'm
gonna let you spook me

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.979
from playing my game,
Spectre!

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.914
I know how you lost those
you cared about as a child.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.251
I know there was
a hole in your heart

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:19.520
that could not be filled
until your brother

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.623
read you a story about
a certain Blue Angel.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:25.125
An angel that could understand
what you're going through

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.795
and show you that you do not
have to struggle alone.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:30.531
Isn't that so?
Grr!

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.966
And now here you stand

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.002
before my very eyes
so vibrant and strong.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.836
Fighting to save
this world.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.105
It's wonderful.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.575
Only if the ending
wasn't so tragic!
Grr!

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:42.810
I Link Summon!

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.780
Link 1 Sunvine Thrasher!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.983
Attack Trickstar
Holly Angel!

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:51.284
Hyah! Ahh!

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:53.787
Unh!

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.455
Holly Angel's mine!

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.626
Now you've learned that
friendship can be so fleeting.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.795
(thinking)
Not only can't I attack him,

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:03.197
but he's also stealing
my best monsters.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.664
Chopping down his tree

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:07.701
is the key to breaking
his combo, but how?

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.870
There has to be a way.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.073
It's a slim chance,
but it's my only chance!

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:17.010
And possibly,
my last chance!

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.980
(theme music playing)

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:20.407
(Ai)
The first ring of the tower's
almost complete,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.076
so that means we only have about
five hours left.

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.412
If you got some extra gas
in your caboose,

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:26.947
you better light it or you'll
never get your chance

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.548
to take down Varis.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.918
I've had enough
of your games, Varis!

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:34.922
But the games have
only just started.

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:38.558
And the only way for you
to win is to defeat me.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.661
So, um, for the sake
of argument,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.796
suppose you fail
to defeat Varis.

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:43.998
You plan on
setting me free?

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.900
Losing to Varis
is not an option

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.934
that I am
remotely considering.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.903
Uh, okay.
Good talk.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.979
(Blue Angel)
The play field says Spectre
has this duel on lockdown,

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.981
but my hand tells
a different story.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.818
If I play this perfect
and get lucky,

00:03:03.818 --> 00:03:07.721
really lucky,
I just might break his combo.

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:12.392
I summon Trickstar Candina

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:13.393
in attack mode!

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:16.329
(giggles)

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.499
And just the same
as last time,

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.135
I can add
a Trickstar card in my deck

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:22.603
straight to my hand!

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.104
Next, I'll build the circuit

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.139
that turns dreams
into reality!

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.943
The summoning conditions
require two Trickstars.

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:32.146
So I set Trickstar Lycoris
and Candina

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:33.647
in the Link Arrows!

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:35.316
I Link Summon!

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:38.685
Link 2
Trickstar Crimson Heart!

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.858
And when I Link Summon her,

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:48.996
my Field Spell Trickstar
Light Arena is activated!

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:50.864
It resurrects
one of my Trickstars

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:52.966
I used to summon
Crimson Heart!

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.801
Come on back, Candina!

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:00.708
And since I summoned her next
to Crimson Heart's link,

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.377
I regain 200 life points.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.412
I discard a Trickstar
from my hand

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:09.083
to activate Crimson Heart's
second ability!

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:12.086
So now we each get to draw
one card from our decks.

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:15.756
(thinking)
And I hope
it's the one I need.

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:16.857
Nice!

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.225
Here I go!

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.562
I activate my spell
Trickstar Bouquet!

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.064
By returning
Candina to my hand,

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:26.133
this spell lets one
monster on the field

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.204
have her attack points,
all 1800 of 'em!

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:33.039
But I'm not powering up
my monster, Spectre.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.508
I'm giving
those attack points

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:36.410
to your
Sunavalon Dryades.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.679
That's kind of you, I guess.

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.347
No, it's really not.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:43.383
I only did it so I could
play Trickstar Temptation.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.686
Since your monster's
attack points changed,

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:47.054
it returns to your hand!

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.522
Ahh... How unexpected.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:51.458
Blue Angel's bustin' out
the moves,

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.360
but Specter's
not fazed at all.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.696
Yeah, but that's because
his emotional range

00:04:55.696 --> 00:04:58.432
is somewhere between
a concrete block and a turtle.

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:01.135
Skye can duel better
than I thought.

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.970
You think she'll win?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.439
She must.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.274
If you get rid
of my Dryades,

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.444
you'll most certainly
have me at a disadvantage.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:11.745
Obviously.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.414
Why do you think
I'm doing it?

00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:15.616
I didn't think
you'd be so rude.

00:05:15.616 --> 00:05:17.117
Rude?

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:19.453
Look, are you
a duelist or a magazine?

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:21.121
'Cause you sure got issues.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:22.789
Just 'cause you didn't have
any friends growin' up

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.624
doesn't mean you gotta
take it out on the world.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:26.694
Easy for you to say.

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:28.462
As alone as you felt,

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:30.531
you had a brother
looking out for you.

00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.366
So your misery
was by choice,

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.601
while I never had
such an option.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.270
Don't be warping
my life story

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.072
just so you can
prove a point.

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:41.775
Fine... but it's
not like I'm wrong.
Mmm!

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.611
All right, Trickstar
Temptation, it's time!

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:47.281
Get rid of his Dryades!
(laughing)

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.517
Since my Dryades forms
the crux of my strategy,

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.821
you know that I would never
allow that to happen.

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.789
Now, Sunvine Maiden!

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.592
Activate your
special ability!

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:00.961
Not only do I get
to summon her,

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.030
but she also negates
Trickstar Temptation's effect!

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.069
Great.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.205
All of that added up
to a whole lot of nothing.

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.906
Now, what was it you played?

00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:15.909
Five, six, seven cards to
try to get rid of my monster?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.146
Ha! And I stopped it
with one card!

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:20.681
Grr!

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.984
I'm placing one card facedown
and ending my turn.

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:26.687
And by doing so,
Sunavalon Dryades's

00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.657
attack points
drop down to 0.

00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:32.025
Do you want to know why

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:34.394
you can never
defeat me, Blue Angel?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:37.498
Because though you think
your tough times
made you strong,

00:06:37.498 --> 00:06:40.835
they were nowhere near
as difficult as mine.

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.637
While you whined about
loneliness in the light,

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.539
I was stuck in a dark canyon

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.809
where even the concept
of light did not exist.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.044
What I would have given

00:06:50.044 --> 00:06:52.813
to live your life...
but alas.

00:06:52.813 --> 00:06:55.082
At least mine will continue

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:58.986
while you will be
stuck here forever... Oh!

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:02.989
And with this card,
it will most certainly be so.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.394
(laughing)

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:10.297
Now, watch as I manifest
my circuit!

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:14.000
I require at least
two plant-type monsters.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.571
So I set my Sunvine Maiden
and my Sunavalon Dryades

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.906
in the Link Arrows!

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:22.276
Link the circuit!

00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:25.279
(laughing maniacally)
I Link Summon!

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:28.715
My Link 3
Sunavalon Dryanome!

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.460
Whoa, Spectre's deck has more
trees in it than the Amazon!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.097
Next, by discarding
one card from my hand,

00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:46.934
I activate the effect
of my Sunvine Shrine.

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.102
It lets me bring
a Plant monster

00:07:49.102 --> 00:07:53.407
back from my graveyard
to re-pollinate my field.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.910
Rise again,
my Sunseed Genius Loci!

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.949
However, it won't be around
for long.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.817
(chuckling)

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.153
Because I'm using it to
Link Summon again!

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.290
The summoning condition
requires just one Plant monster,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.662
so I set Sunseed Genius Loci
in the Link Arrow!

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:17.831
(laughing maniacally)
I Link Summon!

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.302
Link 1 Sunvine Thrasher!

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:25.806
Since Sunvine Thrasher is
linked to Sunavalon Dryanome,

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.941
it gains 800 attack points

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:30.310
for every link
that Dryanome has.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.514
So, 800 multiplied
by 3 equals...

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.682
Well, tragedy for you.

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.320
Now it's stronger
than my monster!

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.824
And my Sunvine Thrasher has
an additional special ability

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:46.560
that allows me to steal
the monster it destroys
in battle.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.794
Grr!

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:49.363
Go, Thrasher!

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.698
Attack Trickstar
Crimson Heart!

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.667
Hyah!

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.035
Oof!

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.505
Grr!

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:00.307
Well, I can
still play this!

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.010
Due to Trickstar
Light Arena's effect,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.046
instead of me taking
a crazy amount of damage
from this battle,

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.749
I'm gonna gain a whole
lotta life points!

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:11.885
I do so admire you
for finding the one positive

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:13.788
in your hopeless situation.

00:09:13.788 --> 00:09:15.889
But those life points
are nothing more

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.691
than an insignificant
impediment

00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.594
since I still gain control
of your CRIMSON HEART.

00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.376
Another Trickstar
has abandoned you.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.513
But since you've been so kind
to share your monsters,

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:42.249
allow me to repay
your generosity.

00:09:42.249 --> 00:09:44.418
With an attack!

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:47.054
Unh!

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.689
(groaning)

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:52.692
Crimson Heart wants
to thank you as well.

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.230
Hyah!

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.533
Unh!

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:02.402
(chuckling)
I end my turn.

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:05.239
(thinking)
Specter has more
life points than me,

00:10:05.239 --> 00:10:07.341
more monsters than me...

00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:09.877
but he doesn't have
more heart than me!

00:10:09.877 --> 00:10:13.546
As long as I'm in this duel,
I still have a chance!

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:17.584
It's my turn!

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.920
I summon
Trickstar Nightshade!

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.957
(cooing and laughing)

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.561
And I'll use her
to build my circuit!

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.631
To Link Summon,

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:33.066
I require one Trickstar.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:36.836
So I set Trickstar Nightshade
in the Link Arrow!

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.205
I Link Summon!

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.840
Link 1 Trickstar Bloom!

00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.847
And due to her
special ability,

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:49.549
you get to draw
one card from your deck.

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.752
It seems there's no end
to your generosity.

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.556
Thank you for this present
my dear.

00:10:55.556 --> 00:10:57.758
I wouldn't thank me
just yet.

00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:00.794
You see, since I used Trickstar
Nightshade to Link Summon,

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:03.330
I can resurrect her
from the graveyard!

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.832
That means I have
all the monsters I need

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.969
to Link Summon
for a second time this turn!

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:13.340
I set Bloom and Nightshade
in the Link Arrows!

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.276
I Link Summon!

00:11:15.276 --> 00:11:18.679
Link 2 Trickstar
Black Catbat!

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.948
But the link train
doesn't stop here!

00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.616
I use my Light Arena

00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:26.420
to resummon Nightshade!

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.155
She's not only the key
to Link Summoning

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:29.856
for a third time in a row,

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.826
but she holds my key
to victory!

00:11:31.826 --> 00:11:34.161
I set Trickstar Nightshade

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:38.031
and Trickstar Black Catbat
in the Link Arrows!

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.905
I Link Summon!

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:48.074
Link 3
Trickstar Delfiendium!

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:54.348
I've never seen that before!

00:11:54.348 --> 00:11:56.449
Uh, yeah,
because it's new.

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.319
Just like this
sweet trap card.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:01.321
Trickstar Maribold returns
a Trickstar in my grave

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:03.857
to my hand and lets me
summon another monster.

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:05.426
So I regain
Trickstar Lycoris

00:12:05.426 --> 00:12:07.494
and summon
Trickstar Candina!

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:08.762
(giggles)

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:11.198
And Candina's ability
lets me draw

00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:13.400
another Lycoris
from my deck.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.836
Next, I place
one card facedown.

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:17.571
Here I go!

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.206
Delfiendium is attacking
your Crimson Heart!

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:23.677
And you'll think she's O.P.
when she uses her ability!

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:25.646
For every Link Monster
on your field,

00:12:25.646 --> 00:12:28.648
I get to retrieve a card
that's been banished!

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:29.849
You what?

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:31.418
Since you have
four Link Monsters

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.687
and I only have three
banished cards...

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:36.356
You get them all back?
Oh, no!

00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.925
You mean, oh, yes!

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:41.028
I get to add all three
Trickstar Reincarnations

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:42.696
straight back to my hand!

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:44.999
But that's only the start.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:47.167
Delfiendium gains
1000 attack points

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.570
for every card
that I regained!

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.371
And 5200 attack points

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.541
is enough to end this duel!

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:54.909
No!

00:12:54.909 --> 00:12:56.577
Oh wait just a sec.

00:12:56.577 --> 00:12:59.413
Dryanome's ability
won't let you damage me.

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:01.448
That's only true as blue
if you can summon

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.450
a monster next to
Dryanome's links,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.952
but what if all the links
are already filled?

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.257
Oh, my you got me!

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:14.628
You tricked me into misplaying
my cards to trap myself!

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.998
All I can say is
brava, Blue Angel.

00:13:17.998 --> 00:13:19.633
Brava.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:21.435
(Blue Angel)
Delfiendium!

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:24.371
Attack and end this duel!

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:29.543
Ohh!

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:31.745
Bravissima.

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:34.247
I really thought you had me.

00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:36.783
This can't be.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.556
(Pigeon)
How'd Spectre survive?

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.559
Is he secretly
using cheat codes?

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:48.162
He did go up-up
instead of down-down.

00:13:48.162 --> 00:13:51.398
I was sure Blue Angel
had won this duel, right?

00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:53.900
She'll get him next time?

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.103
(Spectre)
I thought you had
won, too, Blue Angel,

00:13:56.103 --> 00:14:00.073
until I realized Dryanome
had another special ability.

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.609
When you attacked
Crimson Heart,

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:05.312
Dryanome was able to move her
to a different location

00:14:05.312 --> 00:14:07.314
on the field
to negate your attack.

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.283
(beeping)

00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:11.285
It must've slipped my mind.

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:12.786
It was by sheer luck

00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:14.989
that I remembered it
just in time.

00:14:14.989 --> 00:14:16.189
Hmm!

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.225
Well I guess that ends
my turn then.

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:21.695
So Delfiendium's
attack points drop to 2200.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:24.698
(chuckling)
You really need to work
on your poker face.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:26.666
I send Sunvine Shrine
to the graveyard

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:30.370
to swap it with
a different trap.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.773
But maybe I'm doing
all these moves for nothing

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:34.608
since you can't win anyway.

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:37.711
Ohh!
Quit your daydreaming
already would ya?

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.614
I've come back from way
bigger deficits than this!

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:43.483
I am oh so quite aware
of that, Blue Angel.

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.686
But none of those
enemies were me.

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:47.153
It's my turn.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.623
All right... Oh!

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:51.792
When I digitize you,
be a dear

00:14:51.792 --> 00:14:54.161
and give my best regards
to Ghost Gal.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:57.398
Why don't you go
and do that yourself!

00:14:57.398 --> 00:15:00.668
I'm summoning two Trickstar
Lycorises from my hand

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:04.405
in defense mode
during your turn!

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:07.107
But in exchange,
I have to return

00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:09.109
Trickstar Candina
to my hand

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:13.113
and Trickstar
Delfiendium to my deck.

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:14.715
I see what you did.

00:15:14.715 --> 00:15:17.117
You bolstered your defenses.

00:15:17.117 --> 00:15:18.551
That's well done.

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:20.253
That's why I'm such
a fan of yours.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.889
Your number one fan.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:24.525
Then I'll send you a selfie
when we're done here.

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:28.028
But until then,
I activate Trickstar Treat!

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:29.696
I'll start things off
by placing

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:32.366
one Trickstar Counter
on this card.

00:15:32.366 --> 00:15:34.234
And if Trickstar Treat
ever has

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.503
at least two counters on it
at the end of the turn,

00:15:36.503 --> 00:15:38.371
I have to
immediately destroy it

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:40.440
and take a 1,000 points
of damage for each one

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.277
of those counters,
which is obviously not cool.

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:44.912
But here's what is cool.

00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:46.913
By placing a counter
on Trickstar Treat,

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:49.616
I can play a trap card
even if it's your turn!

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.785
And, boy, do I know
the perfect trap

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.920
to play against you
right now.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.890
It's the one you tried
so very hard to get rid of,

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.693
Trickstar Reincarnation!

00:15:59.693 --> 00:16:02.329
Trickstar Reincarnation
will banish my hand

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.764
and then force me to draw

00:16:03.764 --> 00:16:05.699
until I replace
each and every card.

00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:10.404
But every time I draw,
Lycoris will deal me damage.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:11.639
(chuckling)

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.440
But just because you can
play a trap

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.643
doesn't mean
you get to activate it.

00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:17.778
(Blue Angel)
Oh wait, I do get
to activate it.

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.813
Must've slipped my mind.

00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:22.749
It's totally luck that I
remembered it just in time.

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:26.186
You mock me?
No one ever mocks me!

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:27.921
Whoa, struck a nerve?

00:16:27.921 --> 00:16:31.158
What's wrong, never been
on the losing side of a duel?

00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:33.159
Actually, I haven't.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.829
Not to be pop psychologist,
but maybe that's why

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.933
your mind's all twisted
like a pretzel.
Grr!

00:16:38.933 --> 00:16:40.367
You think losing this duel

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.069
will mean you're
a loser in life.

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:44.471
And I understand why
you feel that way.

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:46.440
Because for those of us
who had to fight

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.441
for every scrap
growing up,

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:49.909
losing's costly.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.979
Especially if
you're all alone.

00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:53.446
It can toughen us up

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:56.116
or it can
harden us like you.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:17:00.321
But if I'm any example
it isn't too late to change.

00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:03.657
You have to know it's never,
ever too late to change.

00:17:03.657 --> 00:17:05.593
What do you mean?

00:17:05.593 --> 00:17:08.362
In the fairy tale,
Blue Angel's friends

00:17:08.362 --> 00:17:10.230
put her on the right path.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.566
And that's what
I'll do for you.

00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:15.002
Put me on the right path?
Why?

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:18.004
My current path
has led me to many a win.

00:17:18.004 --> 00:17:21.308
Until now that is, I'm afraid.

00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:24.211
Trickstar Reincarnation
makes you banish your hand

00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.981
and draw a new one.

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:29.183
And for every single card
that you drew,

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:32.186
Trickstar Lycoris gets to deal
200 points of damage

00:17:32.186 --> 00:17:33.487
to your life points.

00:17:33.487 --> 00:17:36.056
But since I happen to have
two Lycroises,

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.924
the damage you're taking
is doubled!

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:40.094
To 1600!

00:17:40.094 --> 00:17:43.830
Unh!

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.032
You must do
better than that.

00:17:46.032 --> 00:17:49.202
By activating Sunavalon
Dryanome's ability,

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:53.173
I'm allowed to summon
a Sunvine from my Extra Deck.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.509
And I regain every point
of damage I took

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:59.647
from one of your Lycroises.

00:17:59.647 --> 00:18:03.250
Sunvine Healer, germinate!

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.754
That was nice,
but it never hurts

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.757
to have a few more
life points.

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:13.227
So I activate Sunvine Healer's
special ability.

00:18:13.227 --> 00:18:15.662
For every one
of Dryanome's links,

00:18:15.662 --> 00:18:18.932
she endows me
with 300 life points.

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.102
But I'm gonna take those
life points right back!

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.938
By placing a counter
on Trickstar Treat,

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:27.741
I play another Reincarnation!

00:18:27.741 --> 00:18:28.975
So here goes!

00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:31.945
Ah!
She played a second one?

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.447
Great.

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:35.582
And you'll take damage
like last time!

00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:39.586
Aah!

00:18:41.655 --> 00:18:43.757
But what's different
this time

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.993
is that you have
nothing left to heal you.

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.895
So when I play my third
Trickstar Reincarnation,

00:18:48.895 --> 00:18:50.831
I'll deal enough damage
to get rid of

00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:54.135
your remaining life points
and win this duel.

00:18:54.135 --> 00:18:55.702
Yes.

00:18:55.702 --> 00:18:58.539
As much as I hate to admit it,
you have clearly proven

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:01.475
who the better duelist
is in this match.

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:03.844
Just look at this loser!

00:19:03.844 --> 00:19:05.478
You may feel that way,

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.447
but it is
so not true, Specter.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:09.616
And I'll promise
to help you realize that

00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:11.351
when the duel's done, okay?

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:15.989
I play my final Trickstar
Reincarnation and activate it!

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.959
My combo will bring
this duel to a close.

00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:21.161
But you'll see this is
for the best!

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:22.496
The best?

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.698
When I said
"Take a look at this loser"

00:19:24.698 --> 00:19:28.034
I was talking about you,
I wasn't talking about me!

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:32.840
Ha ha!

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.808
You've proven
that you are nowhere close

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:37.811
to being as skilled a duelist
as I am, Blue Angel.

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:40.347
Ohh!
A real duelist would remember

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.282
that I still had a card.

00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:45.485
I now activate the trap card
Sunbloom Doom!

00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:48.221
I now select one monster
that's on the field,

00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:49.656
and for every monster
that has

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:51.492
the same Type
as the chosen one,

00:19:51.492 --> 00:19:54.661
I regain life points equal
to their attack points!

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:55.963
Ohh!

00:19:55.963 --> 00:19:58.632
And the monster
that I shall choose...

00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:01.969
Is Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.304
How does it feel to watch
your so-called friends

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:08.375
betray you again so that
they can all eagerly serve me?

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:11.144
No! This can't
be happening!

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:13.647
But it is happening
right before your very eyes,

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.816
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it!

00:20:15.816 --> 00:20:17.284
Grr!

00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:20.387
Oh my.
Did I go too far?

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.223
I just couldn't control myself
after you went and decided

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.793
that you could
lecture me, dear.

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:28.228
My sincerest apologies.

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.464
So please do carry on.

00:20:30.464 --> 00:20:32.199
Something about dealing me
enough damage

00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:36.136
to end this duel?

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:38.605
Ahh! Unh!
That stings.

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:41.475
(chuckles)

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:45.445
But it appears your math
was a tad bit incorrect.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:49.183
My dear, like you, I read
this book cover to cover.

00:20:49.183 --> 00:20:51.785
And I did quite enjoy it.

00:20:51.785 --> 00:20:55.155
But I wasn't so dumb to base
my whole life on a fairy tale!

00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:56.991
Ohh!

00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:58.526
But there is
a moral to our story.

00:20:58.526 --> 00:21:01.295
Unlike a children's book,
tales in real life

00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:04.064
do not necessarily
have happy endings.

00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:05.366
Most of 'em?

00:21:05.366 --> 00:21:07.567
They end in tragedy!

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:09.703
Ahh!

00:21:15.342 --> 00:21:17.111
You might think that now,

00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.012
but my friends
will prove you wrong.

00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:21.515
Yes, yes, always
with your friends.

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:24.184
You know it's too bad
they're not here
to see you off,

00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:25.920
but they'll be
joining you soon enough

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.522
since I will
digitize them, too.

00:21:28.522 --> 00:21:32.225
I banish Sunbloom Doom
from my graveyard!

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:34.461
Since three trap cards
were activated

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.030
and sent directly
to the graveyard this turn,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.301
all Level 3 or lower monsters
on the field are destroyed.

00:21:40.301 --> 00:21:43.537
You're the cause of your own
destruction, Blue Angel.

00:21:43.537 --> 00:21:46.039
Because it's your fault
that both of your Lycorises

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.908
are destroyed!

00:21:47.908 --> 00:21:49.843
And for every monster
that's destroyed

00:21:49.843 --> 00:21:52.213
you take 500 points of damage!

00:21:52.213 --> 00:21:54.048
Be gone!
(both wailing)

00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:55.682
(maniacal laughter)

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:57.251
I would ask if you had
any last words

00:21:57.251 --> 00:21:59.453
to add for your life story,
but it seems

00:21:59.453 --> 00:22:01.956
we already reached
the final page.

00:22:01.956 --> 00:22:03.691
It was quite a good tale,

00:22:03.691 --> 00:22:06.326
but no one will be
writing a sequel.

00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:08.795
Farewell, Blue Angel.

00:22:08.795 --> 00:22:11.765
(screaming)

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.338
(both)
No! Blue Angel!

00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:20.974
Hey, Playmaker, look!

00:22:20.974 --> 00:22:24.311
That's where
Blue Angel went!

00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:26.313
Blue Angel?

00:22:26.313 --> 00:22:27.782
No, Skye!

00:22:27.782 --> 00:22:30.750
(maniacal laughter)

00:22:34.621 --> 00:22:37.591
(theme music playing)
