(AI)
Previously
on "Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS"...

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:07.674
It's one thing to hack
into my company's mainframe.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.778
It's another to give
Playmaker access to it.

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.080
What do we both want?

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.983
We want to know what happened
a decade ago to Playmaker,

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.119
and that info's locked tight
in SOL Tech's databank.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.588
If he triggers the alarms,

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.023
Security will be busy
chasing him down

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.792
while we infiltrate
the databank ourselves.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.461
Very well then.

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:28.762
Hey, Blue Angel!

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.198
It's safe to come out now!
Ohh!

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.499
You wanna talk?

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.436
Because I see a role
for you in this, too.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.074
(Playmaker)
This place is more massive
than I expected.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.343
Ahh!

00:00:42.443 --> 00:00:43.610
(AI)
The tether's severed!

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.245
Oh, no!

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.917
What?!

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.785
It seem someone is hacking
into our company's databank!

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.087
No! It can't be!

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.658
That's Playmaker!
Launch my AIs immediately!

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:01.695
Time to Speed Duel!
Speed Duel!

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.597
Unh!

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:08.068
(AI yelping)
Oh!

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.203
I'm here
to even up the odds!

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:11.505
Eliminate intruder.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.008
So go ahead and give it
your best shot.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.010
In the end,
you'll be seeing blue!

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.017
(theme music playing)

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.019
♪♪♪

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.278
Blue Angel?

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:25.913
Hey!

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.249
Looks like you can use
some help, Playmaker.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.450
How did you get here?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.120
Uh, it's pronounced
"thank you"?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.257
C'mon, ya slowpoke!
Try to catch me!

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.627
(thinking)
I'm back where I belong,
riding a Duel Board!

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.600
Blue Angel dares infiltrate
my mainframe, too?

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.403
Aah!

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:51.539
That is so... Zaizen

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:54.107
to use his sister
to try to disgrace me!

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.810
But he will not succeed!

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.212
You there!
With the bad posture!

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:01.014
Bring Zaizen!

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.816
(Operator C)
<i>He's already left
for the day.</i>

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:05.886
He did, huh?
That's bug wash!

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:07.521
(Operator B)
<i>What should we do
about Blue Angel, sir?</i>

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.690
Delete her... at once!

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.491
Or you're fired!

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.527
And don't bother asking me
for a recommendation!

00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:15.862
Red-B, switch your target

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.998
from Playmaker
to duel Blue Angel.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.500
Affirmative.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.601
Let's Speed Duel!
Speed Duel.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.139
(Ghost Gal)
Huh!

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:27.874
Seems Blue Angel arrived
to give Playmaker a hand.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:29.709
(Zaizen)
What?! Skye's here?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.478
But how? And why?

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.480
And who where when?

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.015
Relax.
No!

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:38.218
I have to save her!
Zaizen, wait!

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:41.354
This is our only chance to
get to the mainframe's core,

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:44.991
and I won't have your emotions
messing up our plans.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.393
What about Skye?

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.028
She's a big girl.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:49.329
She can take care of herself

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:52.299
without having big brother
running her life.
Ohh.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:55.202
You can work this out
with a self-help book later,

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.638
but for now, less chatting
and more skedaddling.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:05.245
Okay, fans, stay blue!

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.881
This duel is not televised.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.350
Like that matters?

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:10.884
Here I go!

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.553
I'll set the venue
with the Field spell

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.621
Trickstar Light Stage!

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.891
It lets me add
one Trickstar monster

00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.926
in my deck to my hand!

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.195
And she's a Trickstar

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:23.864
that I'm automatically
allowed to summon!

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:26.400
So, fluttering
to my field first

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:30.170
is Trickstar Lilybell!

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:32.339
Next, I summon
Trickstar Candina

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:36.176
to join Lilybell
on my field!

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.778
My Candina's so sweet.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:39.579
She uses her special
ability to grace me

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.782
with another Trickstar
from my deck!

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.050
Okay, let's go, girls!

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:47.220
Build the circuit
that turns dreams into reality!

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:56.196
I set Lilybell and Candina
in the Link Arrows!

00:04:58.198 --> 00:05:00.701
I Link Summon!

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.237
Link 2 Trickstar
Holly Angel!

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.813
(Blue Angel)
I Link Summon!

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:16.149
Link 2 Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.619
She Link Summoned
on her first turn?

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:20.788
My Link Monster's
only the beginning,

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:25.291
because I activate
my spell, Trickstar Vision!

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.961
This card lets me summon
another Trickstar from my hand,

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.631
but I have to negate
all of her special abilities

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:32.599
and cut her
attack points in half.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.835
Total bummer,
but it's no biggie.

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:37.604
Come on out,
Trickstar Narkissus!

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:41.241
Then, Trickstar Vision
lets us both draw one card.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:43.444
Drawing card.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.180
Me, too!
But I'm not done yet!

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.782
I'm gonna
place this facedown.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:53.921
Next up is my Narkissus.

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.490
Sure, she may have lost
all of her cool powers,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.292
but that doesn't mean
she's powerless!

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:02.396
I can trade her
for Trickstar Lycoris!

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.198
And summoning Lycoris

00:06:04.265 --> 00:06:06.566
triggers Holly Angel's
special ability!

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.568
Because every time
a Trickstar is summoned

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.903
next to Holly Angel's link,

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:12.573
she deals you
200 points of damage!

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:14.374
And not to be greedy
or anything,

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.677
'cause I know it's better
to share and care,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.012
but I wanna
keep dealing you damage.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.349
So my spell
Trickstar Light Stage

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:24.017
kicks in for 200 more!

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.488
Ya know, you got
a pretty good poker face.

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.424
I really can't tell
if you're upset or not.

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:32.392
Maybe this'll change things!

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.195
Narkissus, use your ability!

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.430
That's right!

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.098
When my effect damages you,

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.235
she can summon herself
to the field!

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:42.636
All those flickering gnats

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.671
are more a nuisance
than a threat!

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:47.007
It's your turn,
Mr. Machine.

00:06:47.074 --> 00:06:48.675
Commencing turn.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:49.743
Draw.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:52.246
Oh goodie!

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:54.515
Whenever you draw a card,
Lycoris' special ability

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.683
deals you 200 points
of damage.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.988
But that's not all!

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.490
Like last time,
whenever one of my Trickstars

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.926
deals you damage,
Trickstar Light Stage

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:09.930
short circuits 200
of your life points!

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.666
And then my Trickstar
Holly Angel gains attack points

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.734
equal to the damage you took!

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.206
Rise up, Holly Angel!

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.643
Oh wait.

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:24.578
This was actually
your turn right?

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.580
Sorry to snatch
your spotlight.

00:07:26.614 --> 00:07:29.583
I'll do my best not to
interrupt you again, okay?

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.052
Initiate optimal action:

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:35.255
Activate spell
Abyss Invitation.

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.090
Pay 500 life points.

00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:39.759
Summon Tentacluster Darkwhip.

00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:43.163
Okay, okay, I know I said

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.666
I'd do my best
not to interrupt you,

00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.334
but you make it so easy!

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.770
You've triggered
Narkissus's ability!

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.474
(Operator B)
<i>Red-B's down another
200 life points!</i>

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:55.575
Counteraction:

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.145
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:07:58.245 --> 00:08:01.681
Consequence: Opponent loses
200 life points.

00:08:04.017 --> 00:08:05.686
Two can play that game.

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:08.321
I'll take your ding
and ding you right back!

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.194
And your loss means Holly Angel
gains more attack points!

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:18.666
Counteraction:

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.967
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.269
Optimal action:

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:24.538
Activate Machine
Duplication.

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.306
Action result:
Summon two

00:08:26.373 --> 00:08:28.441
Tentacluster
Darkwhips from deck.

00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.816
Kinda gross.

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.318
With three monsters, Red-B
is able to Link Summon!

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:43.824
Materializing circuit.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:48.328
Summoning conditions:
three Tentacluster monsters.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:51.532
Response: Set three
Tentacluster Darkwhips

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.734
in Link Arrows.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:58.005
Link Summon complete.

00:08:58.105 --> 00:09:02.076
Action result: Link 3
Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:09:02.176 --> 00:09:05.545
Yes! Yes, yes!

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:09.750
Action: Special ability
of Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.419
Summon Tentacluster
from hand next to link

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.688
of Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:09:14.722 --> 00:09:19.126
Action result: Summon
Tentacluster Blastsucker.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:21.395
New optimal action.

00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:24.798
Summon second
Tentacluster Blastsucker.

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.900
Analyze duel state.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:28.703
Optimal action:

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:30.938
Special ability
of Tentacluster Nautilus.

00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:33.040
Destroy monster
next to its link.

00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:37.778
Consequence:
Opponent loses 400 life points.

00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:41.114
Action result:
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:45.452
Opponent loses
200 life points.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:47.555
My, my, Blue Angel!

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.723
It appears your life points
have sprung a leak

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.425
and it's only going
to get worse.

00:09:51.525 --> 00:09:52.793
(Red-B)
Rerun process.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.696
Consequence: Opponent loses
400 life points.

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:58.599
Action result:
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:01.135
Opponent loses
200 life points.

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.570
(thinking)
That AI's whittling me down
little by little,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.506
and I better watch out
'cause there isn't
much left to whittle!

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.711
Victory imminent.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:13.547
Yeah, right!
A ketchup bottle beating me?

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.415
That'll be the day!

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:17.585
Ha! Red-B is programmed

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:20.387
with the best strategic
algorithms ever computed!

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:23.557
Your odds of winning are zero,
just like your I.Q.!

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.392
(laughing)

00:10:25.425 --> 00:10:29.230
Action: Banish Tentacluster
Blastsucker from graveyard.

00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:32.700
Consequence: Opponent
loses 400 life points.

00:10:32.733 --> 00:10:35.402
Action result:
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.370
Fine with me.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:41.275
'Cause Narkissus lights you up
with 200 points of damage!

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.277
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:45.245
And Trickstar
Light Stage!

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:47.347
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:49.349
Trigger, trigger,
trigger!

00:10:49.383 --> 00:10:51.551
Didn't they program you
with a bigger vocabulary?

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.687
Studies say
that people over-talk

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.955
when they're under duress.

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.390
She's shook!

00:10:56.457 --> 00:10:59.460
Action: Banish second
Tentacluster Blastsucker.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.029
Consequence: Opponent loses
400 life points.

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.297
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.165
We're doing
all this again, really?

00:11:05.266 --> 00:11:08.903
Trigger Abyss--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:11.772
Action result:
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:15.108
Opponent loses
200 life points.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:20.080
Victory probability: 99%.

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:21.982
You're shaving away
my life points,

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:23.483
but every time you do,

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:25.752
you're only powering up
my Holly Angel.

00:11:28.456 --> 00:11:30.657
Inconsequential response.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:34.428
Optimal action: Activate
Flexible Tentacluster.

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.630
Action result: Re-summon

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:39.299
banished Tentacluster
Blastsucker.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:41.768
Additional:
Flexible Tentacluster

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.771
lowers battle damage to zero.

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.406
Victory probability:

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:48.942
Increased to 99.9 percent.

00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:50.945
All right!
And now, Red-B,

00:11:50.978 --> 00:11:53.814
clip Blue Angel's wings
once and for all!

00:11:53.914 --> 00:11:56.149
(laughing)

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.185
(thinking)
Okay, if I was that thing,

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:01.354
I'd have my Blastsucker
attack a stronger monster

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:02.856
so that it'll destroy itself.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.925
'Cause with
Flexible Tentacluster,

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:07.093
I won't take
any damage anyway.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:10.197
But that now lets me banish
Blastsucker from my graveyard

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:12.366
to deal 400 points of damage,

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.334
which is exactly
what I have left.

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:16.536
That's the most efficient
path to victory.

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:18.338
And that's what makes
a computer program

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.374
a program-- efficiency.

00:12:20.474 --> 00:12:22.643
But with that efficiency
comes predictability,

00:12:22.676 --> 00:12:23.977
which I can exploit!

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:25.812
Initiate battle.

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:29.683
Tentacluster Blastsucker
attacks Trickstar Lycoris.

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.987
Oh no!

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.589
Jokesies!
Just kidding!

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:38.325
By returning Trickstar
Light Stage to my hand,

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.194
I can then activate
my trap card...

00:12:41.228 --> 00:12:43.663
Trickstar Cascade!

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:48.735
It slams the brakes
on Blastsucker's attack!

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:51.004
Remaining action:
End turn.

00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:53.173
Huh?!

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.507
Now that your turn's done,

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.743
Trickstar Holly Angel's
attack points

00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:58.211
drop back to 2000.

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:02.216
But it's still strong enough
to erase your hard drive!

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:04.718
Come on, girls, let's go!

00:13:04.752 --> 00:13:08.222
I'll start by banishing
two Cyberse monsters

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:11.091
from my graveyard,
Dotscaper and Linkslayer.

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.759
This allows me to activate

00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.928
Dual Assembwurm's
special ability.

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.397
I can resurrect it
from my graveyard

00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.499
by cutting
its attack points in half.

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:29.710
And whenever
I banish Dotscaper,

00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:33.947
I'm allowed to resummon it
to my field.

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:37.084
Then by giving up
half of my life points,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.922
I activate Cynet Defrag's
effect from my graveyard.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.290
It equips and revives

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.592
a Cyberse monster
from my graveyard.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:48.161
Return to the field,
Flick Clown!

00:13:55.703 --> 00:13:57.737
And when my hand's empty,

00:13:57.771 --> 00:13:59.573
Flick Clown lets me
draw a card

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.775
by paying 1,000 life points.

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.010
Here I go!

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.346
I draw!

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:07.514
You're down to
1,000 life points,

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:10.817
so you can now use
your Skill, Playmaker!

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:13.820
And there's a perfect
Data Storm waiting for us!

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:18.492
(Operator A)
<i>Sir, we've detected
an anomaly!</i>

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:21.995
Hmm?
<i>It's a... Data Storm?
That can't be right!</i>

00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:29.503
Green-A's
safely past the storm,

00:14:29.603 --> 00:14:31.939
but Playmaker's heading
straight towards its eye!

00:14:31.972 --> 00:14:34.642
Whoever put a Data Storm
there is fired!

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:37.444
(AI groaning)
Keep the board steady!

00:14:37.477 --> 00:14:40.147
When the storm's swirlin',
I feel like hurlin'!

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.148
Hold it in.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.118
I'll try, but you
aren't helping!

00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.128
Seize the wind,
Playmaker!

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.833
Go Storm Access!
Ha!

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.247
Bonanza!
Hyah!

00:15:20.887 --> 00:15:24.024
Now... create
the ultimate circuit!

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.428
The summoning conditions

00:15:27.528 --> 00:15:30.230
require at least
two Cyberse monsters,

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.066
but I'm going to use three.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:34.868
So I set Dotscaper,
Dual Assembwurm,

00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:39.039
and Flick Clown
in the Link Arrows!

00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:41.242
Link the circuit!

00:15:41.342 --> 00:15:42.877
I Link Summon!

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.047
Link 3 Vector
Scare Archfiend!

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:49.916
(Archfiend roars)

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:57.123
And I also summon
my Cyberse Wizard!

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:01.595
Time to wrap this up!

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.430
With a nice, big bow!

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.137
There's the core.

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:12.105
And the info we want.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:14.474
Now, Cyberse Wizard,

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:17.110
strike down
that Tentacluster Drillworm!

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:20.280
Illusion Spike!

00:16:22.683 --> 00:16:25.119
You're up next,
Vector Scare Archfiend!

00:16:25.152 --> 00:16:27.520
Destroy Tentacluster
Nautilus!

00:16:36.797 --> 00:16:39.165
For a place housing
all the data,

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:41.502
I didn't expect it
to be so sparse.

00:16:41.602 --> 00:16:42.903
Love the lighting, though.

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:45.673
We can access the database
from that console.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:47.140
Let's extract
Playmaker's info

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.109
before anyone
realizes we're here.

00:16:49.176 --> 00:16:52.513
For my next move,
I tribute Cyberse Wizard

00:16:52.613 --> 00:16:55.849
to activate Vector Scare's
special ability-- Go!

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.621
Vector Scare Archfiend
resummons the monster

00:17:00.654 --> 00:17:02.355
it destroyed
next to its link!

00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:08.695
And then
Vector Scare Archfiend

00:17:08.728 --> 00:17:10.231
is allowed
to attack it again.

00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:11.698
Error! Error!

00:17:11.765 --> 00:17:13.433
QQ, AI.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.735
It's over!

00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:17.003
Vector Scare Archfiend...

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.973
attack Tentacluster Nautilus!

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:22.008
Diabolical Destruction!

00:17:27.981 --> 00:17:30.417
(Playmaker)
Attack Tentacluster Nautilus!

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.252
Diabolical Destruction!

00:17:37.024 --> 00:17:39.693
Sir, it appears Green-B
has been deleted.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:42.262
You're all useless,
you useless drones!

00:17:42.362 --> 00:17:43.864
This is all your fault!

00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:46.867
(Kolter)
Should be smooth sailing
from here, Yusaku.

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:48.668
But don't know
about Blue Angel.

00:17:48.702 --> 00:17:50.070
Hope she's good.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.540
I'll start my turn by
summoning Trickstar Candina!

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:57.177
And her special ability

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.380
lets me draw a card
from my deck!

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.715
Ahh! Come on!

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:04.919
Teamwork time!

00:18:04.952 --> 00:18:08.255
I need exactly two Trickstars
to Link Summon,

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:11.458
So I set Trickstars
Narkissus and Lycoris

00:18:11.558 --> 00:18:14.761
in the Link Arrows!

00:18:14.795 --> 00:18:16.896
Link the circuit!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.732
I Link Summon!

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:20.901
The purr-fectly delightful

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.703
Link 2 Trickstar
Black Catbat!

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.408
Hup!

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:30.411
And, boy,
I'm ready to pounce!

00:18:30.444 --> 00:18:33.313
When I summon a monster
next to Holly Angel's link,

00:18:33.414 --> 00:18:36.450
she deals you
200 points of damage!

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.652
Trigger Abyss Invitation.

00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:41.655
You do that one more time
and I'm a goner.

00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:44.625
At least my Holly Angel
gets pumped up.

00:18:44.725 --> 00:18:46.793
It's pretty clear
I won't survive another turn,

00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:49.062
so I guess I just gotta
win this turn.

00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:52.466
And my Black Catbat
is the key to victory!

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:53.934
Whenever you take damage,

00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:57.538
Trickstar Black Catbat
claws 200 attack points

00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.407
out of your shellfish
for every monster

00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:01.474
that's next to her link!

00:19:05.946 --> 00:19:08.715
And next...
well, I'd feel pretty guilty

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.518
doing this next move
if you had a heart,

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:11.886
but... ya don't!

00:19:11.986 --> 00:19:14.321
I activate
Trickstar Temptation!

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:15.822
With this spell in play,

00:19:15.856 --> 00:19:18.158
when your monster's
attack points change--

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.960
I'm looking
at you, Blastsucker--

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.462
It returns to your hand!

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:23.530
You can take
your pretty tentacles home.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.864
Deuces!

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:31.806
That just leaves Tentacluster
Nautilus left on your field!

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:33.874
Attack 'em, Holly Angel!

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:43.884
Counteraction:
Flexible Tentacluster.

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:46.287
Lower battle damage to zero.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.155
But you can only
do that once.

00:19:48.221 --> 00:19:51.492
And I can still attack!

00:19:51.525 --> 00:19:55.162
Black Catbat, let's put
this duel to rest!

00:19:55.196 --> 00:19:57.731
You think you're
a state-of-the-art AI?

00:19:57.831 --> 00:19:59.499
You're BASIC!

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.638
(Black Catbat screeching)

00:20:09.843 --> 00:20:12.646
Yeah! Ha ha!

00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:14.981
And that's how ya stay blue!

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:22.222
(AI)
Is that the core?

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:24.524
Seems so.

00:20:27.294 --> 00:20:29.797
Why is
your pathetic posterior

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.165
still glued to that seat?

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.465
I fired you!

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:35.136
I didn't think
that you were serious.

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:37.471
Don't I look serious?!

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:40.140
Well, if you're gonna
sit there, then work!

00:20:40.173 --> 00:20:42.810
Find a new way
to purge them!

00:20:42.843 --> 00:20:45.145
Ohh...
You over there!

00:20:45.178 --> 00:20:46.480
What's your solution?

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:48.048
(Operator A)
Um, with all
due respect, isn't it

00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:50.117
your responsibility
to fix this?

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.819
Oh, I shall fix you!
Grr!

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:56.857
Ohh, easy does it now.
I have to stay calm.

00:20:56.957 --> 00:20:59.994
Things can't get any worse.
They can't.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.896
(Operator D)
Sir, just thought
you'd like to know

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:03.797
there are additional
intruders in the mainframe.

00:21:03.897 --> 00:21:05.566
Oh, no!

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:08.702
(gasps)
Someone's coming!

00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.874
Akira!
Didn't you hear me?

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:31.558
What are you doing?

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:37.731
Zaizen! Of course!

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:43.704
I see you made it.

00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:45.906
Zaizen.

00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:49.242
Playmaker...
I was waiting for you.

00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:56.182
(theme music playing)
