WEBVTT

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:11.511
He's in there.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.749
(Varis) There's one more mission
for you to do.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.851
What sir?

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:19.353
Go retrieve Kolter.
In the real world.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:20.487
(gasps)

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.988
You'll find him
in the hot dog truck

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.024
in Den City's main courtyard.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.093
We leave no one behind,
even if they're our rivals.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.097
Ah!

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.067
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think he was sleeping.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.973
Soulburner is dueling
against Bohman.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.649
(growls)

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.119
Let this roll
decide your fate!

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.787
Go, Judgment Dice!

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.291
♪

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.830
I rolled the Water icon.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.832
Therefore,
my Paradox Hydradrive Atlas

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.868
transforms into a Water monster.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:10.137
Next, I activate

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.640
Paradox Hydradrive Atlas's
special ability

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.709
to roll a second die and summon

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.344
a Hydradrive Link Monster

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:18.545
from my extra deck

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.347
which has
the same number of links

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.149
as the number that I roll.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.583
(growls)

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.852
Go, Judgment Dice!

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.691
I rolled a four.

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.660
So, I can summon
a link for Hydradrive

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.996
next to my Atlas's link.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:39.699
Emerge,
Rousing Hydradrive Monarch!

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.872
When I summon
my Hydradrive Monarch

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:46.507
from my extra deck,

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.142
it gains
four Hydradrive counters.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.850
Then my Monarch's
attribute changes

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.019
to match the monster
it's linked to

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.988
and becomes a water monster.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:05.492
You humans say
to fight fire with fire,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.661
so I decided
to use fire monsters

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.729
to take on your fire monsters.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:13.167
But... perhaps it wiser

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.535
to douse your fire
with water instead.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.138
Let us see
if I'm correct Soulburner.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:22.976
♪

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:22.035
(suspense music)

00:03:23.104 --> 00:03:24.271
Bohman realized that

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:26.506
his previous strategy
wasn't working,

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.708
so he abandoned it
for a new one.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.278
That is a high-level maneuver.

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:34.881
Let's let destiny
judge you for a third time.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:38.218
I activate my
Monarch's ability!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.888
By removing
one Hydradrive counter,

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.890
I roll my Attribute die.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.827
And all your monsters that have
the same attribute

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:49.964
as what I roll are sent
to the graveyard,

00:03:49.964 --> 00:03:54.634
and you take 500 points
of damage for each monster.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.007
The attribute I rolled...
is fire!

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:02.376
And since
your Salamangreat Heatleo

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:03.677
is a fire monster,

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:08.181
it's destroyed, and you take
500 points of damage!

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.086
Aww, glitch!

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.522
Soulburner's got nothing left
on his field!

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.256
Here I go!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.191
Rousing Hydradrive Monarch!

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.560
Attack their life points
directly!

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.698
(thuds)

00:04:25.232 --> 00:04:27.668

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:28.835
(beeping)

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.004
(groans)

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.606
That was quite the blow.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.245
Perhaps harder than I thought.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:40.547
I'll place these two cards
facedown.

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.949
And end my turn.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.955
Bohman's game is on point!

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.356
His AI is improving so fast,

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.526
I bet he's almost
as smart as me now!

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:55.529
Come on, wake up!
You're supposed to correct me!

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.530
I gave you the perfect opening!

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.267
It's our turn, Flame!
Let's go!

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.137
Soulburner.

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:05.238
Do you think
Bohman really controls

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.008
the outcome of luck
in this mirror world?

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:11.111
That what is random
is no longer random?

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.247
Why do you say that?

00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:14.848
He rolled his dice
three times,

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:17.250
and he got the outcome
he wanted all three times.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.020
The odds of that
happening is one in 216,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.922
or 0.46 percent.

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.758
That is pretty lucky,
but it's not impossible

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.593
This outcome is
not impossible,

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.762
but highly improbable.

00:05:28.762 --> 00:05:30.631
So if Bohman can control luck,

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:34.602
he can manipulate every facet
of this duel in his favor.

00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:36.137
Therefore, unfortunately,

00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:38.672
I do not know
if there's any way we can win.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.108
Well, I do.

00:05:41.108 --> 00:05:42.843
Because we have something
more powerful than luck, Flame.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:44.511
It's called teamwork!

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.415
As long as I have you,
I'm not worrying about a thing!

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:51.418
By revealing to you that
I have this card in my hand...

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:54.121
My field spell activates!

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.957
I return my entire hand
to my deck,

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:00.294
and then I draw
the same number of cards.

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.230
Then I activate the spell
will of the Salamangreat

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.265
to resurrect
a Salamangreat monster

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.067
from my graveyard!

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:10.303
Roar again,
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.341
Since you summoned
a monster,

00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.009
I'll use a Hydradrive counter

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.912
to activate
my Monarch's special ability!

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.981
Bohman gets
to roll another die,

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:24.085
and if he rolls a fire attribute
we lose.

00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:26.753
We're about to find out
how lucky he is.

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.996
The attribute
I rolled is water.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:37.330
He failed!
(gasps)

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.669
How very lucky of you.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.805
Looks like you don't
control everything around here,
Bohman.

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.641
And that is so gonna
cost you big time!

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:50.310
I'll use
Salamangreat Shrine

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.312
to reincarnation
link summon!

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.848
Rise again
from the valley of flames,

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.017
Salamangreat Heatleo!

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.520
Due to my Heatleo's ability,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.389
I get to return
one of your spell

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.890
or trap cards to your deck.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.562
Yes, but which one?

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.564
I'll let you in on a secret.

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.733
One is worse than the other.

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:15.569
So let's see
if your luck is holding up.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:20.441
I choose...
the card on the right!

00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:24.044
In that case,
I activate the card on the left

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.712
Card of Pandora!

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:27.281
What?

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.050
This trap switches the target
of your special ability

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.085
from the other card to itself.

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.222
Then I draw two cards...

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:37.391
straight from my deck.

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.293
It didn't matter
which card we chose.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:41.962
The result would have been
the same.

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.397
This guy thinks
he's so funny.

00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:47.901
But let's see
if he's laughing after this!

00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.371
Heatleo can change
your monster's attack points

00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:54.040
to become the same as
one that's in my graveyard!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.210
And my Salamangreat mole has
zero attack points!

00:07:58.045 --> 00:08:00.213
(thuds)

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:01.948
No!

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:03.951
Nice, Soulburner!

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:06.286
Come on, Playmaker!
Wake up already!

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.188
You're missing the best part!

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.861
Wake up, Yusaku.

00:08:13.861 --> 00:08:15.663
Just a few more minutes.

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:17.230
No can do.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.899
But I'm so tired.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:20.300
I know you are, bud.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.769
But the world
still needs your help.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.705
Your friends are counting
on you.

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.506
I'm counting on you.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.842
So just do me one last favor.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:29.943
What, Kolter?

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:32.279
Just wake up.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:34.781
(gasps)

00:08:35.683 --> 00:08:37.017
Playmaker!

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.352
About time you stopped nappin',
sleepyhead!

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:43.356
Well, I'd still be sleeping
if Kolter hadn't woken me up.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.792
Huh?
Kolter?

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:47.727
And it seems I missed a lot.

00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:50.164
Soulburner is dueling Bohman?

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:51.799
Heatleo!

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.768
Attack and destroy
Rousing Hydradrive Monarch

00:08:54.768 --> 00:08:56.102
and end this duel!

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.942
I activate my trap card
dice logic against your monster!

00:09:02.877 --> 00:09:04.611
If I roll an even number,

00:09:04.611 --> 00:09:07.180
your Heatleo's attack points
are doubled.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.018
But if I roll an odd number,
its attack points drop to zero.

00:09:11.018 --> 00:09:13.019
So it's a fifty-fifty shot.

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:14.855
Not exactly.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.424
If I roll a 5 or lower,

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.926
I can use Judgment Dice

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:20.527
to add 1 to the result

00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:23.130
and guarantee
I get an odd number.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.131
Say what?

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.265
In other words,

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.733
Heatleo will have
zero attack points

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.402
unless he rolls
a six and only a six.

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.503
How's that fair?

00:09:31.605 --> 00:09:33.073
Who said it had to be?

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.841
(grunts)

00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:37.711
It's a two.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.346
But I'll add two
to the result,

00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:40.881
making it three.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.216
Since that's an odd number,

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:44.885
Heatleo's attack points
become zero!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:49.790
We had him!

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.057
Or did we!

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:54.261
He still seems prepared
for everything we try.

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.896
Are you okay, Flame?

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.531
Yes, of course.

00:09:57.531 --> 00:09:59.232
No, you're not.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:02.669
Don't you see you and Soulburner
are far from okay.

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:04.238
Because you cannot win.

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:07.340
Because you do not possess
the intellect.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.444
While humans evolve
over millions of years,

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:12.379
AIs evolve rapidly.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.180
And I've evolved so far that

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.350
I can anticipate
everything you do.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.387
Hey man, I never said
I was the smartest around.

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:23.223
But Flame's an AI too
and a far better one than you!

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.392
Oh? Flame,
I've calculated that

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:28.228
you're a million times superior
to Soulburner,

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:31.431
but I am a million times
superior to you.

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.200
You serious?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.368
I think you need
a new calculator.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.005
Or maybe you forgot
to carry one with you.

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.273
Cuz there's no equation
in the world

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.175
where you're better than Flame

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:44.211
Soulburner!

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:46.513
You may have the knowledge
of the entire world

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:47.714
locked up in your brain,

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.683
but I have two eyes
that can clearly see

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:51.251
that compared to Flame,

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.519
you're not a better duelist,

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:53.854
you're not a better AI,

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:55.922
and most of all,
you're not a better friend!

00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:57.691
And added together,

00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.059
our two minds

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.628
are a million,
billion times better

00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:03.497
than yours could
ever be, Bohman.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:05.299
Still not
the best trash talk,

00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.434
but thank you, Soulburner,

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.636
(groans)

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:11.404
(gasps)

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:12.105
What's wrong?

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.608
I...don't know.

00:11:14.608 --> 00:11:16.176
(grunts)

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.750
(suspenseful music)

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.252
(screams)

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:25.919
What the...

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:29.856
(laughs)

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.291
I can't believe it,
it's Windy!

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:34.795
Windy?

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.296
What are you doing?

00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:38.766
What?

00:11:38.766 --> 00:11:41.101
No hello, how are things,
no greetings?

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:43.737
Rude, rude, rude,
not that I'm surprised.

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.072
What I'm doing
and have been doing is using you

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.808
to rebuild me.

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:51.077
I'm absorbing your data, Flame.
Every bit, byte and crumb.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:53.079
The damage you thought
you were taking from Bohman

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:54.247
you were actually
taking from me.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:57.618
So it was all you.

00:11:57.618 --> 00:11:58.986
I did warn you, Flame.

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:01.087
You should've erased me
when you had the chance!

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.391
Stop it!
Leave him alone!

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.525
(grunts)

00:12:08.028 --> 00:12:09.830
Stay out of our business, human.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.365
This does not concern you.

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.233
But I guess you did make it
my concern,

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.835
and given me an idea.

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.970
Do you know what I think will be
more excruciating

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.572
than this bellyache
I'm giving you?

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:21.575
If you have to watch me absorb
your human out of existence!

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:25.145
A little snack to go along with
my full course Flame meal!

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:27.314
(laughs)

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:30.717
Stop Windy, that's enough.

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:31.985
Shush!

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:34.321
Do not tell me
what I can or cannot do.

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:36.389
I do what I want to do
whenever I do what I do.

00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:38.425
(laughs)

00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:41.061
Soulburner.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:41.829
(grunts)

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:43.163
Bye-bye, Flame.

00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:44.064
(laughs)

00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.266
(groans)

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.034
(grunts)

00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:51.805
N-N-N-N-N-No...
My S-s-strength's draining.

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:55.041
Let...Soulburner...go.

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:59.546
(groans)

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:01.548
(screaming)

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.587
Let me go!

00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:10.324
No, I do not think I will.

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:13.593
(screaming)

00:13:15.095 --> 00:13:16.997
Oh, man, are you okay,
Flame?

00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:19.300
I think so.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.767
I can't believe it.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.803
Flame was able to regain control

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:25.239
despite having been
greatly deteriorated.

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:27.207
Don't be so surprised.

00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:30.043
I find your incredulity
a bit irksome.

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:33.280
After all, once Soulburner
sang my praises,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.050
I couldn't very well
let him down, could I?

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.452
It appears you could not.

00:13:38.452 --> 00:13:40.287
I refuse to allow my spirit

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:43.290
to break until I ensure
this war is over.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.592
That's right, buddy.

00:13:44.592 --> 00:13:46.960
And we'll do it together.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.230
Of course.
Together until the end.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.231
Til the end.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.403
(grunts)

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:57.104
Flame, what's wrong?

00:13:57.104 --> 00:14:00.874
It seems Windy took
more out of me than I thought.

00:14:00.874 --> 00:14:02.009
Do need a break?

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:03.877
I don't think it will help.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:06.613
I know I just said
we'll be together until the end

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:09.316
and it feels like
that time is now.

00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.952
My code is deteriorating.

00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:13.654
I don't have much time left.

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:17.023
So thank you, Theodore.
I will never forget you.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.226
And I hope you never forget me.

00:14:19.226 --> 00:14:23.463
Flame.
That's spelled F-L-A-M-E.

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.066
The F stands for many things,

00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:29.302
but the one thing
it will always stand for...

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:30.103
...is friend.

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:34.274
(sobbing)

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:37.110
Flame!

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:44.217
No, Flame can't be gone.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.788
Just to be clear,

00:14:47.788 --> 00:14:50.457
I didn't ask for Windy
to interfere.

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:55.296
The last thing that I wanted
was an unfair fight.

00:14:55.296 --> 00:14:58.465
So let us postpone
our duel for another time.

00:14:58.465 --> 00:14:59.633
When you're ready.

00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:01.902
Postpone?
I don't think so.

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:04.004
Flame helped me get this far,

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:09.042
so I'm not letting his sacrifice
end up meaning nothing!

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:12.779
So, we're not dueling tomorrow
or the next day

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:14.381
we're dueling now!

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.782
And I will defeat you,

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:17.784
not 'cause
I wanna save the world

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.287
but to finish what Flame and I
started together!

00:15:21.555 --> 00:15:22.289
Very well.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:28.362
I activate
Salamangreat burning shell!

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:30.698
This spell lets me summon
a Salamangreat

00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.532
by negating
its special abilities!

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:35.268
Come on out, Salamangreat Parro!

00:15:37.504 --> 00:15:38.672
Next up, I'm
allowed to use

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:42.109
this Salamangreat Parro
to link summon!

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:44.177
Here I go!

00:15:46.113 --> 00:15:48.281
I set Salamangreat Parro

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:51.218
and Salamangreat Heatleo
in the link arrows!

00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:56.022
I link summon!

00:15:56.022 --> 00:16:00.093
Link 4
Salamangreat Pyro Phoenix!

00:16:00.093 --> 00:16:02.162
(groans)

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.364
Pyro Phoenix?

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:08.068
This is a first,
I've never seen that before!

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:10.337
Since I used burning shell
to link summon,

00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:11.905
my Link Monster isn't allowed

00:16:11.905 --> 00:16:14.975
to attack or use
its abilities this turn.

00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:17.311
Then that monster
is useless.

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.980
Don't you know that
nothing is useless?

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.249
And I'll prove it
using this card,

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:25.118
my spell card
Salamangreat Transcendence

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:29.422
It lets me use a Salamangreat
on my field

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.092
to link summon
another copy of that monster!

00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:37.698
And that'll restore
its abilities!

00:16:37.698 --> 00:16:40.767
Pyro Phoenix,
let the flames engulf your body!

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:44.004
Because from its ashes,
you will be reborn!

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:48.742
Super Reincarnation
link summon!

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.581
Soar, Link 4
Salamangreat Pyro Phoenix!

00:16:57.083 --> 00:17:00.020
Soulburner has taken
his game to the next level.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.921
(grunts)

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:04.892
Flame, man,
I wish you were here with me

00:17:04.892 --> 00:17:07.094
to share in this moment.

00:17:07.094 --> 00:17:09.830
Because we're about
to win this duel!

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.732
When our Pyro Phoenix is
reincarnated,

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:15.302
it destroys
every single card on your field!

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.741
Not every card.

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:24.077
Due to
my Atlas's special ability,

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.646
it's not affected
by your special abilities!

00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:30.217
No way!

00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:32.853
And since you destroyed
my trap card dice logic,

00:17:32.853 --> 00:17:34.521
its effect activates,

00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.724
summoning a Hydradrive
link monster from my extra deck!

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.759
Rise, my Monarch!

00:17:41.228 --> 00:17:44.564
Next my Hydradrive atlas changes
my Monarch's attribute

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:45.599
to match its own,

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:48.302
transforming it
into a Water monster.

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.904
You just caused
your own defeat, Bohman!

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.073
By activating
Pyro phoenix's ability,

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.207
you take damage equal

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.509
to your link monster's
attack points!

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.245
All 3000 of 'em,

00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:01.381
and you only have
1700 life points left!

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:02.883
I don't think so.

00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:05.385
I'll play this card
from my hand.

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:08.255
The trap card Judgment roll.

00:18:08.255 --> 00:18:10.590
By tributing
my Hydradrive monarch,

00:18:12.226 --> 00:18:14.662
you get to roll a die.

00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:15.962
What? Me?

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:18.598
Instead of choosing
your destiny for you,

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:22.703
I'm going to let you decide
your own fate, Soulburner.

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:24.738
This sound a little bit
suspish to you?

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.573
'Cause it sounds a little bit
suspish to me.

00:18:26.573 --> 00:18:29.810
&gt;&gt;:If your monster happens
to share the same attribute

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.445
as the one that you roll,

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:34.248
its attack points
will be doubled.

00:18:34.248 --> 00:18:36.950
So in other words,
if I roll a fire attribute,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.953
Pyro Phoenix's attack points
will be doubled.

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:42.222
So what's the catch, Bohman?

00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:44.925
The catch is that
if you roll any other attribute,

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.928
your monster loses
all of its attack points.

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:50.897
So your odds of success
are only 1 in 6.

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:52.832
So what!

00:18:55.135 --> 00:18:56.536
I am not scared!

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:06.012
This is for you, Flame!

00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:10.283
Burning dice!

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:16.190
That's the fire icon!

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.024
(chuckles)

00:19:18.024 --> 00:19:20.995
Pyro Phoenix's attack points
are now doubled!

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:22.629
(beeping)

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:25.966
5600!
That's more than enough to win!

00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:28.268
Yeah.
GG, Bohman!

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.270
Attack!

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.278
Destroy
Paradox Hydradrive Atlas!

00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:40.981
It's over!

00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:44.952
You would think that.

00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:46.886
After all you're only human

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:50.324
and wouldn't think that
I'd have another trap to play.

00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:52.025
Hydradrive gravity moves

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:54.294
your Phoenix next
to my Atlas's link.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:56.696
What?

00:19:56.696 --> 00:20:00.300
By doing so, my Atlas's
special ability activates,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.270
changing your Pyro Phoenix
from a Fire monster

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.604
into a water monster.

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.443
And if it's no longer
a fire monster,

00:20:09.443 --> 00:20:12.612
judgment roll drops
its attack points to zero!

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:16.684
No way.

00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:17.852
That's not all.

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:19.520
You also take damage

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.621
equal to
your Phoenix's attack points.

00:20:22.022 --> 00:20:23.957
(gasps)

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:26.626
Instead of choosing
your destiny for you,

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:30.630
I'm going to let you decide
your own fate, Soulburner.

00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:33.200
You lied.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.636
Since you had that trap card,
I never had a choice!

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.105
No!
(thuds)

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:42.108
(screaming)

00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:48.448
Sorry, Flame.

00:20:48.448 --> 00:20:50.183
I couldn't win this one for us.

00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:52.886
(beeping)

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:57.625
Playmaker, it's over for me,

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:59.793
but it's not over for you.

00:20:59.793 --> 00:21:02.896
And I know you'll succeed
where I failed.

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:07.234
I believe in you, Playmaker.

00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:22.515
No.

00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:25.518
Soulburner.

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:33.059
Soulburner, you were truly
a worthy adversary.

00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:37.230
But I cannot allow anyone
who stands in my way to exist.

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:41.969
Through our duel,
I have confirmed

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.239
that my dueling skills are
at peak perfection.

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:46.941
And with that recognition,

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:50.844
there is only one more score
left for me to settle

00:21:50.844 --> 00:21:53.013
and that means one thing

00:21:53.013 --> 00:21:56.082
Playmaker, I'm coming for you!

00:21:58.018 --> 00:22:02.822
