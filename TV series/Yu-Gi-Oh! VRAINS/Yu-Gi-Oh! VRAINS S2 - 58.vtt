WEBVTT

00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:04.004
Previously on Yu-Gi-Oh!
VRAINS...

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:05.806
(Bohman)
I've been ahead of you

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.241
every step of this duel,
Playmaker.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.744
Haven't you
figured it out yet

00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.615
why it is that I'm able
to predict your every move?

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.983
It's because I...

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.751
Am you, Playmaker.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:19.954
And, in turn,
you are me.

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.788
You're me?

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.525
It all started
ten years ago.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.627
A certain Lost Incident?

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:29.964
You think that you were
taken as a child.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:33.467
A guinea pig for experiments
to create the Ignis.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.302
But here's
what you don't know--

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.739
that child's feelings,
thoughts and experiences

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.442
were constantly being
recorded and backed up

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:44.144
in a myriad
of hi-tech servers.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.614
And that backup
had enough data

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:49.316
to create a digital version
of this child.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.619
Due to a glitch
in the system,

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.420
the digital copy of the boy

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.423
and the actual boy
switched places.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:00:59.359
I was the real boy.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.095
And you're nothing more
than a backup made alive

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.430
by a freak accident.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.399
No, I don't believe you!

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.201
I was unjustly trapped

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.536
in those servers
for years, Playmaker.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:11.405
But now I'm free.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.474
And now I'll tell you
what I want

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:14.875
when I win this duel--

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.710
my body back!

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.511
(Harlin chuckles)

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.247
VRAINS isn't big enough
for the two of us!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.649
(Bohman)
Face it, Playmaker,
you're nothing but an imposter--

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.719
a digital copy of myself!

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:34.654
And all inferior copies
must be deleted!

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.295
So if Bohman wins this duel,

00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:44.464
does that mean he gets to
take over Playmaker's body?

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.767
(chuckles)
Sounds good to me!

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.703
Playmaker's an AI
instead of a human?

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.104
Bohman's gotta be lying!

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.073
Playmaker's nothing
like an AI...

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:55.543
(gasps) Except for his
lack of emotion...

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:58.612
His calculated coldness...
His icy cold stare...

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.214
Come to think of it,
have I ever seen him blink?

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.484
Now I know why you've always
been jealous of my smarts!

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.520
Because I'm a better
AI than you!

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.455
Believe what you want, Ai.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.491
But I will not allow Bohman
to take me off of my game.

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:14.494
(gasps) He's not denying
he's an AI!

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.364
But he's not not
denying it either...

00:03:16.364 --> 00:03:17.698
Ooh, I'm so confused.

00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:19.900
One of ‘em's not being honest,
but which one?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.535
Who's the real Yusaku?

00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:22.936
If you're done lying,
Bohman...

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.704
I'm continuing this duel.

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.039
My turn.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.007
I draw.

00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.709
I summon WIDGET KID
in attack mode.

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:34.314
And then WIDGET KID's
special ability allows me

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.550
to summon a Cyberse monster
from my hand in defense mode.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.953
Such as my RAM CLOUDER.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.956
And RAM CLOUDER has
a special ability of its own.

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:47.127
By tributing one monster
that's on my field...

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:50.030
I can resurrect a Cyberse
monster from my graveyard.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:54.501
So I tribute WIDGET KID
to bring back UPDATE JAMMER!

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.206
That's the monster that
can stop Bohman's Link Spells!

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:00.173
So what?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.742
TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:05.112
negates the special abilities
of all Wind Attribute monsters,

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.247
such as your UPDATE JAMMER.

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.616
If our JAMMER
gets jammed up,

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.785
all our strategies
get jammed up too.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.386
This isn't good at all!

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:14.688
Or is it?

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.590
What if Playmaker's
been tricking me all this time

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.758
and I'm supposed
to be Team Bohman?

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.228
I mean,
who's the real Yusaku?

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:22.797
Is it Broody McGee
over here

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:24.598
or Flex McCoy
over there?

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.599
Who should I root for?

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.068
How do folks make
tough decisions?

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:29.837
I know!

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:30.838
When in doubt,

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:32.572
go with the
cooler username!

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:33.840
Playmaker!

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.777
Even if UPDATE JAMMER
can't use its abilities,

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:38.612
I can use it
to Link Summon!

00:04:38.913 --> 00:04:41.248
The summoning conditions
are two or more

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:42.449
Cyberse monsters!

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.251
I Link Summon!

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.953
Link 3
DETONATE DELETER!

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:50.924
And since I used UPDATE
JAMMER to Link Summon,

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.426
its special ability allows
DETONATE DELETER

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:55.762
to attack twice
in a single turn.

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:57.197
Impossible!

00:04:57.197 --> 00:04:59.599
I negated UPDATE
JAMMER's abilities!

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.435
Only when
it's on the field,

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.270
but not when it's
in the graveyard!

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.272
Chop ‘em up,
Playmaker!

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:06.507
Go!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.476
DETONATE DELETER
will destroy

00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.310
your TWIN HYDRADRIVE KNIGHT!

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:12.913
That's where you're wrong,
Playmaker.

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:14.081
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.016
doubles my KNIGHT's
attack points,

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:18.919
So your monster's the one
that'll be destroyed!

00:05:19.186 --> 00:05:21.421
You're the one
who's wrong, Bohman!

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.524
DETONATE DELETER can
automatically

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:24.825
destroy your monster,

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:26.326
no matter
how strong it is!

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.160
It can?

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:28.495
It can!

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.864
So keeping
your monster alive

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:30.831
will be as hard
as winning

00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:32.166
an argument against me!

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.167
(Playmaker)
No, it won't.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.135
Yes, it will!
I win!

00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:41.442
Oh, yeah!

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:43.643
Now that Bohman
has nothing to defend with,

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.079
his life points are prime
for a pummelin'!

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.281
DETONATE DELETER!

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.985
Attack for a second
and final time to end this duel!

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.920
Be gone, Bohman!

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:55.622
I think not!

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.758
I activate my spell card!

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.094
HALF SHUT cuts
your DETONATE DELETER's

00:06:00.094 --> 00:06:01.495
attack points in half...

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.763
which is not enough
to defeat me!

00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:11.671
Aww great.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.307
His ticker's
still tickin'.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.675
I end my turn,

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:18.178
so my DELETER's attack
points rise back to 2100.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.848
Get up, bro!

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.048
You're still in this!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.049
(groans)

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.318
If that's the best you got...

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.054
Then you, Playmaker,

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:29.155
have no chance
of beating me.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:32.759
Because I fought through
tougher battles than this.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.995
A battle called injustice.

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:37.832
Watching you, my clone,
get rescued

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.833
while I had to
stay behind...

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:42.336
That was the ultimate
wrongdoing.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:43.804
Wait, he's a fake!

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:45.539
Don't you see
I'm the real one?

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.874
Please come back!
Don't leave me!

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.812
There...
I was trapped.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:55.816
Not for a day or a month,
but for years and years

00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:58.218
with only my thoughts
to keep me company,

00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:01.955
replaying the moment
when my would-be “rescuers ”

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:03.490
turned their backs on me.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:07.460
But it wasn't their fault.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.595
Oh no...

00:07:08.662 --> 00:07:10.297
It was all yours!

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:18.438
Did Windy forget to pay
the light bill?

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:24.110
(Bohman shouts loudly)

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.713
Oh-- Alright, okay!

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:31.952
Now I will
get my revenge!

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.654
And make you suffer
even more than I did!

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.295
Now I will
get my revenge!

00:07:41.395 --> 00:07:44.164
And make you suffer
even more than I did!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.066
It's my turn.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.767
I draw!

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:51.071
If I was locked up,
I'd be salty too...

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:52.373
Wait a sec...

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:53.940
Since neither one of us

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.576
have any monsters
in our Main Monster Zones...

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:59.146
I can summon
HYDRADRIVE BOOSTER

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.147
from my hand.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.717
And that triggers BREAK
HYDRADRIVE's special ability,

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:06.820
allowing me to resummon it
from my graveyard.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:12.693
I follow that up

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:15.963
by activating
my trap card HYDRADRIVE CYCLE!

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:18.231
By paying
400 life points

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.834
I get to summon
a HYDRADRIVE TOKEN!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.938
(Ai)
Would you give up life points
for that pipsqueak?

00:08:24.938 --> 00:08:25.872
Yes, I would.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.975
To set the stage
for something big.

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:29.443
Ooh, like what?

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:32.112
Why tell you when
I can show you instead?

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.180
Behold...!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.981
A Data Storm!

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.725
This wasn't in
the five day forecast!

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.628
How ‘bout a heads up
next time, sheesh!

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:49.830
Can you feel it?

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:50.864
It's coming...

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:52.532
Your destruction!

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:55.536
I don't believe it!

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:57.938
Bohman is able to create
Data Storms?

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.942
Believe it,
Playmaker...

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:04.678
And since I have less
than 1,000 life points,

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:07.214
I can use my
Skill, Storm Access!

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:08.949
But that's our Skill,
copycat!

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.218
How's it a copy
when I'm the original!

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.552
(groans)

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.958
The winds just
suddenly kicked up, Flame.

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:19.860
But it's not
supposed to.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:22.629
It's coming from the direction
Playmaker headed.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:23.898
I know.

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:26.433
I got a bad feeling
about this.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.703
(Bohman)
Storm Access
lets me pull a new

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:31.872
Link Monster
from the Data Storm!

00:09:40.047 --> 00:09:41.948
Depending on
what he drew...

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.951
This duel could head
in any direction.

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:46.620
I couldn't whip up
a Data Storm this big,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.255
but this meatbag can?

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:49.556
Something's fishy,

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:52.392
and I'm talkin' the
half-price day-old sushi type!

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:53.894
And now...

00:09:53.894 --> 00:09:56.296
I'll generate
three circuits..

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:57.697
at once!

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:01.235
I Link Summon!

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:03.571
Link 1
BURN HYDRADRIVE,

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:07.007
FLOW HYDRADRIVE
and COOLANT HYDRADRIVE!

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:07.040
BURN HYDRADRIVE
COOLANT HYDRADRIVE

00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.876
Three HYDRADRIVES with
three different Attributes...

00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:12.179
That's correct,
Playmaker!

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:13.880
But this is only the midpoint

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.782
to generate
what I truly want!

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:18.718
The summoning conditions require

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.921
three HYDRADRIVE
Link Monsters!

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:25.225
I Link Summon!

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:29.563
Link 3
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD!

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.102
So that's the new monster you
acquired from the Data Storm.

00:10:36.537 --> 00:10:37.404
That's right.

00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:39.239
And when TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE LORD

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.941
is successfully
Link Summoned...

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:43.377
It gains the Attributes
of the monsters

00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:44.911
that were used
to summon it!

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:50.250
So that means

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.553
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE
attributes are wind,

00:10:52.553 --> 00:10:54.454
Water...
And Fire, too.

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.623
And if your monsters
happen to share

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.458
any one of those
three Attributes,

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.594
their special abilities
are negated!

00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:03.297
Then it's a good thing
that my DETONATE DELETER's

00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.666
Attribute is Dark
instead of any of those.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.334
Ha!
Pwned!

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:09.102
You think
I don't know that?

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:10.104
I activate

00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:11.838
HYDRADRIVE ACCELERATOR

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.775
and equip it on TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE LORD.

00:11:15.109 --> 00:11:16.443
HYDRADRIVE ACCELERATOR

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:19.279
has a different effect
for each different Attribute.

00:11:19.312 --> 00:11:21.782
If the equipped
monster's Attribute is Wind,

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:23.850
you can't use
any effects against

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.786
all other monsters
on my field.

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:27.755
If the equipped monster
is Water...

00:11:27.788 --> 00:11:30.123
It's not affected
by any of your trap cards.

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:31.458
And if it's Fire...

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.527
It's not affected
by your spell cards, either!

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.133
So it's protected

00:11:39.133 --> 00:11:40.867
from everything
and everything?

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:41.768
(Bohman)
Yes.

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.070
But don't fret.

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:45.772
You won't have
to suffer for very long.

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.510
My spell card
JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.946
doubles TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE LORD's attack points!

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:56.317
4,600?

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:58.452
That's enough to destroy
DETONATE DELETER

00:11:58.452 --> 00:12:00.387
and the rest
of our life points!

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.755
This is it!

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:05.425
Your end
and my new beginning!

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:17.838
Alright!

00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:19.840
Way to win the match,
Bohman--

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.507
Oh!

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:21.742
That's right...

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:23.844
And now that Playmaker
has been defeated...

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.045
I get his body!

00:12:26.346 --> 00:12:28.381
(panting)

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:29.916
Guess again.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.017
(gasps)

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:33.053
How is he standing?

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:34.021
Impossible!

00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:36.090
I erased
all your life points!

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:38.925
It's obvious that you're wrong
about that, Bohman.

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:42.262
I activate...

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:43.897
The trap LINK RATION!

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:51.739
Since both our monsters

00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:53.874
had at least five
Link Arrows between them,

00:12:53.874 --> 00:12:56.643
this trap card gave me
1,000 life points.

00:12:56.744 --> 00:12:58.879
Which was enough
to survive your attack.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.048
But just barely!

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:02.916
That's fine.

00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:05.419
Because as long as I have
a single life point remaining,

00:13:05.419 --> 00:13:06.954
I ‘m still in this duel.

00:13:07.054 --> 00:13:09.089
Since my Link Monster
was destroyed,

00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:11.558
LINK RATION summons
a RATION TOKEN.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:13.827
I shouldn't
be surprised that

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:16.096
you refuse to give up,
Playmaker.

00:13:16.163 --> 00:13:19.299
‘Cause you're a copy of me,
and I don't give up either.

00:13:19.432 --> 00:13:21.868
Does that classify
as an epic humblebrag

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:23.804
or as a backhanded
compliment?

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.406
I suppose
on the bright side...

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.309
I can punish you and
your Ignis even more!

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.244
Whaaa?

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:31.578
Why are you
pointing at me?

00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:33.580
Scooch your finger up
about eleven inches

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.414
to this guy!

00:13:34.615 --> 00:13:36.249
I've been doing
some thinking, Bohman...

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.720
Do you actually believe
that I'm your digital copy?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.422
Yes, Playmaker.

00:13:41.455 --> 00:13:43.823
I believe it down
to my very core.

00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:46.426
But I don't believe
that I'm a copy

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.827
to my very core.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:51.265
And we both can't be right,
can we?

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:53.100
So one of ya's
tellin' tall tales

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.435
but which one's
the fibster?

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:55.903
Playmaker?
Bohman?

00:13:56.037 --> 00:13:57.404
Both?!? (whimpers)

00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:58.305
(Playmaker)
Or neither.

00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:00.807
I think Bohman really believes
what he's saying.

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:02.008
Say whaaa?

00:14:02.643 --> 00:14:03.811
Because it's clear to me

00:14:03.811 --> 00:14:06.513
that someone has
manipulated his memories.

00:14:06.814 --> 00:14:08.282
That so, Playmaker?

00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.384
How can you be sure
that it wasn't you

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:12.185
who had his memories
manipulated?

00:14:12.986 --> 00:14:14.387
(Playmaker)
For three reasons.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.022
Number one:

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:18.392
How can you be so certain
you're the original

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:20.494
when you couldn't even
remember your own name

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:21.729
just a few days ago?

00:14:21.896 --> 00:14:22.796
(gasps)

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:23.997
Number two:

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.567
If you only wanted
revenge against me,

00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.969
then why would you
also attack Jin?

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.170
And three:

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.940
If we both agree
that an inferior copy

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.207
cannot defeat
the original,

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:35.976
then I will prove
I'm the original

00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:37.811
by defeating you
in this duel.

00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.647
Then that means I can
prove I'm the real one

00:14:40.847 --> 00:14:43.851
and you're the fake
by defeating you!

00:14:43.984 --> 00:14:45.619
That is what it means.

00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:48.288
But you won't
because I refuse to lose!

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.123
I draw!

00:14:50.357 --> 00:14:53.326
First, I summon CYBERSE
GADGET to the field!

00:14:55.196 --> 00:14:56.329
And CYBERSE GADGET's

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:59.133
ability revives a monster
from my graveyard.

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.068
CATCHE EVE L2!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.270
Now I'll create
my circuit

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.273
by setting my RATION
TOKEN in the Link Arrow!

00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:08.375
I Link Summon...

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.177
Link 1
LINK SPIDER!

00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:15.048
LINK SPIDER's
special ability

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.250
allows me to summon
a monster from my hand

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.385
next to its link!

00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:20.287
C'mon out!

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:21.588
PROTRON!

00:15:26.227 --> 00:15:28.395
Next,
I'll Link Summon again!

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:31.731
The summoning conditions
require two Cyberse monsters.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.101
I Link Summon,

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:36.937
Link 2
FLAME ADMINISTRATOR!

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:40.574
And with FLAME
ADMINISTRATOR's ability--

00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:42.042
Not so fast!

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:44.178
That monster's
Attribute is Fire...

00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:47.614
So TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE LORD
can negate its abilities!

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:49.383
In that case,
I'll activate

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.752
CYBERSE GADGET's
special ability!

00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:54.454
Since it was sent from
the field to the graveyard,

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.556
I can summon one GADGET TOKEN!

00:15:59.226 --> 00:16:00.560
And I'll use that TOKEN

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.629
to Link Summon
for a third time!

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.667
I Link Summon,

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.336
Link 1 LINK DISCIPLE!

00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:11.271
But I won't stop here--

00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:13.273
I set CATCHE EVE L2

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.143
and FLAME ADMINISTRATOR
in the Link Arrows

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:17.744
to Link Summon again!

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:19.980
I Link Summon...

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.683
Link 2 CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:16:23.284 --> 00:16:25.319
You know, I'd usually
be super impressed

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:26.954
with four Link
Summons in a row,

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:27.955
but not if all he got

00:16:27.955 --> 00:16:29.823
was a bunch of
worthless scrubs.

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:32.126
All of that work
for nothing.

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:34.695
That's because you think
my work is done now.

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:36.663
When I'm only
getting started.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.331
By summoning CLOCK SPARTOI,

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.401
I can then go and add
CYNET FUSION to my hand.

00:16:41.434 --> 00:16:42.235
(gasps)

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:44.271
I activate LINK KURIBOH's

00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.306
special ability
from my graveyard!

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:48.642
By tributing PROTRON,

00:16:48.742 --> 00:16:50.777
I can summon
it back to my field!

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.614
And since I summoned
LINK KURIBOH

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.449
next to CLOCK
SPARTOI's link,

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.120
I can summon a second monster
from my graveyard

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.688
as long as its Level
is four or lower.

00:17:01.721 --> 00:17:04.057
Return to the game,
CLOCK WYVERN!

00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:09.029
Whoa,
hang on a sec...

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:10.864
How'd that get
in his graveyard?

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.033
You never played
that monster!

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.268
(Bohman)
Unless...

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:17.504
that's the card he discarded
on the second turn!

00:17:18.072 --> 00:17:19.507
But that would mean...

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.708
He expected this duel
to play out

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.677
just like it
has from the start?

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.345
If this surprises you...

00:17:25.412 --> 00:17:28.148
It seems that we're not
as similar as you thought.

00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:29.883
I now activate...

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.818
The spell CYNET FUSION!

00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:34.188
I fuse CLOCK WYVERN,

00:17:34.355 --> 00:17:35.522
LINK DISCIPLE,

00:17:35.589 --> 00:17:37.224
and CLOCK SPARTOI!

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:39.893
By fusing my monsters,

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:43.730
I merge them into a new,
even more powerful creation!

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.366
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:55.208
Rise up!

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:57.477
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:12.760
(Playmaker)
Rise up!

00:18:12.893 --> 00:18:14.895
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON!

00:18:20.935 --> 00:18:23.570
Time's running out
for you now, Bohman!

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.907
CLOCK DRAGON's
special ability activates!

00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:29.243
Since the monsters
I used to summon

00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:30.543
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:32.479
had a total of three
Link Arrows,

00:18:32.479 --> 00:18:35.916
I send three cards from the top
of my deck to the graveyard

00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:38.786
to raise my DRAGON's
attack by 3,000.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:42.889
That's a whole lot more elbow
grease to clean your clock!

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:46.660
What?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.796
It's now the strongest
monster in play?

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:49.997
This is bad.

00:18:50.097 --> 00:18:52.132
If he attacks,
Bohman loses!

00:18:52.299 --> 00:18:55.101
You know it, creepy kid
who states the obvious!

00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:55.803
Attack!

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:56.970
Not so fast!

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.139
I'm activating my trap card

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:01.141
HYDRADRIVE CYCLE first!

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:03.644
By paying 400 life points,

00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:04.678
I'm allowed to summon

00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:06.680
a Fire Attribute
HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.615
on your field
in defense mode!

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.219
On our field?

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:13.787
Thank you...?

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:15.889
There's no need
to be thanking me.

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.492
Because due to TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE's ability,

00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:20.660
all of the monsters
on your field

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.829
will share
the same Attribute.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:25.232
The HYDRADRIVE
TOKEN's Attribute!

00:19:25.866 --> 00:19:26.833
I see!

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:29.136
This means Playmaker's
CYBERSE CLOCK DRAGON

00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:31.005
will change
into a Fire monster.

00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:32.172
Aww glitch!

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.373
TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:35.042
can negate
the special abilities

00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:36.143
of Fire monsters,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.811
so CLOCK DRAGON's
attack points

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:40.146
will drop back
down to 2,500!

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.381
I did tell you.

00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:44.651
That I'd anticipate
every move you might make.

00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:46.453
Except for this one.

00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:50.791
I activate CLOCK DRAGON's
second special ability!

00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.993
When a Link Monster
is on my field,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.195
your special abilities
can only target

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:56.630
my CYBERSE
CLOCK DRAGON.

00:19:58.165 --> 00:19:59.733
We have a Link Monster?

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:00.634
Where?

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.336
(Linky giggles happily)

00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:04.871
Oh yeah!
Hi, Linky!

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.474
So instead of targeting
the HYDRADRIVE TOKEN

00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:09.609
to change
my monsters into Fire...

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:11.378
you must target
my CLOCK DRAGON

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:13.613
and change my monsters
into Dark!

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.382
And TRIDENT
HYDRADRIVE LORD

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:18.052
can't negate my Dark
monsters' special abilities!

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:19.553
But my JUDGMENT ARROWS

00:20:19.553 --> 00:20:22.222
doubles TRIDENT HYDRADRIVE
LORD's attack points!

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:25.659
So what?

00:20:25.659 --> 00:20:26.560
Because...

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.395
It's not enough
to save you!

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:38.038
(groans)

00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:43.810
Yeah, Playmake!
You won!

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.612
I knew you were
the real you!

00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:47.214
I never doubted you
for a minute--

00:20:47.214 --> 00:20:48.215
just a few seconds.

00:20:48.215 --> 00:20:49.182
Mwah!

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:50.451
(groans)

00:20:50.618 --> 00:20:52.152
No, this can't be...

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:53.354
He beat me?

00:20:54.021 --> 00:20:55.789
(Mysterious Voice)
Bohman lost...

00:20:56.156 --> 00:20:59.060
But this is how
he learns.

00:20:59.326 --> 00:21:03.063
And learning
will lead to winning.

00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.006
Playmaker!

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:15.709
You may have beaten
Bohman this time...

00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:18.345
But next time things
are gonna end differently!

00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:25.585
(Soulburner)
Playmaker! Over here!

00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:27.721
Soulburner!

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:30.057
I'm detecting
sudden changes

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.725
in this world's
infrastructure.

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:33.794
Its programming is
losing cohesion.

00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:35.062
(Ai)
That's fancy talk for

00:21:35.062 --> 00:21:37.264
this place is
goin' gone-zo!

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:39.767
(Flame)
We must leave now
while we still can.

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:42.102
(Soulburner)
Quick,
use your emergency logout!

00:21:43.103 --> 00:21:44.538
You heard him say quick,
right?

00:21:44.538 --> 00:21:45.906
Cuz you're not
being quick!

00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:48.375
Bohman's a powerful
adversary,

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:50.710
so who could be strong
enough to control him?

00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:52.346
Whatever may come,

00:21:52.379 --> 00:21:54.714
I will find the one
behind all of this.
