But it's not SOL Tech
that worries me.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.685
It's the plan being
devised by Dr. Kogami.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.487
Hm.

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:10.190
I agree that the Ignis
must be eliminated,

plan is...

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.361
It's just that I am fearful
that in the end we may

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.330
be taking it too far.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.233
And Varis will be the one
who pays the price!

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.670
Baira, don't let your emotions
cloud your reason.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.206
Even though you feel
as if Varis is family,

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:26.940
the mission <i>must</i> come first.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:30.277
I know, but don't pretend
that you're not worried

00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.446
about Varis
as well.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:35.349
As he is the leader
of the Knights of Hanoi,

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.352
he will be the one...
to shoulder the blame.

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.189
The only option
is to destroy the Ignis

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.891
and annihilate the
Cyberse before Dr. Kogami's

to accomplish.

Playmaker and eliminate him

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.204

With the great number
of duelists you deleted,

something worse
will happen.

cause of my nightmare, but now,

00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:06.226
I'll be yours!

00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:14.268
(Skye)
This is one duel that
I can't afford to lose!

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.704
Okay, I'll place
this card facedown

00:17:16.804 --> 00:17:18.973
and end my turn!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.408
So, you're up, Baira.

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:23.544
I don't know what tricks
you have up your sleeve,

00:17:23.577 --> 00:17:25.646
but I'm ready
for any and all of 'em.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:26.881
Hmph.

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:30.083
It's cute.
How confident you are.

00:17:31.418 --> 00:17:33.187
I don't know why you would be

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.856
when you're using
your same old strategies.

00:17:35.889 --> 00:17:39.159
Your lack of innovation
will be your Achilles heel.

00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:42.830
For you see...

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.566
I prepped my deck
to beat yours!

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.669
I knew you'd play your Trickstar
Light Stage so I had a card

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:51.538
ready to take advantage of it!

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.008
When there's a Field Spell
in play, I'm allowed to summon

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:56.210
Dark Mummy Probe!

00:17:56.243 --> 00:17:57.577
Come on out!

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.383
(moans)

00:18:02.449 --> 00:18:05.619
Then the Field Spell in play
is immediately destroyed!

00:18:05.653 --> 00:18:07.220
What?!
No way!

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:11.291
Now I'm summoning a second
Dark Mummy Probe!

00:18:12.626 --> 00:18:14.561
(moans)

00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:17.998
I'll place this facedown.

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:22.035
And then... well,
I'll activate <i>this</i> spell card!

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.771
Temple of the Kings!

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:26.940
It lets me play a trap and
activate it on the same turn!

00:18:26.973 --> 00:18:30.277
So I activate the trap
Current Corruption Virus!

00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:32.046
No!
A virus?

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:36.450
It requires me to tribute
one of my Dark Mummy Probes.

00:18:36.483 --> 00:18:39.119
But in exchange,
your monsters with 2000

00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.454
or fewer defense points

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:43.156
lose all their special abilities
and attack points

00:18:43.256 --> 00:18:45.725
for three whole turns!

00:18:48.963 --> 00:18:50.797
(screams)

00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:56.203
You may have infected
one of my Trickstars,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.605
but my Holly Angel's immune

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:00.207
because Link Monsters
don't have defense points!

00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:02.509
Yes, I'm quite aware.

00:19:02.543 --> 00:19:06.046
So I will tribute
my other Dark Mummy Probe.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:08.182
That lets me activate this.

00:19:08.282 --> 00:19:09.850
The spell
Monster Restitch!

00:19:09.883 --> 00:19:13.520
It sews together three
Dark Mummy Tokens!

00:19:16.857 --> 00:19:19.393
(Skye)
She transformed
one monster into three!

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.528
Which is more than enough
to Link Summon!

00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:24.998
(Skye gasps)

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.601
Watch as I suture
the circuit!

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:29.202
Go!

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:34.341
For me to Link Summon
I need three Dark Mummies,

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:37.611
therefore I set my three
Dark Mummy Tokens

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:40.213
in the Link Arrows!

00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:42.116
Come on out!

00:19:42.183 --> 00:19:45.652
Link 3 Dark Mummy
Surgical Forceps!

00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:49.155
(roars)

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.062
That monster really
needs a manicure. Yikes!

00:19:55.162 --> 00:19:58.031
Now it's time I administer

00:19:58.064 --> 00:19:59.567
your monsters a checkup!

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:04.271
Surgical Forceps,
incise Trickstar Holly Angel!

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.806
(gasps)

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.841
(roaring)

00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:09.443
That is such a no!

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:12.546
I activate my trap
Trickstar Perennial!

00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:15.549
By sending Trickstar Nightshade
to the graveyard,

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:18.718
Trickstar Holly Angel
can't be destroyed in battle!

00:20:20.454 --> 00:20:22.689
You may have saved
your monster...

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.226
but can you save yourself?

00:20:25.326 --> 00:20:27.494
(Skye screaming)

00:20:29.196 --> 00:20:31.198
Have a nice fall,
Blue Angel.

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:32.699
(wind whooshing)

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:38.038
(grunts)

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:39.940
Hey!

00:20:48.181 --> 00:20:49.216
Hey, Baira!

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:50.951
You're not shaking me off!

00:20:51.018 --> 00:20:53.186
(Baira)
I pity you, Blue Angel.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.023
Crashing would've been far less
painful than what I have

00:20:56.057 --> 00:20:57.357
in store for you.

00:20:57.457 --> 00:21:01.429
Because no matter what you try,
your diagnosis is defeat!

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.697
Blue Angel whipped herself
out of trouble!

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.298
She's still so in the duel!

00:21:05.398 --> 00:21:08.769
And... so is every member
of the True Blue Crew!

00:21:08.869 --> 00:21:10.604
Win this Blue Angel!

00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:14.575
C'mon!
The True Blue Crew
believe in you!

00:21:14.675 --> 00:21:16.376
(Ai)
Poor Blue Angel...

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.412
She's giving it
all she's got, but...

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:20.581
If she only had an AI like me,

00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:22.216
then she'd--
(Yusaku)
Lose quicker?

00:21:22.249 --> 00:21:23.617
(stutters)

00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:25.252
(groans)

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.759

this video again.
