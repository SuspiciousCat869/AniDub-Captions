So I said, "You spread
mustard on a sandwich,

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.478
you squeeze mustard
on a hot dog."

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.414
Education. We gotta
look out for each other.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.685
Speaking of, you look
like you could use a break.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.920

♪♪♪

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:26.260
Nothing like an iced slushy
and a sea breeze.
Sure.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.695
But how do you expect
to get any customers,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.829
being all the way out here?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.298
Don't you worry.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:33.833
While you were face deep
in your laptop there,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.270
I sold a hot dog
with all the fixins

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.005
to one lucky gentleman.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.274
One whole hot dog, huh?

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.977
Take a gander out there.

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:44.912
Who wouldn't want to
feast on these sights

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.614
while feastin'
on a footlong?

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:49.283
And if you're lucky to be
here at just the right time

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.951
on just the right night,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.753
the tide sweeps glowing
plankton into these waters,

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:57.258
forming the Stardust Road
as far as the eye can see.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.259
The Stardust Road's so rare

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.661
that the guy
who just bought a dog

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.030
and lives on top
of that cliff...

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.699
a million to one,
I doubt he's ever seen it.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.669
Well I should probably
get back to work.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:10.971
You sure?
Better pace yourself.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:12.239
You'll burn out.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.641
Getting to the truth
about my past

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.710
is more important
than anything, Kolter.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.513
Burning out is
the least of my worries.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.847
Hear that.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.317
But seriously,
take care of yourself.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.519
Our fight against
the Knights of Hanoi

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.487
is a marathon,
not a sprint.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.190
And I've already seen
too many people suffer.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.192
But we're one step closer.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.994
According to
SOL Tech's database,

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.331
a certain Dr. Kogami
started the Lost Incident,

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.734
but why is a mystery.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.470
And he's no longer
around to tell us.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.238
Unfortunate.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.541
But at least we've
learned his name.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.744
And that's more than
we knew yesterday.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:52.012
Guess so.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:53.714
But are you sure Ai
doesn't have

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.083
any more information
he'd like to share with us?

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:59.686
He did munch
the entire database.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.757
I bet he's loungin',
rubbin' his belly...

00:02:02.757 --> 00:02:05.759
What's he do when
he's home alone anyway?

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.096
(Ai)
So Playmaker's like,
"Noooo! I'm gonna lose!"

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.765
until I say, "Not if
you play that card!"

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.101
And that's how I
saved him again!

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.636
He is so lucky
to have you.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.405
Hmm, you think?

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:19.440
You know what?

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.442
You're absolutely correct!

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.944
And that wasn't the only
time I won him the duel!

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.280
Far from it!
Wanna hear another story?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.616
Do ya, do ya, do ya?

a mysterious message
from this meatbag.

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:49.697
She's supposedly
a great hacker,

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:52.332

What's her name again?

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.201
Ah! Gore Gal!

So check this out.

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:58.639
It's a message
from Ghost Gal.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.040
Looks like gibberish.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.009
Sure does,
but the thing is,

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.244
it's written in a
cipher that only I use.

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:05.779
So what's it say?

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.714
She's challenging you
to a duel.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.184
Well, not <i>you</i> you,

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:11.518
And if she wins the duel,

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.286
she gets to take
possession of Ai.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.955
Dream on, sister!

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:16.890

Right, best friend
forever? Yeah?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.262
I'm in.
Whaaa?

00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:24.531
Huh?
Just look at what
she's offering up in return.

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:27.868
If I win, we get backdoor access
to Sol Tech's mainframe.

Oh!

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.371
Gore Gal vs. Playmaker,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.507
and the winner
gets to have me!

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.576
That's the problem
with being so popular.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.043
Everybody wants you.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:39.113

Sometimes
it's really hard being me.

The pressure
of being beautiful.

your tricks, Ghost Gal.

Me? Tricks?

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:58.565
Okay, usually,
but not this time.

The backdoor program,
all zipped up and ready to go.

That's a valuable program.
So, why are you risking it?

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.781
Because your AI will
fetch a much higher price.

00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:15.649
I already have buyers
lined up.

I've analyzed your
strategies, Playmaker,

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.004
and you're winning these days

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:41.575
using your new Skill,
Storm Access.

00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.411
Sure, it's one tough
Skill to beat,

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.615
but you can only activate it
during your turn. So...

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:53.087
I'll make sure you never
get the chance to use it!

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:55.289
She was outdueling
Playmaker,

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.157
and the only way to
turn the duel around

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.292
was to get Gore Gal
to mistakenly attack.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.362
And she wouldn't do that!

00:06:01.362 --> 00:06:02.830
<i>Au contraire!</i>

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.432
That's where I tricked her
with my awesome acting!

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:07.568
Oh, noes!
We're in danger!

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.503
If she pokes us
with those tentacles,

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:11.739
we'll be flappin'
like a fish filet!

The Ai-manity!

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.076
Hope she forgets to attack,

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:17.911
'cause that's the most
problematic thing

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.380
with no conceivable
drawbacks to occur!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.050
Oh, no! I'm glitching
out into moves

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.685
that make me
an enticing target!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.221
I did not think attacking
was my best option,

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.424
but I am now fully
convinced that it is!

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:33.193
Thank you, Ai--
I mean, your greatness!

00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.329
Straight up, you're
double deuce aces!

your glorious guidance!

Is that what
really happened?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.136
Eh, close enough.
Now where was I?

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:45.573
Oh, yeah! You can
now use your Skill

00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:48.041
to pull a new monster
outta the Data Storm!

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.343

and still couldn't stop him

00:07:14.935 --> 00:07:17.070
from activating his Skill.

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:25.079

(gasps)

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:49.496
I leave Link VRAINS for
like two and a half seconds

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:51.365
and now duelists are robots?

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.334
How the... Blue Angel?

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.535
Intruder determined
as hostile.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.940
Optimal action:
eliminate intruder.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.343
Now... create
the ultimate circuit!

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.579
I Link Summon...

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:09.216
Link 3 Vector
Scare Archfiend!

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:12.185
♪♪♪

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.759
It's over!

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.061
Vector Scare Archfiend...

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.630
attack
Tentacluster Nautilus!

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.566
Diabolical Destruction!

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:33.040
(Blue Angel)
Teamwork time!

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.376
I need exactly two
Trickstars to Link Summon.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:40.780
So I set Trickstar's Narkissus
and Lycoris in the Link Arrows!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.851
Link the circuit!

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.286
I Link Summon...

00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:49.022
the purr-fectly delightful...

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:52.192
Link 2 Trickstar
Black Catbat!

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:54.895
Black Catbat!

00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:57.130
Let's put this duel to rest!

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.399
You think you're
a state-of-the-art AI?

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.868
You're basic!

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.436
Yah!

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.611
Yeah! Ha ha!

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.712
And that's how
you stay blue!

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:17.251
(Ai)
Is that the core?

00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.553
Seems so.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:24.291
Zaizen, Ghost Gal,

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:26.794
now I understand
why you're here.

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:29.196
To stop me from
getting access.

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:32.032
If you won't voluntarily
step to the side,

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:33.767
then I'll go through you!

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.168
I will not.

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:36.370
Let me be clear.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.838
I'm willing
to risk everything

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:38.905
to get what I want.

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:40.541
And that even
includes...

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.676
putting Ai on the line
and up for grabs.

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:43.710
Yeah. Wait, what?

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.078
But, if I win,

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.514
I get direct access
to the databank.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:49.549
Very well.

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.886
If it's the only way
to break our stalemate...

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.588
So be it!

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:57.023
We'll let our cards
decide the matter!

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:58.192
Okay...

00:10:58.192 --> 00:10:59.392
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.331
And once again,
they're fighting over me!

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:06.700
You're so popular!

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.936
Yes, I am!
But I wish I wasn't.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.473
All I want is peace,
but my very existence

00:11:12.473 --> 00:11:16.076
is causing strife
and tragedy! Oh!

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:20.114
Poor master...
or are you acting again?

00:11:20.114 --> 00:11:23.450
Of course I am!
Fight! Fight over me!

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.819
Fight for my love!

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:27.287
And boy did they!

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:30.791
I activate my Base Gardna's
special ability.

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:32.025
Aw, glitch!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.493
Glitch, indeed.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:36.797
I shall summon
Tindangle Hound!

00:11:36.797 --> 00:11:38.465
(roars)

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:41.835
Uhh! Wait, that's
all yip and yap!

00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:44.471
Decode Talker still
has higher attack points!

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:48.775
Decode Talker, attack!

00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:56.750
You can't get rid of
my Hound that easily!

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.653
Because it's back
on the field!

00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:01.088
I Link Summon...

00:12:01.088 --> 00:12:04.424
Link 4 Firewall Dragon!

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:17.504
Playmaker has his best monster
out. Now the question is,

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.973
can Akira find
a way to top it?

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:22.042
Because if he can't,
his life points

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:24.344
are hitting rock bottom!

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:30.250
Now emerge...

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.219
Tindangle Acute Cerberus!

00:12:38.325 --> 00:12:39.492
(wails)

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:40.861
Oh, wait, what
am I scared of?

00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:42.363
It has no attack points.

00:12:42.363 --> 00:12:44.998
You may have fought
valiantly, Playmaker,

00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:49.169
but ultimate victory
remains in my grasp!

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:52.973
Acute Cerberus,
destroy Firewall Dragon!

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:55.508
Isometric Inferno!

00:12:59.814 --> 00:13:04.785
I then place two cards
facedown and end my turn.

00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:06.153
Are you even trying?

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.921
You know what's gonna
happen if you lose?

00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:09.923
Zaizen gets to
take me from you!

00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.158
And I won't be around
to give you

00:13:11.158 --> 00:13:13.627
positive vibes,
you mindless meatbag!

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:16.430
If that's your idea of
words of encouragement, Ai,

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.432
I'm more than willing
to help you pack.

00:13:18.432 --> 00:13:20.167
Uhh! So not cool!

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:21.935
After everything
we went through?

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.070
The millions of times
I saved you?

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.206
You'd abandon
your bestie like that?

00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:29.543
Whoever said
we were besties?

00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:31.045
How can one noun,
two verbs,

00:13:31.045 --> 00:13:34.047
and two pronouns
hurt so much?

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:35.982
Maybe he's jealous of you.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:40.221
Right? Why else
would a bestie get
more than testy?

00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:42.088
Poor master.
Even your compassion

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:44.458
cannot melt
his frozen heart.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:46.994
May I suggest downloading
a flamethrower app?

00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:48.595
There's a thought.

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:51.298
But continue the story
first, please.

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:53.234
Right. So, like,
Playmaker's back

00:13:53.234 --> 00:13:55.903
is against the wall, but
with me giving pro tips,

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:57.571
he's uber confident.

00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:01.876
It all comes down
to this one draw...

00:14:01.876 --> 00:14:04.211
But I believe in my deck!

00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:05.446
I draw!

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:07.214
So tell me, Playmaker,

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:08.649
did your trust pay off?

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:11.151
Well?

00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:15.856
I place this card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:18.392
Clearly not the card
you were hoping for,

00:14:18.392 --> 00:14:21.829
because miracles don't
happen in real life.

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:26.166
So you'll lose this duel
and lose your one opportunity

00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.369
to uncover the mysteries
of your past.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.770
But you have won
something in exchange.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.306
Your freedom.

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.975
The past is a ball
and chain.

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:37.644
It keeps you from
moving forward in life.

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:41.382
But now, at long last,
you will finally be able to.

00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:43.483
I know what they did
to you was horrendous,

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.385
but I'll take care
of your problem.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:48.188
So go make new friends,
be adventurous.

00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:50.124
You can do anything

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:53.494
when you're no longer
consumed with revenge.

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:56.297
Your future is right
before your eyes.

00:14:56.297 --> 00:14:59.199
Right before our eyes?
I don't see anything.

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.901
(Skye)
So it's all peaches
and cream, huh?

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:06.006
(gasps)
Skye!

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.541
I've been
listening to you two

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:10.578
jabbering about the
past this and past that.

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:14.014
So, Playmaker,
what happened?

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:15.916
Akira, you care to share?

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:18.118
I'll tell you what I know.

00:15:18.118 --> 00:15:19.586
Story time!

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:23.557
There was an incident
known among inner circles

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:26.260
<i>as the "Lost Incident."</i>

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.061
Six children went missing,

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.731
mysteriously vanishing
one-by-one

00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.734
because a secret
organization took them.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:37.037
And one of the six
children was Playmaker.

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:38.672
It's true
that I was taken,

00:15:38.672 --> 00:15:41.408
but that was only the
beginning of things.

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:46.513
I found myself alone
in an empty room,

00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:48.883
except for one thing.

00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:50.417
A single piece of VR tech.

00:15:51.752 --> 00:15:54.254
The headset
showed a duel field

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:57.858
where I was forced
to duel and win.

00:15:57.858 --> 00:15:59.860
Because if I didn't...

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.361
(computer voice)
<i>You lose!</i>

00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.495
(groans)

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:04.197
I was punished
for my failure.

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.936
It was a tedious
existence...

00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:11.739
Eat, sleep, and duel.

00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.807
That's all I was
permitted to do.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:18.178
Eat, sleep, and duel.

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.647
(computer voice)
<i>You lose!</i>

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:23.617
And when I lost, the
"eat" portion went away,

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:26.620
so I had to improve
as a duelist to win.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.756
(groans)

00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:32.426
Duel after duel after duel,
hour after hour,

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:34.828
day after day,
wondering why I'm here,

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:36.997
wondering why life
dealt me this hand,

00:16:36.997 --> 00:16:38.298
wondering
when this would end,

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.500
if it would ever
end at all,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.240
and then one day,
it just did.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.743
You were rescued, but
the culprit was never found.

00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:52.612
In fact, the whole Lost
Incident was covered up,

00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:55.182
so the public
never knew it even occurred.

00:16:55.182 --> 00:16:56.950
Zaizen...

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.721
you said that those rescuers
saved me that day.

00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:02.923
But I wasn't saved at all!

00:17:06.727 --> 00:17:08.829
There are three reasons
why I must learn

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.932
the motive behind
the Lost Incident.

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:14.935
One: I can only
move past my suffering

00:17:14.935 --> 00:17:18.038
when I know why I had to
suffer in the first place.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.874
<i>Two: To save those
who are still afflicted</i>

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.744
from the ramifications
of what we had to endure.

00:17:23.744 --> 00:17:27.848
And three: When I was
about to give up back then,

00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:30.083
one voice kept me going.

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.752
(voice)
Hey...

00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:33.420
Hey...

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.556
C'mon, you gotta get up.

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:36.823
I can't do it.

00:17:36.823 --> 00:17:38.392
You can make it
through this.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:40.060
You just have to
always remember

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.929
these three things...

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:43.597
One: If you give up now,

00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:45.565
there won't be a next time.

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:49.036
Two: You can't win if you
don't believe you can win.

00:17:49.036 --> 00:17:51.471
And three: Just because
it's tough now

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:52.873
doesn't mean
it will always be.

00:17:52.873 --> 00:17:56.476
The reason I'm here today
is because of that voice.

00:17:56.476 --> 00:17:59.079
And whoever that was
was not among the rescued.

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:02.450
So if he's still captured,
I must rescue him!

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.885
Zaizen, you speak
of the Lost Incident

00:18:04.885 --> 00:18:07.955
as if it was something that
was ended a decade ago.

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:09.056
But for me,

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:11.591
<i>it still hasn't ended!</i>

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:15.795
Many people
did try to help me

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:17.665
readjust back
to a normal life.

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:21.135
My teachers and classmates
treated me no different,

00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:23.570
just another normal kid.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.105
Deep down inside though,

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:28.776
I was still struggling
through the pain...

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:31.945
And this pain would
only grow as I grew older...

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.547

The nightmares would
come every night.

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:41.621
It was as if I was falling

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.957
into a bottomless
chasm of despair,

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.826
but I realized that if
I didn't want to break,

00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:48.428
I had to climb out on my own.

00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:51.998
Instead of trying
to avoid it,

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:56.069
I decided to confront
the demons that haunt me.

As he is the leader

he definitely must know
something of value.
