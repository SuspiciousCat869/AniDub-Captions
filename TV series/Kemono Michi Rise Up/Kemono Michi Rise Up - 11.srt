This isn't teaching, it's abuse!

I told you yesterday
that training

[CLAUSE] Yes, they'll be located

Yeah, but, like,
where specifically?

There'll be a lot of vendors.

We've significantly
increased our sponsorships

as well, now.
Which equates to more money.

left is for Genzo to decide

who'll be competing

Looks pretty overcast to me.

This is total balls!

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,704
I don't wanna do any more
of this lifting stuff:

60
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,248
if I don't learn some moves,
I'll have no chance of winning!

Trust the process!

If you don't know
the right way to lift,

you won't be able
to pull off any moves!

We don't have
that much time, Genzo.

[ANIMAL MASK]
Then stop whining!

If you don't have the endurance,
why even get in the ring?

[growls] I can't take
much more lecturing.

And this time around...

...I have to win my fight.

00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,570
To prove that I'm worthy.

00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,655
Good, because that counts...

00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,656
So, Carmilla...

I've known her ever
since I was young.

The servant that she
had with her is Rose,

00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,714
who fought Carmilla
before and totally wiped

86
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,383
the floor with her.
It was absolutely brutal.

87
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,928
Okay. Here's a thought.

88
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,513
It would probably
make a lot more sense

00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,014
if you fought instead.

End of story.

some prime eating time,

00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,276
so it's not an option!

96
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
[ANIMAL MASK]
It was worth a shot.

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,446
But it's gonna be hard
to properly train her

98
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,615
if I don't know much
about her opponent.

be ready for anything.

Yes, I suppose you're right.

And if he's already begun
the celebration this soon,

117
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,348
then that's a strong
indication that victory

in this battle will be ours.

Yes, indeed it is!

Defeating the hero and
getting revenge on Lindabulea

will be an absolutely
delicious treat.

[ANIMAL MASK] So this person's
already beaten you once before?

125
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,953
Yes, and, besides
the personal embarrassment,

126
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:56,708
it caused a number of
problems for my mistress.

But with this fight...

taste sweet vengeance.

[CARMILLA]
Oh, and by the way...

You have your own history

from your world, don't you?

133
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,098
You see, I was going to
retire from the ring

134
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,266
and open a pet shop.

135

He would have been
my last opponent.

on this fight as well.

Yeah, I suppose
that'd be fair to say.

Hey, Genzo!

[CARMILLA]
Uh, but how?

You haven't taught me
how to do anything yet!

You know, you really put
all you had into that fight.

476
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,114
It took a lot of guts,
and you came out of it a winner.

477
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:24,742
No, I... Didn't you see?

478
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:29,538
She beat me...
I lost to her again...

479
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,081
No way...

480
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,125
[CARMILLA]
Huh...?

481
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,670
It sure looked
like a victory to me.

482
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:41,050
I'm proud of you, and you should
be proud of yourself, too.

483
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,928
So here's your reward.

484
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,972
[whimpers]
You are way too good to me.

485
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,057
[sobs, whimpers]

486
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,893
[HANAKO chuckles]
There's no crying in wrestling.

487
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,270
[sobbing continues]

488
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,438
Thank you!

489
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,524
This is the very first time my
mistress has ever shared

490
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,942
her food with me!

491
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,527
‐‐[sobbing loudly]
‐‐That's really something, huh?

492
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,861
[ANIMAL MASK]
Mm‐mm.

493
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,908
[MAO] Genzo Shibata, or should
I say, Animal Mask?

494
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,703
Well, that's a name...

495
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,873
...I haven't heard
in a long time.

496
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,043
Are you ready
to get it on, or what?

497
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,169
Oh, yeah!

498
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,255
Got a suplex just for you!

499
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,267
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Hero and Demon King."

500
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,560
You better check it out!
