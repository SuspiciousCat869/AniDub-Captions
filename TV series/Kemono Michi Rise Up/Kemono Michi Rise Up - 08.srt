Awesome work‐‐
the fight was a success!

Eat and drink your fill,
you've earned it!

484
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,749
Congratulations!
The event was a huge success.

485
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,085
I'm not sure we should count
the last match as a success.

486
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,045
The good news is we made a ton.

487
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,131
So, we can pay you a substantial
amount for the fight.

488
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,342
Yes! We're one step closer
to getting the pet shop!

[SELLER 8A]
Excuse me, Shigure?

496
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,069
Yes?

497
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,821
It's the bill.

[SHIGURE]
Huh...?

499
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,286
What the hell is this crap?!

500
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,954
Do you see all these
bills we got for repairs

501
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,123
on the stalls and buildings you
wrecked during practice?!

502
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,958
Look at the tab for the booze
Carmilla guzzled down!

503
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,835
And don't get me
started on Hanako's tab!

504
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,796
Plus, there's the money we owe
the baker for the tons of bread

505
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,714
everyone ate and this
stupid after‐party!

506
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:39,799
Now all the prize money we won

507
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,551
and the money from my stall
is completely gone...!

[ANIMAL MASK, HANAKO, CARMILLA]
We're sorry...

509
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,472
Looks like we're going
back to watered down soup

510
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,933
and salted potatoes.

511
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,351
[ANIMAL MASK, HANAKO, CARMILLA]
Fair.

512
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,197
The hero has had ample
time to prepare for battle.

513
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,534
I'm sure he's used it to
assemble a powerful army.

514
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,077
A team match, huh?

515
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,455
Yeah, he's good at those.

[JOANNA] I propose
we try and strengthen

517
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,500
our own forces as well.

[MAO]
Do you have a plan?

519
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,048
Yes. We recruit
the demon beasts to help.

520
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,675
Demon beasts?

521
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,594
Do you mean animals?
