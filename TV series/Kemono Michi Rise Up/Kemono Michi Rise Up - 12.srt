[ANIMAL MASK] I decided
I wanted to own a pet shop

on the match.

I had to beat a Demon King.

with me, but then you showed up.

that the Demon King

One man uses a move.

Carmilla and I will continue
to observe and keep tabs

There were some
complications, though.

379
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,842
The damage from Genzo and the
other wrestlers far exceeded

380
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,094
the event's profits.

381
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,722
This is the repair bill
to cover the damage.

Wha‐‐?

383

[CLAUSE] We also have
to factor in Hanako's food

as well as Carmilla's drinking.
