Fess up, Genzo.

Call it "wrestler's intuition,"

but I doubt that girl
is the culprit in this.

Then again, Shigure's
nose is rarely wrong

about these things.
Which means...

It's likely that half‐dragon

473
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,548
Please don't say whatever
I think you're going to say.

474
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,800
It's too soon and the
audience will see it coming!

475
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,343
‐‐So, Genzo!
‐‐[ANIMAL MASK] What?

476
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,554
I'd like to formally request
to stay here and help you

477
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,723
with your dream of
starting a pet shop!

478
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,475
What about your
responsibilities to your family?

479
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,395
Too bad. I've made my choice.

480
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,189
Fate is what led us
to each other.

481
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,693
No matter what anyone
says, my mind's made up.

482
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,446
Therefore, will you
allow me to stay here

483
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,781
by your side? Hiroyuki?

484
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,782
[HIROYUKI whines]

485
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,908
What the what?!

486
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,285
[CARMILLA]
Huh?

487
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,580
Very well, then.

488
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,874
I shall go and inform the
clan leader of your decision

489
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,709
as soon as possible.

490
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,253
‐‐[HIROYUKI whines]
‐‐You will? Promise?

491
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes. Believe it or not,

492
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,800
your well‐being has always
been my highest priority.

493
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:00,968
Wait a sec!

494
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,553
We can't afford a new employee‐‐

495
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,638
we haven't even opened
for business yet!

496
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,474
As long as I have
food and a place to sleep,

497
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,975
I don't need money!

498
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,018
[SHIGURE]
Approved.

499
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,102
Then it's settled.

500
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, but we can't
go around calling you

501
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,815
Lindabu‐longest‐name
‐ever, am I right?

502
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,567
Let's see.

503
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,985
I've got it! Call me Hanako!

504
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,529
Like when we used
our code names earlier!

505
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,614
Are you sure?

506
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,615
[HANAKO]
Yes!

507
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,825
Right! Well, welcome aboard.

508
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,286
Oh, so who was
the suspicious person

509
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,746
we were looking for?

510
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,080
[HANAKO]
Suspicious person?

511
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,915
That's right.

512
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,000
Did you possibly
attack any humans?

513
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,293
That's so rude!

514
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,796
Even I wouldn't go
around eating people!

515
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,631
I've been told
humans are omnivores

516
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,174
and therefore taste quite bland!

517
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,052
And there's no way
you bit someone to sample them?

518
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,553
Yeah, all the people
who were attacked

519
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,388
had puncture holes
on their necks.

520
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,808
Oh, that was probably me.

521
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,725
[ANIMAL MASK]
Nuh?

522
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,935
[HANAKO]
Explain yourself!

523
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,646
Well, when I was
hunting for you, I got excited.

524
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,773
I may have helped
myself to a little snack.

525
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,609
You know, just some humans
who were passing by.

526
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,861
Would it be okay if
we kept that our little secret?

527
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:01,987
Eh‐heh!

528
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,448
[ANIMAL MASK]
It was you...?!

529
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,784
[CARMILLA screams]

530
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,495
[VOICE 1A]
One. Two. Three!

531
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,455
‐‐[bell rings]
‐‐[CROWD cheers]

532
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,123
[ANIMAL MASK]
Hmph!

533
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,334
[SHIGURE] Is she supposed
to foam at the mouth like that?

534
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,836
[ANIMAL MASK]
She'll never taste bacon again.

535
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,088
[HANAKO]
Genzo, do you have any snacks?

536
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,756
[SHIGURE]
What? Definitely not!

537
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,809
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Demon Beast and Part‐Time Job!"
