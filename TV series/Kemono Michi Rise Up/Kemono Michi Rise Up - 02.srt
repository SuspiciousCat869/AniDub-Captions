474
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:37,379
needed by the government
to open your business, yes?

475
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,380
[ANIMAL MASK]
That's right!

476
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,801
In order to qualify for a loan
for the full amount listed,

477
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,636
you'll need to have
a least 20% of the amount

478
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,180
in hand to put up
as a down payment.

479
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,848
How much would that be?

480
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,186
Seriously?!

481
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,357
We don't have even
close to that much cash!

482
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,442
One more thing.
I hope you don't mind

483
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,736
my asking, but...

484
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,864
This pet shop.
What is its purpose, exactly?

485
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,741

Doesn't anybody know?!
