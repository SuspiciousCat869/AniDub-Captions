1
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,061
It worked!

2
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,108
[MAO]
What is this place?

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,777
A few minutes ago,
I was inner‐monologuing

4
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,446
in my bedroom!

5
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,781
[gasps]

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,367
[MONSTERS growling, murmuring]

7
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,704
Welcome to my castle.

8
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,831
I am one of the four
Dukes of Darkness,

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,084
a servant of the
mighty Demon King.

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,919
I also happen to be
the proud daughter

11
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,005
of Wallen Joannascore
Adorian Uljika.

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:52,177
And I go by the name of Joanna
Joannascore Adorian Uljika.

13
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,929
Demon King from another world,

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,473
summoned here by
the gods of darkness,

15
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,643
will you help us
to defeat the hero?

16
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,103
Huh?

17
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,729
Tell me your name.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,149
It's MAO.

19
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,234
‐‐[MONSTERS murmuring]
‐‐[MONSTER 6A] You hear that?

20
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,277
[MONSTER 6B]
We actually succeeded in

21
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,320
summoning the Demon King!

22
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,407
You are the Demon King
from another world?

23
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,831
[JOANNA] This is a picture of
the hero that Princess Altena

24
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,500
of Edgardo summoned
not long ago.

25
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:24,960
No, it can't be!

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,628
[ROSE]
He fled the castle shortly after

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,297
he was summoned to this world.

28
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,465
[MAO grunts]
Wow, it's him!

29
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,594
This is where that coward
has been hiding all this time?

30
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,680
[JOANNA] We're giving you
the task of defeating him.

31
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,348
[gasps]

32
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,103
[laughs]

33
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,022
You want me to
defeat Animal Mask?

34
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,274
I was made for this.

35
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,192
What are you insinuating?

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,987
Do the Demon King
and Hero know each other?

37
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:55,782
No way. It goes beyond
just knowing the guy.

38
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,701
Our relationship is complicated.

39
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:01,121
Words could never begin
to describe our rivalry!

40
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,290
[laughs]

41
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,918
That's wonderful news.
Wouldn't you agree?

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,919
Indeed.

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,962
[MAO coughing]

44
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,061
[ROSE]
What a coincidence.

45
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,940
One could even go so far
as to say it's "destiny."

46
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,316
The Demon King
from another world

47
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,944
already hates the hero.

48
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,237
[JOANNA]
Yes.

49
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,699
Between my own hatred, and the
feelings of the Demon King.

50
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,743
The darkness will grow stronger.

51
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,537
Combine them together
and it's quite powerful.

52
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,538
[ROSE]
Indeed.

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,165
I'm done playing around.

54
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,418
This time, I'm going
to crush that girl.

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,211
My nemesis...

56
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,256
Fafnir Gildomela
Grind Lindabulea.

[JOANNA grunts]

59
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,221
[SWORD MASTER 6A laughs]
Good form, Lady Joanna.

60
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,056
You improve more
and more everyday.

61
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,141
At this rate,

62
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,852
you'll surely be the victor
at the next tournament.

63
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,145
[JOANNA gasps]

64

[JOANNA yelps]

65
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,903
[ANNOUNCER 6A] Winner: Fafnir
Gildomela Grind Lindabulea.

00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,362
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

67
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,407
[applause]

68
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,244
[HANAKO] Thank you
very much for the match.

69
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,958
[JOANNA]
Wh‐‐ Ah‐‐! Hold on a second!

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,376
Yeah?

71
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,420
I request a rematch!

72
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,590
[HANAKO groans] A rematch?
Like right this moment?

73
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,092
Yes!

74
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,928
Nah, I'll pass.

75
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,641
Wha‐‐?! But why?!

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,393
Well, I'm just
too hungry to keep fighting.

77
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,274
[HANAKO]
Ahh!

78
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,403
It's so good!

79
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,739
Wow, have you ever noticed how
someone else's food can taste

80
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,741
way better, but it's only
'cause it's different

81
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,369
than what you're used to eating?

82
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,621
Thanks for feeding me!

83
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,833
[JOANNA] I lost to this
insatiable glutton?!

84
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,918
So, ready to fight?

85
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,670
Ah. Yeah.

[JOANNA]
No!

88
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,508
One more time...

89
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,094
One more time!

90
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,929
Just one more!

91
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,059
[JOANNA] I'm really getting
tired of looking at that sky.

92
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,854
[JOANNA panting]

93
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,567
I... I don't get it!

94
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,861
[JOANNA] She was the first
person with the capability

95
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,322
to defeat me in combat.
I was flummoxed.

96
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:08,869
[JOANNA] After my defeat, I
became obsessed with Lindabulea.

97
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,955
I watched her every move to see
if I could find the secret

98
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,958
behind her power,
but my observations

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,710
yielded no answers.

100
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,588
I grew increasingly
frustrated that I lost to a girl

101
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,758
whose only ability was having
a bottomless pit for a stomach!

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,512
And then, there
was that one time...

103
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,306
Lady Joanna.

104
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,308
[JOANNA grunts]

105
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,185
[CARMILLA] Come on,
we need to hurry up, Mistress!

106
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,353
[ROSE]
Carmilla.

107
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,524
So that's the lesser vampire
who serves the dragons.

108
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,610
I've been told that
all four of the duke's families

109
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,777
are going to be
at this party,

110
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,114
so we need to be on our best
behavior, Mistress! 'Kay?

111
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,282
Meh...

112
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,242
Ooh, and I heard
that they brought in

113
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,162
the nation's finest chefs
to do the catering!

114
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,498
Seriously? You should
have led with that!

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,000
[CARMILLA]
My bad.

116
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,132
Hold it!

117
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,884
[CARMILLA, HANAKO]
Huh?

118
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,346
It's been a long
time, Lindabulea.

119
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,139
[CARMILLA, HANAKO]
Uhh...?

120
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,766
You are...?

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,017
You forgot her?!

122
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,354
She's Joanna
Joannascore Adorian Uljika!

123
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,356
[HANAKO]
Hmm. Oh...

124
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,275
Are you for real?
You fought her!

125
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,277
Cool story. See ya!

126
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,697
[JOANNA]
Hold on!

127
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,325
What is it now?
I'm kind of in a hurry here.

128
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,744
The finest chefs are all in
charge of the cooking.

129
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,914
If I don't get there quickly,
it's all going to be gone.

130
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,959
Heh! I see you're
as gluttonous as ever.

131
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,211
Oh, you. There's
no need for flattery.

132
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,505
[JOANNA]
That was an insult!

133
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,506
Heh!

134
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,007
[gasps]

135
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,761
Tell me, isn't your
servant a lesser vampire?

136
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,929
[CARMILLA groans]

137
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,138
[JOANNA]
Lindabulea.

138
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,432
As I'm sure you know,
when it comes to vampires,

139
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,434
there are three
different classes.

140
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,481
The great ancestors, the elders,
and below them are the lessers.

141
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,151
Naturally, my own servant,
Rose, is an elder vampire.

142
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,945
Okay, what's your point?

143
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,989
[JOANNA] At her rank,
she shouldn't be able to serve

144
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,741
the family of one of
the four dukes' daughters.

145
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,078
Honestly. I knew you were
strange, but I thought even you

146
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,622
would put more thought into
choosing your servants.

147
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,250
You've got it all wrong‐‐
she never even chose me!

148
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,293
I begged the mistress
to let me serve her!

149
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,546
Silence! A worthless
vampire like you

150
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,798
has no right
to address my lady.

151
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,800
[CARMILLA whimpers]

152
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,093
[JOANNA]
Here's an idea.

153
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,971
If you like, I'd be happy to use
my authority to assign you

154
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,598
a servant better suited
for someone like you.

155
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,475
One more befitting your station.

156
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,645
[JOANNA] Hmph. I heard
rumors about Carmilla.

157
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,647
She's an incompetent moron.

158
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,317
Even an odd girl like
Lindabulea must be sick of her.

159
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,820
[JOANNA]
So, what do you say?

160
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,697
‐‐[HANAKO] Hmm...
‐‐Are you serious?!

161
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,824
You're actually
thinking about it?!

162
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,826
‐‐Can you un‐think about it...
‐‐[JOANNA] This is perfect.

163
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,871
I'll send her an elder
vampire in my control.

164
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,874
Then I can finally
uncover her weakness!

165
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,083
Well, then?

166
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,002
[HANAKO] Thanks for
the offer, but I'll pass.

167
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,005
Excellent. I'll make
the arrangements‐‐

168
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,508
Ah. Wait.
Did you just refuse?

169
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,178
Sure did. Please excuse me.

170
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,013
Hey! I don't think
you understand!

171
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,307
Your servant is as
useless as wallpaper!

172
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,559
‐‐Yeah, no duh!
‐‐Ahh!

173
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,103
Allowing that moron to serve
a noble lady like yourself

174
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,938
is an absolute embarrassment.

175
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,150
But if you truly insist upon
keeping her in your service,

176
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,403
why not have her and Rose
face each other in a match?

177
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,156
If Carmilla somehow
manages to win,

178
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,616
then I'll accept her.

179
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,617
[HANAKO]
Carmilla?

180
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,702
[CARMILLA whimpers]

181
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,787
She says yes!

182
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
Did not!

183
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
[HANAKO] We can work
out the details later!

184
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,626
Why'd you accept
her proposal, Mistress?!

185
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,044
Because! If we don't hurry,

186
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,587
then all the good food's
gonna be gone!

187
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,965
Ignore your stomach for once!
Rose is an elder vampire!

188
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,259
She'll mop the floor
with my lifeless corpse!

189
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,260
[HANAKO]
Carmilla.

190
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,261
Huh?

191
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,387
If you wanna be my servant,

192
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,264
then you're gonna
have to work hard.

193
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:02,352
Right. As you wish, milady

194
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,770
[HANAKO]
Now, pick up the pace!

195
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,730
I'm wasting away here!

196
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,273
[CARMILLA]
Yes, ma'am!

197
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,484
This should be interesting.

198
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,070
Yes, this time,
we'll win for sure.

[CARMILLA whimpers]

200

00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,184
Sorry to keep you waiting.

202
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,562
[JOANNA] Let's clarify
the terms, shall we?

203
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:49,357
If Rose wins, Carmilla is fired,
and you will replace her

204
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,610
with an elder vampire based
on my recommendation.

205

[HANAKO]
Understood.

It's obvious that
Rose is the winner.

There's just no way
a lesser vampire can defeat

an elder vampire.

227

Tell her to surrender.

Sparing your pathetic

As long as I serve

I'll send your new servant

Hold on a moment.

It's true that Carmilla
is quite literally useless.

If you're going back
on your promise,

then you'll have to do
something for me in exchange.

I swear, Carmilla can be such
an embarrassment sometimes.

She fails at
any task you give her.

She's a giant loser.
Like, the worst I've ever seen.

If that's really what you think,

307
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,889
then you should have gotten rid
of her when you had the chance.

308
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,099
Perhaps. But even if
she goes about it

309
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,394
in the wrong way sometimes,
everything that Carmilla does,

310
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,773
whether it's right or not,
is to make me happy.

311

It's odd, but I feel so
at ease when she's around.

What are you saying?

Do you want me
to apologize to her?

To accept her?
Is that why you're out here?

317
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,001
No. She's always been
an incompetent sack of meat,

and I doubt that
will ever change.

Besides, it was a fair fight.

320
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,425
I didn't come here to complain
about her embarrassing loss.

321
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,095
[JOANNA] So, then,
what did you come here to do?

322
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,224
As you may know,
the Fafnirs are the most warlike

323
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,976
of the four houses.

324
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,311
If she loses and I don't
do something about it,

325
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,313
then I'll never hear
the end of it.

326
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,691
That's just the way
my family is.

327
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,817
I get it.

328
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,278
So, you've come here because you
don't want me telling anyone

329
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,572
that Carmilla lost,
is that right?

330
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,533
You'll have to do something
in exchange, of course.

331
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,159
And you've already
humiliated yourself

332
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,161
by kneeling down in the dirt.

333
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,164
So, you'll have to do something
to top that little display.

334
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,041
[HANAKO] No, I won't be
doing anything like that.

335
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,001
[gasps]

336
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,127
Let's say...

337
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,796
...that I'm here for
a moment of your time.

338
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,632
Whoa! What are you doing?

339
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,136
Are you stripping naked to beg?
That is so not necessary!

340
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,846
Yes, please don't strip!

341
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,973
No. I'm only removing my clothes

342
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,642
so that I don't
accidentally rip them.

343
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,313
I am a lady, and I've
always been told

344
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,565
that it's important to stay
in control at all times,

345
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,525
no matter what.

346
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,694
But, it seems
I still have a lot to learn.

347
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,945
[JOANNA, ROSE gasp]

348
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,198
Even a loser like Carmilla
is important to me,

349
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,327
and I'm sure she must
be very upset right now.

350
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,828
That's why...

351
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,538
...as her master...

352
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,333
...it is my duty
to avenge her loss.

353
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,586
[horses whinny]

354
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,004
[HANAKO (monstrous)]
On behalf of Carmilla,

355
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,507
I, Fafnir Gildomela
Grind Lindabulea,

356
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,760
hereby challenge
you both to a duel,

357
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,138
and I sincerely hope
that you'll accept.

358
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,432
[ROSE, JOANNA scream]

359
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,313
[JOANNA] Just thinking about
that night makes my blood boil.

360
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,940
[ROSE]
Yes, I feel the same way.

361
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,109
[JOANNA]
According to my numerous spies,

362
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,570
Lindabulea snuck out
of her castle shortly after

363
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,198
the Hero was summoned
to this world.

364
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,493
She probably intends to
find him before anyone else,

365
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,536
thus stealing the
glory for herself.

366
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,871
And here I thought that glutton

367
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,291
was only interested in food.
She's quite the adversary.

368
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,252
If anyone's going to
defeat the Hero, it'll be me!

369
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,464
I can't allow Lindabulea
to find him first.

370
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,007
Of course.

371
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,552
[JOANNA] I will track her down,
and this time,

372
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,764
I will thoroughly crush
her like the bug she is.

373
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,770
Here, help yourself.

374
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,271
Lady Joanna wanted
me to tell you

375
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,316
you can take anything you like.

376
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,444
But using any of these weapons
would be against the rules.

377
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,160
It's been long enough.

378
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,204
We need to go on
a quest, already.

379
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,288
Not yet.

380
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,998
I'm still recovering from
the wounds I received

381
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,001
on yesterday's dangerous
quest, so until I heal,

382
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,212
I'm not leaving
this impure soil.

383
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,715
But you didn't even
do anything yesterday.

384
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,051
You may shower me with
praise at any time, Genzo.

385
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,302
[ANIMAL MASK]
Why would I?

386
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,722
You didn't do anything
worth praising.

387
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,558
As I recall,
I even tried to stop you.

388
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,851
Don't do it!

389
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,852
Don't worry, Mistress,

390
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,521
I'll get you a nice, big,
tasty snack, okay?

391
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,818
[ANIMAL MASK]
Despite my warnings,

392
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,154
you still got turned
into giant worm chow.

393
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,280
Now stop slacking off.

394
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,323
Time to unbury yourself
and get to work.

395
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,074
‐‐Up and at 'em! Any day now!
‐‐[CARMILLA] Stop it!

396
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,367
‐‐Up and at 'em! Any day now!
‐‐I will end you, mortal!

397
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,577
‐‐Come on, slowpoke.
‐‐I will end you, mortal!

398
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,413
Outta the dirt. You can do it.
Are you just gonna take this?

399
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,421
[sighs]
Well then, see ya later.

400
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,975
[HANAKO]
Ah...

401
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,859
[snoring]

402
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,487
Please forgive me...

403
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,988
Huh...?

404
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,992
[gasps] Oh! Mistress!
You're finally back.

405
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,328
I was so worried! You're here!

406
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,371
[groans, yells]

407
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,874
I was so afraid that you'd
given up all hope for me

408
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,960
and run back to Lady Joanna
to ask for a new servant!

409
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
I was trying to heal
my wounds as quickly

410
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,881
as possible so that I could
come and find you

411
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,467
and beg for your forgiveness!

412
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,469
[sobs]
Where have you been all night?

413
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,971
I was beside myself,
I couldn't sleep!

414
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
I've missed you!

415
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,724
[groans]

416
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,519
[CARMILLA]
Owwie...

417
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:08,035
Goodness. What a useless potato.

418
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,287
[ANIMAL MASK]
Here, let me help you.

419
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,540
If we cover you up,
you'll heal even faster, right?

420
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,208
[CARMILLA] Fine, I'll let
you go just this once!

421
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,168
But only if you stop
burying me, I'm not that dead!

422
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,045
[ANIMAL MASK] Hey, do you
call that stuff impure soil

423
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,381
because it's where Hiryoyuki
makes boom‐booms?

424
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,549
[CARMILLA]
What?!

425
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,726
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time: "First
Student and Pain in the Butt."
