[MC] Ladies and gentlemen!
It's time for the main event!

Animal Mask vs. the
Macadamian Ogre, AKA. Mao!

3
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,648
That's right, the renowned
masked wrestler, Animal Mask,

will face off against
former Judo fighter, Mao!

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,237
Will this conclude their
long‐standing rivalry?

Either way, this match is sure
to be one for the books!

At last, the time has come.

[ANIMAL MASK]
Being a pro‐wrestler

00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,625
was only the first step.

10
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,294
All I have to do is win
tonight's world championship

11
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,714
title match, and then
it's on to step two.

[SAIGO chuckles] It's almost
time for the big fight!

Big Saigo.

You've interrupted my
internal monologue.

Oops, sorry about that, buddy!

17
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,353
Anyway, what will you do
if you win tonight's bout?

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,647
What mountain will
you climb next?

‐‐Well, since you asked.
‐‐Oh?

20

Once I win the world
championship title,

21
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,362
I plan to start the second
chapter of my life.

[SAIGO]
Oh, go on!

23

Are you quitting
pro‐wrestling to do MMA?

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,576
No wait, you're more of a
Muay Thai or Capoeira guy,

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,577
aren't you?

26
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,620
[ANIMAL MASK]
Okay. If you must know.

‐‐I'll tell you‐‐
‐‐[SAIGO] Oh, shoot,

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,707
will you look at the time?
I gotta fly,

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,958
but you kick butt
and all that jazz!

30

Crush that Macadamia nut

Byeeee.

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,632
[ANIMAL MASK] That's cool.
It's not that important.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,468
[ANIMAL MASK] But the
second chapter of my life

34
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,639
starts right after tonight!
I will win my match against Mao.

35
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,766
And then I'll share my
life with the animals

36
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,477
I love, and spread the
joy of pet ownership

And now, entering the ring,

the man with an unhealthy
love for animals.

45

Weighing in at a
respectable 198 pounds.

[CROWD cheers]

48
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,595
[ANIMAL MASK] The time has come.
I'll face my rival, Mao.

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,640
A truly worthy opponent
for my last match.

50
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,767
Just slam his face
into the mat a few times,

off the turnbuckle.

Uh, along with his dog!

quite sure what you mean,

but it doesn't matter!

Only a true Hero would be
able to answer our summons.

you're standing here!

you up to this?

Did you say evil beasts?

Yes! They're nothing
more than terrifying animals,

You really want me
to defeat animals

Yes, after all,

are you doing?

defeat the Demon King first!

00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,096
[ANIMAL MASK]
Uhh...

312
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,972
I begged him
for a loan with no interest

313
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,349
and no collateral.

314
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,768
And then I sobbed non‐stop
in front of Edgar's shop

315
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,728
until he finally gave in.

316
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,814
I was gonna use that money
to open my own business

317
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,567
and get filthy rich, but it
didn't really work out.

318
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,237
[ANIMAL MASK]
Oh. She's an idiot.

319
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,364
Hey. Don't look at me like that!

320
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,741
I'll have you know I
was making money for a bit!

321
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,618
It's not like it's my fault
the humans started

322
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,079
copying my business model.

323
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,498
[ANIMAL MASK]
Hmm...

324
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,960
The name's Genzo Shibata.
I'm a pro‐wrestler.

325
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,254
[SHIGURE]
Nice to meet you, I'm Shigure.

326
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,047
[ANIMAL MASK]
This is my best friend.

327
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,384
Hiroyuki is what I like to
call a pure‐bred mongrel.

328
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,510
[HIROYUKI yipping]

329
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,387
Hello. Nice to meet you.

330
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,015
Anyway, I really
wish that I could give you

331
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,309
a proper reward for saving me.

332
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,520
Unfortunately, I'm flat broke.

333
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,063
[ANIMAL MASK] I thought
I was doing a good deed,

334
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,482
but seeing as you willingly
put yourself in that position,

335
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,359
I feel more like I've
committed a crime.

336
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,153
No! It's nothing like that!

337
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,988
You remember how I just
told you people were

338
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,614
stealing my business model?

339
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,242
Well, one of those people
was Edgar himself!

340
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,243
[ANIMAL MASK]
Hmm!

341
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,495
So, that makes him
totally evil or whatever!

342
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,705
Amiright?

343
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,206
Well, if you say so.

344
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,459
I suppose that would just
barely qualify my actions

345
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,503
as a good deed. Hold on.

346
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,546
[SHIGURE]
Hmm?

347
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,673
[ANIMAL MASK] Since you
don't have any money...

348
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,304
...you can pay me
with your body instead.

349
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,222
[SHIGURE]
Great, so he is a perv.

350
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,778
I'll make him pay...

351
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,826
[MISHA] That was a rough fight.
Are you sure you're okay?

352
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,912
Damn him! Dumb bastard.

353
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,289
Does he think he can just
get away with mocking me?

354
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,167
[MISHA] I'm not sure
there's much we can do.

355
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,960
[WOLFGANG] Wait, do you
have some kind of plan?

356
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,171
Yeah. You saw it, right?

357
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,340
The strange little
creature he had?

358
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,009
[WOLFGANG]
Oh, that thing? What about it?

359
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,720
[EDGAR] I'm gonna steal it!
Then we'll sell it.

360
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,056
[WOLFGANG]
Yeah, great idea! Let's do it!

361
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,974
[EDGAR]
It's a fool‐proof plan!

362
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,059
[WOLFGANG]
Heck yeah!

363
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,769
[EDGAR] We'll show that
stupid pervert who's boss!

364
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,146
I have a bad
feeling about this...

365
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,650
[ANIMAL MASK]
This is it, huh?

366
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,860
[SHIGURE]
Yep! The Hunter Guild.

367
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,072
We can work here for a little
bit to earn some extra cash.

368
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,074
You seem like
a pretty strong guy, Genzo.

369
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,409
I'm sure there's a ton of
different job opportunities

370
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,453
that you'd be perfect for!

371
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,454
[chatter]

372
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,706
[ANIMAL MASK] In conclusion,
I have complete confidence

373
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,960
in my ability to love any animal
regardless of its gender,

374
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,087
species, or even
more specifically,

375
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,756
whether it's hairy or scaley,
has blue eyes or brown,

376
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,426
claws or paws, and has a
long tail or no tail at all.

377
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,970
[GUILD MASTER 1A]
Hmm...

378
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,098
So basically,
I'm an animal lover

379
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,684
through and through, and my
goal is to always maintain

380
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,103
a healthy, positive
relationship with them.

381
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh?

382
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,231
[GUILD MASTER 1A]
What?!

383
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,025
I don't even know what
he's talking about!

384
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,527
What's more...

385
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,987
And I can personally
guarantee that

386
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,906
even the most ferocious, violent
animal will turn to putty

387
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,118
in my loving arms. Yes, sir!

388
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,081
[GUILD MASTER 1A] Ugh. What's
with the wide stance, buddy?

389
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,041
Guild master! Help us!

390
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,543
What's going on?

391
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,877
[GUILD MASTER 1A]
I'm saved!

392
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,755
Our party was just wiped out
by a pack of Cerberuses!

393
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,340
[GUILD MASTER 1A]
What? Fine, then.

394
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,925
Take this job, if you want it.

395
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,177
Cerberuses are
terrifying creatures.

396
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,597
Say wha‐‐? Where are they?

397
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,974
[SHIGURE]
Hey! Wait for me, Genzo!

398
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,476
[GUILD MASTER 1A] How odd. Not
just any kind of man would rush

399
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,938
head‐on to face a pack
of wild Cerberuses.

400
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,316
[GUILD MASTER 1A] I've never
seen such a brave soul.

401
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,358
Even though...

402
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,154
...I didn't understand a single
thing he was talking about.

403
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,115
[GUILD SOLDIER 1B]
They're in this forest!

404
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,325
[ANIMAL MASK]
Okay!

405
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,868
[GUILD SOLDIER 1B] I don't
think I've seen you before.

406
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,662
Are you unarmed?
Here, you can borrow this.

407
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,289
You fool! Do I look like

408
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,042
the kind of pro wrestler
who relies on cheap weapons?

[GUILD SOLDIER 1B]
Wha...?

410
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,086
[GUILD SOLDIER 1B] So, he's
going to fight them unarmed?

411
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,089
He's either crazy strong
or just plain crazy.

412
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,176
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'd be happy to borrow it.

[GUILD SOLDIER 1C]
Listen!

No matter what, we can't let
them near the village!

415
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,640
We have to stop them right here!

Are those the Cerberuses?

[VOICE 1A]
They've got three heads!

[ANIMAL MASK] That means
they're triple the fun!

like this here!

extra‐extraordinary!

Hey!

00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,044
Wait. Let's see
how he handles this.

429
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,545
Don't interfere with him.

00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,506
Uh. Okay.

[CERBERUSES panting]

434

They appear to be dog‐like.

435
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,641
Meaning that if I can
befriend their alpha male,

436
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,311
the rest of the pack should open
up to me and stop their attack.

437
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,730
The leader is probably...

00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,615
I think I'm starting
to figure him out.

465
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,075
[ANIMAL MASK]
Who's a good boy?

466
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,871
Who's a good boy?
You are! Yes, you are!

467
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,873
‐‐Do you like to get cuddles?
‐‐[VOICE] One! Two! Three!

468
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,458
‐‐Of course you do!
‐‐[VOICE] One! Two! Three!

470
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,005
[ANIMAL MASK]
Oh, is that a good boy?

471
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,631
Did you get the tummy rubs?

472
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,968
No way. He actually pinned that
beast with his bare hands.

473
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,095
Like you'd pin down a lady!

474
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:07,141
He's a real lady killer.
No! It's more impressive.

475
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,768
A beast killer!

476
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,189
[CERBERUSES howling]

477
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,275
[chatter]

478
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,527
[SHIGURE] It's a good thing
that job paid so well.

479
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,030
We were finally able to get
you some real clothes.

480
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,198
‐‐[ANIMAL MASK] Yeah.
‐‐[HIROYUKI whines]

481
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,033
Okay. So, what's next?

482
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,493
Big plans?

483
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,495
[ANIMAL MASK]
I do have one idea.

484
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,497
I want people to
realize how wonderful

485
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,791
demon beasts are. So...

486
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,252
My goal is to teach humans how
they can coexist with them.

487
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,963
I'm afraid that's
impossible in this country.

488
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,174
‐‐[ANIMAL MASK] No.
‐‐Huh?

489
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,885
I truly believe
that I can do it.

490
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,387
I need you to believe it, too.

491
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,933
[SHIGURE]
Huh? Genzo...

492
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,769
Will you tell me why you
refused to become a Hero?

493
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,479
They left me with no choice!

494
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,899
The princess wanted me to
defeat innocent animals!

495
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,400
[SHIGURE]
Animals and humans.

496
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,277
Beast people and humans.

497
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,403
Okay, then.

498
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,531
I've decided I'd like
to help you, too!

499
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,325
[ANIMAL MASK]
Really? Then let's do it!

500
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,328
And now. The three
of us will prevail.

501
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,914
Or, the four of us,
if you count Hiroyuki.

502

[HIROYUKI yips]

503
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,584
Right! Wait, four?

504
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,757
[SHIGURE]
Who's that...?

505
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,976
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Quest and Demon Beast Killer."
