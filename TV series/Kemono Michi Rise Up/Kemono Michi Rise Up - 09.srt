Hey, who is this woman, anyway?

161
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,531
Is there a reason why she
showed up out of nowhere

162
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,659

to the whole town?

163

[PRINCESS]
Apologies.

I suppose I've yet to
properly introduce myself.

165
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,416
[PRINCESS]
I am the princess of Edgardo,

166

as well as its high priestess.
My name is Edgardo Latis Altena.

[BOTH growling]

172
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,519
He may be a delinquent,

173
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,647
but he is absolutely not one
of those disgusting heroes.

174
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,649
How dare you speak
of him that way!

175
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,193
Heroes are not disgusting, if
anything they're rays of hope,

176
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,820
and he's undeniably one of them!

I would know, after all‐‐I'm the
princess who summoned him here!

178

[CARMILLA]
Some princess you are!

179
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,035
I wasn't aware that
the royal family

180
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,037
was full of exhibitionists!

181
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,955
It was never my intention
to show the public

182
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,207
my delicates, but I
didn't have a choice!

183
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,710
You have no idea what sort
of teasing I've endured!

184
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,879
The entire royal court
calls me Princess Buttocks

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,047
behind my back!

186
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,048
It could be worse.

187
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,383
At least there aren't booger
eaters chasing you around,

188
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,136
making fun of your underwear
and wanting a free show!

189
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,138
Look, it's not
a competition, okay?!

190
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,932
Now please stop before
the neighbors hear you!

191
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,685
Ah! Ahem.

192
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,271
Anyway, what matters is that
I need the hero to come

193
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,815
with me right now, so we
finally start your journey

194
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,901
to defeat the Demon King!

195
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,778
Let's say I am this hero.

196
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,447
Why should I have to go
and fight the Demon King?

197
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,157
There's no way
it could be Genzo.

198
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,159
The hero is supposed to
be the strongest human,

199
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,245
a murderer who slays any
demon beast he comes across.

200
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,748
The demon king is the
leader of all the beasts,

201
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,000
and he'll unite those
disgusting monsters.

202
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,503
So I need Genzo to
defeat him right away!

203
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,004
‐‐Hey!
‐‐"Disgusting monsters"?!

204
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,423
Really, the hero
is not a murderer!

205
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,302
I see. He's the
king of the beasts.

will you join me and put

00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,973
the Demon King in his
place once and for all?

So, you really have no intention
of fulfilling your duty?

214
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,525
Nope.

215
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,527
If it's like you say, and the
Demon King is the leader

216
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,737
of animals, then
I can't fight him.

217
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,282
Besides. I would prefer to focus
on opening up my pet shop.

218
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,743
A "pet shop," you say?

219
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,869
That's right.

220
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,372
You see, my goal is to help the
animals of this world find

fur‐ever homes with
the people of this town.

All for a nominal fee.

00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,837

homes of innocent people.

225

However,

226
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,717
unless the current hero
either goes home

227

to his own world, or dies,

Whenever a man has
that far off look in his eye,

probably something stupid.

the same sort of

476
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,463
fighting techniques as Genzo!

477
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,966
[MAO]
Genzo? Fine, then!

478
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,801
Where's Genzo Shibata?

479
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,095
Tell me! Or you'll be dust!

480
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,722
[ORC KING]
My goodness.

481
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,349
I do believe you're the
rudest guest we've ever had.

482
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,560
Perhaps you should leave, human.

483
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,687
Not until I find Genzo.

484
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,648
Tell me where he is or else!

485
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,109
[ORC KING]
Oh, yeah? Or else what?

486
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,819
Is that a threat?

487
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,947
[MAO]
Heh!

488
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,118
[ANIMAL MASK]
That's so weird.

489
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,953
I don't see any
demon beast hordes.

490
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,163
Talk about unfair.

491
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,624
You said there were a ton of
them, so I skipped lunch today.

492
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,501
They're not your lunch!

493
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,920
I dunno, it smells
like they went this way.

494
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,255
‐‐[sniffs]
‐‐Well.

495
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,590
Did you hear that Genzo?

496
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,843
Now they'll be safe from his
creepy, perverted fondling.

497
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,094
Huh?!

498
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,137
"Huh"?!

499
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,555
[ding]

500
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,307
[BOTH growling]

501
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,976
[ORC 9A]
Genzo!

502
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,813
[ORC 9B] Hey there,
you've got perfect timing, sir!

503
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,566
‐‐[CARMILLA] Hmph!
‐‐What's wrong?

504
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,942
The king!

505
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,404
[ANIMAL MASK gasps]
What happened?

506
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,405
Ah?

507
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,324
[SHIGURE]
Look, it's the Orc King!

508
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:26,452
[ORC KING]
I tried to defeat him alone.

509
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,829
But in the end,
I'm afraid that I failed.

510
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,456
[CARMILLA]
Defeat who?

511
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,875
A powerful man leading
a horde of demon beasts

512
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,084
came barging into town

513
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,003
demanding to know
where you were.

514
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,589
But the king was brave,
and he refused to betray you!

515
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,299
That's right,
he's more than just a king,

516
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,176
he's an orc among orcs!

517
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,636
[ORC MC]
This man...

518
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,430
He's the Demon King that's been
summoned from another world.

519
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,140
[ANIMAL MASK gulps]

520
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:23,277
[WOLFGANG] That's it‐‐I'm never
leaving the house again.

521
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,571
It's too dangerous out there!

522
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,115
The only place I'm safe
is underneath my binky.

523
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,617
[whimpers]

524
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,493
My brother used
to be a proud warrior,

525
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,787
but now he's a shut‐in!

526
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,748
[EDGAR sighs]

527
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,168
This whole
situation is so unfair!

528
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,503
Listen, Edgar, we have to
find a way to get revenge,

529
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,255
and I don't care how!

530
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:46,926
Yes, I agree.

531
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,929
I refuse to take this
insult lying down.

532
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,221
Let's go!

533
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,726
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Money and Bonds."
