According to my knights, the

yet you did nothing?

Where'd you come from?

483
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,778
You know, I was just
thinking that it would be

484
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,990
a good time to host another one
of Genzo's special tournaments.

485
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,159
Whoa. Another one?

486
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,368
Heh.

487
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,620
So, it's a fighting
tournament, is it?

488
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,456
Then you can count me in.

489
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,875
I'll bury you
in front of a crowd.

490
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,586
You better not run away
when I'm about to win again.

491
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,962
The time has come...

492
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,423
I'll make you pay
for what you did!

493
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,383
Will you face me, Lindabulea?

494
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,384
Oh, it's on!

495
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,971
My mistress and I are gonna
grind you up into little pieces!

496
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,806
Another tournament?

497
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,393
I wonder if there will be more
yummy food like last time?

498
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,270
Man, I can hardly wait!

499
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:14,565
We're in! This is our
chance to get rich, Genzo!

500
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,692

501
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,152
[ANIMAL MASK]
Pay back, huh?

502
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,949
Okay, then. I accept
your challenge, MAO!

503
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,622
[HIROYUKI snoring]

504
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,958
[ANIMAL MASK grunting]

505
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,251
All right.

506
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,797
This time, I'll be facing
another pro‐wrestler.

507
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,549
It's totally different from the
other people I've fought here.

508
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,135
‐‐[footsteps]
‐‐[ANIMAL MASK] Mm?

509
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,184
[ANIMAL MASK]
Carmilla? What's up?

510
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,644
[CARMILLA sighs]

511
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,396
[ANIMAL MASK grunts]

512
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,107
There's somebody
that I need to beat.

513
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,152
No matter what.
And I'll do whatever it takes.

514
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,738
[CARMILLA]
Genzo...

515
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,201
Will you... please teach me
how to be a pro‐wrestler?

516
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,205
[CARMILLA sighs]

517
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,043
Let's do it.

518
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,477
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Pride and Loyalty!"
