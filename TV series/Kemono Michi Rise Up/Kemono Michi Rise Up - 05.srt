Now come on, let's go!

162
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,076
[MISHA]
Okay...

163

[WOLFGANG]
Of course!

And even if it doesn't
work, then too bad!

Make it work!

167

[MISHA] No need to shout.
Anyway, what's the plan?

170
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,093
First, we tie an
expensive ham to a string

171
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,053
and throw it in
the dirt close to him.

And waste a ham?

[WOLFGANG] Next, we use the
dirt ham to lure him to us.

you swoop in with a bag!
And then we make tracks!

176

Isn't it genius?

177
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,775
If you say so.

178
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,776

Okay!

Maybe they aren't in this area.

I guess, but the clerk

187
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,061
this is where we
would find them.

Welp, looks like she was wrong.

We should head back to the shop.

Give it a rest, Genzo.
