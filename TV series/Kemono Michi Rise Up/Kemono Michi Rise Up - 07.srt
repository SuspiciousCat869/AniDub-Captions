00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,919
were coming from,
but it was you, huh?

475
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,379
Huh?

476
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,760
Might I have
a moment of your time?

477
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,472
You wanna have a big tournament?

478
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,642
Yes. I was very impressed by
that mock battle I saw earlier.

479
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,977
From what I gathered,

480
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,729
the public seems
to enjoy watching people

481
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,814
fight each other.

482
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,025
In addition to selling
tickets to the event,

483
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,444
we could also sell
food and merchandise.

484
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,071
I assume it will be
a profitable venture.

485
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,282
[SHIGURE squeals]
That sounds amazing!

486
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,534
Plus, I'll do anything
to help fix our budget!

487
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,994
If you're going to
make merchandise,

488
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,914
might I suggest modeling
it after my mistress?

489
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,624
It will surely sell.

490
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,875
I only heard the part
where you said

491
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,212
there will be food. And if
that's the case, I'm all in!

492
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,047
But... I wanna open a pet shop.

493
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,175
[CLAUSE] If you agree
to take part in the fights,

494
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,886
then we'd be happy
to compensate you.

495
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,972
You could use that money
to fund your business.

496
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,975
Fight money?
So it's come to this.

What the..?

499
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,939
My pecks are trying
to tell me something.

500
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,816
It's like they're excited
to get back in the ring

501
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,692
and fight again!

[ANIMAL MASK] My training
has led me to this moment.

504
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,114
And if it will help the animals.

505
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,201
[ANIMAL MASK]
Very well!

506
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,663
A wrestler has to
accept all challenges!

I'm returning to pro‐wrestling!

Next time: "Animal and Event!"
