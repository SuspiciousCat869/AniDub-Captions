[yaps]

474
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,158
[SHIGURE]
Uh...

475
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,953
[SHIGURE] Since we got our butts
handed to us by the griffons,

476
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,747
we didn't get the cash reward.

477
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,375
[SHIGURE]
And then...

478
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,626
[ANIMAL MASK sighs]

479
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:59,467
Man. The food. It eats so much.

480
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,926
[ANIMAL MASK]
Kyoko!

481
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,387
You're just the biggest,
sweetest girl, aren't you?

482
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,097
[SHIGURE]
She's too big!

483
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,807
And such soft fur!

484
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,185
[SHIGURE]
But what about the food costs?!

485
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,312
[ANIMAL MASK] I hope you grow
to be three times bigger!

486
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,565
[SHIGURE]
Well, I don't!

487
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,026
[sighs]
You're not gonna believe this.

488
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,236
Genzo brought
yet another girl home.

489
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,988
What, again? How rude.

490
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,741
You'd better give that player
a piece of your mind.

491
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,742
I don't know.

492
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,078
He loves everyone so openly,
it's kinda charming.

493
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,997
Are you serious?

494
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,416
Come on, What about
the money problems?

495
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,003
Actually, I found a pretty
lucrative cash flow recently.

496
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,422
[SHOP OWNER 4A]
Whoa! Do my eyes deceive me?

497
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,132
It's really the
magic sword Dainsleif

498
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,967
and the holy sword, Durandal!

499
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,511
Please, I simply must know,

500
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,930
where did you find these
incredibly rare items?

501
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,807
I must have, like,
some crazy good luck,

502
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,309
because I just find
them lying around!

503
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,061
[SHOP OWNER 4A]
Here's your payment.

504
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,313
You're welcome
to come back anytime!

505
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,565
Thank you,
I'll be sure to do that.

506
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,983
[chuckles]

507
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,629
[JOANNA]
I see, a human hero?

508
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,050
[ROSE] Yes. Our preparations
are almost complete.

509
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,093
Lady Joanna.

510
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,595
[chuckles]

511
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,226
[ANIMAL MASK] Next time:
"Animal Mask and MAO."
