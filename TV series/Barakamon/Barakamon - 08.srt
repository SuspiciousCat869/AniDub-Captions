Young artists of today,

00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:14,083
Heed my words!
You must not fear failure

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,541
but rather,
seek new frontiers in art!

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,000
Seek new frontiers, huh.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,708
Or this?

00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,375
Sensei!

00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,833
What are you doing?

--What about Naru's birthday?
--Shh!

10
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,458
We're trying to
keep it a surprise,

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,875
so don't talk so loud!

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,541
Everyone is pitching in
so we can throw a party for her.

13
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,958
You can afford, say,
a thousand yen, right?

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,208
You're charging fees for
a kid's birthday party?

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,750
You act like this is extortion.

16
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,625
We just can't afford a cake
on our allowance is all.

17
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,166
Hiro's got dinner covered.

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,916
He's gonna bring
everything over this evening.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,791
Get a present ready
in the meantime, okay?

20
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,041
I already gave you money!

I have to write... today.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,708
Well,
maybe I could use a break.

24
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,750
I got you a giant teddy bear
for your birthday.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,000
I hope you like it!

26
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,750
I guess it makes a good
punching bag at least!

27
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,166
--I got you a nice ribbon.
--Yeah!

28
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,166
I'm the heavyweight
champ of the world!

a little hand mirror?

Girly things
just aren't gonna work.

33
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,625
She'd rather play around
in the dirt than with dolls.

[KENTA]
Take that, cicada!

39
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,375
I got it! Yeah!

Yay!

41

Kenta, you have a second?

42
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,958
Hey there, Sensei, what's up?
Something wrong?

43
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,500
It's more like I have
a favor to ask you.

44
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,625
I need a last-minute
present for Naru.

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,125
So could you maybe give me
one of your beetles, please?

46
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,250
Nuh-uh!

47
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,833
Come on, how many beetles
do you need?

48
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,083
I'll give you ten yen for one,
that's a lot for a kid, right?

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
You can suck it, Sensei!

50
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,833
I'm giving Naru
beetles for her birthday!

51
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,041
You can't steal
my awesome present idea!

52
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,375
--Come on, just one!
--I said no!

53
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
I'm gonna give her
a hundred of these guys!

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,625
Then she can make
a whole bed out of 'em!

55
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,208
Is that supposed to be
a good thing?

56
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,500
My idea won't be near as cool
if you give her a beetle too.

57
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,458
Okay, fair enough.

58
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,500
Ichiro, Jiro?
What are you guys bringing?

59
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,541
Those aren't even our names,
you jerk!

00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,500
And we're giving her candy!

[HANDA]
You got this in the bag.

62
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,208
[KENTA] Better start
thinkin' fast, Sensei!

63
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,166
Hmmm.

64
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,833
A stag beetle, of course!

65
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,958
If you can catch that many
rhinoceros beetles,

66
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,750
one stag beetle
should be a cinch!

67
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,083
Lemme try.

68
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,958
Sensei's not takin'
beetle catchin' serious.

69
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,583
He's not takin' life serious
either if you ask me.

70
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,333
What d'you mean "a cinch"?

71
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,375
They ain't easy to come by,
you know!

72
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,875
Sure, maybe not for children,
but I'm an adult.

73
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,375
Since I'm tall,
unlike you little gremlins,

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,666
I can see all over
and find one easy.

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,791
Sensei can be
a real turd sometimes.

Oh! There's one already!

77
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,458
Nope. It's a girl.

78
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,916
Hey!
That one's mine. I found it!

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,583
If we waited on you, it'd run!

Naru's gonna make fun of you,

if you can't even catch
one measly bug.

--What a loser.

Bam! Ha!

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,208

How do you like that?

00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,041
Huh?

00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,291
Well, look who it is.
Thought you went home.

104
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,250
Not without
catching a beetle.

105
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,458
Also, a "thank you"
would be nice.

106
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,416
This is a bit more effective
than a human totem pole.

107
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,750
Now, it doesn't matter
how high up they go.

It couldn't be more simple.

00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,333
Could you lend me
your net for a sec?

111
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,375
If you're too scared to
touch 'em, then why even bother?

112
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,458
What, are you nuts?

113
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,958
They could bite me
or be carrying

114

some weird disease
or something!

I touch 'em all the time
and I'm fine!

Now apologize to that beetle!

117
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,416
Now that I get a closer look,
this thing is really creepy.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,250
I mean, it's kind of like
a super huge roach

Someone bought it from
a pet store, I reckon.

out of its cage.

I'm confused.

A real big deal

I heard they can cost
like 20,000 yen!

Day's just started and
you've already fell down twice.

Well, that settles it, senseis

00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,958
You realize this was your fault,
don't you?

163
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,208
--Anyway, show us the beetle!
--Right.

164
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,416
Didn't want it to get away,

165
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,750
so I made sure to grab
the net extra tight!

Yay!

167
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,875
[KENTA] Uh-oh.
Guys, why is it not moving?

168
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,958
It's not dead. Is it?

169
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,500
Are you kidding me!

You squished him,
you big idiot!

No, it can't be!

173
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,750
You ruined every birthday
forever, stupid!

00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,500
I wish I could squish you!

--That was our only chance!
--Okay, I get it.

It's still just a bug! Jeez!

[crying]

178
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,875
All I wanted was
to give it to Naru!

[HANDA]
Stop crying! Please!

00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,208
Seriously, I'm sorry.

181
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm over it now.

00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,416
[KENTA]
Here, Sensei.

183
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,750
You can have
one of the beetles I caught.

184
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
--Are you sure?
--Uh-huh.

185
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,125
'Cause even if you messed up,
you tried hard for Naru.

186
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,291
Plus, you're the first grownup
who's ever played with us

187
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,875
like he really meant it.

188
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,791
Man, this summer sure
has been lotsa fun, huh?

189
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,500
--I agree!
--Me too!

190
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,958
Thanks, you guys.

191
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,166
[KENTA] Grab 'em from the back.
It's easy.

192
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,000
[HANDA]
Like this?

193
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,041
All right! I can hold it!

194
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,958
I won't lose next time!
You kids better be ready for me!

195
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,041
And if you thought
I was playing today,

196
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,041
then you're wrong.
I was fighting.

197
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,791
So you better
watch those beetles

198
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,750
or I'm gonna
steal 'em from you.

[KENTA]
Jeez, pull it together, will ya?

201
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,416
They went all out.

202
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,916
Didn't know this
was such a big deal.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,583
Hey!
What took you so long?

204
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,958
Never mind that,
how did you get in here?

205
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
You even need to ask?

206
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,791
This house was our secret base
for, like, ever

207
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,250
before you got here.

208
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,333
You can have this key back.
I made a spare.

209
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,833
--You did what?
--I thought, "why not?"

210
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,333
I went in to have
a spare made for my bike lock,

211
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,291
but it was super cheap,
so I went ahead

212
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,291
and made five extras
for this place.

213
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
[TAMA]
I have one too!

214
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,250
Hey, I guess
I don't need my key today.

215
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,333
Oh great, Hiro's got one?

216
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,125
Wait, she said
she made five, right?

217
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,125
Where's the last one?

218
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,541
Who knows!

[HANDA groaning]

220
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
Must have lost it when
I was up in the mountains.

221
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,708
So, did you find
a present after all, Sensei?

222
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,791
Oh, uh, well,
what did you get her?

223
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,750
Hmm?
I brought some bubble wrap.

224
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,041
She loves this stuff!

225
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,916
And I brought these
peacock feathers I found.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,958
Neat, huh?

227
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,833
Wow, that's actually
kind of perfect.

228
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,708
[TAMA] Good thing
I didn't bring bubble wrap.

229
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,166
--I thought about it!
--She's gonna love

230
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,458
the feathers, though.

--You think?
--Yeah!

I just found
them on the ground.

Naru's coming, guys!

Uh-oh.
Alright, you know what to do!

I've never gotten to do
a surprise party before!

You do realize
you're half the reason

00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,583
we're doing this
in the first place.

Huh? Really?

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,958
But we'll have to make it
a yearly tradition now.

did I do something?

And now,
a present from Sensei!

[NARU]
Yeah!

00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,625
Look at me, working so hard to
take care of these sunflowers,

without even knowing
who planted them out here.

stopping by for just a bit.

stand the toro first.

families have them too.

until the fire on this goes out.

a good two hours at least.

sit here all that time?

There's firecrackers, too!

fine for me, thank you.

314
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,875
Nice of you to come out.

315
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,166
Must be hard on you inside types
in this awful heat.

316
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,250
I'm fine.
It is a bit awkward, though.

317
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,000
As an outsider, I feel like I
don't have a right to be here.

318
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,166
Naru's granny
wouldn't think so.

319
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,541
Just take a look
at this here candle.

320
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,916
See how the fire's bobbing up
and down as bright as can be?

--Uh-huh.
--Well there's your answer!

322
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,666
Means granny's dancing and
waving at you, happy as a clam!

323
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,333
Well, if granny's happy to have
me here, I'll do my best!

324
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,500
Yeah!

--Parachutes!
--Oh!

Ha!

Nice one, Miwa!

Just bowl over everyone
and don't bother to apologize!

335

Man, it's tough running
in a yukata, though.

--[NARU] I wanna catch one too!
--[MIWA] Sorry!

That was our last parachute.

Let's find another
game to play, okay?

[groans]

340
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,000
Come on, Sensei, don't give us
the silent treatment.

341
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,500
Get mad or yell at us
or something!

342
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,375
[MIWA and TAMA]
I guess he wants us to help.

[MIWA]
Okay! We'll help! We'll help!

[TAMA] Just stop with
the creepy eyes, please!

345
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,625
Is this different from how you
do Bon stuff in the city?

346
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,833
Completely different.

347
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,000
We don't visit cemeteries
in the evening

348
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,000
and we don't give rice
as an offering.

349
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,166
No lanterns, no fireworks,
and we don't wear yukata.

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,875
[MIWA]
Wow, nothing?

351
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,916
Also, isn't it weird having
the gravestone etched in gold?

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,625
[MIWA] I thought it was
like that everywhere!

353
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,750
[sighs] Whatever, not like
I have any room to judge.

354
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,791
I hardly ever go
to pay my respects,

355
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,083
so, hey, what do I know?

356
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,666
If you're gonna
put it that way,

357
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,750
we only come here during
the Bon Festival ourselves.

358
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,625
And it's more about the
fireworks, to tell the truth.

359
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,041
Well, and the Onde too,
I guess.

Hope we're not interrupting,

but we need
to pass through here, okay?

That's Onde.

to life on the island, huh?

good care of Naru, too.

think about this too much,

the only reason he's here

is because he punched
that director guy.

Howdy do, Sensei.

477
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,875
Hey Puchi.
So, you come to fish for dinner?

478
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,750
Dogs don't eat crayfish,
you big silly.

479
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,541
Look at you,
fishing like a natural.

480
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,250
You're fitting right in here!

481
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,333
You think?
Well, I try.

482
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,833
You know,
the people in the village

483
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,375
are all happy
to have you here.

484
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,958
What do you say you give up
the city life for good?

485
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,125
I still have
my career to consider.

486
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,666
[chuckling]
Fair enough.

487
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, you always have a home
here if you change your mind,

488
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,375
and I'll save
some crayfish for you, too.

489
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,708
Thank you, Puchi.

490
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,708
[PUCHI]
But if you ever strike it rich,

491
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,416
treat me to some lobster, okay?

492
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,166
[HANDA laughing]
So you do eat them after all!

493
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,500
Keep it a secret from Granny.

494
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,416
It was the best dream ever.

495
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,625
It's really a shame
it'll never be real.

496
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,500
Huh.

497
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,458
--You do know Puchi's a girl.
--Huh?
