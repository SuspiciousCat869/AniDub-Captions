1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,541
This is the first chance
I've had to write on a ship,

2
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:17,333
so I appreciate the opportunity.

3
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,541
And it helped me realize
how to calm myself.

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,458
Be like a kid with finger paint.

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,250
[thinking]
It's almost like the brush

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,833
is moving on its own now.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,625
Just one month to go
until the Narukain exhibit,

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,750
but that's all the time
I really need to--

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,750
[yelps]

10
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:37,750
For you. Eat up!

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:40,208
And what is that?

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,333
It's pickles.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,750
Pickles.
Do I need this many?

14
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,708
[laughs]

15
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,500
I'll bring ya back s'more
when ya run out.

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,416
And now he's just gonna
disappear into the woods.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,375
[sighs]

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,291
Seriously.
No human can eat this much.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,458
Oh.

20
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,500
[thinks]
Oh, man.

21
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,208
Okay, I really need to focus.

22
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,750
I can clearly picture it.
A jarring yet tasteful pickle.

23
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:13,958
Not pickles!

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,458
Now write, and then pickles.

25
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,583
Stop thinking that!

26
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,625
[thinks] Only one month
'til the pickles exhibit.

27
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,666
Get out of my head,
you damn pickles!

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,208
[whimpers] Pickles!
[cries] Pickles!

29
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,166
Pickles!

30
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,750
[HANDA] More pickles!

31
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:09,083
Pickles. Pickles.
Pickles. Pickles.

32
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,500
--Pickles. Pickles.
--[knocks on door]

33
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:12,750
Pickles?

34
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll bring ya back s'more
when ya run out.

35
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,666
[breathes shakily]

36
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,875
More pickles!

37
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,875
Sensei! Teach us to write!

38
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,875
[HANDA] Of course
it's just you girls.

39
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,000
--Huh?
--"You girls"? Real nice hello.

40
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,916
Oh. Sorry.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
--[NARU] Here!
--[gasps]

42
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,916
Grandpa told me to bring 'em
to ya 'cause it ain't gonna

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,166
do ya no good to run out
and have no more.

44
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
[breathes shakily]
Thank you.

45
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,000
So, can you help
with our school project?

46
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,166
[HANDA] First off, hold
the brush with your right hand.

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,166
--[NARU] Is this my right hand?
--[HANDA] Yes, it is.

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,916
Wait, you've gotta be
right-handed to do calligraphy?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,791
No, but the inkstone
goes on the right,

50
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,083
so it's easier this way.

51
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,833
So, what's the subject?

52
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,000
Um. It's this.

53
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,166
Okay, I'll do a quick example
for you, so watch what I do.

54
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,458
--Move.
--[grunts]

55
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,125
Aw. You're not gonna slap it on
like normal? I like that.

56
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,541
[HANDA] Slap it on?

57
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,083
I'm just trying to teach you
the fundamentals here.

58
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,041
Huh? Yeah, but I wanna learn

59
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,500
how to write like that!
It's more raw!

60
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,333
[HANDA] Uh, I'm still
hammering out that style.

61
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,375
I'll teach it to you after I get
some public recognition for it.

62
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,791
Recognition?
Don't we count as the public?

63
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,208
I guess so,
but I meant winning first place

64
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,583
in next month's exhibit.

65
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,333
Hmm. Really?

66
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,833
You're too good to worry
about getting awards.

67
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,500
Who cares
about that kind of stuff?

68
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,083
I just wanna have fun with it.

69
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,166
[hesitantly]
You wanna have fun?

70
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,750
Oh, man. So young and naive.

71
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,875
--[BOTH gasp]
--Here. Write this one, Naru.

72
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,250
Cat! Okay!

73
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,750
--[HANDA] All right!
--[GIRLS gasp]

74
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,208
As your teacher, I promise
that you'll both get awards.

75
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,083
And once you get a taste for it,

76
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
you'll understand
why I'm so hung up

77
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,916
on being recognized
and winning one myself.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,166
[HANDA]
Now, write for the next hour

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,833
--like your lives depend on it!
--[GIRLS scream]

80

--Keep focusing.

81
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,166
Hmm.

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,958
Don't ink your brush
if there's still ink on it.

83
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
Does this line
look right to you?

84
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,708
--[whimpers]
--Stop your brush here.

85

--[snoring]
--Wake up.

86
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,791
[groaning]

87
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,833
--No more! Please!
--[HANDA] Snap to, girls!

88
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,250
Stop being lazy!

89
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,708
You were the ones who asked me
to teach you, remember?

90
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,041
I can turn you into champions.

91
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,625
Fine, but we've been writing
the same dumb thing all day!

92
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,416
Can't you just, like,
teach us the cheat codes?

93
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,916
--[MIWA gasps]
--Are you serious?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,750
Do you think
writing beautiful characters

95
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,041
come easily
to professionals like me?

96
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,333
You have to feel the emotion
behind every stroke

97
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,833
of the brush!
Calligraphers throughout time

98
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,500
have painted
their emotions onto paper

99
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,125
as though
they were spilling their blood!

100
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,125
--Like who?
--Right?

101
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,666
[HANDA] Physical fatigue,
mental breakdowns,

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,625
living in a world
of constant solitude!

103
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,666
Yes, the edge, you have
to peer right over it!

104
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,416
[MIWA and TAMA]
The edge of what?

105
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,250
[HANDA]
Just one more step.

106
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,750
Another step closer
to completion,

107
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,125
but an eternal desert stretches
between you and the end,

108
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,041
and you're too tired
to take that next step.

109
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,541
And when you can't write
any further,

110
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,250
that's when you see it.

111
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,291
The god of calligraphy!

112
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,750
But is the god really there

113
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,833
or is it just a mirage
from the desert?

114
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,250
[BOTH] Can calligraphy make
you hallucinate? Or is he nuts?

115
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,583
[MIWA] This is just a dumb
assignment for middle school!

116
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,708
We're not trying to reach
the point of enlightenment!

117
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,750
Go buy some juice
and let us take a break!

118
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,166
[sighs] You girls don't
even care about this, do you?

119
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,375
[straining]
Yes, we do! I promise!

120
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,791
We really do!
We just need a break!

121
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,208
[HANDA] Fine, but you better
be writing when I get back!

122
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,166
[MIWA] All right,
we will, now just go!

123
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,291
[TAMA and MIWA sigh]

124
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,125
Seriously,
he is like totally obsessed.

125
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,333
--Sei!
--At the rate he's going,

126
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,833
he is never gonna get
a girlfriend.

127
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,291
Who knows? Maybe he's
in a long-distance relationship.

128
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,958
[whimpers, thinks]
"Girlfriend"?

129
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,000
Maybe we should nose around
and see what we can find.

130
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,791
Hey, cut it out.
That's just tacky.

131
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,166
--[MIWA] Oh!
--[NARU and TAMA gasp]

132
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,291
"Kawafuji"?
Let's see if it's a girl.

133
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,208
Please.
You're making me uncomfortable.

134
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,666
--Aw. It's just some dude.
--Huh? Let me see!

135
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,666
Why? You told me to stop.

136
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,291
[TAMA]
There's a group photo in here.

137
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,583
[MIWA] Oh, you think he's going
out with one of those girls?

138
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,000
Maybe her?

139
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,416
[TAMA]
She's pretty and all,

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,375
but she's not standing next
to him. What about her?

141
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,916
[MIWA] She looks
a little too plain Jane

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,291
to be Sensei's girlfriend.

143
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,166
I guess.
Do looks matter though?

144
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,791
I mean, as long as they wanna
talk about calligraphy with him.

145
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,041
How many women out there
could stand listening

146
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,916
--to his delusional rambling?
--[NARU thinks] Got it!

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,125
Listening's easy,
even monkeys can do it.

148
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,333
[NARU] This!

149
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,833
[MIWA] What's that
you're holding, Naru?

150
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,250
Sensei told me that this thing
is his special treasure.

151
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,875
-What is it?
-It's a picture stand.

152
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,625
I wonder just how special
the picture inside it is.

153
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,583
--[chuckles]
--[NARU wailing]

154

Hey, what's wrong?

155

[NARU] I don't want Sensei
to be someone else's wife.

00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,541
You should work
on your definition of "wife."

157
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,083
Aw, poor kid. Her little heart's
about to break.

158
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,000
[MIWA] This is a good thing,
Naru. Trust me,

159
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,166
it's a lot weirder for a guy his
age to not have a girlfriend.

160
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,166
You just wait ten years, Naru.
You'll grow up to be so pretty

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,083
that you can have your way
with him if you want.

162
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,833
I can have my way?

163
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,625
Well. Let's take a look...

164
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,750
At Sensei's secret girlfriend!

165
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,083
--[BOTH] Uh...
--[door opens]

166
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,000
All right, here's your juice.
What're you doing?

167
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,000
You should be writing!
You have to take this seriously

168
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,958
if you ever wanna
win an award!

169
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:41,875
Huh?

170
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,708
You're 23 years old, Sensei!

171
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,583
You can't make calligraphy
your whole life!

172
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,125
You can't fall in love with
some stupid dead historic dude!

173
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,500
You need
a real woman in your life!

174
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,750
Just date Naru
if that's what it takes.

175
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,500
[gasps] Ugh.

176
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,291
[gasps]
Yeah! Date me!

177
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,708
--I want my way!
--Do what?

178
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,500
--[grunts] Get off me!
--[NARU grunts]

179
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,625
[MIWA] At the rate you're going,
you're gonna die alone!

180
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,291
[HANDA]
Where is this coming from?

181
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,875
--[NARU] Gimme my way!
--What are you talking about?

182
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,708
Out to the ocean?

183
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,208
Yeah, the kids want
to go swimming,

184
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:18,125
so I was hoping
you could keep an eye on them.

185
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,958
I asked the head teacher
to watch 'em,

186
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,208
but you know how he is.

187
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,750
[KAZUYUKI]
That'd cut into my fishing time!

188
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,375
Ah. Well, if you only
need me to watch 'em,

189
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,958
and as long
as they all know how to swim--

190
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,250
One more thing.

191
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,541
It looks like Miwa
and Tama are going as well.

192
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,000
Can you also make sure

193
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,833
they don't do anything
dumb or dangerous?

194
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,916
[KIDS laughing]

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,958
I'll make Hiroshi tag along
to help ya keep watch on them.

196
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,416
[HANDA thinks] Something
terrible is bound to happen.

197
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,333
Sensei! Come on, let's go!

198
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,750
--[HANDA sighs]
--Hurry up already!

199
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,541
--Hey, wait a second!
-[KENTA] Get movin', Sensei, go!

200
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,250
Yeah, all right,
just let me get ready first.

201
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,750
--[KENTA] Butt!
--[HANDA] No butt stabs!

202
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,541
--[KIDS laughing]
--[HANDA] Hey, stop running.

203
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,333
[NARU]
Look! Miwa and Tama!

204
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,583
[MIWA] What's up, Naru?
Took ya long enough, Sensei.

205
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,083
[TAMA]
Thanks for taking us.

206
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,708
[HANDA] What's with the outfits?
They look like gym suits.

207
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,125
Yeah, that's because
they are gym suits.

208
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,291
Sorry if that's
not sexy enough for you.

209
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,208
What? You wear those to swim?

210
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,250
Well, yeah.
Why wouldn't we?

211
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,666
It seems like it'd be a pain
to swim with your clothes on.

212
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,750
Hmm? If ya care so much,
take yours off.

213
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,666
Well. I don't actually own
a swimsuit.

214
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,791
[TAMA whimpers]

215
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,666
[NARU]
Hey! You're takin' too long!

216
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,375
It's not my fault!
We're still waiting on Hiro!

217
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,375
Well, let's go.

218
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,333
All right, everyone!
Follow me to adventure!

219
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,791
[KIDS] Yay!

220
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,958
[thinks] All right. He's clearly
not gonna be any help.

221
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,791
Let's go, you guys!
I'm gonna become

222
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,291
--a master backstroker!
--[KIDS cheer]

223
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,791
Hey! Don't run on the rocks!

224
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,166
Jeez, quit freakin' out.

225
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,333
They know this beach
backwards and forwards.

226
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,583
Beach? More like jagged,
deadly boulders!

227
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,208
I don't even see
any sand around here!

228
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,250
Only dumb little kids play
on those kinds of beaches.

229
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,625
[HANDA]
Exactly my point!

230
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,333
Man. It's way too slick.

231
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,250
[yells, grunts]

232
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,333
--[TAMA] Sensei, what happened?
--[MIWA] Jeez, Sensei.

233
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,166
Don't they teach you
how to walk in the city?

234
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,208
[group chattering]

235
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,375
[NARU] Sensei? You okay?

236
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,000
[MIWA] Yeah, he's fine. We've
all fallen on the rocks before.

237
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,958
[MIWA]
All right! Jump in!

238
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,958
[GROUP] Yeah!

239
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,750
--Huh?
--[gasps]

240
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,208
[KIDS laughing]

241
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,125
[DAISUKE and YUTAKA]
Whoa, they're super huge!

242
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,000
--[NARU] A sea urchin.
--[HINA] Scary.

243
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,166
[MIWA]
Quit splashing me, Naru!

244
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,208
--[laughter]
--[TAMA] Calm down!

245
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,291
[breathes deeply]

246
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,333
Hina! Ya find any good fish?

247
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,500
Yeah, but my goggles
got all foggy,

248
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,833
so I couldn't really see 'em.

249
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,583
No problem.
Wipe 'em off with this.

250
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,291
Here, that'll do the trick.
I always use mugwort leaves,

251
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,791
'cause the sap stops 'em
from getting all cloudy.

252
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,958
Oh, wow. Naru, you know so much.
You're just like a grandma!

253
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,750
Hmm?

254
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,333
What's that 'sposed t'mean,
I'm like a grandma?

255
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,250
Huh? Sorry. Is that rude?

256
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,375
Well, of course that's rude!
I'm only seven years old!

257
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,791
[HINA yelps]

258
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,541
[HIROSHI]
So young. So foolish.

259
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,333
They just don't know how
to enjoy the sea, do they?

260
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,333
There's one! Take this!
Hiroshi Critical!

261
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,625
[humphs]

262
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,583
[KENTA]
Whoa, an octopus!

263
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,208
Heed my skills!

264
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,166
Awesome! You're so cool, Hiro!

265
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
[BOTH gasp]

266
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,500
[HIROSHI yells]

267
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,541
[KENTA] That was
the most uncool thing ever!

268
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,041
[sighs]

269
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,291
Those guys just don't know how
to enjoy the sea, do they?

270
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,291
How sad.

271
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,750
Sorry to bail, Miwa,
but I need to lie down a bit.

272
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,041
--[MIWA] You okay?
--Oh!

273
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,708
You don't look so hot.

274
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,833
I'm just gonna rest with Sensei
for a while and I'll be fine.

275
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,875
[MIWA] Sure.

276
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,000
--[TAMA grunts]
--Ah!

277
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,791
Uh. You sick or something?
Your face is red!

278
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,958
This is normal.
I'm more of an indoors person.

279
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
[HANDA] Well, then this is
the last place you should be.

280
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,416
You need to hydrate.
Can you drink some water?

281
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,958
[TAMA] Uh, yeah.

282
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,791
--[KIDS laughing]
--[MIWA] There ya go.

283
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,041
That's how ya do it!
[laughs]

284
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,583
[thinks] What's with her?
Why does she keep staring at me?

285
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,541
Hey, Sensei?

286
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,708
Um, have you ever gotten
so hung up on something

287
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,250
that you can't sleep?

288
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,625
[HANDA] What's bothering you?
You can tell me, y'know.

289
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,958
[TAMA] Its not that--

290
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
it's not that
I'm bothered by it.

291
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,541
But to be straightforward,

292
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,333
what are your feelings
towards Hiro?

293
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,416
Uh...

294
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,125
[thinks]
Hiro? I don't get it.

295
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,083
--[HIROSHI] One, two, three!
--[HANDA] He's close to my age,

296
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,416
so I guess he's kinda like
a younger brother.

297
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,833
[thinks] Wait, no.
We're nowhere near that close.

298
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,208
He's more like the guy
that just drops off my food.

299
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,750
--[whimpers]
--Regardless, why is four-eyes

300
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,833
so anxious to hear
what I think about him?

301
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,250
[gasps]

302
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,041
Now I get it! Of course!
She's got a crush on Hiro!

303
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,958
That explains
why she's been acting

304
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,791
so strange around us lately.

305
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,125
And here she is,
finally gotten up the nerve

306
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,875
to ask me
for some grownup advice.

307
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,583
Now, that's just adorable.

308
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,958
