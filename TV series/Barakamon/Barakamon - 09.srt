1
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,583
[sighs]

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,125
[thinking]
Just two more weeks.

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,541
But the more stressed I get,

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,833
the harder it is to come up
with something good.

5
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,458
It's strange, but ever since
I came to this island,

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,291
I started getting these powerful
urges to do calligraphy pieces.

7
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,666
Something rises up inside me.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,583
My hands start to shake.

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,708
I need to get that feeling back.

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,833
I just don't know how I can.

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,833
Maybe I'll feel better
if I take a hot bath.

12
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:51,291
Huh? Can't get it to click.

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:01,750
Please, no. Oh, no, not now!
[grunting]

14
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,708
Why? Why me? Why this?

15
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,250
Yep. It's busted.

16
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,666
So how long do you think it'll
take for someone to fix it?

17
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,791
Let's see.
Probably be a week, at least.

18
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,708
Figured as much.

19
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,458
Wait a sec. I just realized
we have a backup plan.

20
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,833
Huh?

21
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,291
[YUJIRO] Ta-da! A bath boiler.

22
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,166
If you burn firewood in here,
you can heat your bath

23
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,000
the old-fashioned way.

24
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,875
That's not just gonna burn
my house down?

25
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,541
Of course not. We use a boiler
at my place and I just love it.

26
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,208
Yeah, but you said
this uses firewood.

27
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,125
It's not like I have
that just lying around.

28
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,958
Sure you do.

29
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,000
There's a whole mountain full
of trees right behind you.

30
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,833
[laughter trails off]

31
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,666
Remember, the branches have to
be dry or else they won't burn.

32
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,208
Hey!

33
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,125
[thinking] I wanna tell him
this is a pain in the ass,

34
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,166
but I don't think I have
the heart to break it to him.

35
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,083
There's more over here.

36
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,541
I have to do this crap
for a whole week?

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,208
[screams]

38
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,833
--Lovely.
--[screams]

39
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,666
I'm so sorry, sir.

40
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,625
[YUJIRO] This is about how many
branches you'll need.

41
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,875
I bet you wish you had
a pretty young wife

42
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,666
to keep the fire for you,
huh, Sensei?

43
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,416
All I really want is a bath with
a gas-powered hot water heater.

44
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,458
You're at the right age.
You don't have any lucky ladies

45
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,750
in your life you've thought
about marrying?

46
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,375
Not a one, lucky or otherwise.

47
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,000
Aw, come on.

48
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm absorbed in my work
all the time,

49
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:19,333
so it's like, well, I'm the type
who might die alone.

50
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,791
[YUJIRO chuckles]

51
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,291
[HANDA thinks] You're
supposed to tell me I'm wrong.

52
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,458
[YUJIRO]
Well, you should be good to go.

53
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,791
[HANDA] Huh?

54
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,750
--[TAMA] Hey, Miwa.
--Hmm?

55
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,166
Is it just me, or is that smoke
coming from Sensei's house?

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,500
Looks like it.

57
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,125
A bonfire?

58
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,250
You think Sensei would do that
kind of thing?

59
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,958
Might be.

60
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,708
A fire!

61
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,291
[HANDA]
Just a bath.

62
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,791
I see.

63
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,833
Sensei,
you big troublemaker, you.

64
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:52,083
I can help if you like.
I'm really good at this.

65
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,083
Yeah?
Then you've done this before?

66
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,208
Yep. When my grandpa
takes a hot bath,

67
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,916
I'm right there
to watch the fire.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,875
And you're absolutely sure
you're okay doing this?

69
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,416
Leave it to me. I'm a pro.

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
The prep work's kind of a pain,

71
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,750
but it almost feels like
I'm going to a hot spring.

72
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,375
I'm excited.

73
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,583
Yow!

74
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,208
Sensei, is it too hot?

75
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,250
No. I'm fine.

76
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,458
Don't scare me.

77
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,250
[sighs] It's so relaxing.

78
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,458
[thinks] I can feel
the stress just melting away.

79
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,666
I'm starting to see the appeal,

80
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,583
even with all that wood
gathering.

81
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,041
[NARU] Sensei. Help me!

82
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,166
Are you okay?

83
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,625
[BOTH chuckle]

84
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,375
Hold it.

85
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,541
Naru, what are these two doing
here harassing me?

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,541
They came 'cause they thought
there was a fire.

87
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,541
We should punish you for forcing
a kid watch to the boiler.

88
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,625
Seeing you naked will do.

89
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,250
[HANDA]
Where's the logic in that?

90
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,416
You probably want girls to look
at you nude, you sicko.

91
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,416
Sorry, but I'm not a flasher
and my house is not on fire,

92
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,250
so kindly get lost.

93
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,083
He never likes to play along,
does he?

94
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,250
Uh... why the camera?

95
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,750
I need photos to use
for manga reference.

96
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,291
Of him? Even in manga,
you can't show the naughty bits.

97
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,875
What? Sure you can.

98
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,500
You just have to
censor the tip of it.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,000
[thinking]
How am I supposed to relax now?

100
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,958
I'll have to remember not
to take baths in the afternoon.

101
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,458
Maybe if I just wait it out,

102
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,833
they'll get bored
and leave on their own.

103
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,708
You punks trying to melt me?

104
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,625
--[laughing]
--[TAMA] Book it!

105
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,750
So was it hot enough, Sensei?

106
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,125
What do you think?
Look how red I am.

107
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,125
--Book it!
--Wait, not you too.

108
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:41,083
Ahh. Lot of trouble,
but I do feel better.

109
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,000
Now let's get to work.

110
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,833
[chopping] Hey.

111
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,125
Aah! What're you doing here,
Hiro?

112
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,291
Mom is out,
so she can't cook today.

113
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,083
I thought I'd make you lunch
instead.

114
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,333
Fine, but why here?

115
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,375
First, cut the cucumber.

116
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,166
Add miso and sugar,
about this much.

117
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,083
Toss the cucumber in the bowl
and mix just a bit.

118
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:07,000
There you go, cucumbers with
miso in just three easy steps.

119
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,541
I see. If it's that simple,
I bet even someone like me

120
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,458
could do it.
First, cut the cucumber.

121
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,625
Add miso and sugar,
then mix. Perfect.

122
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,333
Sensei,
were you watching at all?

123
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,291
What?
It's the same, isn't it?

124
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,875
In what way?

125
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,750
It'll be the same
once you eat it.

126
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:26,291
I'm a man, okay? My food
looks bad and tastes good.

127
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,000
No, pretty sure that's
gonna be terrible.

128
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,750
[BOTH]
Thanks for the meal.

129
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,958
Whoa! This is really good.

130
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,833
And this is just plain awful.

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,625
I'd be better off eating
a cucumber by itself.

132
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,750
Actually, this is yucky.

133
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,833
You're not fooling anyone.
You just said it was good.

134
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,291
Don't get such a big head over
this. It's only miso.

135
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,916
I'm not the one with the big
head, you spoiled baby.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
You take that back. Don't speak
to your elders that way.

137
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,958
My "elder" needs to stop
pointing his finger

138
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,291
and act like a damn adult.

139

--[growling]
--[HINA screams]

140
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,583
Sensei!

141
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,458
What's wrong, Hina?
Hey, tell me what happened.

142
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,083
Would you pull it together?
Crying isn't gonna help.

143
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,041
Don't rush her, Sensei.

144
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,250
Hina, have some tea
and calm down.

145
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,291
She came running here screaming
and crying.

146
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,625
It's got to be an emergency.
Tell me.

147
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,250
[HIROSHI] Let her cry if she
likes. Why are you so impatient?

148
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,041
[HANDA]
What? I just want to know.

149
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,708
So you can help her
or because this is bugging you?

150
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,958
--[wailing]
--I'm sorry. Calm down.

It's Naru.

A bunch of bigger kids
from the other village

154
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,291
--are picking on her.
--[BOTH gasp]

155

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,250
[BOTH think]
Actually, that looks kinda fun.

160
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,250
Naru!

161
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,833
Hina, help me!

162
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,791
You guys went
and got grownups?

163
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,666
Cheater.

164
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,166
Hey, get off their playground.

165
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,375
You kids go on back
to wherever you came from.

166
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,500
Shut your trap, fox face!

167
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,666
You snooze, you lose.
This is our turf now.

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,125
[thinks]
"Fox face"?

169
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,125
They must be
from Rokunosaki village.

170
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,208
The high school and middle
school kids from there

171
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,750
are a bunch
of little punks, too.

172
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,791
Come on, Sensei,
make 'em go away.

173
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,750
We were playing here first
and they ruined it.

174
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,750
Okay. Hey look, you
little dweebs, listen up.

175
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,041
We've never even met before, so
why did you call me "fox face?"

176
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,375
What part of me, exactly,
is fox like?

177
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,250
'Cause if it's my eyes,
I have heard that sometimes.

178
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,375
Sensei's really taking
this personally, huh?

179
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,375
You wussy bean sprout. Go away.

180
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:46,083
Ugh! That hurt,
but my pride hurts much more.

181
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,708
That kid's a genius.

182
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,791
He only saw Sensei for like,
five seconds

183
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,791
and he could already tell
he's a pushover.

184
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:52,875
Huh?

185
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,083
You gotta take
a stern approach

186
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,291
with brats like these.
Here, I'll show you.

187
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,333
Hey, you turds!

188
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,000
--He's scary.
--He a gangster?

189
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,291
Who cares?
You don't scare me, punk.

190
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,041
You're the big kids here.

191
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,166
You can let the little
ones have fun, right?

192
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,041
Please? Just this once.

193
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,583
If you want it that bad,

194
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,083
then get down and beg.

195
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,750
[laughing]

196
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,541
--[growling]
--Don't flip out!

197
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,416
Screw that.
I'm gonna pound some manners

198
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,000
into this doggone ankle biter
if it's the last think I do.

199
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,625
Book it!

200
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,083
I know they suck,

201
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,916
but you can't go around
punching children.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,375
Sensei, we just wanna play
dodgeball.

203
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,208
Can we do that, please?

204
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,125
Don't worry. There's no way
we're backing down now.

205
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,458
[thinks]
The children are counting on me.

206
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,083
Now's my chance
to get my dignity back.

207
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,416
Listen up, kiddos.

208
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,333
Shut up, you wet noodle.

209
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,666
[thinks]
Somehow, that really hits home.

210
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,541
We're adults,
so we won't resort to violence.

211
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,500
But if you kids loiter
any longer,

212
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,625
I'll have to make a call
and I don't think you'll like

213
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,208
what happens next.

214
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,166
Who you gonna call, huh?
Your mommy?

215
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Hmm. The police.

216
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,625
Whoa, why you gotta pull
the cops into this, huh?

217
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,791
I'm going to make an anonymous
call and tell them

218
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,458
you're bullying
innocent children.

219
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,791
Your parents will be so ashamed.

220
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,833
I bet the other kids at school
will make fun of you, too.

221
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,666
And that is how an adult
wins a fight.

222
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,458
[HIRO thinks]
Wow, that is petty.

223
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,333
Dang it!
To heck with your dirty tricks.

224
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,750
Take this!

225
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,416
Oh! It's over.

226
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,666
You've dealt the finishing blow
to my poor little friend.

227
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,916
Hey, man, chill out.
We just got some poop on it.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,416
Though I couldn't use him after
I dropped him in the ocean,

229
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,375
this loyal partner of mine
at least kept the time.

230
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,500
Are you telling me that thing
don't even work?

231
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,291
You better apologize to us.

232
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,625
How about you apologize
to my phone, you little urchin?

233
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:47,125
[laughing]

234
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,041
Hiro, were you just laughing?

235
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,791
No, this is all very serious.

236
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,958
What a couple of clowns.

237
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,416
Let's leave 'em
and play some ball.

238
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,291
Hey, Sensei,
those brats are ignoring us.

239
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,208
Don't make me repeat myself.

240
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,375
You kids go back to the
playground in your own village.

241
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,708
We can't. Our playground
got taken over

242
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,750
by these two middle school
girls.

243
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,250
One of 'em's all tough and manly

244
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,125
and the other's got
funny glasses.

245
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,125
[BOTH think]
Them, huh?

246
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,208
That's got nothing
to do with this. Go away!

247
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,208
Naru! Hey, that's going
too far, you hooligan.

248
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,833
Oh, boo hoo.
What, you gonna punch us?

249
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,000
'Cause I don't think my
folks would be too happy

250
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,875
to hear about that, do you?

251
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,708
Then you guys are gonna be
the ones who get in trouble

252
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,250
with the cops. How's that?

253
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,458
You're gonna go to jail
for child abuse.

254
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,791
Unfortunately,
I can't argue with that.

255
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,666
I want to hit 'em,
but they have a point.

256
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,791
Guess we'll just have to
be adults here.

257
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,333
Naru, we can't stop their
baseball game after all.

258
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,791
--Just let 'em play.
--Aww.

259
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,875
You finally get it, now scram.

260
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,375
Those guys can play baseball.

261
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,291
And we can play dodgeball,
right?

262
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, yeah.

263
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,250
--[BOTH] Huh?
--Wait.

264
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,833
I thought you said you
were gonna let us play.

265
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,125
Yeah, stick around and have
all the fun you like.

266
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,541
In the meantime,
we'll be having our own fun.

267
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,125
Me and Sensei are gonna be
outfield,

268
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,166
-so you guys better move it.
-[shouting]

269

But how do we--

270
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,708
Game on!

271
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,625

That's hardcore, Sensei.

No mercy, even for kids.

273
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,208
You think I don't know how
to play dodgeball?

274

Who wants some of this, huh?

275
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,583
He hit the ball back at me.

276
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,583
Would you pull yourself
together, man?

277
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,291
If they get the ball,
it's all over.

278

Come on. You're grownups.

279
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,708
You're not playing fair.

280

You got it all wrong.
Didn't you know?

play fair.

Time for round two.
We're gonna unleash.

283

Eat this.
Back up a little bit, Sensei.

284
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,458
They're playing dodgeball
in this heat?

--It's Akki.
--Akki.

Hey, you're not busy today,
are you?

you lent me. Can you help?

Hey, you little squirts,
this isn't over yet.

Nah, we're good now.

290

We're gonna play
with Akki instead.

291
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,083
What? So did we win here?
I'm a little confused.

292
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,750
Sorry about that.

293
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,583
I interrupted your
game, didn't I?

294
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,333
Game? Yeah, that's totally
what it was.

295

Bye.

296
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,791
We'll be back.

the real adult here.

Let's go over there

Oh. Wow, this is
like real Tarzan.

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,958
Let me explain.

311
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,958
What's to explain? It's just
a vine and a long fall.

I'll go first,
so you watch close now.

315
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,166
Oh!

316
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,458
[groans] You see? Piece of cake.

317
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,291
[HANDA thinks]
That is gonna send me

318
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,916
straight to the hospital.

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,708
Here. Go ahead,
knock yourself out.

320
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:16,708
Heck, no!

321
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,458
Why not? It's super fun.

322
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,125
And you call yourself a grownup.

323
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,958
I'm not swinging on the vine

324
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,916
because I'm a grownup,
you little imp.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,875
There's no way that thing could
hold the weight of an adult.

326
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,166
I mean, it would have to be able
to support

327
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,458
all of you at once
for that to work.

328
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,000
[KIDS] Hmm.

329
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,416
I take it back!
Please don't do that!

330
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,666
Then you'll try after all?

331
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,625
Yeah, sure, whatever.

332
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,833
Anything, as long as you don't
all kill yourselves on my watch.

333
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,333
Look, guys.
Sensei is gonna be awesome.

334
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,375
I can't tell
if she really means that

335
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,625
or she just wants
to see me hurt myself.

336
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,958
[thinks] This is obviously
an accident waiting to happen.

337
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,583
The kids won't like it,
but I've gotta get rid

338
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,833
of this thing
before someone gets hurt.

339
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,625
Are you ready?

340
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,083
I'll break this off
and that will be that.

341
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,708
--[screams]
--[laughs maniacally]

342
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,708
Stop it, Sensei.
You're pulling it too much!

343
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,875
--No!
--Come on!

344
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,166
[wails] Stop fighting, please.

345
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,291
[gasping]

346
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,083

Agh!

[splashes]

350

[coughs]

351
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,000
Is everyone all right?

352
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,958
--Yep. Doing great!
--That was so scary!

353
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,541
[thinks] I thought
I was gonna die.

354
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:39,916
I thought I was gonna die!

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,958
--Is that blood?
--Please don't die.

356
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,916
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

357
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,750
We gotta use mugwort to fix it.

358
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,041
Huh? No, it's not that big
a deal. I promise.

359
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
Mugwort!

360
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,333
I'll make some medicine
to stop the bleeding.

361
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,125
It's just a scratch.

362
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,000
Also, please don't rub dirt
on my forehead.

363
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,333
[NARU]
Let's take the secret shortcut.

364
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,916
[HANDA thinks]
Another day wasted

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,541
without anything to show for it.

366
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,833
I really should find something
more productive

367
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,666
to do than play with kids
every day. This is bad.

368
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,125
I can't afford to sit around and
wait for inspiration to hit me.

369
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,375
The closer I get to my deadline,
the more hopeless it feels.

370
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,500
Yes. It's here.

371
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,416
Finally. I feel it.

372
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,750
All it took was one sunset
for the God of Calligraphy

373
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,791
to shine upon me.
I gotta go write.

374
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,583
Hurry. Hurry! Ugh!

375
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,500
[screams]

376
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,583
Huh?

377
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,666
Is something wrong, Naru?

378
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,541
Sensei's not following us.

379
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,333
He probably went back another
way by himself is all.

380
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,750
You think?

381
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,125
[KENTA] Yep.
Sensei loves doing stuff alone.

382
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,125
[NARU]
I guess.

383
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,125
[KENTA]
I know.

384
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,333
[KIDS laughing]

385
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,333
Huh?
So Sensei never came home today?

386
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,916
Nope, just been the two of us
here as far as I know.

387
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,083
Sensei disappeared when me
and my friends

388
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,791
were coming back
from the mountains.

389
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,791
That doesn't sound good.

390
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,583
Yeah, that's a shame. I bet one
of those mountain titans

391
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,250
--is eating him up as we speak.
--[HANDA whimpering]

392
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,875
[screams]

393
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,250
I don't know about
the whole titan thing,

394
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,416
but I am worried
that he's not home yet.

395
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,416
Even if he's lost
in the mountains,

396
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,958
it's not like the forest
is that big.

397
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,000
There.

398
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,875
A rabbit.
Don't scare me like that.

399
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:38,333
[thinks] And just when
I finally got some inspiration.

400
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,083
The time I spent with the kids
is already a distant,

401
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,708
fading memory.

402
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,750
I can barely remember
their smiling faces.

403
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,333
[gasps] No, stop.
That's not even remotely true.

404
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,000
You're just freaking out
and exaggerating the situation.

405
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,166
Stay calm and stay on track.

406
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,833
I just need to climb up
a little more.

407
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,333
[grunting]
You can do it, Seishu.

408
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,000
Keep on climbing, Seishu.

409
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,333
Okay.

410
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,833
[gasps]

411
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,958
[screaming]

412
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh, crap.

413
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,250
Argh! I hate this!

414
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,291
Damn it. Help should be here
by now. Where are they?

415
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,291
Normally, I just want everyone
to leave me alone,

416
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,041
but the one time I do need them,
there's not a soul to be found.

417
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:29,333
I'm dead.
I really am gonna die alone.

418
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,625
Somebody help me.

419
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,041
Anyone! Hmm?

420
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,708
What is that?

421
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,125
What's a key doing way out here?

422
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,750
It's the key to my house.

423
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,541
I made five spares, but I
must have lost the last one

424
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,458
when I was up in the mountains.

425
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, so that's it.

426

[laughs]

427
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,458
This is stupid.
It's no big deal.

428
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,541
I'm practically
in my own back yard.

429
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,166
I'm not gonna get stranded and
die, that's not even possible.

00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,375
So many stars.

431
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,125
It's beautiful.

432
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,625
You sure can't see this
in the city.

433
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, a shooting star.
Please let my bath be fixed.

434
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,833
Please let my bath be fixed.
Please let my bath be fixed.

435
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,083
Actually, let's try that again.

436
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,083
Please let me get home
so I can write calligraphy.

437
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,500
Okay, he wasn't eaten.
He just fell.

438
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,041
That explains why we couldn't
find him on the path at least.

439
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,458
Sensei, I thought
you were done for.

440
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:42,250
You guys sure took your time.

441
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,000
Sensei's crying, isn't he?

442
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,916
Yeah, not pretty.

443
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,041
[laughs] Yes! This is it.

444
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,208
