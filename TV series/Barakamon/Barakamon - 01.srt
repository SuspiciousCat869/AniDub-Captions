[DIRECTOR] We all face the wall
of mediocrity.

It's awful pretty, huh?

[HANDA]
Yeah.

Well, we're just plumb tickled
to death to have ya!

Huh? Don't think so.

saw the moving truck

Yeah, but this is awkward.

--Aaah!

[NARU] You gotta be careful
with her, she's super shy.

352
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,541
Oh. So I should just kinda hang
back and ignore her, or what?

353
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,250
Ugggh! What did I do wrong?

354
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,958
Now she's all sad

'cause she's been looking
forward to talking with you.

Sorry 'bout that.

So who's this friend of yours?
