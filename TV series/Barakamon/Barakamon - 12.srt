1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,166
Ahem!
'Kay, guys.

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,250
If you want Sensei to hurry
back, then gimme a "heck yeah!"

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,166
[ALL]
Heck yeah!

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,208
If I know Sensei, he won't wanna
come home to a messy house.

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,708
So let's team up and make
this place sparkling clean!

6
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,208
[ALL]
Yeah!

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,000
Miwa's the one who made
most of this mess.

8
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,500
It's a trap, don't listen!

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,083
Time to work, you guys!

10
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,958
Sensei's gonna be so happy!

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,166
[ALL]
Yay!

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,416
You think
we'll see Sensei again soon?

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,333
I hope so.

14
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:56,625
Sensei!
Hurry on home! We miss you!

15
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,041
[HANDA stammers]

16
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,291
What is this?

17
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,041
[HANDA] Would you mind maybe
explaining this to me?

18
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,666
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
I think it's fairly clear.

19
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,458
This is a silent protest.

20
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,375
I don't want you going back
to that island.

21
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,500
How bored are you?

22
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,791
I already submitted my work.

23
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,375
I was planning on going home
to the island today.

24
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,333
Why, you little beast!

25
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,500
This is your home,
you awful, awful boy!

26
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,875
After all the trouble
I went to raising you,

27
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,541
you throw me
under the bus that easily?

28
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,250
--Mom, calm down!
--Not a chance!

29
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,041
I am going to punch you
and punch you and punch you

30
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,500
--until you change your mind!
--Can we try talking first?

31
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,583
You went straight to abuse!

32
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,083
You couldn't save this
for later, could you?

33
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,250
You're being rude to our guest.

34
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,041
Oh. Hi, Kawafuji!

35
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,791
Nice save!
Perfect timing!

36
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,000
I just stopped by
real quick to tell you

37
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,125
that your work
was accepted for the exhibit.

38
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,750
I'll be leaving now.

39
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,791
What're you saying?
Don't go!

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,416
Or even better,
take me with you!

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,708
Oh, no.
You're staying!

42
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,166
We are having a life-crisis
discussion, right now!

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,083
With Kawafuji included!

44
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,208
He's on my side,
so that's only fair!

45
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,166
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
I was against him going

46
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,750
to that island from the start.

47
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,708
But this big dumb jerk
sitting next to me

48
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,291
decided my opinion
wasn't important.

49
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,083
As if that
weren't bad enough,

50
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,416
then I hear you got sick
and were hospitalized?

51
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,416
Without me
to watch out for you,

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,208
I bet you weren't careful about
your cat allergies, either!

53
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,791
--I, uh...
--And just like your father,

54
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,541
you won't listen
to a word I say!

55
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,333
Well, fine! Then I won't listen
to you, either!

56
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,500
You're staying here if I have
to break both your legs!

57
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,166
I see where you get your bouts
of violence from.

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,166
[HANDA thinking] As long as
she doesn't break my hands.

59
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,166
Well, clearly your mom makes
a strong point about this.

60
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,833
--I'd stay home.
--What?

61
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,125
Don't you care about
my progress as an artist?

62
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,750
Now that I know you can write
just fine in Tokyo,

63
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,750
I'd honestly rather
have you stay close by,

64
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,958
so I can crack my whip.

65
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
Democracy at work, I see.

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,083
It's hardly
the wilderness, you know.

67
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,625
I dropped
my phone in the ocean

68
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,625
and I still have
cell phone reception.

69
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,958
And! It's right next
to the mainland,

70
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,708
so I can still get something
if I really need it that bad!

71
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,000
Besides, it's not like
I get out that much anyway,

72
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,583
so I'll hardly notice
the difference!

73
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,416
All I need
is my calligraphy.

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,875
I mean, it's not like
I've really got friends here.

75
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,458
Ouch, buddy.

76
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,541
Did I do something
to piss you off, or what?

77
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,916
You honestly think it's the
location that has me so worried?

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,333
Huh?

79
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,666
[thinking]
I can tell you've been

80
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,708
hanging around
weirdoes, haven't you?

81
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,791
You've picked up these strange
habits and don't even notice!

82
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,833
I can hardly
recognize you anymore!

83
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,416
Am I seriously that bad now?

84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,250
Ah... I wouldn't say bad
so much, but weird, definitely.

85
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,500
You have to choose
your friends carefully!

86
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,416
Bad company
ruins good morals!

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,625
Hm?

88
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,416
[HANDA thinking]
Bad company, huh?

89
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,416
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

90
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,250
What?
What do you mean, "no"?

91
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,291
You've been acting strange
ever since you came back!

92
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,125
You keep
eating pickles for some reason,

93
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,125
and I heard you talking about
catching some "nusano"?

94
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,541
What is that, drugs?

95
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,208
[HANDA] I don't know
what you're talking about.

96
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,875
And I haven't changed, okay?

97
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,125
[KAWAFUJI]
I dunno about that.

98
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,583
[MOTHER]
The Sei I know would never raise

99
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,458
his voice at his mother!

100
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,333
[groaning]

101
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,541
If your only concerns are
the location and the people

102
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,333
who live there, then I'm afraid
I'm with Seishu on this one.

103
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,500
Thanks, but you didn't
have to change your seat.

104
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,375
I lived on the island myself

105
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,625
when I was his age
and I turned out just fine.

106
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,791
It's a perfectly
healthy environment.

107
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,750
Huh?
I never knew that.

108
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,958
Well, I wouldn't
have asked you to leave

109
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,666
if I didn't know it would be
a positive experience.

110
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,458
Yujiro Kido has been
looking after you, correct?

111
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,416
Kido?

112
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,666
--The mayor!
--Sort of.

113
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,166
I'm sure I have some photos
of us in one of my old albums.

114
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,166
Ah! You don't get
to submit physical evidence!

115
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,541
That's not fair!

116
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,625
This is just
a stroll down memory lane.

117
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,250
[HANDA]
Wow.

118
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,541
I didn't know you kept
old photos like this.

119
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,083
That's crazy.
You look just like Handa.

120
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,958
I like to believe
I have a kinder face.

121
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,750
Here!

122
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,750
It's a picture of me
from the island.

123
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,458
[HANDA]
Whoa, you're both so young!

124
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,583
[SEIMEI] I believe
this was 35 years ago.

125
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,833
Kido and I went
fishing for hisanio.

126
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,333
[BOTH]
Hisanio!

127
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,958
There! "Nusano"!

128
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,500
We caught a hisanio
ourselves, didn't we?

129
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,083
That's not quite
how I remember it.

130
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,083
Wait, the local store?

131
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,250
Oh, good to hear
it's still around, then!

132
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,125
[HANDA] Is that the owner?
She's so young!

133
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,541
She was really pretty!

134
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,666
Ah! The river
hasn't changed a bit!

135
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,000
--[HANDA'S MOTHER groans]
--[SEIMEI] The river.

136
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,541
[SEIMEI] I actually
injured myself down there.

137
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,833
[HANDA] Oh yeah, me too.
I have a scar right here.

138
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,375
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
I've had enough!

139
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,416
None of you understand
my feelings one bit!

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,958
You're all just talking about
how great the island is!

141
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,875
I'm worried about my son,
is that so wrong?

142
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,750
Can't you
take this seriously, Da?

143
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,416
Our precious child
is heading down

144
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,041
the path of destruction
and you're cheering him along!

145
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,250
[KAWAFUJI]
"Da," huh?

146
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,958
[SEIMEI]
Please dear, calm down.

147
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,541
We should support whatever
is best for his development.

148
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,208
He needs to live his own life.

149
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,583
Yeah?
And he should do that away

150
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,625
from his loving mother?

151
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,208
The dear,
sweet boy that I raised

152
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,625
would show some appreciation

153
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,208
for all the loving care
I showered him with!

154
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,583
Discourtesy,
as high as a mountain!

155
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,583
Boy, your mom
really is a handful.

156
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,791
You! A back-stabber
and disrespectful to mothers!

157
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,416
[KAWAFUJI]
She heard me? Ow!

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,125
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
Undutiful, like a cutting wind!

159
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,375
As traitorous
as a raging fire!

160
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,875
[KAWAFUJI]
Ma'am, wait! you may recall...

161
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,833
Rest in peace, Kawafuji.

162
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,500
[HANDA thinking]
If this is how she's gonna be,

163
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,375
I may be stuck
in Tokyo forever.

164
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,208
[SEIMEI]
Seishu...

165
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,791
I know that I was the one
who sent you to the island,

166
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,958
but what you do now
is all your choice.

167
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,875
Whether this is for your work
or for your own well being,

168
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,500
I trust in your decision.

169
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,250
Just remember,
you'll always have a home here.

170
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,916
[HANDA'S MOTHER] Why does
he have to be so cruel?

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,208
I just want the best
for him, can't you see? Ah!

172
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,750
[HANDA sighs] I finished
my piece for the exhibit,

173
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,291
and I think I have a firm handle
on my new style now.

174
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,083
Maybe I don't need to rush back
to the island after all.

175
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,958
If you're gonna stay holed up
in your room either way,

176
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,333
I think it's more convenient
to live here in Tokyo.

177
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,833
[HANDA sighs]

178
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,208
Weighing the pros and cons,
Tokyo does come out ahead.

179
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,083
So why can't
I make up my mind?

180
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,375
Hm.

181
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,750
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
Sei?

182
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,708
This package
just arrived for you.

183
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,250
It seems it's from your friends
back on the island.

184
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,250
Wait!

185
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,333
Are these your things
and you're never going back?

186
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,958
[HANDA] I don't think
they want me gone that bad.

187
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,875
Actually, this got here
a little late.

188
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,291
I asked them for some things
to help with my exhibit piece.

189
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,166
[ALL]
Huh?

190
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,916
What's this stuff?
Shoulda figured.

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,458
They just tossed in
whatever junk they had.

192
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,000
They're bullying you!

193
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,875
My sweet boy
is being picked on!

194
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,208
It's complicated, okay?

195
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,583
Must be from Naru.

196
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,833
Ha! Naru?
Who is this "Naru"?

197
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,500
-Some hussy?
-She's just a kid!

198
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,125
They sent these, too?

199
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,375
Uh-oh, it looks like Miwa's
upset about her grade.

200
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,083
Sei, what on earth are those?

201
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,000
It's calligraphy written by
these kids I was teaching.

202
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,458
Huh?

203
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,541
Pretty good for a rookie,
if you ask me.

204
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
If I'd known they were
gonna get their grades so soon,

205
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,791
I would've stuck around
a little while longer.

206
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,875
Wish I coulda been there
when they got the news.

207
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:13,291
So I could congratulate them
or encourage them or something.

208
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,666
Sweetie...

209
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,875
Do what you want.
I don't care.

210
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,125
C'mon, Mom,
enough pouting already.

211
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,458
I'm serious, okay?
Ugh!

212
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,041
If someone on that dumb island
needs you,

213
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,500
then you have to go back.

214
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,541
You mean that?

215
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,708
Yes, as long
as you call me

216
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,041
every once in a while,
you awful child!

217
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,666
Okay, does this mean
I can book a flight?

218
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,625
Well, nobody's stopping you.

219
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,541
You're all right with this?

220
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,916
I am.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,625
I don't know
who his friends are,

222
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,875
but it felt like he really
wanted to look out for them.

223
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,958
If I put my foot down now,
it would just be selfish.

224
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,958
I guess his calligraphy wasn't
the only thing that matured.

225
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,708
Mm-hm.

226
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,416
That island
is a wonderful place.

227
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,208
We should go visit
before the cold settles in.

228
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,583
Sure.

229
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,750
Ahem! So...

230
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,916
We just
received word from Akki,

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,125
fulfilling his duty
as keeper of the phone,

232
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,958
and it turns out Sensei's coming
home on a plane this evening!

233
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,750
[ALL]
Yay!

234
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,916
Okay!
So let's team up

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,166
and make this
place sparkling clean for real!

236
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,750
[ALL]
Yeah!

237
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,041
But seriously,
Sensei's gonna lose his mind

238
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,500
if he sees this mess,
so let's hurry.

239
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,416
[HIRO]
So heavy.

240
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,000
You're
a real piece of work, Sensei.

241
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,500
You leave the island
without a word

242
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,583
and you come back
just as fast.

243
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,125
But man, hope the girls
are cleaning that place up.

244
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,958
[MIWA and TAMA thinking]
Okay, so maybe this wasn't

245
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,875
the best use of time.

246
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,416
--[HIRO] Hey.
--How long have you been here?

247
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,833
No! Please don't ask!

248
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,375
[MIWA]
We somehow got it in our heads

249
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,375
that these things were cool,
but we were wrong.

250
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,541
You don't need to scold us!
We know we're dumb!

251
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,791
[HIRO] Whatever.
Just finish things up, okay?

252
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,041
Hold on, you haven't
even started cleaning yet!

253
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,125
--Whoops?
--Whaddya mean by, "whoops"?

254
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,208
So did you come by
just to help us out?

255
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,875
You wish.
I have my own work to do.

256
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,666
Gotta put slides
on all the windows

257
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,958
before the weather
gets too cold.

258
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,458
Huh.
So what happened

259
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,458
to the old ones,
they break or something?

260
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,625
No, but they fell off
when a typhoon hit.

261
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,791
I've been keeping them
at my place since then.

262
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,916
Wait,
stop changing the subject,

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,666
you need to get back
to cleaning up this place!

264
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,375
Aww.

265
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,166
Hurry it up, you guys don't
wanna face Sensei's wrath.

266
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,666
[HIRO]
Separate the trash!

267
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,000
--Kenta, you sweeping the floor?
--Uh-huh!

268
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,833
[HIRO]
You two, wipe the windows!

269
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,291
Lookin' pretty good.
We should take a break.

270
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,625
Break from what?

271
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,333
You two haven't
even done anything yet!

272
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,041
[MIWA] Okay, okay.
I just gotta remember.

273
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,083
We're doing
all this for Sensei.

274
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,291
One for all
and all for Sensei!

275
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,541
--All for Sensei!
--All for Sensei!

276
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,208
All for Sensei!

277
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,833
[BOTH]
All for Sensei!

278
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,208
[ALL]
All for Sensei!

279
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,791
--[TAMA] Operation Clean Up...
--[MIWA] Complete!

280
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,166
[ALL]
Take that, dirt!

281
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,375
Now I can't wait to make
the place all messy again!

282
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,166
At least hold out
until Sensei comes back.

283
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,666
[MIWA] I can't believe
he's on his way here, already!

284
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,208
Yeah, I know!

285
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,291
--Let's party!
--All right.

286
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,041
Then I'll run home
and bring back some snacks.

287
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,500
Think maybe you can cook
something up for us, Hiro?

288
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,083
You really do
wanna make a mess, huh?

289
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:06,458
[yawning]

290
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,833
I made it.

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,708
Village Leader was
supposed to pick me up,

292
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,916
but I guess he's late.

293
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,458
If I start walking,
I'll catch him.

294
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,833
[DIRECTOR]
Seishu's piece should be

295
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,541
up for review shortly.

296
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,750
[SEIMEI]
Yes. I haven't seen it either,

297
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,625
so I'm looking forward to this.

298
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,041
[DIRECTOR] Kanzaki's work was
quite excellent this time.

299
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,916
I have a feeling
those two youngsters

300
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,958
are going to have
a long-running rivalry.

301
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,750
My only hope is that no matter
the result, Seishu is able

302
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,250
to see what lies beyond it
as an artist.

303
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,125
I believe your son has
a clear vision of the future

304
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,625
and will not lose
his way again on that path.

305
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,791
Now that he's had
his share of setbacks,

306
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,125
I have a feeling he might
rein in that impulsive nature.

307
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,541
[thinking]
"Impulsive."

308
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,125
That's certainly the word.

309
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,875
Though I have a feeling
he still has a while to go.

310
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,375
