Did I miss something?

00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,166
[NARU]
This, ladies, is a

"pre-mi-um choc-o-late bar."

[MIWA] You can read English

[TAMA]
Good job, Naru!

00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,833
Mmm. It's manly.

00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,416
Say what now?

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,958
[NARU]
I have mastered all words.

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,708
When I finished
my summer reading homework,

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,833
I became a true man.

00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,083
[TAMA and MIWA]
Hmm?

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,166
I'm flexing the muscles
in my brain.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,625
My mind can see a new world
of adult wonders,

16
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,583
a kingdom of men.

17

You might even call it...

Where did she learn that?

Now, let me find you something
a little more challenging.

21
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,375
Here.
Can you read this?

22
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,875
"Open with push-ups."

23
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,666
Yeah, that's close enough!

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,416
I don't get the manly thing,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,291
but you've sure gotten real good
at reading!

26
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,000
You can take the milk
as a reward.

27
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,125
No push-ups required.

28
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,875
Thank you, ma'am.

29
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,083
Make sure you tell everyone what
a big, manly reader you are!

30
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,916
Kids sure grow up fast
these days.

I mean the studying.

The "mandom" thing is actually
pretty normal for her.

33
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,208
What do you think caused
the big change, anyway?

34
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,958
Probably hanging out
with that calligraphy nerd.

35
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,125
Aha!

36
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,000
Uh, hello there.

Sensei, can you read
the top of this?

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,541
It's "push to... open"?

You're pretty confident!

some manga project, weren't you?

There's nothing embarrassing
about having a hobby.

If you enjoy expressing yourself
with ink, that's great.

but I wanted to get some honest
feedback from someone first.

Even if you're not

I respect your opinion
as an artist.

No, a boy's magazine.

There's not something
wrong with it, is there?

Not "wrong" per se, but you
might want to write something

more suited to your audience.

or save his soul.

Also a female character
that gets introduced early,

then immediately
becomes useless!

Yeah, but children
read this stuff!

00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,166
Read these too, so you can
learn more about manga!

162
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,625
[HANDA, thinking]
I want to hide under my bed

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,250
where manga can't hurt me.

164
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,041
[sighs]

165
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,458
[TAMA, thinking]
Miwa was the only person

166
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,458
I ever told about
being a manga artist.

167
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,083
I wonder what came over me.

168
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,833
Not only did I show Sensei
my draft,

169
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,916
I went on and on about
all that stuff.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,708
What am I gonna do if he tells
the rest of the town about this?

171
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,333
I mean, if Naru said it...

172
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,750
Tama makes comic books!

173
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,875
[TAMA] ...I could play it off,
but not Sensei!

174
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,125
Everyone's gonna find out
that I'm a closet otaku!

175
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,666
A rival who could destroy him
or save his soul!

176
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,166
A female character
that becomes useless!

177
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
I'm not trying
to hook the guys up, I swear!

178
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,208
They're gonna think
I'm a fujoshi!

179
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,166
Aaaah! My love for manga
is pure!

180
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,541
I don't go crazy with shipping
or write dirty fan-fics

181
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,875
or any of that stuff!

182
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,166
I just have a love
for the fine arts!

183
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,916
I will fix this.
Immediately.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,458
[HIROSHI] Did you hear me?
I brought dinner.

185
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,000
[HANDA]
Yeah. Thanks.

186
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,416
You're not looking so hot.
What's wrong?

187
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
I was just thinking
that girls these days

188
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,500
have a lot of energy
and manga is scary.

189
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,208
Anyway, thank you,
but I need to go make some ink.

190
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,000
Not a great day.

191
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,500
Yep! I had a feeling you
wouldn't be able to buy any!

192
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,291
And why is that?

193
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,500
Everyone has calligraphy
homework over summer vacation,

194
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,083
so they always sell out.

195
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,541
No biggie.

196
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,333
I brought you an extra one,
just in case.

197
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,750
[dramatic music plays]

198
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,125
Oh, no, no, no!
I can't live in this place

199
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,666
if people think
I'm some kind of dirty fangirl.

200
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,000
Anything but that!

201
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,750
I'll tell them
those were storyboards

202
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,916
and that I'm into writing
and directing!

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,250
Yeah, that's it!

204
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,458
I didn't accidentally lend him

205
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,958
my secret book, did I?

206
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,916
It all started my first year
of middle school.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,125
Look at this, Tama!
Your cousin was nice enough

208
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,000
to give you
some of her old manga to read!

209
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,583
[TAMA]
Yay! Neato!

210
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,500
[MOTHER] You really do like
your comics, don't you?

211
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,416
[humming]

212
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,833
Aaaaah! I didn't know this was
a guy-on-guy book, ew!

213
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,291
I thought it was an innocent
workplace drama!

It's so dirty!

Wow.

218
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,333
I kept that forbidden book
as a reminder,

219
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,750
not because I liked it
or anything.

220
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,708
I didn't put it
with my other books,

221
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,458
so I don't think I would lend it
by accident,

222
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,166
but I can't be too careful!

223
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,708

a literature fan, not a pervert!

Probably good you brought me
something to eat, too.

Whatever, just stand up
and stop touching me!

I was so happy, I got dizzy!

was my masterpiece!

Huh? What is he mumbling about
over there?

He said he got second place
in a calligraphy contest.

Oh yeah, I heard he was mailing
his work off for some big show,

254
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,291

with second place?

Huh?

He said first place went
to some 18-year-old punk.

[BOTH]
Huh?

259
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,125
All this pouting 'cause you lost
to someone younger than you?

260
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,500
You're that petty?

261
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,791
[HANDA]
It's not petty!

262
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,000
I worked myself sick
producing this!

263
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,375
Calligraphy is my entire life!

264
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,041
I poured my heart and soul
into that piece.

265
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,083
It's unbearable to think
that some rookie

266
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,416
could beat it that easily!

267
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
I thought moving here
would give me

00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,875
a new perspective on my work,

269
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,916
but now I realize
there's no easy answer.

This is what I get for coming
to this damn useless island!

at a bad time.

Why did you apologize to him?

278
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,416
He can't deal with losing,
so he just pins it on us?

279
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,416
[TAMA] He needs a lot
of confidence to do his work

280
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,750
and that's all been shattered.

Right or wrong
isn't the issue here.

Don't feel bad.

because they don't like you.

I know, though
I wouldn't blame them.

I don't care.
Calligraphy is all I've got.

00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,791
I'll lie to myself if that's
what it takes to keep going.

If I can't be number one,
then what am I fighting for?

Boy, you city folk
don't know nothing!

It's that thing
where people toss mochi

299
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,500
after they build a new house,
right?

300
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,000
I've never done it,
but at least I know what it is.

We're gonna catch mochi
from a boat!

Get with the program!

[AKIKO] Uh-oh, Sensei,

[KENTA'S MOTHER] They're gonna
start the toss any second now!

[HANDA]
What is this for, again?

[KENTA, laughing]
Naru! Up here!

310
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,208
[NARU] Wow, Kenta,
your boat is awesome!

311
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,958
[KENTA] Yeah, I know!
It's called the "Kenmaru"!

312
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,541
"Kenmaru"?

313
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,125
I know,
normally you'd name the boat

314
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,000
after the eldest sister
in the family.

315

Unfortunately, we don't
have any daughters.

316
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll toss you a whole bunch
so get ready!

317
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,958
Sensei! Over here!

318
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,125
[KENTA]
Dang it!

319
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,666
Look at me, Naru,
I got mochiiii!

320
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,625
What's wrong with you?

321
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,541
[KENTA] I didn't mean to!

322
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,375
[KENTA'S MOTHER] Never mind!
Just scoop them out!

323
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,875
[KENTA whimpering]

324
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,666
[MIWA]
Well, look who showed up!

325
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,291
Feeling a bit better now,
I take it?

326
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,958
Hiroshi came to play, too!

327
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,625
[HIROSHI] I got dragged here.
I should be studying.

328
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,583
[MIWA] Like you dragged that
baseball glove of yours here.

329
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,958
[HIROSHI] If I'm gonna do it,
I might as well do it right!

330
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,166
[MIWA] Ooh!
Them's fightin' words, partner!

331
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,458
Listen.

332
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,458
About before.

333
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,083
I, uh...

334
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,375
What?

335
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,500
I know you artist-types
are snippy.

336
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,833
Anyway, I'm over it now.

337
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,750
I'd focus on grabbing that
mochi, if I were you.

338
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,791
Now I'll warn you, there are
two mochi-grabbing heavyweights

339
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,291
you'll need to steer clear of.

340
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,500
That's really a thing?

341
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,250
The first one is Yasu.

342
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,916
She's super old, so she's
done this like a billion times

343
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,250
and she always grabs
a whole bunch.

344
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,000
The other one is Panchi.

345
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,833
She'll knock the mochi clean
out of your hand,

346
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,583
so it's best
to leave her alone.

347
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,875
All right, everybody, let's
give it our best out there!

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,708
You too!

349
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,416
[HANDA] What, the hand thing?
I don't really--

350
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,916
[KENTA'S FATHER]
Here goes! You ready?

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,750
[MIWA]
Let's make some mochi magic!

352
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,916
[ALL]
Yeah!

353
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,041
[HANDA]
Yeah.

354
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,083
Grab some mochi!

355
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,583
[cheering]

356
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,833
[HANDA]
Okay, uh. Don't think.

357
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,791
Just go for it!

358
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,083
Wow, that is harsh.

359
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,666
Damn it, one more try!

360
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,250
All right!
Now let's--

361
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,375
[thud]

362
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,958
Sorry, didn't see you there.

363
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,041
[HANDA, feebly]
That was my mochi.

364
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,291
Why?
Why must the gods test me so?

365
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,916
Tama?

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,625
C'mon, Sensei, I know you've got
a lot of drive.

367
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,458
Let's see some of that here.

368
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,958
[HANDA] Drive, huh?
I sure don't feel like it.

369
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,958
Huh. I guess this isn't
so different than calligraphy.

370
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,625
In other words,
no matter how much I try,

371
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,875
I still can't get what I want.

372
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,875
If I'm going to just make
a fool out of myself,

373
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,750
maybe it's better
to just stop trying.

374
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
That goes for mochi
and calligraphy.

375
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,750
Uggh!

376
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,750
Huh?

377
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,416
[snarls]

378
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Panchi. It figures!

379
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,708
[YASU]
Hey there, Sensei. Any luck?

380
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,208
Uh, no.

381
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,083
Maybe this just ain't
your cup of tea, then.

382
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,958
Judging by the results,
I'd have to agree.

383
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,791
I'm useless.

384
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,750
If you keep lookin' up
the whole time,

385
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,833
you'll miss half the show!

386
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,000
Just sit still a spell
and you might see

387
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,500
there's all sorts of goodies
lyin' on the ground for you.

388
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,000
Not everybody can fly,

389
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,375
but you'll find your way
if you keep lookin'.

390
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,083
[HANDA]
The ground, huh?

391
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,541
[YASU] Time's a-wastin'!
Give it your best out there!

392
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,083
Wait a sec!

393
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:43,166
What if I try everything
and it's still not enough?

394
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,208
Like if someone comes along
who's better than me

395
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,250
and I can't beat them
no matter what?

396
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,041
[YASU]
Hmm?

397
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,500
Um, forget I said that.

398
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,250
When that happens,
the answer is simple.

399
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,541
You say "be my guest, friend."

400
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,791
Ain't nobody need every mochi
in the world

401
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,166
and ain't nobody deserve
to take 'em all, neither.

402
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,291
Sometimes you give one
and you find

403
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,041
a bigger one for yourself
somewhere else.

404
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,291
[YASU chuckles]

405
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,500
That seems to work out fine
for me!

406
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,750
[NARU]
Sensei!

407
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,791
Better hurry, or there won't be
any left for you!

408
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,375
Right!

409
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,916
I'm on it!

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All right, let's go!

411
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,125
[snarls]

412
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,458
Please, be my guest.

413
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,625
Was this the right thing to do?

414
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,458
[NARU] How many did you get,
Sensei?

415
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,875
Some things you don't ask.
I mean, take a good guess.

416
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:53,000
[NARU, laughing] I got a whole
28 of 'em, so I'm awesome!

417
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,083
[MIWA] And a full-grown man
got zero.

418
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,916
[HANDA] Nuh-uh! I got one
and gave it to Panchi,

419
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,208
'cause she wanted it more!

420
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,166
[MIWA]
You liar.

421
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,875
[ALL]
Huh?

422
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,625
What the heck is that?

423
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,750
Red bean soup?

424
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,125
It's red bean and mochi soup.

425
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,125
Panchi likes
the thrill of the fight,

426
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,958
but when it's over with,
she always shares

427
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,666
whatever she catches
with everyone.

428
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,125
Some people can't come and some
don't have a knack for it,

429
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,166
but we all win this way.

430
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,583
[MIWA] Yeah, whatever.
I'm winning for real next time.

431
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,416
[TAMA] Ew, gross!
Why's my mochi wet?

432
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,375
[NARU] 'Cause Kenta
dropped it in the water. Duh!

433
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,375
[MIWA]
Aw, I got one too!

434
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,333
[HANDA]
I know I made a big stink.

435
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,291
But in the end,
I had fun today.

436
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,958
Thank you, guys.

437
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,916

438
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,666

some crayfish too, huh?

460
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,791
[NARU]
Mr. Sakamoto!

461
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,166
[HANDA] It weirds me out
every time that he's a teacher.

462
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,083
You gonna cook up some crayfish
for dinner tonight?

463
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,250
What, are you kidding?
These are bait for bigger stuff.

464
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,166
Aaaah!

465
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,666
What is wrong with you?

466
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,250
The poor crayfish deserve
better than that!

467
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:38,250
Naru, if we use them as bait,
we can catch beakfish.

468
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,125
Whoa.

469
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,666
They're yummy, huh?

470
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,041
So no more throwing buckets,
okay?

471
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,166
Yeah! Beakfish!

472
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,458
So how do you make the crayfish
into bait, anyway?

473
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,083
