1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,375
[HANDA]
Yeah, it's done.

2
00:00:09,458 --> 00:00:13,000
I'll mail it to you ASAP,
so keep a look out.

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:16,333
It took long enough, but I'm
really proud of this one.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,208
I've been overflowing
with inspiration

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,625
ever since I came here.

6
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:21,916
I really gotta hand it
to Mother Nature.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,708
I'm actually enjoying my job,

8
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,875
compared to when
I was in the city.

9
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey, Kawafuji,
are you listening to me?

10
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,125
Hey!

11
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,250
Uh, thanks
for stopping by, Director,

12
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,500
you're a bit early,
so you caught me off guard.

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,500
So how would you say Handa's
work is progressing?

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,833
Well, according to him
everything's going great.

15
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,083
I hope that he can master
a style that's all his own.

16
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,458
The beauty of his calligraphy
is meaningless

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:49,250
if it doesn't
come from the heart.

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,916
I want to see his very soul
splashed right across the paper.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who knows. Personally,
whatever he does,

20
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,291
I'd like to see him
come back and do it here,

21
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,000
but he seems intent
on staying put

22
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,041
until he sees
the results of the exhibit.

23
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,166
Do you think
he's about ready to apologize

24
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,000
for punching me like that?

25
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,958
I couldn't really say.

26
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,000
If you think my forgiveness

27
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,625
will bring him back sooner,
then let me help.

28
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,041
That is, if he finds himself
ready, of course.

29
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
[HANDA]
Stupid Kawafuji. After all that,

30
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,250
he doesn't even bother listening
to what I'm saying.

31
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,875
[sighs]

32
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,666
What I said sure sounded
confident enough.

33
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,416
But I don't know if that piece
is any good or not.

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean, I like it,
but you can tell

35
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,458
it was written
in the heat of the moment.

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,000
Is this like, the "new face"
of my calligraphy?

37
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,375
I could only write this
because I came here.

38
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,333
If I was told to reproduce
something like this

39
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,375
once I went back to Tokyo,
I probably couldn't.

40
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,375
[thinks] Damn it. Now I'm
starting to doubt myself.

41
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,000
Should I really be submitting
something I wrote on a whim

42
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,333
to an exhibit
I can't afford to lose?

43
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,083
Positive, stay positive.

44
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,041
No use worrying
about it now.

45
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,333
Inspiration from nature is my
new weapon, not fundamentals.

46
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,083
I cannot afford to have
an identity crisis right now.

47
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,583
Naru, what
do you think about all this?

48
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,000
Huh? 'Bout what?

49
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,125
Actually, who cares?
Let's play!

50
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,166
I was opening up to you,
and you say, "Who cares?"

51
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,708
You expect me to play games
with you after that? No way.

52
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,208
I don't know if I'd say that
if I were you, Sensei.

53
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,166
--Pchoo!
--Tch!

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,166
Should've gone with a "free
shoulder massage" instead.

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,375
As long as I have this,
you gotta listen to me forever!

56
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,416
It clearly has
"one time" written on it.

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,291
Hey!
What's up, Grandpa?

58
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,750
Huh?
Look who it is!

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,083
Hmm?

60
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,291
[thinks]
What the heck are they doing?

61
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,125
[KOUSAKU]
Gotta pile them rocks up

62
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,875
into a wall 'fore a typhoon
comes barreling through.

63
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,291
And if you don't stack 'em
just so, it all falls apart.

64
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,125
[HANDA]
Oh. It's like a puzzle.

65
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,708
Bring me the next piece
right over yonder!

66
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,708
[thinks] He's trying
to trick me into helping him!

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,708
I'm gonna make Sensei go
frog catching with me today.

68
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,875
--'Cause I got this!
--[thinks] Frog catching?

69
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,583
--[KOUSAKU] Is that so?
--[NARU] Hey!

70
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,791
If I use this magic ticket,
will he help me out?

71
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,416
--[NARU] Huh?
--Only one use, though!

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,708
Ohh!
That's my present!

73
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,458
Don't throw a tantrum,
how' bout we make a trade?

74
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,583
Trade me what?
I want my ticket!

75
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,083
--Here.
--Hmm?

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,958
It's a rock.

77
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,166
[KOUSAKU]
A rock that'll skip on water!

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,625
--[whimpers]
--Now that's a good deal!

79
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,750
I don't want it!

80
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,458
--[groaning]
--Not bad.

81
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,250
C'mon, now,
let's get to work!

82
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,958
[HANDA]
Whoa, heavy.

83
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,708
[KOUSAKU]
Right over yonder.

84
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,041
Phooey.

85
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,291
Let's see,
where's a good spot?

86
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,583
Here. Ha ha!

87
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,958
Feels pretty good
when it fits just right!

88
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,416
It beats frog catchin',
I'll tell you that much.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,166
[groaning]

90
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,875
I'll be darned,
you ain't half bad, Sensei!

91
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,125
I think I'm just good at jobs
that require precision.

92
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,708
I might need a lesson from ya,

93
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,666
seeing how mine are all
whomperjawed in comparison.

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,291
Ha! You got no skills,
Grandpa!

95
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,208
[laughs]
That's mighty honest of you.

96
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,500
Naru!

97
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,500
[NARU and KOUSAKU laughing]

98
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,416
[CAT MAN]
Since we got Sensei for the day,

99
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,041
we should have him
go look at the shrine.

100
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,541
Now there's an idea.
Let's go.

101
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,291
"The shrine"?

102
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,250
[KOUSAKU]
Step on in.

103
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,666
[HANDA]
Okay.

104
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,833
And what exactly
am I supposed to do here?

105
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,166
A prayer, or...?

106
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
I'd rather
you take a look at this.

107
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,500
Them's the names of the folks

108
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,375
that helped out
when the shine was built.

109
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,833
Actually, that amounts

110
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,791
to everyone
in the whole dang village.

111
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,250
We wanted
to get it rewritten.

112
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,125
Here. The list.

113
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,750
[KOUSAKU]
Same as on the wall.

114
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,625
We were gonna hire
some fancy pants from the city

115
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,833
to rewrite it for us, but
I reckon you're even fancier.

116
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,625
Take it.

117
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,541
Oh, wow, this is amazing.
This must be really old.

118
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,166
Might not be a whole bunch,
but we can pay you, of course.

119
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,125
Oh, no, I'm not worried
about the money.

120
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,583
Don't fancy the work?

121
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,041
It's not that.

122
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,250
[HANDA] This is just
so meticulously ordered.

123
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,791
I'm afraid I'm rusty.

124
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,583
[KOUSAKU] You just write 'em
how you do best.

125
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,125
And here we got space
for one more name.

126
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,250
Why don't you
put your signature there,

127
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,833
since you'll be
a part of this, too.

128
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,375
Are you sure?
I'm not really adding much.

129
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,250
[whispers]
Shh! It'll be our secret.

130
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,333
That's not very convincing.

131
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,166
--[AKKI] Sensei.
--[HANDA] Hm?

132
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,916
There was a call
for you back at the store.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,833
From Mr. Kawafuji.

134
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,708
First he ignores me,
and then he wants to talk.

135
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,500
Take this. Got it?

136
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,833
[NARU]
Uh-huh.

137
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,000
So why'd Kawafuji
call him, anyway?

138
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,208
He said he had something
important to talk about.

139
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,833
And what's
that supposed to mean?

140
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,416
Grownup talk, that's what.

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,958
--[NARU whimpers]
--[KENTA and HINA] Huh?

142
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,250
Is something wrong, Naru?

143
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,708
Grandpa stole
my birthday present.

144
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,791
It was an "I'll do anything
you say" ticket

145
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,000
from Sensei, and we were gonna
have so much fun!

146
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,708
Sorry, sounds like
a tough break.

147
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,750
[AKKI]
So, if you had another ticket,

148
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,125
what would you want
to use it for?

149
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,166
[NARU]
Lemme think.

150
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,958
I wanna go to a festival

151
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,458
with Sensei for one,

152
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,375
and then go walk
in the mountains!

153
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,916
Oh, and we could go
to a sports game, too!

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,375
And the beach!
Then let's see...

155
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,250
You don't need a ticket.

156
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,583
If you asked, I bet Sensei
would do that stuff for free.

157
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,333
Y' think so? Then I'll ask him
when I get back!

158
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,375
[KENTA] Festival's
right around the corner!

159
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,541
We gotta make plans!

160
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,125
[HINA]
I wanna wear a kimono!

161
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,250
[NARU] Then let's ask Miwa
and Tama to come too!

162
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,333
[AKKI] Are you sure?
They're gonna cause trouble!

163
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,083
[NARU] You wanna cause
some trouble too?

164
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,083
[AKKI]
Sure.

165
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,708
[ALL laughing]

166
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,083
Yeah. I see.

167
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,125
Oh, no, it's fine.
I'll come back.

168
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,458
[MIWA]
Okay!

169
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,250
I think this one's my best.

170
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,583
Here's my favorite.

171
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,791
Good.
Those are both strong pieces.

172
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,416
You've learned a lot from
my lessons, but as your mentor,

173
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,250
there is nothing more
I can teach you.

174
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,958
That gold award is yours,
I guarantee it!

175
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,625
[BOTH]
Okay!

176
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,500
[ALL groan]

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean, he says that,
but who knows

178
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,166
if our teacher
is gonna like it or not.

179
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,666
After all of that hard work,
what if we don't get any award?

180
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,458
I don't even
wanna turn it in now!

181
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,333
Are you fools?
I trained you, didn't I?

182
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,833
Your calligraphy
will not lose to anyone!

183
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,500
Where does
that confidence come from?

184
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,833
I'm actually
not confident at all.

185
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,750
Not with your work,
I mean, my own.

186
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,541
I have no idea if my latest
piece is worth anything or not.

187
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,208
[BOTH]
Uh-oh!

188
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,750
Sensei!

189
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,291
Let's go!

190
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,625
There's a festival!

191
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,625
[NARU gasps]

192
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,875
There. All done!

193
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,291
Wow! I didn't know
you could tie a yukata sash!

194
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,541
That's awesome.

195
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,291
[laughs]
It's cute!

196
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,166
You think this is awesome?
Yukata are easy.

197
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,833
--I can do kimono sashes, too!
--Wow.

198
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,375
You're going
to the festival, right?

199
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,541
Yeah.

200
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,541
[NARU]
Yay! Let's hurry!

201
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,958
It's gonna be so much fun!

202
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,583
We're meeting up
with some friends first,

203
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,875
but we'll
see you there, 'kay?

204
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,125
--Thanks again for the lessons.
--Sure.

205
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,833
[NARU]
Sensei, what's taking so long?

206
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,833
[HINA]
Let's go!

207
00:09:58,916 --> 00:09:59,875
That's enough!

208
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,666
A festival. Who knows,

209
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,458
maybe a little change
of pace is all that I need.

210
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,333
What'cha smiling 'bout, Sensei?

211
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,166
I wasn't smiling,
I was just deep in thought!

212
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,458
[NARU and HINA screaming]

213
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,833
--Hey...
--[NARU and HINA] Festival!

214
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,958
[HANDA sighs]

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,958
Well, it's fine.

216
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,541
This one last time.

217
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:28,000
[NARU]
Yay! Party time! Party time!

218
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,958
[CROWD chattering]

219
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,333
[NARU and HINA]
Yay!

220
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,500
C'mon, this way!

221
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,416
[HANDA chuckles]

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,666
[thinks]
Wow, it's a picture-perfect

223
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,291
small town festival.

224
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,500
Guess I don't
have much experience

225
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,166
with that sort of thing.

226
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,666
There's a festival today, Sei,
would you like to go?

227
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,833
[SEIMEI]
He has an exhibit to attend to.

228
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,250
C'mon, Handa,
let's go to the festival!

229
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,583
[HANDA'S MOTHER] I'm sorry,
Sei has an exhibit to attend to.

230
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,125
Handa, let's go
check out the festival!

231
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,708
He's got an exhibit,
but you can go with me!

232
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,041
[HANDA]
What?

233
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,208
[thinks]
That is super depressing,

234
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,166
especially since I have
an exhibit coming up.

235
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,375
[NARU]
Sensei! Come play this!

236
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,625
You can win a goldfish!

237
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,916
[thinks] I can make up
for the childhood I never had!

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,750
[HANDA trembling]

239
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,583
[IWAO] Well, I'll be damned!
If it ain't Sensei!

240
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,166
[HANDA]
If I can't catch a goldfish,

241
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,416
I don't have to cut off
a finger, do I?

242
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,583
[IWAO] You here to support
the community or not?

243
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,166
Uh, yes sir, sorry.

244
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,666
Then pay up!

245
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,625
A pastry shell?

246
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
So, I catch it with this?

247
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,750
It'll be easy!

248
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,208
Easy!

249
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
You're mine, fishy!

250
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,208
[HANDA]
Huh?

251
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,458
You sure stink
at this, don't you?

252
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,583
This is defective,
gimme a new one!

253
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,625
It's not the game, buddy,
it's the player.

254
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,500
Fine.
One more try.

255
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,000
'Scuse me, Sensei,
move over a bit.

256
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
The nurse from before.

257
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,041
Hey, Iku!

258
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,458
[IKU] You have to be gentle,
or it'll break. Watch.

259
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,875
Take notes, 'cause
this gal's the best there is.

260
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,541
[HANDA and NARU]
That's crazy!

261
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,000
[HANDA]
It's like the goldfish

262
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,416
can't wait to leap
into her arms!

263
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,291
[AIKO]
Ah! It's Iku!

264
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,083
What can I say?
Fair's fair.

265
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,166
Girl puts me
in the red every year.

266
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,541
Can't help but wonder what she
does with all of 'em, though.

267
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,791
Good question.

268
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,958
--[AIKO] Iku!
--Last sweep, here we go!

269
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,750
[AIKO laughs]

270
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,583
What are you doing, Aiko?

271
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,000
That's a damn shame, Iku--
better luck next time.

272
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,083
Aww. I almost broke
my old record!

273
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,583
[crowd laughs]

274
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,416
[KAZUYUKI]
Iku tries to make a clean sweep

275
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,833
at the goldfish scoop
every year.

276
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,333
[HANDA]
The head teacher.

277
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,375
I taught her not to be so flashy
back in school,

278
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,250
but I guess she didn't learn!

279
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,500
Oh, yeah?
She was your student?

280
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,958
[HANDA thinks] He wants me
to ask about the balloons,

281
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,625
but I'm not taking the bait.

282
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,291
[NARU] We didn't catch
a single goldfish.

283
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,291
[HANDA]
Taking care of pets is a pain.

284
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,458
I lost on purpose.

285
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,708
They're doin'
somethin' cool over there!

286
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,250
I wonder what.

287
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,708
Actually, it's
a free throw competition.

288
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,708
--[NARU] Hey, Akki.
--Oh, hey there.

289
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,791
I entered, myself.
You make a four-person team,

290
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,333
then shoot for points
to win coupons.

291
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,125
[ALL]
And we're his team!

292
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,208
--[HANDA] You again?
--Oh right, you've already met!

293
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,041
Anyway, I thought
we might actually have

294
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,708
a shot at winning it
this time around,

295
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
but the middle school girls
are out for blood.

296
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,833
5,000 yen in coupons!

297
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,208
Let's teach those fools

298
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,875
that the softball club
shows no mercy!

299
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,375
You got it, Miwa.

300
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,875
Girls these days.

301
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,750
[HANDA]
Hey, Tama isn't with you?

302
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,375
Hey, Sensei.

303
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,791
She was supposed to be here,

304
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,416
but she had to go buy
some dumb manga.

305
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,125
We still need a fourth player,

306
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,541
so she better get her butt down
here before it's our turn.

307
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,166
So this is Sensei!

308
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,500
Wow, he's cute.

309
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,041
Nice shot, Akki!

310
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,916
I'm gonna put that little shrimp
in his place, just you wait!

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,625
Akki acts all low-key, but he's
actually a superstar, huh?

312
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,291
If Tama doesn't show up pronto,
we're gonna be disqualified!

[scoffs]
What is her deal?

314
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,041
The release date is today!

--We've been over this before.

--[MIWA stammers]

318

[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Are you ready, ladies?

319
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,333
I am gonna shove
her glasses up her butt!

320
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,375
--Sensei, help us!
--Huh?

321
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,250
Even you can make
one little shot, right?

322
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,833
That's easy for you to say.

323
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,791
Also, are you
making fun of me?

324
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Second shot!

325
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,416
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Third shot!

326
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,750
You're in the softball club,
why are you so good?

327
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,208
Officially, yeah,

328
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,875
but we practice with
the basketball club too.

329
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,208
None of the clubs have
many members,

330
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,833
so we trade out a lot.

331
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,791
The country life
is breeding superhumans.

332

Here! You're up!
Better not miss!

Hold on!

[thinks]
Can't back down now.

335
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,208
Don't blow it, Sensei!

336
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,208
[thinks] I never thought
this day would come,

337
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,708
when I show the world
my hidden talent. That's right.

338
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:08,041
When I was in high school,
I read basketball manga!

339
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,416
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
"Team Akki" wins!

340
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,833
Who'd've thought
that grade schoolers

341
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,791
would seize victory
from the jaws of defeat?

342
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,208
C'mon.
It ain't that bad.

343
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,291
I-- I really thought
I could do it.

344
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,125
[MIWA]
Here, Sensei!

345
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:26,083
It ain't much, but we still got
some coupons for second place...

346
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,458
Even split
for 300 yen a head.

347
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,833
I kind of ruined it
for you, are you sure?

348
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,666
Well, you did better
than Tama, at least.

349
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,250
I can't complain.

350
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,083
[crying] Why did you sell
the book I preordered?

--That was my copy!
--We'll get more in soon.

Your pick, my treat.

Yay! Takoyaki!

00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,041
--Yakisoba!
--Cotton candy then.

356
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,666
--[BOTH] Huh?
--[HINA] Cheapo!

357
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,666
You said we could have
anything we wanted!

358
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,875
You need to learn that
adults aren't made of money!

359
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,875
Fine, I'll just
buy it myself, then.

360
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,375
Same here.

361
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,791
[HANDA]
You had money all this time?

362
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,666
Then why were so excited?

363
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,833
If you want something, lemme
know, and I can buy it for you!

364
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,750
Even when free food is at stake,

365
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,875
I can't take up a little girl
on that offer.

366

Just let her treat you.

Hmm... It's not that
I don't have any money, but...

371
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,333
Three cotton candies,
with these coupons.

[thinks] I've never
had cotton candy before.

Where am I supposed to start?

380
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,208
Here? Over here?

381
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,833
Do I just bite it?

382
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,500
[thinks]
Why do I feel like

383
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,875
he isn't responsible enough
for cotton candy?

384
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,833
I'm worried he's gonna get it
on someone's clothes,

385
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,333
or poke himself with the stick.

--Sensei.
--[yelps] Tama?

401
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,666
What are you doing?

402
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,375
I was just reading
the manga I bought today.

403
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,166
I don't do very well
with crowds,

404
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,708
so this is
pretty much what I do

405
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,541
when the summer festival
comes around each year.

406
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,583
Not that I have
any room to talk,

407
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,708
but you are throwing away
your youth.

408
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,000
Have you seen Naru or--
Stop it!

409
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,750
They came through here,

410
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,375
so they were
probably headed to the beach.

411
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,708
The fireworks display should
be starting any minute now.

412
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,833
I know
the perfect place to sit.

413
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,541
Hey, it's Sensei!

414
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,125
[MIWA] Tama, where
have you been hiding?

415
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,500
Oh, you know me,
just reading manga.

416
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,375
Where's the rest
of the softball club?

417
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,041
They're gonna watch the
fireworks with their boyfriends.

418
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,791
Maybe they'll get blown up
by the fireworks.

419
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,666
--Tama!
--[KENTA] Cool!

420
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,333
[KENTA] Look!
Naru and Hina are here too!

421
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,583
--[NARU] Hey!
--So where's your girlfriend?

422
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,000
What gives?

423
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,708
You think I'd be cooking
yakisoba if I had a girlfriend?

424
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,916
I know.
Just pullin' yer' leg.

425
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
--So, same group as usual, huh?
--Yep!

426
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,666
Can't believe
summer break is ending.

427
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,791
So it's back
to the drudgery of school,

428
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,875
but we had lots of fun and all
good things must come to an end.

429
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,250
Will you be
taking entrance exams?

430

[HIRO]
Hmm.

431
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,416
I'll probably look for a job.

--I'm leaving.
--Aww. It's gonna be so sad.

434
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,875
Well, I still
got some time left.

435
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,791
I guess so, and even if you
leave, we still have Sensei.

436
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,083

can take my place?

--was gonna say to us?
--No.

It's obvious
if you look at him.

That back
and those slumped shoulders

tell you everything
you need to know.
