1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Step right up ladies and gents.
Seashells for sale.

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,541
Come on down. Huh?

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,291
Should be somewhere around here.

4
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,541
Put a little more effort
into searching this time.

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,916
I don't want to spend
the night

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,916
at that stupid campsite
again, okay?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,791
I hear you. What's this?

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,458
I'm selling seashells,
by the seashore. [gasps]

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh! Grandma.

10
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,000
And she's back.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,458
'Sup, bro?

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,625
Uh, nothing much, bro.

13
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,416
Wow, are you playing shop?

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,166
So what are you selling?

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,750
Seashells.

16
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,166
I'll take one of your
finest then, please.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,833
Here you go, sir.

18
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,125
I didn't know you
liked kids so much.

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,166
It's good for P.R.

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,375
I should have figured.

21
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,875
And what about you, Kawafuji?

22
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,208
[KAWAFUJI] Give her another
15 years and I might like her.

23
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,958
[KANZAKI] That's not liking
kids. That's liking women.

24
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,458
I like my women with experience.

25
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,416
--Ew! Gross!
--Hey!

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,166
You trying to break my glasses,
you stupid brat?

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,166
What was that?

28
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,458
You use a toothpick like this
to dig 'em out

29
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,750
and gobble 'em up.

30
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,708
[KANZAKI] Oh, hell no! No, no!

31
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,625
--Hey, little lady.
--Yeah?

32
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,708
Is there a person named "Seishu
Handa" living around here?

33
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,041
Seishu Handa, huh?

34
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,458
Don't think so.

35
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,000
Huh? You sure?

36
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,000
We got a sensei that just moved
in if you need one of those.

37
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,416
Sensei?

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,041
A calligraphy sensei.

39
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,625
Yeah, that's Handa.

40
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,750
You happen to know where
he lives, by any chance?

41
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,375
I'll tell you if you buy one
of my seashells.

42
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:48,375
She's a real pro.
All right, how about that one?

43
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,083
Oh. You've got an eye
for quality, mister.

44
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,791
But only rich people like
I.T. presidents

45
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,750
or major leaguers can afford
to buy this baby.

46
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,708
Oh, yeah? Okay.

47
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,083
Can I pay with my credit card?

48
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,583
For real?

49
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,541
So how much money are
we talking here?

50
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,625
I want you to be my guide too,
so I'll pay you well.

51
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,458
A mil-- a million yen
for you, ya thief!

52
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,583
At least let me bargain before
you start calling me a thief.

53
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:20,458
I've never seen a real-life
credit card before.

54
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,458
Check it.

55
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,083
[screams]

56
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,583
Okay, little girl.
Now show me the way.

57
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,666
Hold on a sec.
I gotta go show this to grandma.

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,916
I don't think so.
We're doing my stuff first.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,250
-Unh-unh. Let me go.
-Just take us to see Handa.

60
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,125
Now what do we have here?

61
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,833
--Uh. I was just--
--There a problem here, Teach?

62
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,541
--Couple of weirdoes.
--They look like kidnappers.

63
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,166
Are those gang tattoos?

64
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,916
Let's all calm down and talk.

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,500
We're going to
the village meeting.

66
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,666
You can make your case there,
city boy.

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,250
--Huh?
--Move it!

68
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,125
--Whoa, wait, this is just--
--Kawafuji!

69
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,208
Thanks for this food.

70
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,791
--Thanks for this food.
--Let's eat!

71
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,250
Hold on a sec,

72
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,833
why aren't you eating dinner
at your own damn house?

73
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,666
'Cause nobody's home.

74
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,083
Mom and dad went to the village
meeting at the Community Center.

75
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,708
Hmm. Grandpa too.

76
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,791
Food tastes better
in good company, right?

77
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,833
Yeah!

78
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:51,500
Define "good company."

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Sensei, looks like

80
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,125
you put on some weight
since you moved here.

81
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,125
No way!

82
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,208
Yes, way.

83
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,666
Your sloppy country attitude
is starting to rub off on me.

84
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,250
A little meat on your bones
is healthy, Sensei.

85
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,916
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,625
what are all these weird
scribbles on your arm?

87
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,083
I don't get it.

88
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,250
I met a guy today
who had scribbles too.

89
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,666
He's probably in jail
or worse now.

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,125
Then he had tattoos. Hopefully
not like yours, though.

91
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,666
A flower. The word "dog."

92
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,416
And what are those dots?

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,166
Chocolate candies.

94
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
So that guy's tattoo,
did it look like an eagle?

95
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:31,291
Hmm. It was all messy.
I couldn't quite tell.

96
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,250
He's been sending me
text messages like crazy

97
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,375
--since yesterday.
--[HIROSHI] Huh?

98
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,541
That may be my friend. I haven't
been able to reply to him,

99
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,791
'cause the keys on my phone got
messed up after I dropped it

100
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,666
--in the ocean.
--Whoa.

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,875
The dropping your phone
in the ocean part I can believe,

102
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,291
but you actually have a friend?

103
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,416
I'm gonna beat you.

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,791
--Sensei!
--Miwa, what's up?

105
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,250
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

106
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,458
--Who are they? Hmm?
--Huh?

107
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,166
Hey, you dummies, come around
to the back to get in.

108
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,541
That's the entrance.

109
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,000
I would rather you use
the entrance

110
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,250
like a normal person, please.

111
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,916
Are they guests?

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,250
They said they're friends
of yours, Sensei.

113
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,291
--Huh?
--Hey!

114
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,000
Kawafuji?

115
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,291
He's stumbling around
an awful lot.

116
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,875
What did you guys do to him?

117
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,000
They said they found him trying
to kidnap a kid or something,

118
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,166
so they were like, lecturing him
at the village meeting, I think.

119
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,458
Yes, siree!

120
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,791
But since half the town
was there,

121
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,083
it turned into
one big drinking party.

122
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,333
--I'm so sorry, little buddy.
--I see.

123
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,500
Ah, Handa!

124
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:34,708
Do you have any idea how
worried I was about you?

125
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,916
A city boy stuck out here
in the boonies,

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,916
without me to watch your back?

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,416
I mean, okay,
but that's no reason to cry.

128
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,208
[crying]
I was just so scared.

129
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,583
You were, you were really
that worried about me?

130
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
You're my best friend, man.

131
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,916
And you're my only friend.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,750
[BOTH]
Best friends forever!

133
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:56,208
--Kawafuji.
--Little buddy.

134
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,250
--Crane style!
--Ugh!

135
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,708
You bastard! How dare you
ignore all my calls?

136
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,333
You're just pretending
to like me, aren't you?

137
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,750
I'm sorry.
My cell phone was acting up.

138
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,333
Are you too cheap
to use a pay phone to call

139
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,125
your best friend
in the whole world?

140
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,416
I figured you'd find your way
here sooner or later.

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,708
Are you kidding? Have you tried
using a GPS around--

142
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,875
[retching]

143
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,166
Stop it!
No barfing on top of me.

144
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,291
It must've been a pain coming
from all the way from Tokyo.

145
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,125
We had a connecting flight,
but it took just a few hours.

146
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,833
Man, that's awesome.

147
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,750
I've never actually ridden
on a plane in my whole life.

148
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,125
I don't think I've ever
even seen one before.

149
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,708
You kids never went
to Tokyo before?

150
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,625
--No.
--Just Nagasaki.

151
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,791
Hyogo for me.

152
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,875
What? That's so lame.

153
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,875
Sensei, we're out of pickles
over here.

154
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,041
Can you get some more?

155
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,458
So just to get this straight,

156
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,958
I'm being ordered around
by a middle schooler.

157
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,166
Yeah, 'cause I'm the guest.
So hurry it up.

158
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,875
It's neat how you're
all friends here.

159
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,083
Speaking of friends, it doesn't
seem like Sensei knows you.

160
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,500
Did you just tag along
with that drunk guy?

161
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,750
Actually, yeah,
'cause I wanted to meet Handa.

162
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,666
Oh, here's my card.

163
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,958
I'm a calligrapher,
Kanzaki Kosuke.

164
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,500
[NARU] I want a card, too.

165
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,416
It was Handa's work that
inspired me to start my career.

166
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah? You look awful young
to be a professional.

167
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,458
I'm 18. I get mistaken for
a middle schooler a lot, though.

168
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,041
An 18-year-old calligrapher?

169
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,416
Why do I feel like
I've heard that before?

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,416
I built up my courage
and made a piece

171
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,041
for the Tokyo Kasho Exhibit
a little while back.

172
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,375
It was really great,
since Handa entered, too.

173
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,833
[BOTH gasping]

174
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,125
Unfortunately, it actually
turned out kind of awkward.

175
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,333
Even though I look up to Handa,

176
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,125
I ended up beating
his exhibit entry.

177
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,125
Well, he was probably
phoning it in that time,

178
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,125
but I was still excited.

179
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,958
It gave me this feeling that my
hero wasn't quite out of reach.

180
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,458
Is this the guy he threw a fit
about before the mochi toss?

181
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,041
That sure is what
it looks like, huh?

182
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,958
You don't think he came here
to rub it in his face, do you?

183
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,500
It would be bad if Sensei
had another relapse.

184
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,541
No matter what, we can't let
him find out who this guy is.

185
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,208
I hope these are enough
pickles, princess.

186
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,208
--Oh, Handa, my card.
--[BOTH] No!

187
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,916
What do you mean by "no?"
You seriously want more pickles?

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,041
This isn't about the pickles,
it's--

189
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,750
wait, wow, that's a whole lot
of pickles, isn't it?

190
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,916
[laughs] These country folk
sure are fun, huh?

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,208
I knew this was bad before
you started choking me, thanks.

192
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know if Sensei's
pride could take this.

193
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,583
[BOTH] What are we gonna do
if he kills himself?

194
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,125
Listen, about
the Tokyo Kasho Exhibit--

195
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,541
Aaah!

196
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,458
Oh, wow,
would you look at the time?

197
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,958
You guys had better
hit the road soon.

198
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,708
I mean, you're staying
at an inn now, aren't you?

199
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,541
I wish. We slept at some
dumb campsite yesterday.

200
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,250
Better go then. The roads
at night are way dangerous.

201
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,916
There's always tomorrow.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
Kawafuji's still sleeping.
Just stay here tonight.

203
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,291
--Huh?
--That would be great.

204
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,583
You have no idea how many
disgusting bugs there are

205
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,375
everywhere at that camp place.

206
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,125
Plus, there's lots for us
to talk about.

207
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,625
If you've got any bright ideas,
now is probably the time.

208
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,666
We'll have to spend the night
too and keep him in check.

209
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,708
I've got a meeting with a career
counselor tomorrow, though.

210
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,041
--What is it?
--I know we just met,

211
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,041
but a friend of Sensei's
is a friend of mine.

212
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,125
So here's a present just
for you.

213
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,125
Huh. What could it be?

214
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,458
[slithering]

215
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,333
[screams] Kill it with fire!

216
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,291
--No!
--What the heck did you do?

217
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,291
You were keeping those
in my house?

218
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,291
Shut up.

219
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,791
Damn it. Go away!

220
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,250
Sensei, no.
Those are stink bugs.

221
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,416
--Eww.
--I tried to warn you.

222
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,916
--Hey, Hiro.
--On it.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,125
Here.

224
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,250
[MIWA] Bloop.

225
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,958
[HANDA] Huh?

226
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,666
You don't wanna smash 'em
or upset 'em,

227
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,250
but this way
works like a charm.

228
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,625
You guys know
the strangest stuff.

229
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,625
I just saved your butt
from stink bugs

230
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,958
and you call it "strange"?

231
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,916
No more. I wanna go home.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,708
Anyway, you should head back
to the campsite till tomorrow.

233
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,916
The smell's only gonna
attract more bugs.

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,583
All right, well,
see you in the morning.

235
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,875
Yeah. You know where to find me.

236
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,875
[KAWAFUJI]
Oh, one last thing.

237
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,375
[HANDA] Hmm?

238
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,500
I wondered if I could
call you "Sensei" too?

239
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,208
That's fine. I don't mind.

240
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,791
[BOTH] Nobody had to die.

241
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,708
[HANDA] Hmm, so
that's Kosuke Kanzaki.

242
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,958
Doesn't seem like
the calligrapher type.

243
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,583
I did get kind of a nasty vibe
from him, though.

244
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,791
Hold on a second, Sensei. You
knew who he was the whole time?

245
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,708
I don't know him personally.
Kawafuji sent a text about him.

246
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,916
"I'm bringing Kosuke Kanzaki
with me.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's the brat who won first
place at the last exhibit."

248
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,375
"He's a bit on the strange side.
Don't say I didn't warn you"?

249
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,375
See?

250
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,958
Don't play cool with us.

251
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,333
We were flipping out trying
to keep that secret from you.

252
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,291
Huh? Really?

253
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, it does bother me a bit

254
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,625
and maybe I resent him
a little, too,

255
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,916
but I do feel a lot better now.

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,625
[BOTH] I didn't know.

257
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,083
Come on, let's catch
the rest of those bugs.

258
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,250
Yeah.

259
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:03,041
[KAWAFUJI] Uh, I'm lost.

260
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,208
I'm sorry to bother you again
after that mess last night.

261
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,041
--Not a problem.
--How merciful of you.

262
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,791
No Kawafuji today?

263
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,833
He's so hungover,
he can't even move.

264
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,416
Somehow, that doesn't come
as a surprise to me.

265
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,000
He's got a history of bad timing
when it comes to that stuff.

266
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,500
Hot tea in the middle
of summer?

267
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,125
It's Black bean tea
or nothing, I say.

268
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,583
Speaking of Kawafuji,
did he say anything about me?

269
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,041
Only that winning that exhibit
went to your head.

270
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,458
It's my fault for asking,
I guess.

271
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,666
Well, I'm actually a pretty big
fan of yours.

272
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,375
Here, I even have the collection
to prove it.

273
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,833
I picked up every book
and every magazine

274
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,833
that had an article about you.

275
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,041
"The talented son of a master
calligrapher takes the stage."

276
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,666
Every interview praises
the beauty of your work

277
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,541
and your talent
for capturing the fundamentals.

278
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,125
I love your expression here.

279
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,458
It's like, "Yeah, I'm awesome,
what about it?"

280
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,833
I like this black suit
one, too.

281
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,208
You're like,
"Whatever shall I write next?"

282
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,000
This is sick.
Are you trying to embarrass me?

283
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,375
It's nothing weird.

284
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,791
I just want to be
exactly like you in every way.

285
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,791
Oh, and this one's my favorite.
You had the most awesome quote.

286
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,583
"I breathe in the air around me,

287
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,500
and when I speak to the paper
and brush,

288
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,333
it's as if they listen
and answer back to me."

289
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,291
Okay, that's enough.
Stop reading it out loud.

290
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,250
"The ink is more than just
a tool. It transforms the dull

291
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,791
into the charismatic,
to put it succinctly."

292
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,416
Card is magic sushi?

293
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,791
Just shut up.

294
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,500
I don't need your pity.

295
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,375
Ooh, and I love this one too.

296
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,625
No! I have been shamed
enough by you.

297
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,833
Hey, that's mean.

298
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,333
What is your problem?

299
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Did you just come here
to mock me or what?

300
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,458
Not at all.
I thought your quotes were cool.

301
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,291
What's so wrong with that?
I wanted to hear them live,

302
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,541
and record them
to take home with me.

303
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,375
To what end?

304
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,333
The whole reason why I entered
the Kasho Exhibit

305
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,458
was so I could meet you, Sensei.

306
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,541
Why'd you have to move away?

307
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,000
That second place piece
that you just made,

308
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,791
it was the product of moving
to this island.

309
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,958
Huh?

310
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,958
Sensei, let's go back
to Tokyo together.

311
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,333
[gasps]

312
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,875
Ugh, my head.

313
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,875
Hmm?

314
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,750
Oh, hey, what's up?

315
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,666
Dude, you stink.

316
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,000
Anyway, we came here looking
for Kanzaki.

317
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,416
Can you tell us where he is?

318
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,041
Yeah, he got up early
to go see Handa.

319
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,958
Whoa, already?

320
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,291
I see. You don't want him to
shoot his mouth off to Handa,

321
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,625
so you came to lecture him.

322
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,791
Uh-huh. That a problem?

323
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,750
I just don't think it'll work.

324
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,791
Though I appreciate you trying
to take care of Handa and all.

325
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,583
He's a full-grown man.
It's not like that, okay?

326
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,458
No, I get it.
It's the same way with me.

327
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,458
He's got this whole lost puppy
thing about him.

328
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,458
You're afraid of what might
happen if you leave him

329
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,000
to his own devices.

330
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,666
We've been friends
since middle school,

331
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,583
so I know better than anyone.

332
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,041
He has a hard time talking
to people.

333
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,375
And when he does, he ends up
being an ass about it.

334
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,375
I'm useless.

335
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,583
[KAWAFUJI]
Then he gets depressed

336
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,250
--and starts the cycle over.
--An AT Field?

337
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,833
Still, socking the director in
the face was a new low for him.

338
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,375
That was a real pain
to clean up, by the way.

339
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,125
Sounds like the Sensei we all
know and love for sure.

340
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,875
Anyway, since moving way out
here to the country

341
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,416
would require him to be social,
I figured he'd give up

342
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,125
on the whole thing and come back
home in no time flat.

343
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,250
In other words, he must really
be having fun out here.

344
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,000
I can't stick around, so try
to look after him for me.

345
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,625
That's cute and all,

346
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,750
but seeing how depressed he got
after he lost that competition,

347
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,666
it sort of feels like you're
dumping problems on us

348
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,833
for absolutely no good reason
by bringing Kanzaki out here.

349
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,916
Oh, my headache's back.

350
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,666
Don't change the subject.

351
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,833
I'm an art dealer, you know?

352
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,916
Handa's my golden goose
as much as he's my friend.

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,541
Golden goose?

354
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,500
He's an investment,
so I want him to do well.

355
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,791
I think coming to this island
has brought him close

356
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,625
to some kind of breakthrough.

357
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:57,750
Problem is, he can't quite
figure out what it is.

358
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,583
If a person wants to improve, he
needs a rival to compete with.

359
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,458
As for me,
I've still got a hangover,

360
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,958
so I'm gonna sleep it off.

361
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,625
Tell Handa I'll stop by his
place tomorrow.

362
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,375
So Sensei's only friend is
really more like his handler,

363
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,208
and this rival thing's supposed
to be like, tough love?

364
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,958
He's got it bad.

365
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,708
Since when is calligraphy
about winning, anyway?

366
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,708
It's not like martial arts.

367
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,666
Can't you see you're wasting
your time here?

368
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,333
You need to come back
and take your work seriously.

369
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,333
Hold on a second. I didn't
just come here to run away.

370
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,958
I came here
to improve my calligraphy.

371
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't leave
until I see results.

372
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:38,083
What results? So far all this
has done is harm your career.

373
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:43,166
[sighs] I started on my
calligraphy work way back

374
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,833
in elementary school,
but it was nothing but a bunch

375
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,041
of boring exercises,
so I was about ready to quit.

376
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,500
But then my school had a field
trip to a local exhibit

377
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,291
and I got to see your work
for the first time.

378
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:00,875
It was so beautiful.
I had tears in my eyes.

379
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,208
But now, even though your career
is just starting,

380
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,375
you've already completely
lost your way.

381
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,125
--I have?
--It's obvious.

382
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,916
Your work now is trying
too hard to be unique.

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,958
You're throwing away the
strength of your fundamentals

384
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
for some confused sense
of artistry.

385
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
You think so?

386
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,416
Losing to me is all
the proof you need.

387
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,791
I expected you to be angry,
but it's like you haven't even

388
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,708
noticed that your work
has gotten worse.

389
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,208
This country lifestyle
is ruining you.

390
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,541
-Okay, wait.
-I'm taking you back home.

391
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,875
Listen to me.

392
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,583
You're the one who said
recognition is everything

393
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,125
to an artist,
or did you forget that too?

394
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,458
[MAN] So young and yet your work
is already mired in monotony.

395
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,958
A textbook piece in every way,

396
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,833
with a checklist of features
to curry favor with judges.

397
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:40,916
[KANZAKI]
Sensei!

398
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,083
I'm trying to save
your career, okay?

399
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,625
[MAN] We all face the wall
of mediocrity.

400
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,541
[MIWA] Who cares about that?
I just wanna have fun with it.

401
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,791
[KANZAKI] Why won't
you listen to me?

402
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,333
It's obvious this
place is no good for you.

403
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,375
I'm taking you with me.
Got it?

404
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,583
--Sensei.
--[screams]

405
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,625
Just shut the hell up, okay?

406
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,333
First, I win a competition and
they tell me my work is boring,

407
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,791
then I make something
interesting and I lose.

408
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,458
What do you want?

409
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,333
[sobs] I don't know

410
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,083
what I'm supposed
to do anymore.

411
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,791
A paper airplane?

412
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:17,041
[gasps] That's from my book
collection. Who did this?

413
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,000
[laughing]

414
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,083
Wow! Your airplanes
really can fly.

415
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,875
It's 'cause the wind
is just right.

416
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:31,416
Sensei. Look at 'em go!

417
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,833
I am going to beat you,
you brats.

418
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,250
They're disrespecting your work.
We have to--

419
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,250
--Be my guest, friend.
--Huh?

420
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,666
The works that I made,
that you love so much,

421
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,666
were kept very carefully in line

422
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,250
thanks to my father's
discipline.

423
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,875
There's nothing wrong with that.

424
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,458
They're still quite beautiful.

425
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,916
But now I want to create works

426
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,625
that only I can make.

427
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,916
I don't know if that's right
or not,

428
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,666
but I'll never know
if I rush back to Tokyo

429
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,083
because of what you said.

430
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,375
I want to make a change.

431
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,375
And I want to do it here.

432
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,375
Come down before you get hurt.
And watch your step.

433
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,041
[BOTH] Okay.

434
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:19,916
You go on ahead
and don't worry about me, okay?

435
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,125
I'll ride the wind

436
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,083
and catch up again soon.

437
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,583
Sensei, wait. Say that again
so I can record it. Ugh!

438
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,333
Whoa, sorry. I didn't realize
that I was such a badass.

439
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,500
Naru, get the Village Leader.

440
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,791
Hina, you go pick up some ice
for Kanzaki's face.

441
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,916
[BOTH] Roger.

442
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,708
Well, I tried.

443
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,500
He's never going to stop
improving, is he?

444
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,000
I'd better work hard.

445
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,291
I don't get it.
Did he come here just to sleep?

446
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,916
It's complicated, okay?

447
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,458
I'm not complaining
when I get to make dinner

448
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,791
for another handsome young man.

449
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,041
You're not cute, mom,
you're just old.

450
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,625
I'll wallop that dirty mouth
of yours and jerk a knot

451
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,958
in your tail.
Oh, by the way, Sensei,

452
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,458
Naru was passing out these
magazines with you in them

453
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,458
all over the village.
We knew you were special,

454
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,083
but we didn't think
you were a celebrity.

455
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,750
[HIROSHI]
Oh, no.

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,958
Can I get you to sign this?

457
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,666
Your mom is destroying
my wall calendar.

458
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,541
Yeah? She destroyed my jaw.

459
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,833
Do you even have a signature?

460
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,208
Okay, yes.

461
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,041
Hold on.

462
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,333
If she showed those magazines
to everyone--

463
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,250
I didn't know you were famous.

464
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,500
[sighs] I knew it.

465
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,916
[MAN]
Being published in Tokyo,

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,541
I figure that's as fancy pants
