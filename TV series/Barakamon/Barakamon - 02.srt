1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:11,666
[HIROSHI] Not awful,
but not good either.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,750
I studied really hard this time,
so it's not my fault.

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,083
They think
I'm just being lazy.

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,041
The exam is coming up,

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,666
so I don't want to see you
acting like a slacker anymore!

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,125
Gimme another lap!
Don't be such a wimp!

7
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,583
If you're going to sing,

8
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,083
at least try
to put some heart into it!

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Ugh! I'm doing my best!

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,583
It's okay Hiroshi,
just relax!

11
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,208
Uggh!
Don't sneak up on me!

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,750
I don't mind
if you don't get all A's!

13
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,250
When I was your age, I was
pretty lazy in school myself.

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,958
[AKIKO] See?
Your father's an underachiever

15
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,708
and he's done just fine!

16
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,958
[YUJIRO] Maybe mediocrity
just runs in the family, huh?

17
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,750
[PARENTS laughing]

18
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,458
Either say something nice,
or leave!

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,333
Actually, we have a favor
to ask of you. Here.

20
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,625
Take these noodles to Sensei,
would you?

21
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,791
[HIROSHI groans]

22
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,000
You know, maybe you should try

23
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,791
getting your priorities
straight, Mom.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,250
Your son's having a life crisis

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,041
and you're making
dinner for strangers.

26
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,416
Look, if you don't want to
tell him to make his own food,

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,416
then I sure will!

28
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,750
[AKIKO] You don't know anything,
do you, boy?

29
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,958
Would you rob your mother
of the only thing in this world

30
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,416
that gives her life meaning?

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,125
I don't have any children
to nurture

32
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,208
and my husband
is a washed-up mediocrity,

33
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,666
a mundane mockery
of the man I married!

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,666
Sensei is the only one
who can save me

35
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,541
from life's tiresome monotony,

36
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,833
awakening my feelings
as a mother and as a woman

37
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,625
with fire in her heart!

38
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,083
[BOTH groan]

39
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,250
[HANDA, thinking]
It's been a week

40
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
since I came to this island,

41
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,833
but I still can't write anything
that agrees with me.

42
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,833
That was something I did
in the passion of the moment.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,375
It's nothing like my style
at all.

44
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,250
I came here to immerse myself
in calligraphy

45
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,958
and to make that withered
old turd eat his words.

46
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,333
Now focus.

47
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,041
[NARU]
Sensei!

48
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,125
[HANDA]
You again?

49
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,125
Do you have
to come here every single day?

50
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,291
Of course I do.
I'm your commuter wife!

51
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,041
I don't even know
what that means, but it's wrong.

52
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,125
[MIWA]
Hello!

53
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,166
Miwa and Tama came, too!

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,666
Ooh! It's the celebrity!

55
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,750
Are your clothes
a calligrapher thing?

56
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,250
They're pretty neat.

57
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,083
Boy, I sure miss
the secret base.

58
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,166
It's my house, now get out!

59
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,458
Aaaah! The poster's gone!

60
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,166
Where'd the CDs go?

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,291
Hey! What makes you think
you can just waltz in here, huh?

62
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:17,083
You're the one who "waltzed in"!
This used to be our secret base!

63
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,583
What did you do
with all of our stuff?

64
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,375
You better not have
thrown it away!

65
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,791
The junk that was here
when I moved in?

66
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,958
It's in that box over there.

67
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,125
[MIWA] Whew, you really had me
scared for a minute there!

68
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,916
I thought I was gonna
have to hurt you.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,708
Straight to violence, huh?

70
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,208
Am I going to have to teach you

71
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,041
the meaning of the words
"private property"?

72
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
What the--
Hey! No! Take that down!

73
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,291
Sorry, pal,
but we were here first!

74
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,125
That is not how this works!
Not even close!

75
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,000
C'mon, this is a sweet deal!

76
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
Surrounded
by cute young girls.

77
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,291
It's like a dream come true,
ya know?

78
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,125
Don't even go there,
that's not funny!

79
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,375
So you're the ones
that ruined her!

80
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,083
You should know better
than to teach a child

81
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,541
a bunch of dirty slang!

82
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,750
[NARU] I bet that lady's
banking at the cathouse!

83
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm gonna lay down
for some serious pillow talk!

84

This miso soup's makin' me
all hot and heavy!

85

[HANDA]
Be careful what you say!

86
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,875
Well, it's not like
I said it to her.

87
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,208
Yeah!

88
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,208
Kids just overhear stuff,
you know?

89
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,666
Mm-hmm! You didn't teach me
a thing!

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,083
You better
keep your mouth clean.

91
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,250
Kids that age are
just like mynah birds,

92

they'll repeat
anything they hear!

00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,958
I just said that!

Don't try and turn
all this around on me!

No! That's not--

97
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,875
It's for
an exclusive restaurant!

98
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,250
Oh, I get it, so it's
an "Eth and Em Club."

Those are professional tools!

Don't treat them like
some kind of a toy!

write something nice?

Wow, Tama,
you're good at this!

Well, you did wanna be
a manga artist, right?

110
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,500
It only makes sense.

111
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,000
[TAMA] I told you,
that subject is off-limits!

112

[NARU] I think you're
even better than Sensei!

113
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,291
[MIWA] Being a calligrapher
is nothing special after all.

Oh, is that what you think?

116
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,500
This is what calligraphy
looks like!

know why, exactly.

[TAMA]
It's all artsy and stuff.

120

Didn't we have some calligraphy
homework to do over the summer?

121
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,916
Let's have Sensei teach us!

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,041
Nice idea!

00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,208
have a shot at the gold award!

125
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,625
So how 'bout it?
Can we count on you?

Ha! That's what I'm here for!

127

on the desert of my heart,

have a job to do!

This'll keep you still!

00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:13,375
Stupid mom getting obsessed with
some out-of-town fancypants.

160
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,875
Thinks he gets to eat
all our food

161
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,416
just 'cause he can write good.

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,166
Whatever.
This is the last time.

163
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,916
I'm gonna tell him off.

164
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,541
Hey! What's your problem?
Answer the door!

165
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,166
[footsteps]

166
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,791
If you were home, you should've
said something, you dumb--

167
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,583
What's wrong?

168
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,000
[HANDA retching]

169
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,000
[HIROSHI wailing]

170
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,958
Guess who came back to play?

171
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,166
Hiroshi, you monster!

172
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,000
You've broken the only Sensei
we've got!

173
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,416
He was like this already!

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,416
Ooh! What should I do?
What should I do?

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,041
I don't know,
just grab the noodles!

176
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,791
Okay!

177
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,708
People of the Earth,
lend me your energy!

178
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,958
[HIROSHI] I said grab
the noodles, you little gremlin!

179
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,000
Arrrgh!

180
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,500
It didn't spill.
Nice wrap-up job!

181
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,416
[HIROSHI] Yeah. Too bad it looks
like crap now, though.

182
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,875
So what happened?

183
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,125
It looks like he's half-dead
or something.

184
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,458
Oh, he gets like this sometimes,
no biggie.

185
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,083
Something about some writing
contest for all the senseis.

186
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,291
[HIROSHI] So he was pulling
an all-nighter, huh?

187
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,791
I'm like this before
a big test, too.

188
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,416
Of course, I'm not a genius
like he is,

189
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,083
so I'm sure his results
will be a bit better.

190
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,125
A genius?
So like, he's smart?

191
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,583
More like he was born
with talent,

192
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,958
whereas people like me
have to work hard

193
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,500
and still can't do anything.

194
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,916
Like how you study all the time
and your grades still stink?

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,416
They don't stink,
they're just not that great!

196
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,041
Waaaah!

197
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,583
I'm gonna try real hard
and be a genius, too!

198
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,541
Did you hear a word I said?

199
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,250
And I know my talent, too!

200
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,708
Naru! Where the heck
do you think you're going?

201
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,916
I hid my secret over here.
I'll show you!

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,791
Hey, hey! I really don't think
you're supposed to go in here.

203
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,125
What is this room?

204
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,333
Here, lemme grab
something out of that box.

205
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,541
I'll show you!

206
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,541
[HIROSHI]
Whoa, wait!

207
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,375
And know what Sensei said?

208
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,375
He said he doesn't have
any talent, just like you.

209
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,750
So he writes
and writes all day,

210
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,500
'cause that's the only way

211
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,083
he thinks
he can ever get better.

212
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,541
I don't get
this whole talent thing.

213
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,500
I think Sensei is
great just like he is.

214
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,500
[HIROSHI, thinking] That should
be enough studying for anybody!

215
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,416
[STUDENT]
You bleached your hair?

216
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,541
Yeah, I'm turning things around,
time for a new me.

217
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,625
[STUDENT] It's gonna take
a lot more than a dye job, man.

218
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,166
That's why I can't make
a change.

219
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,375
Everything I do
is so half-assed.

220
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,833
[NARU]
Hiroshi?

221
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,791
You know, I think
Sensei is wrong.

222
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,208
He does have talent.

223
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,583
Wow. You can look and tell,
just like magic?

224
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,583
Well, no.
I mean, that's not how it works.

225
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,583
So do you know
if he has talent or not?

226
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:19,708
I guess his hard work
is like a talent in itself.

227
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,166
Hiroshi, are you crying?

228
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,625
I had something in my eye.

229
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,416
Grownups shouldn't cry, Hiroshi,
and they shouldn't lie, either!

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,125
[HIROSHI] Shut up!
Don't look at me!

231
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:35,000
Ewww! Aaaah!
What is that?

232
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,291
[chuckles]

233
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,833
Ta-da!
They're cicada shells!

234
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,166
Yeah, but what for?

235
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,541
This is my talent!

236
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,250
When it comes
to collecting these,

237
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,083
there's nobody
that can beat me!

238
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,125
That makes me a genius!

239
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,708
I guess.

240
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,541
Probably not the smartest
use of time, but yeah,

241
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,833
you could call that a talent.

242
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,083
You must be
the village leader's son.

243
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,541
I really appreciate
you guys feeding me.

244
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,041
[HIROSHI]
Yeah, about that.

245
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,041
After today, we're not cooking
for you again.

246
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,916
My mom doesn't say it,
but this is a big pain for her.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,166
[HANDA]
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

248
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,000
And one other thing.

249
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,416
It's kind of awkward
saying this,

250
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,625
but you really inspired me
today.

251
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,375
I saw how hard you work,
and it made me realize

252
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,583
that I can push myself
a lot harder in school.

253
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,083
No more potato stew.

254
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,708
It's gonna be tough, but I'll
learn to cope, I guess.

255
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,000
Huh?

256
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,041
Okay, fine.
Don't listen.

257
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,500
You know, I can make
potato stew.

258
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,083
I'll bring you some tomorrow.

259
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,791
Oh, no, that's not
what I was trying to--

260
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,333
The noodles were a mess, so I'd
rather end on a high note.

261
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,333
Bye.

262
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,625
[door opens, closes]

263
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,875
I'll just have to cook
for myself now, huh?

264
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,583
Wow! You know how to cook?
Sensei, that's cool!

265
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,375
[HANDA, sighing]
I can make curry at least.

266
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,041
[NARU]
Yay!

267
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,416
Sensei! I came back to play!

268
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,625
Aaaah!

269
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,458
Call an ambulance!

270
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,041
It's a Sensei-mergency!

272

[WOMAN] Heatstroke, dehydration,
sleep deprivation, malnutrition.

273
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,708
Yeah, we'd better keep you here
for tonight.

274
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,250
Okay.

275
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,708
My, Sensei, if you
weren't feeling well,

276
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,458
you should've said something
to us!

277
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,875
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,041
I was just too exhausted
to think straight.

279
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,500
[NARU] You're not going to die,
are you, Sensei?

280
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,166
Nah. I'm taking drips now,
so I should be fine.

281
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
Does it hurt more
than a bug bite?

282
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,083
Well, depends on the bug.

283
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,625
You just sit tight.

284
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,125
We'll head to your house
and pick up

285
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,750
a few essentials for you.

286
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,750
Oh. Thank you.

287
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,750
[AKIKO] If you need anything
else, feel free to ask Ikue.

288
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,541
I know she's young and cute,
but she already has a husband.

289
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,750
So don't be naughty, okay?

290
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,416
[HANDA]
With her? Never.

291
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,083
Oh, goodness.

292
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,333
I'm afraid that some painful
injections may be in order.

293
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,375
[HANDA gasps]

294
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,458
[HANDA, thinking]
Really outdid myself this time.

295
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,541
Gotta learn to keep
my stress down.

296
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,833
Get better and get back
to work!

297
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,625
Come on.

298
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,875
I know the hospital's a blast
and all, but could you go home?

299
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,583
[NARU]
Vroom, vroom!

300
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,500
Park the car and listen
to me for a second!

301
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,500
[TAMA] Oh, look.
This is the room.

302
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,000
You're still alive!
That's nice!

303
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,250
Feeling okay?

304
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,333
--[TAMA] Nothing terminal?
--[NARU] Hi!

305
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:44,458
You didn't need to come
all the way just to check on me.

306
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,791
[MIWA] Eh, we have
a summer course today.

307
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,791
And the hospital's
close to the school.

308
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,208
I see.
You're just skipping class.

309
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,666
Don't sweat the details.

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,333
Aaaaah!

311
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,291
Sensei, look!
The drip is almost empty!

312
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,166
[HANDA]
Oh no! I mean, they gotta have

313
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,916
some kind of computer to tell
them when to fill it, right?

How do I press her button?

317
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,833
Which button?
The button on her shirt?

318

There's a bunch of them,
and what good is that gonna do?

Wait, did she leave
her button in here?

No, thank you!

00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
I was so embarrassed

Okay, too much information.

Grandpa told me to watch out,

'cause there's ghosts
in the hospital halls.

Ugh, it's not that I believe
in ghosts or anything,

but this hospital is really old

00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:28,375
What happened to your fingers?

471
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,458
Wh-what about my fingers?
There's nothing strange here.

472
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:35,208
Sensei, what should I do with
these bloody onions you chopped?

473
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
--Think they're okay to eat?
--[HIROSHI groans]

474
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,875
That's not blood,
it's hot sauce and ketchup.

475
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,291
Red stuff.
Gonna be really tasty onions.

476
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,041
[HIROSHI, thinking]
I get it now, Mom.

477
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,625
Some people just need
special attention.

478
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,708
[HIROSHI, aloud]
So, forget what I said.

479
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,333
We'll bring you food after all.

480
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,833
[HANDA]
Huh? Really?

481
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,875
[NARU]
No more bleeding, Sensei!
