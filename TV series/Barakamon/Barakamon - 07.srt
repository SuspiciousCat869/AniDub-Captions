1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:17,000
[NARU] Gonna catch
some fish! [shouts]

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,875
--Ya-hoo!
--I ain't satisfied, Handa.

3
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,708
Hmm? What do you mean by that?

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,208
I took five vacation days

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,333
to drag my sorry ass
out to this place.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,833
I spent half of that time trying
to find your damn house,

7
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,666
and the rest of it
with a hangover,

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,125
thanks to some weird old men
I've never even met before.

9
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,166
[sighs]
I wanna get my time back.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,083
Good luck with that.

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,666
We're fishing so you can have
fun on your last day here.

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,083
Now stop complaining.

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,000
Fishing's a chore, little girl.

14
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,458
When someone goes on a trip,
they like to see the sights,

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,541
not sit around on their butts.
Follow?

16
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,041
Sorry our podunk town
isn't exciting enough,

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,291
but take it or leave it.

18
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,000
This trip sucks for me, too.

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,041
I finally get a chance to see
Sensei's work up close,

20
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,833
and everyone would rather cook
in the sun?

21
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,416
Even on a trip,
he's the indoor type.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,875
[groans]

23
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,291
What's wrong, Hiro?
You look kind of beat.

24
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,833
Your little fan talked about
calligraphy all night long.

25
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,958
I started writing when I was
in elementary school...

26
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,833
Why did he think I would care?

27
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:16,250
Can't we go back
to Sensei's house?

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,541
[MIWA]
Okay, here's our fishing gear.

29
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,416
And what exactly are
we fishing for?

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
[MIWA] Horse mackerel.

31
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,000
Guess there's more to fishing
than just putting on the bait.

32
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,958
Wow, this thing is so neat.

33
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:28,750
Huh? You've never
gone fishing before?

34
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,083
--It's all bendy.
--Nuh-unh.

35
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,500
How 'bout you, Kawa?

36
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,291
Don't lump me in
with those city boys.

37
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,875
I'm a champion in my own right.

38
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,875
I'll nail that bass.

39
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,583
Bass know-how won't help you
catch a mackerel.

40
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,125
A champion never quits.

41
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,250
Well, you might be here
a long time, then.

42
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,333
--[KANZAKI shouting]
--Hmm?

43
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,458
No. Get it off of me!

44
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,666
Hey, Naru?
Put some bait in here.

45
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,291
I don't want to touch it.

46
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,625
Okay.

47
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,250
Wait a sec.

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,541
Why does the line already
have some bait on it?

49
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,041
Is this stuff fake?

50
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,125
[all chattering]

51
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,208
Where's the float
or the sinker?

52
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,458
[MIWA]
If you don't shut your mouth,

53
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,625
I'll slap it off your face.

54
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,041
"Bring the city folks fishing,"
they said.

55
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,791
"It'll be fun," they said.

56
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,916
Well, I'm gonna go fish up here.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,625
--Good luck, Miwa.
--What?

58
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,875
You're ditching me?

59
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,750
I'm a man of the sea.

60
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,458
Mackerel are nothing
but small fry.

61
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,916
I want a hisanio.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,125
A hisanio.

63
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,458
[ALL]
A what now?

64
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,000
[NARU and HINA] Hisanio!
Hisanio!

65
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,750
[MIWA] Whoa, give it your
best out there, pal.

66
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,375
I know you've got it in you.

67
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,250
--The hell's a "hisanio?"
--I don't know.

68
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,541
Sounds like the name
of some foreign guy.

69
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
[HISANIO clears throat]

70
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:28,208
First off, you have to
toss out some bait. Thank you.

71
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,833
Then you drop the line right
in front,

72
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,375
where you just spread
all your bait.

73
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,958
When the tip of the rod bobs
like this, voila.

74
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,916
Oh, wow, that is awesome.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,166
Granny said they'd be biting
for sure today.

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,708
--Let's go.
--Hey, wait for me.

77
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,375
We're gonna feast.

78
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,000
Whoa!
I think I got one already.

79
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,250
Bring it up, hurry.

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,750
[laughs]
I nabbed two in one shot.

81
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,916
Man, that was easy.

82
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,541
--Naru.
--Okay.

83
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,708
Somehow that wasn't a disaster.

84
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,666
Two is okay,
but three is better.

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,458
Next time I'll get four.

86
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,750
I got something too.
Jeez, it's gotta be a big one.

87
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,625
It's putting up one heck
of a fight.

88
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,208
I'm not just
a calligraphy genius.

89
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,166
I'm a genius at fishing, too.

90
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,125
Behold, commoners. This is what
true talent looks like.

91
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:18,291
It's just stuck.

92
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,833
Huh?

93
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,291
[MIWA] Ah.

94
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,625
It's like you caught
the Earth itself. Talent indeed.

95
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,291
Hey, there's wharf roaches.

96
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,333
Yikes!
Sure are a bunch of 'em.

97
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,250
[grunting]

98
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,208
Gotcha!

99
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,500
Hina, gimme your hand.

100
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,916
--Unh-unh.
--It's okay.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,541
No!

102
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,208
What's wrong?
It's not gonna hurt you.

103
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,291
No, you liar, they bite.
Ugh!

104
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,125
[grunting]

105
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,541
I wanna go home. It's hot.

106
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,625
It smells bad,
and I can't catch anything.

107
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,958
We're catching too many fish
to go back now.

108
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,791
--Why don't you just sit down?
--I don't wanna sit down.

109
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,250
I wanna write calligraphy
with you.

110
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,916
Hey, stop, no shaking.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
[KANZAKI] You don't like
outdoorsy stuff either, do you?

112
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,416
Come on,
this is a rare opportunity.

113
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,625
No way am I ever gonna write
calligraphy with you around.

114
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,791
Why would you say such
an awful thing?

115
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,375
'Cause you'd probably just
tell me I lost my touch again.

116
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,458
Kosuke,

117
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,666
did you really say that to him?

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,833
Maybe.

119
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,958
It is true, you know?

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,250
[sighs]

121
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,083
Just 'cause you're close-minded,

122
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,333
doesn't mean you get to force
that on other artists.

123
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,541
That kind of thinking is
what's got you in a slump.

124
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,416
Did you say "slump?"

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,291
Wait, you mean,
he's not writing?

126
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,083
When he saw your last piece,
he got depressed.

127
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,916
You haven't lost your touch,
Handa.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,750
Winning second place one time
isn't that big of a deal.

129
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,833
Kosuke's been super focused
on your calligraphy

130
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,833
since he started his career.

131
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,333
When you changed your style
with the last piece,

132
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,083
he lost his point of reference
and started to panic.

133
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,791
I'll put this in perspective.

134
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,625
Take a look at those kids
for example.

135
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,791
Hold on. What?

136
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,000
You see how
they're mimicking her?

137
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,500
Handa, have you ever looked
at Kosuke's calligraphy before?

138
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,083
Hell, no.
Why would I ever do that?

139
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,416
Figured as much.

140
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,083
The work he does looks
almost exactly like yours.

141
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,833
And yours looks the same
as your dad's.

142
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,041
That's because both of you are
true to the fundamentals.

143
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,708
The fundamentals
got me first place,

144
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,416
so I don't see what's wrong
with that.

145
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,125
Get to the point. Are you trying
to diss us here or what?

146
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,583
Young artists of today,
heed my words.

147
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,875
You must not fear failure,
but rather,

148
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,583
seek new frontiers in art.

149
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,208
[BOTH] Director.

150
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,500
Instead of setting records,
be remembered.

151
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,791
Instead of being number one,
aim to be the only one.

152
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,125
Forget the awards,
strive to make works that sell.

153
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,958
Hey, that last one there
doesn't quite fit.

154
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,541
But I want money.

155
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,166
This is getting scary.

156
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,708
Sensei.
Look at what Miwa taught me.

157
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,583
You wanna use it?

158
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,000
Wow.
You tied that all by yourself?

159
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,666
--Sensei, use mine. Use mine.
--Oh, you made one too?

160
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,250
Yeah, but mine's
super ultra cool.

161
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,958
Now you can catch 'em all.

162
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,541
[laughs]
You can't fish with that thing.

163
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,541
This one of those
new frontiers of yours?

164
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,958
I can't see.

165
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,875
[KANZAKI] It's just perfect
in how completely awful it is.

166
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,333
[HANDA] Come on, don't laugh
so much. She's just a kid.

167
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,208
[KANZAKI]
It's like this modern tragedy.

168
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,375
[screaming]

169
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,041
You little gremlin!

170
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,833
[screaming]

171
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,708
That's all for now.

172
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,916
But there's plenty more where
that came from, city boys.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,666
[HIROSHI] Looks like they're
having fun down there.

174
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,083
Hey, Hiro.
You got any more bait?

175
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,916
Why? You out already?

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,583
Hina freaked and spilled ours.

177
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,000
Are Sensei and his buddies
even fishing at all?

178
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,833
[MIWA] They've mostly just been
talking about calligraphy.

179
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:02,250
Losing your touch or whatever,
but if you're good, you're good.

180
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,041
Isn't that all there is to it?

181
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,583
If all it took was practice,
anyone could be a master.

182
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,458
I'm probably not gonna catch
that hisanio after all.

183
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,041
Not much point in trying
this close to land.

184
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,666
I don't know. The head teacher
said that he saw someone

185
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,291
catch one around here.

186
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,041
'Sup, Hiroshi?
Got that hisanio yet?

187
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,875
Trust me, I would've said so.

188
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,000
You guys ready to leave?

189
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,208
Try this. Then you'll catch one.

190
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,666
Wow. That is one
hardcore looking lure.

191
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,375
[laughs] Sorry.

192
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,500
Why not? It's my last cast,
might as well try it, right?

193
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,958
Make sure you say "Ebisu"
when you do it.

194
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,125
I know, I know.

195
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,041
You say "Ebisu"? Why?

196
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,875
For good luck.
When you cast the line,

197
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,000
if you call upon the name of
Ebisu, you'll catch a hisanio.

198
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,500
[HANDA] Oh. You mean
the God of Good Fortune.

199
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,750
[MIWA]
Yeah, you know,

200
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,000
'cause Ebisu carries
a hisanio with him.

201
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,875
[ALL]
So that's what a hisanio is.

202
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,333
What I'm trying to catch here
is a striped beakfish.

203
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,666
You're supposed to fish for
those offshore, aren't you?

204
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,666
If it was this easy to nab one,
any idiot could be a fisherman.

205
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,291
Wow, so helpful.

206
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,250
But, man, if we caught one,
we could have sashimi

207
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,666
for dinner, couldn't we?

208
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,250
--[ALL] Ebisu!
--Now you're serious.

209
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,500
Of course I am. I haven't
had a single good thing

210
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,208
to eat the whole time
I've been here.

211
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,791
It's not biting.

212
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,375
Guess not.

213
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,916
We are fishing with that
messed up super lure.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,458
You do know that, right?

215
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,000
Time to throw in the towel.

216
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,541
Aww.

217
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,208
I'm gonna clean up.

218
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,291
--Can you hold this for me?
--Huh? You sure about that?

219
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,125
This might finally be your
chance to catch something.

220
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,416
Are you making fun of me?

221
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,500
Whatever.

222
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,333
[gasps]

223
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,583
Whoa! Hey, I got one!

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,583
No way. Miwa, the net.

225
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,083
--Right. I'm on it.
--Come on, let's help him.

226
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,083
Cut it out, you two,
you're in the way!

227
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,708
Yeah, right, there's no way you
can reel in the big one alone.

228
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,541
Don't give me that crap.
I'm perfectly fine on my own.

229
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,166
You just wanna take all
the credit, don't you?

230
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,375
[chanting] Ebisu! Ebisu!

231
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,041
[KANZAKI] Would you shut up?

232
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,583
[HANDA] Now!

233
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,666
[ALL] Yeah!

234
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,000
[ALL] It's huge!

235
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,041
[ALL] Oh.

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,875
[ALL laughing]

237
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,666
[HIROSHI] Did you see
that thing? It was huge.

238
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,625
[MIWA] Then it was like,
"So long, suckers."

239
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,666
[ALL laughing, chattering]

240
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,583
[MIWA] Then the whole
thing just exploded.

241
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,375
Let's go home.

242
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,708
Well, we did catch a lot
of mackerel, so no biggie.

243
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,250
Let's deep fry 'em all.

244
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,416
[MIWA] I heard pickling them
is good, too.

245
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,333
Sensei, is something up?

246
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,416
It's strange, but ever
since I came to this island,

247
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,166
I started getting these powerful
urges to do calligraphy pieces.

248
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,666
Something rises up inside me.

249
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,458
My hands start to shake.

250
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,958
That's not strange.
I feel the same way, too.

251
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,875
These are the ones
that Sensei caught.

252
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,250
Ahem. Uh...

253
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,833
Today, I'd like to celebrate
our arrival here.

254
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,041
[ALL] And cheers!

255
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,416
Let me finish.

256
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,708
I'd rather eat, thank you. Huh?

257
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,583
Wait, did you just dip
those fish in ink?

258
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,916
It's a new frontier in art,
not cuisine.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,125
It would've been better if
it was a hisanio, though.

260
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,583
You can use fish
or whatever else you like.

261
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,333
As long as it makes me rich,
I don't care.

262
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,416
Why don't you tell us something
we don't know?

263
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,916
Glad to see that we're nothing

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,958
but products in your eyes,
Kawafuji.

265
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,083
What's this stuff about
new frontiers?

266
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't know.

267
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,791
Hmm?

268
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,875
--The other room.
--Huh?

269
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,791
Ahhh!

270
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,375
Snooping around again, are you?

271
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,375
Let me see.

272
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,208
I love it.

273
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,291
I mean, your stuff
is always awesome,

274
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,583
but this is the best, for sure.

275
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:54,125
You've really outdone yourself.

276
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,916
[WOMAN over PA]
Attention, Fukuoka Fight 635

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,583
will begin boarding at 10:20...

278
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,541
It's okay.
You can go home now.

279
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,500
You don't need to see us off.

280
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,333
I do appreciate the thought, but
it's only a three-hour flight.

281
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,375
I mean, I'm flattered that
you're so sad to see us go,

282
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,291
but we'll be fine on our own
from here.

283
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,000
Kawafuji, look at this.

284
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,750
I really like the way they
did the logo on this one.

285
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,333
I wonder if I could design
something like that.

286
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,083
TV rocks are the ultimate
souvenir.

287
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
--This is why you came here?
--Huh? What're those?

288
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,708
It's their own airport.

289
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,708
Why are they so excited
to be here?

290
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,708
You've got a minute
before your plane takes off.

291
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,208
How about you pick up some
souvenirs to take back with you?

292
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,583
Yeah? Might do that.

293
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,583
Thanks for driving us here,
by the way.

294
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,500
Oh, no, it was my pleasure.

295
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,416
Any friend of Sensei's is
a friend of this island.

296
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,125
I think the kids here get bored
seeing the same people

297
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,000
day in and day out.

298
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,333
Seems like they had a lot of fun
playing with you city folk.

299
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,208
Check it out.
See? It's like magic.

300
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,000
[NARU] Look over here.
They've got toys, too.

301
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,541
The airport is like heaven.

302
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,541
[HINA] Nuh-unh.
It's like Santa's house.

303
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,666
You wanna take one back
with you?

304
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,875
I'll pass. I like my sanity.

305
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,916
Let's see, anything this
island's famous for?

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,916
Yeah, I guess.
Sweet potato mochi,

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,291
camellia candy, oval squid,
sea urchin.

308
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
Goto udon. Goto beef.

309
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,208
There's no way I can bring
that much stuff with me.

310
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,083
Is there something besides food,
maybe?

311
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,125
We have some cell phone straps,
how's that?

312
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,041
They're portable, at least.

313
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,833
He sure isn't cute, huh?
His name's Baramon.

314
