1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,708
Sensei!
I'm here to play!

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,125
It's locked?

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,083
Sensei!

4
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,833
Huh?

5
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:34,375
He's gone.

6
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,250
[car horns honking]

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,083
[phone ringing]

8
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,791
[door opens]

9
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,208
Hmm?

10
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,333
Hey, you're early.

11
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,791
You got the piece
I sent you, right?

12
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,875
Yeah a while back,
got it right here.

13
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,541
It really catches your eye,
thanks to how big it is.

14
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,708
Yeah.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,875
Wait, are you saying it wouldn't
look good if it was small?

16
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,291
Would you chill?

17
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,791
Kawafuji's an art dealer,
not an artist.

18
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,708
He's just praising its size

19
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,833
because it'll grab people's
attention and sell faster,

20
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,541
not because that's the only
thing praiseworthy about it.

21
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,875
[KAWAFUJI] He's been back five
seconds and this already?

22
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,625
Pull it together,
will you?

23
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,416
The Director will be here
any minute now.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,416
[screams]

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,375
Could you possibly

26
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,250
get me
a glass of water, please?

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,250
You're not sick, are you?
What's that face?

28
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,666
[HANDA sighs]

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,541
What am I even supposed
to say to him, you know?

30
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,041
What do you mean "what"?
Just apologize.

31
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,500
You came back here
'cause he said

32
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,291
he would forgive you, right?

33
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,708
If you're sorry, then tell him
how you feel and that's it.

34
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,791
I did buy these things.

35
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,041
They're souvenir
cell phone straps.

36
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,375
What, do you think he's a high
school girl or something?

37
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,833
Man, and it's ugly, too.

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,333
If you keep drinking like this
you are so gonna pee your pants.

39
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,416
What am I gonna do if the
Director doesn't like my piece?

40
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,916
I mean, the exhibit
hasn't even started yet,

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,625
and I'll already be done for.

42
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,291
You know any good holes
to die in?

43
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,416
I doubt he'll have
anything bad to say.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Besides, you sent this over

45
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,916
'cause you're confident
in it, right?

46
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,541
Can you tell me what
you think of it? Be honest.

47
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,958
Would you have known
it was something I wrote?

48
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,416
Hmm...

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,541
I honestly wasn't thinking
of it that way.

50
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,875
Frankly, I'm not exactly sure
how to answer that.

51
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,500
But the piece is bold
and it draws your attention.

52
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,250
I think it's good.

53
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,083
I guess
I wouldn't have expected this

54
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,541
from your previous style,
though.

55
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,250
--That's the problem!
--Uh-huh?

56
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,458
I don't write this kind of
calligraphy, it's too good!

57
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,125
Don't you see?

58
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,000
What you're saying
is crazy, even for you.

59
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,750
How can I word this?

60
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,416
It just doesn't feel right!

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,416
It's almost--
[speed talking]

62
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,083
So what you're saying is,
it was just a fluke.

63
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,250
Uh, it's a little more
complicated than that!

64
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,583
But you're right.

65
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,125
I used Mother Nature
as inspiration,

66
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,666
but I feel like
she deserves all the credit

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,125
and anyone
could've done what I did.

68
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,041
Even if that were true,
it's still your work.

69
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,250
Say it was an experiment,
and get back to something

70
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
you're more comfortable
with next time around.

71
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,541
Can't question yourself
for trying a new style.

72
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,375
It's just one piece.

73
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,958
If all I do is stay comfortable,
I'll never find my own style.

74
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,375
[sighs]

75
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,875
A farmer can go fishing
and get lucky,

76
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,250
but even if he catches
a hisanio on his first try,

77
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,750
that doesn't make him
a fisherman!

78
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,666
I want to find a special seed
and care for it

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,333
until it grows into a flower
that only I can grow

80
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,666
and no one's ever seen before!

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,500
Gah! I don't care
about being number one.

82
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,083
I want to be the only one!

83
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,208
Wait, seriously?

84
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,958
'Cause I know you
and you'll throw a fit

85
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,208
if you're second place.

86
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,625
[DIRECTOR laughs]

87
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,583
"One lucky catch doesn't make
a farmer into a fisherman."

88
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,375
That's
a clever perspective, Handa.

89
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,625
I like it.

90
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,125
--[HANDA screams]
--Oh, Director.

91
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,625
--[door closes]
--No matter the profession,

92
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,958
every artist must pay their dues
before they become a master.

93
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,208
I'm sorry I didn't greet you
at the door.

94
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:45,166
No. I just came
to say hello to Handa.

95
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,458
There's no need
to be formal.

96
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,291
So? Have you been well
in your absence?

97
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,250
Yes, sir!
Very well, sir!

98
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,541
[DIRECTOR] It's fine.
You don't have to be nervous.

99
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,875
You certainly spoke
your mind to me before.

100
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,000
That's only because I wasn't
using my head before, sir!

101
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,583
[HANDA thinking]
Would you calm the hell down?

102
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,291
You're here to ask
for forgiveness.

103
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,666
Don't blow it!

104
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,625
A cane?

105
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,500
I didn't know the Director
had a bad back.

106
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,833
Oh, thank you, Handa.

107
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,291
Of course.

108
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,541
[HANDA thinking] It doesn't
matter how angry I was.

109
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,416
How could I have punched
a man like this?

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,916
I'm the scum of the earth.

111
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,250
[HANDA]
I'm truly sorry.

112
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,750
From the bottom of my heart.

113
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,750
I should have apologized sooner.

114
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,875
There's no excuse for my violent
behavior and there's no excuse

115
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,333
for only coming here after
I was told you'd forgive me.

116
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,041
There's nothing
I can say for myself.

117
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,875
I'm deeply sorry.

118
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,625
Director, he--

119
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:04,875
In all honesty,
I didn't plan on forgiving you.

120
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,333
I just wanted
to drag you back here.

121
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,625
If you were so intent
on running and hiding,

122
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,083
I would have
to put you in your place.

123
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,958
[DIRECTOR] But it seems
that isn't necessary.

124
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,833
Now, with that said.

125
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,250
So long as you can keep
that temper of yours in check,

126
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,125
I forgive you.

127
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,833
--[HANDA groans]
--[DIRECTOR] Hm?

128
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,166
--Hey...
--Just give me a minute.

129
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,458
I don't know what I would've
done if you didn't forgive me.

130
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,500
I can move on.

131
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,208
Thank you so much.

132
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,500
[chuckles]

133
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,083
Good for you, little buddy,

134
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,875
now why don't you give him
the cell phone strap?

135
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,208
That is not even remotely
appropriate at this moment.

136
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,083
One other thing,
while I'm here...

137
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,708
--Yes, sir!
--I'd like to take

138
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,791
a closer look
at your latest piece.

139
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,500
Would you mind lending me
a hand, please?

140
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,083
Uh, of course!

141
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,708
So then this is the new face
of your calligraphy, is it?

142
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,833
-Yes.
-Hmm.

143
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,583
This particular piece is,
not really-- Uhh.

144
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,291
Handa...

145
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,333
Ah!

146
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,958
This work of yours...

00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,458
--I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
--[DIRECTOR] How unfortunate.

151
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,375
I see you're
as impulsive as ever.

152
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,166
[KAWAFUJI thinking]
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

153
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,250
Don't laugh.

154
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,875
This piece is just a trial!

155
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,666
Something I wrote
as an experiment!

156
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,375
My, uh, actual entry
is still back on the island.

157
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,791
I didn't bring it with me.

158
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,583
--I see.
--[KAWAFUJI laughing]

159
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,625
I suppose
it was selfish of me to expect

160
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,875
to see your work so close
to the exhibit's premiere.

161
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,791
No!
It's not your fault.

162
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,416
I'm just sorry you had to look
at this garbage, that's all!

163
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,083
Hey. Handa.

164
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,916
Understood.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,708
Then strictly evaluating it
as an experiment,

166
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,333
allow me to say a few things.

167
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,708
Frankly, I've never seen
anything like this before.

168
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,333
It's very interesting.
Very exciting.

169
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,208
The concept seems childlike

170
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,125
at first,
and yet I can almost see

171
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,833
the night sky
splashed across the canvas.

172
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,625
The stars feel like a light

173
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,708
that can only be seen
from the darkness,

174
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,541
as if they were painted
from a very lonely place.

175
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,083
I'm not this exhibition's
only judge, but personally,

176
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,541
I think this is worthy
of a grand prize.

177
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,958
[gasps]

178
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,958
Thank you very much, sir!

179
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,875
You've certainly got
my hopes up now!

180
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,541
If this is just a trial,
I'll be thrilled

181
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,916
to see what
you've cooked up for Narukain.

182
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,166
--[KAWAFUJI laughing]
--This has turned into

183
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,041
a surprisingly
delightful day.

184
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,000
Well,
I'll see you again soon.

185
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,791
Oh, just a second, sir,
I'll call a taxi for you.

186
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,083
[door opens, closes]

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,833
Just kill me already.

188
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,625
[KAWAFUJI]
You're waiting outside?

189
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,916
Yes.
I don't need a taxi.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,083
--My ride is already here.
--Oh.

191
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,208
[KAWAFUJI]
All right, then.

192
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,916
Thank you for stopping by!

193
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,250
[car engine starts]

194
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,875
[KAWAFUJI]
Someone drove him here?

195
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,166
Wait.

196
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,375
I know that car.

197
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm quite pleased.
It seems that sending Seishu

198
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,458
to the island was
the right choice after all.

199
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,166
[SEIMEI] He still has
a lot of growing left to do.

200
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,958
--[engine stalls]
--[DIRECTOR] What happened?

201
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,791
[SEIMEI]
I'm sorry, the engine stalled.

202
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,333
I'm bad with a stick shift

203
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,958
and the incline
is giving me trouble.

204
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,625
[DIRECTOR sighs]

205
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,833
Seishu's like me.

206
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,125
We're both quite awkward.

207
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,291
--[engine starts, stalls]
--[DIRECTOR] Stop!

208
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,375
Stop, you're scaring me!

209
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,791
Get this!

210
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,833
Your dad was waiting outside
the whole time!

211
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,583
What the hell?

212
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,958
[HANDA]
Send me back to the island.

213
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,291
[KAWAFUJI]
Uh, hello!

214
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,750
Oh, it's Kawafuji.
I haven't seen you in ages!

215
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,666
Handa, I'm coming in.

216
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,625
[groaning]
You're late.

217
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,000
Nope.

218
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,250
Come back, Kawafujiiii!

219
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,125
[KAWAFUJI]
Let me guess.

220
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,541
You weren't able to bust out
another masterpiece.

221
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,583
--Nope.
--I'm almost afraid to ask,

222
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,458
but did you give yourself
a Naru ponytail for inspiration?

223
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,000
Uh-huh.

224
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,416
It was not as effective
as I'd hoped it would be.

225
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,541
The deadline for
the exhibit is tomorrow.

226
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,083
You might want to use
your time more wisely.

227
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,125
If you want to help, then
tell me something I don't know.

228
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,916
On a positive note,
I did make

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,375
another "stars" piece,
like before.

230
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah? You did?

231
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,333
Then stop acting like a weirdo
and show me already!

232
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,708
If the Director's right,

233
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,000
you might be sitting
on a grand prize!

234
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,208
You're sure you didn't
make this back in grade school?

235
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,083
I knew you'd say that!

236
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,750
[crying]

237
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,291
I tried and tried
but I can't write like before!

238
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,500
Even when I look at the stars,
it doesn't work,

239
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,958
'cause the city lights
ruin the mood!

240
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,125
I can't do it!
I can't! I can't!

241
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,375
It's kinda hard to believe
the same person made this.

242
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,958
I'm just sensitive, okay?

243
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,791
I'm influenced
by my environment.

244
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,958
Inspiration
isn't easy to come by.

245
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,875
Well, now you're back home.

246
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,500
You've made plenty
of winning entries

247
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,958
in this exact environment
before, right?

248
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,708
It doesn't have
to be something fancy.

249
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,333
Just do what you always do.
It'll be fine.

250
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,833
Easy for you to say!

251
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,500
If I could just crap out
a masterpiece,

252
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,125
I wouldn't have
called someone like you!

253
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,375
Then who would you call?

254
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,833
I'm the only friend you've got.

255
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,625
I give up,
there's nothing I can do.

256
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,375
Wait!

257
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,375
I know exactly
how you can help me.

258
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,958
[KAWAFUJI]
Huh? Uh... Huh?

259
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,958
[HANDA laughing maniacally]

260
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,625
[KAWAFUJI screams]

261
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,541
Sei, I brought some tea
for you and your friends!

262
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,875
[KANZAKI] I'm failing to see
the logic here.

263
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,250
If you don't shut your mouth,

264
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,458
I'm gonna have to gag you!

265
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,166
I forgot,
who am I supposed to be?

266
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,625
Do I have to be a kid?

267
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,083
Can't I be
someone cool instead?

268
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,333
Just follow my orders, damn it!

269
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,958
You're not
the one who talks, okay?

270
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,125
You only get to cry!

271
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,166
He's into bondage?!

272
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,541
Oh, you must be
Sensei's mother!

273
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,833
--Thanks for having us!
--Ah! Mom!

274
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,541
Sei, sweetie,

275
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,625
what are you doing over there
with your friends?

276
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,416
This is not what it looks like,
it's for my work!

277
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,291
Sensei needed us to role play
as little girls for him!

278
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,541
He said nothing else
would do the trick!

279
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,416
[HANDA'S MOTHER]
He was such a good child, too.

280
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,708
Maybe a little grumpy wumpy
here and there,

281
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,208
but in his heart,
he was a real sweetie pie.

282
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,916
But now he's just
some pervy bad boy!

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,333
My cutie patootie is dead!

284
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:25,041
Dead! And it's all
that awful island's fault!

285
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,833
[crying]

286
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,083
[HANDA]
Mom, wait!

287
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,333
Aw, jeez.

288
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,708
Are you all right?

289
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,458
No, this is terrible,

290
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,958
but all the insanity
is reminding me of the island.

291
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,125
Just 'cause you made
one good piece on the island

292
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,333
doesn't mean everything
it touches turns to gold.

293
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:44,208
I mean, unless you just
wanna tie me up that badly.

294
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,416
[HANDA] No thank you,
and get out of my bed!

295
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,958
This island calligraphy thing
is unsustainable.

296
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,958
Just move back to Tokyo already
and do what you do best.

297
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,583
[HANDA] Stop searching
under my mattress!

298
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,750
A dirty book!
Ha! I knew it!

299
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,333
--Hey!
--For real?

300
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,125
[HANDA]
My precious!

301
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,375
[sighs] I don't feel like
submitting a piece

302
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,416
if Sensei
isn't gonna do it too.

303
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,958
Not like the prize money's
that great in the first place,

304
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,583
and what do I care if some old
fogeys like my work anyway?

305
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,041
Maybe I should just make

306
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,916
a bunch of new pieces
and do my own show.

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,083
You do what you want,
but I'm staking

308
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,541
my entire career
on this exhibit.

309
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,916
Professionally, maybe
it's not that big of a deal.

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,583
But as an artist,
if I want to be reborn,

311
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
then this is my first step.

312
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,041
I have to take it.

313
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,666
That is so cool.

314
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,041
Damn it,
are you recording me?

315
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,291
My famous quotes,

00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,041
Catch you later, Miwa.

474
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,916
Gotta run
to the bathroom real fast.

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,708
[groaning]

476
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,500
[MIWA]
Is Tama better than me?

477
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:45,083
[TAMA] C'mon, Miwa, cheer up.
It's not a big deal.

478
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,750
[MIWA] I can never show my face
to Sensei again. It's over.

479
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,208
[TAMA]
The silver award is nothing

480
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,875
to be ashamed of!
It's second place!

481
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:55,041
I poured my heart and soul
into that calligraphy!

482
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,416
It's Sensei!
