00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,916
If you keep lookin' up
the whole time,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,833
you'll miss half the show!

3
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:19,041
Just sit still a spell
and you might see

4
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,416
there's all sorts of goodies
lyin' on the ground for you.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,041
[HANDA, thinking]
Just looking up isn't enough.

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,958
If I'm patient,
and I work at my own pace,

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,500
if I gaze inward

8
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,208
and put my heart and soul
into my calligraphy,

9
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,458
then I should be
able to discover my style.

10
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't mind commissions,

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,500
but this sounds like
a really messed-up movie!

12
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,791
And it was popular enough
for a sequel?

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,333
Oh, well.

14
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,000
What the...?

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,833
It went and died on me!

16
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,083
Great, now what?

17
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,583
There's no way

18
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,541
there's a computer repair shop
on this island.

Wait! Kawafuji!

20
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,291
Damn it!

21
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,125
My phone's been screwy
ever since I fell in the ocean

22
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,208
and now the buttons don't work!

23
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,541
No computer,

24
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,458
no cell phone,
not even a land line.

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,666
What am I supposed to do?

26
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,041
I'll die without contact
with the real world!

[HANDA, thinking]
I can't believe

29
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,833
it's already been a month
since I got here.

30
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,333
Despite the "laid-back
country lifestyle,"

31
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:29,458
it seems like I've
been scrambling every day.

32
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,041
But amidst the chaos,

33
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,250
there's one special place
that soothes my heart.

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,083
Ahhhhhh!

Indeed.

This is like heaven on earth
for a cat lover!

00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:51,541
They're so cute!
I'm dying inside to pet them!

00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,666
But that might be kinda weird
since I don't live here.

Did ya not hear me say
that they're strays?

58
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,750
They couldn't give a squat
whatcha want.

You could've told me that first.

I'm just going to slowly lower
my arms now.

I know what'll
get their attention.

Well, that certainly
did the trick!

That leftover stew was gonna
be my dinner

66
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,000
after those little white devils
ate all my sashimi.

Uh, I'm just gonna ignore that.

There's no use namin' a stray.

00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,375
[AKKI] He's a video game legend.
So you need to use the phone?

is uncanny, like clones!

hurry and make your phone call?

Yeah, it's a rotary phone.

Shouldn't this be in a museum?

154

I've only seen these things
on TV before.

It doesn't even look like
it has a camera!

How are you even supposed
to watch cat videos on it?

Haaaaa!
Haa-haa-haa!

00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,958
so go on and use it
whenever you're done, okay?

161
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,041
Um... okay.

162
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,416
This is a very important call
I'm making.

163
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,041
Please be quiet, okay?

164
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,333
[GIRLS]
Shh!

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,583
Now let's see here.
Zero.

166
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,291
What's wrong with this button?

167
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,041
I keep pushing it,
but it won't work!

168
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,666
Hey, I think your phone
is broken!

169
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,250
Um, pressing it like that's
not gonna do anything

170
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,791
'cause you're supposed
to rotate the dial.

171
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,458
I knew that!
It's just stuck!

172
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
Your dial's too tight!

173
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,666
[AKKI, thinking]
He actually blamed the phone?

174
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,125
[HANDA]
Like this, right?

175
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,125
You see, it spins.

176
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,541
[AKKI]
What do you want from me?

177
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,458
[GIRLS giggling]

178
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,458
[NARU] You can take
your finger off now.

179
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,458
I know what I'm doing, okay?

180
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,208
[AKKI] You need to pick up
the receiver

181
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,166
if you actually want
the call to go through.

182
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,875
[GIRLS giggling]

183
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,375
[AKKI] Please tell me the number
and I'll dial it for you.

184
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,125
This has gone on long enough.

185
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,958
[HANDA] Your pity
is making this even worse!

186
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,875
[ringing]

187
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,500
Yeah, hello, Handa.

188
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,541
[HANDA] I told you to be quiet,
I'm on the phone!

189
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,166
[KAWAFUJI chuckles]

190
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,833
Hey, Kawafuji.

191
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,083
[KAWAFUJI]
Sounds pretty lively down there.

192
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,500
So, what's goin' on?

193
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,500
[HANDA]
My computer died on me.

194
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,541
I was hoping you could maybe
ship me a new one.

195
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,708
I can't really do any work
without it.

196
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,500
Actually, speaking of work,
Handa,

197
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,166
I'm thinking the best thing
for you is to take a sabbatical.

198
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,583
Huh?
What are you saying?

199
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,958
[KAWAFUJI]
There's a deadline coming up

200
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,708
for the Narukain Exhibition
this fall.

201
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,666
Look, I know you need to do
commissions to stay afloat,

202
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,666
but as your friend,
I think you should be focusing

203
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,250
on your own work.

204
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
When's the deadline?

205
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,125
[KAWAFUJI]
September 10th.

206
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,500
I mean, if you don't feel
like entering,

207
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,125
you can always let it slide
this year.

208
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,125
Take some time
to think about it.

209
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,500
I need you to send me
the following list of tools.

210
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,833
So I can expect you to take
first place this time, right?

211
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,000
We'll just have to see.

212
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,375
Truthfully, I'm still contending
with the darkness.

213
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,791
But I'll find the light someday,
and you can believe me on that.

214
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,500
It's a promise.

215
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,291
So, how much do I owe?

216
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,000
You charge by the minute,
I guess?

217
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,875
"I'm still contending
with the darkness."

218
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,958
"But I will find
the light someday."

219
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,500
[GIRLS giggle]

220
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,541
Did it really sound
that corny when I said it?

221
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,500
I'm just guessing here,
but I get the feeling

222
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,458
that you got bullied a lot
when you were in middle school.

223
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,125
[HANDA]
That's completely irrelevant!

224
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,625
So that took about five minutes.
Is 50 yen cool?

225
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,000
We only charge a flat
ten yen to use the phone.

226
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,625
Huh? You really only charge
that little?

227
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,583
[AKKI] Grandma actually
says it's free of charge,

228
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,583
but everyone leaves
ten yen behind anyway.

229
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,875
[HANDA] Hmm, okay.
Ten yen.

230
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,541
And that should add
another 40 onto it.

231
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,750
Naru.

232
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:05,833
Yay!

233
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,250
And one for Hina.

234
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,291
Sorry, bad shot.

235
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,166
And, Akki, one for you.

236
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
Oh, cool.
Thanks a lot.

237
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,000
Lookie!

238
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,875
I made a giant,
humongous bubble!

239
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,250
[HANDA] No, don't touch it,
your hands are filthy.

240
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,916
[pop]

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,291
Hina! Jeez, can you
breathe under there?

242
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,875
[AKKI laughs]

243
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,416
When everybody told me
you were a calligrapher,

244
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,583
I figured you'd be all crabby
and stuck up.

245
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,625
I guess you can't really judge
a book by its job, though.

246
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,375
Now I get what everyone meant
when they said you were odd.

247
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,583
People think I'm odd?

248
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,625
[AKKI] Can I come hang out
at your place sometime?

249
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,083
[HANDA]
Are you and your sister

250
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,083
gonna tag-team
ransacking my house?

251
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,291
--[NARU] It's really fun!
--[HANDA] Don't tell him that!

252
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,083
[NARU, HINA and AKKI laughing]

253
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,375
[HANDA] Damn it.
There's nothing coming to me.

254
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,750
[thud]

255
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,333
I'm just not motivated.

256
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,291
[sighs]

257
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,583
[thinking] Maybe it's
'cause I stopped working

258
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,333
to focus on the exhibit.

259
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,250
It's a lot more pressure to
come up with an original piece.

260
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,250
I need to clear my mind
and bust out something,

261
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,791
or else the deadline--

262

The hell you doin',
you careless putz?

You went and spilt
my whole mornin's pickin's!

264
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,416
I'm really sorry,
I was just lost in thought!

265
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,375
[IWAO]
You were lost in thought, huh?

266
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,708
You think your thinkin's a good
reason to spoil my hard work?

267
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,250
You really think
I'm all right with that?

[HANDA, thinking]
He's a Yakuza!

269
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,041
I haven't seen you
around these parts before.

270
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,666
Well, I just recently
moved to the isla--

271
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,625
Aha! You're
the calligraphy sensei!

272
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,333
[HANDA]
Uh, that's me.

273
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,541
Been wonderin' when I was gonna
get to put my eyes

274
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,291
on the odd one
I been hearin' about.

275

[HANDA]
Am I that odd?

276
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,166
It just so happens
I got a little request

277
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,041
I been wantin' to run past you,
ol' Sensei.

278

Uh, where are you taking me?

279
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,666
[IWAO]
Oh, don't worry, you'll see!

280
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,708
Ah, wait, I forgot my bike.

281
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,791
[HANDA, thinking]
Great, I'm getting kidnapped

282
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,583
by a terrifying,
annoying old man.

283
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,666
[IWAO]
All right then, Sensei.

284
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,250
Jump on in there,
and show us your stuff.

[MIWA laughs]

286
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,583
I'm sorry to see you couldn't
escape my dad's iron clutches.

287
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,083
I should've never
mentioned you to him.

288
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,500
He's been determined

289
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,125
to make you write his ship's
name ever since.

290
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,958
[HANDA]
That guy's your dad?

291
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,458
There really is no way
out of this, is there?

292
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,166
[chuckles]

293
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,916
She's gonna be beautiful.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,916
[HANDA] Doesn't feel like
there's any room for mistakes.

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,333
[MIWA] Yeah, Dad's pretty scary
when he gets mad.

296
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,583
[HANDA] Going by custom,
is the ship named after you?

297
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,541
My dad runs a sake store and
bought this ship to kill time.

298
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,666
No way I'm letting him
name it after me.

299
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,750
[HANDA]
That's quite the mouthful.

300
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,625
[MIWA]
Tell me about it.

301
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,041
I'm so happy my mom's
the one who named me.

302
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,750
What's "Yuigadokuson" mean?

303
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,041
Hah! It means I'm a god
among mortal men.

304
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,250
[MIWA] I'm so embarrassed
he's my dad.

305
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,458
[HANDA, thinking]
You can't pick your family.

306
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,458
Five kanji characters.

307
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,416
That's a hefty task,

308
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,125
and it's hard to scale
since the ship's body's curved.

309
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,041
Not to mention
these aren't my normal tools.

310
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,333
And he's clearly the kind of guy
you don't wanna let down.

311
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,541
So I really can't fail here.

312
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,833
Hey, it's paint!

313
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,708
Ta-da!

314
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,541
Bam!

315
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,500
That paint is gonna melt
your hands, you know

316
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,791
[KENTA and NARU]
Aaaaah!

317
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:30,041
[NARU]
Wash it off!

318
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,791
[HANDA]
I need a draft to work from.

319
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm gonna head back home
and whip one up.

320
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,208
You see,
I'll cut around the characters

321
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
and create a stencil.

322
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,875
Then I'll tape it to the boat
and paint over it.

323
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,500
[IWAO]
Hang on there, Sensei.

324
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,291
That ain't any different
than takin' her into a shop!

325
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,750
I want my boat to look like
the work of art she is!

326
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,541
Well, want in one hand.

327
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,791
These aren't the type of tools
I normally use,

328
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,833
and I'm only
used to writing on paper.

329
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,750
So if you want something else,
you really need a specialist.

330
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,750
Oh, yeah? So you're sayin'
you're too damn scared to try

331
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,375
and you want me to drive an ugly
"factory line" lookin' ship!

332
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,125
No, that's not it!

333
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,750
But your ship is gonna look ugly
if I make a mistake!

334
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,458
Plannin' on makin' a mistake,
Sensei?

335
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,833
Of course not, but there is
always that slight chance,

336
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,541
and I just want to do it right!

337
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,625
A slight chance
ain't anything to worry about!

338
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,041
Now hurry up and get writin'!

339
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,750
I don't feel like you're hearing
what I'm saying.

340
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,541
What kind of professional
refuses good, honest work?

341
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,625
I'll be the one to decide
if it's ugly.

342
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,083
I'd rather let Naru

343
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,000
write the name on there
with her eyes covered

344
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,833
than sail this ship
with a slapped-on printout!

345
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,000
In that case--

346
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,666
Calm down, you two!

347
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,208
This ship is sinking,

348
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,166
but I've got a lifeboat--
that's a metaphor!

349
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,083
Okay, Dad, it's time
for the sake deliveries.

350
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,958
Go on and write
what you want, Sensei!

351
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,458
[IWAO] The heck you
telling him to do?!

352
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,541
Hold on! Write what I want?

353
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,416
[MIWA]
Just do what you normally do!

354
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Keep movin', you've got
a liquor store to run.

355
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,416
[HANDA, thinking]
How do I do what I normally do?

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,000
Her gangster father's
got me completely cornered here.

357
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,583
But still...

358
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,708
I'm not gonna cower
after that old man insulted me!

359
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm gonna make him
weep with gratitude!

360
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,875
But first I need to get used
to using this brush.

361
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,791
[NARU] Sensei! We can't get
the paint off our hands!

362
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,333
[KENTA] I don't want
my hand to melt!

363
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,791
[HANDA] Calm down,
your hands won't melt.

364
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,875
You guys wanna help and find
something I can practice on?

365
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,375
[BOY]
Sensei!

366
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,916
We found a whole bunch of boards
up here.

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,375
[HANDA] This is more than enough
for me to do some drafts.

368
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,916
I appreciate it, you guys.

369
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,916
[BOYS]
Yay!

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
[HANDA, thinking]
Am I supposed to know them?

371
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,041
All right, not bad!
It goes on pretty smoothly.

372
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,833
I wanna make a painting, too!

373
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,333
Can you please let me work?

374
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,500
[KIDS laughing]

375
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,625
[HANDA, thinking] I'm finally
getting used to this brush.

376
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,333
Every one of my practice runs
turned into a Freudian slip.

377
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:58,375
Oh, well, at least my form
is in tip-top shape.

378
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,416
Now!

379
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,541
Wait!
I'm not ready!

380
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,875
I didn't take the curve
of the ship into consideration!

381
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,125
No!

382
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,166
If I start now, I'll fail!

383
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,041
Oh, man, that was close!
But I killed my neck!

384
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,833
Why does art have to be
so painful?

385
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,500
Aaaaah!

386
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,625
[thinking] I can't believe I
forgot to check the ship's body!

387
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,875
That would've been a disaster!
All right.

388
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,833
Calm down, this spot
should be flat enough.

389
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,833
Quit pushing me!

390
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,291
[NARU]
We're just standing here.

391
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,791
[thinking] Damn it,
what's wrong with me?

392
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,000
Why am choking
at the last moment?

393
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,708
It's just that blank,
white surface.

394
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,000
All that possibility
for mistakes.

395
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,291
There's too much of a chance
I could screw this up.

396
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,083
Aaaah! I can't do it!

397
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,083
[NARU]
What's the matter, Sensei?

398
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,458
You better hurry
before Miwa's dad gets back.

399
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,958
Shut up!
You're only making this worse!

400
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,000
Go away!
Damn it, I don't wanna do this!

401
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,166
It's just too much!

402
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,000
--[NARU] Hey. Should we help?
--[HINA] Yup.

403
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,416
[HANDA, thinking] Calm down.
Take a deep breath.

404
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,416
I've worked under pressure
like this before.

405
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,000
I prefer to take my time,

406
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,375
but nothing's ever held me back
from delivering my best.

407
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,833
And this is no different.

408
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,625
Arrrggh!

409
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,291
I got it started for you.

410
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,791
Awesome, I wanna do it, too!

411
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,250
[BOYS]
Me too!

412
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,708
[KIDS laughing]

413
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,000
[HANDA]
What the hell are you doing?

414
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,000
You're ruining everything!

415
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,125
Look what you brats have done!
He's gonna murder me!

416
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,125
[NARU] Well, you did say
you didn't wanna do it.

417
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,166
[HANDA] That doesn't mean
I want you to do it for me!

418
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,583
Okay.
I've gotta cover this up.

419
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,625
Ew! It splattered all over me!

420
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,958
Keep it together, it got me too!

421
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,875
I've gotta slap it on heavy
so I cover up the handprints.

422
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,000
Naru!
Fill this bowl with paint.

423
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,375
Okay!

424
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,000
Step back, Hina, or you'll
get your clothes dirty.

425
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,000
Kenta, I need you to cover up
the dripping ink with paper!

426
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,208
I'm on it!

427
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,166
[HANDA, thinking]
This is so weird.

428
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,041
I was really
freaking out earlier,

429
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,708
but I don't feel
any pressure at all now.

430
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,041
The brush is practically flying!

431
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,458
All I needed
to pull myself together

432
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,541
was one tiny handprint.

433
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[HANDA, aloud] Hold the bowl up.
I need more paint!

434
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,041
[NARU]
Roger!

435
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,666
He sure gets into it
once he starts, don't he?

436
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,458
Yeah, he always acts like that.

437
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,333
The village leader told me
how the Sensei

438
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,833
can't help but laugh
when he's workin' on somethin'.

439
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,083
I guess he wasn't exaggerating.

440
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,125
Here ya go.
Seaweed, for all your hard work.

441
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,083
[HANDA]
Um, you shouldn't have.

442
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,208
[thinking] Wait, isn't this
the seaweed I spilled earlier?

443
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,250
And how exactly you supposed
to eat this stuff?

444
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,583
You earned it!
That's mighty fine work ya did!

445
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,708
I'll call ya when I launch this
beauty and ya better show up!

446
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,375
[HANDA, thinking]
He's so happy, it's kinda gross.

447
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,333
[IWAO] I knew askin' ya
was a smart move.

448
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:56,083
Like they say, they don't
call you Sensei for nothin'!

449
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,791
[MIWA]
It's not bad!

450
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,750
[NARU] My handprint's
right over th--

451
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,625
This is the first chance
I've had to write on a ship.

452
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,166
So, I appreciate
the opportunity.

453
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,666
And it helped me realize
how to calm myself.

454
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,583
Be like a kid with finger paint.

455
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,125
Honestly.
This really meant a lot to me.

456
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,250
Thank you very much.

457
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,291
[IWAO] Hey, I'm the one
that should be thankin' you.

458
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,041
'Cept there's one thing
stuck in my craw.

459
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,833
It seems like
you had a few things

460
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,916
you couldn't bring yourself
to say to my face.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,208
[HANDA] Huh?
Where'd you get that idea?

462
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,541
Huh?

463
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,791
Uggh!
That's not what it looks like!

464
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,500
[MIWA]
Busted, Sensei!

00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,083
And I was gonna use them planks
as a gangway for my boat.

466
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,750
How are you gonna make
this right, Sensei?

467
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,000
[HANDA]
I, uh...

468
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm really sorry!

00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,166
He's running away?
Some adult he is.

470
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,916
He even dropped all the seaweed!

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,625

Sensei, your seaweed!

Jeez, look at all the trash.

494
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,333
[KAZUYUKI]
Yeah, some of the kids

495
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,166
come fishing here
got no respect.

496
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,041
I warned 'em,
but they don't care.

497
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,833
[HANDA] Why not put up
some kind of catchy sign

498
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:33,916
that'll make them think twice?

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
[KAZUYUKI]
"The trash you dumped here

500

is slowly murdering
our loving mother Earth."

00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,791
[HANDA] Big thinking,
but not very catchy, you know?

502
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,291
[KAZUYUKI] How 'bout,
"Don't throw trash, ya trash"?

503
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,291
[HANDA] That's just gonna
make the reader angry.

504
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,875
[KAZUYUKI]
"Dump here and die!"

505
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,083
[HANDA]
Kind of an empty threat.

506
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,541
Then you think of one
if you know so much!

[HANDA]
"If you dump trash here,
