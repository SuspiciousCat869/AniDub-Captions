WEBVTT

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:06.981
- [Ryu] The Astrea Familia.
My most precious friends.

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:09.553
(gentle music)

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:13.293
- How are you doing? You
seem a little off lately.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.598
Is something wrong, Lion?

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:18.504
- Oh no, not really.

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:19.974
- Goodness gracious.

00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:22.946
When did the ever so noble
and sophisticated Elf

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:25.017
turn into a lazy bones?

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.321
Asleep on her feet, no less.

00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.325
Why, I could never
hope to achieve

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.530
such a magnificent feet mysElf.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.736
- Kaguya, I assure you,
I'm wide awake.

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:38.243
And lose the snarky tone,
it's extremely irritating.

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:40.681
- [Kaguya] My my,
how unsettling.

00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:43.554
Whenever did the Elf
acquire the poor etiquette

00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:45.223
of a filthy Dwarf?

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.562
- Come on, don't
tease her, Kaguya.

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:49.633
Isn't it obvious
that she's distracted

00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.906
cause she's fallen head over
heels for a sexy dreamboat?

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:54.543
- What? Nonsense, Lyla.

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:56.647
Why must you make
everything so dirty?

00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:57.782
I would never in my-

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:00.387
- Aha! Well, so that's
what it was.

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:02.491
How you met,
how you fell in love.

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:05.765
Give me all the
juicy deets later.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.134
- You need to stop it, Alise!

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.738
Please do not encourage her.

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:11.209
(Ryu sighs)
(all laughing)

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:14.616
- Alrighty, suppose it's
time we get down to business.

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:16.854
The Guild has reported that

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:18.156
Evilus is up to something.

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:19.559
They're on the Lower Floors.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.033
- [Kaguya] Evilus. You
mean the Rudra Familia?

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.536
- Possibly.

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:27.374
It's been a year since the
Nightmare on the 27th Floor

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:30.748
and Evilus has suffered a huge
blow all across the board.

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:33.855
So at this point I'd imagine
they can only operate

00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:35.323
in the general vicinity.

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:37.729
- Those jerks really got
their asses handed to them,

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.731
didn't they?

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.733
But I guess everyone who

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:40.668
allied with the Guild

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.004
didn't exactly walk away

00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:43.140
unscathed either.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.108
- Hard to imagine what

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.043
might have happened

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:46.179
if the Loki Familia-

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.449
- [Ryu] Ah, a memory.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.555
Of that fateful day.
- That's what I'm saying!

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:52.826
- Just before disaster struck.
- We owe it all to Braver,

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.830
the pride and joy of us Prums.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.801
- Okay, so on that note,

00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:00.675
we in the Astrea Familia
shall conduct an investigation

00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:02.779
and if we find something
of interest, great.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.785
If we foil the enemy's
plan, that's even better.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:09.191
But catch the Rudra Familia
and it's party time.

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.697
- What an exciting idea.
- No, no!

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:14.603
- Should we happen upon-
- The Rudra Familia, and Jura.

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:17.742
They used that information
to lure us in!

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:19.311
- Yeah, I don't know man.

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.382
It seems like
another trap to me,

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:24.122
like that time back
on the 27th Floor.

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:26.393
- Maybe so, but we gotta check
it out.

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:29.733
If it means the prevention
of another tragedy like that

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:30.969
then it's worth it.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.872
- So it's right up your alley.

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:34.108
Got your name on it.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.445
- You know me all too well.

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:39.118
Now, okay guys, pack your stuff.

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:41.455
- Roger.
- All right.

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:43.594
(tense music)

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:47.167
- [Ryu] Wait, no!
Don't go down there!

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.637
Kaguya! Lyla!

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:51.577
Neun! Neese!

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.215
Asta! Ryana!

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:56.820
Celty! Isuka!

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.189
Marrue!

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.228
(tense music)

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.334
Alise!

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:08.977
(Opening Song)

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:44.770
- She's fast asleep.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.941
This might be the first
time I've ever seen

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:48.610
Miss Ryu let her guard down.

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.184
- Alise, please don't go.

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:54.021
- She must be dreaming.

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.323
(Bell gasping)

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.829
(rumbling)

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.033
(Skull sheep growls)

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.306
Another Skull Sheep.
Is it alone?

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:06.747
Yeah, I only sense the one.
What do I do?

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:09.485
If it's alone, I should
be able to take it down.

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:11.288
But more of its
friends might show up

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:12.758
when they hear the noise.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:15.396
(dramatic music)

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:18.570
(Bell shudders)

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:22.678
Move and I'll shoot.
I will kill you!

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.386
It's different than the
monsters on the Upper

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:27.288
and Middle Floors.

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:28.323
They swoop in as soon

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:29.526
as they spot their prey.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.630
They're more intelligent down
here

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.536
which means there's a
chance this might work.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:38.476
(dramatic music fades)

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.750
It backed down. Thank goodness.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.089
I'll let her rest just a little
longer.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:48.229
(Ryu snores softly)

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:50.400
(Anya bellows)

00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:52.337
(water gushing)

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.008
- What the heck happened?

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:56.947
- I gotta ask, has the
Water Capital always looked

00:05:57.047 --> 00:06:00.521
like a gaping hole leading
straight to the pit of Hell?

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.890
- Truthfully, no.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.025
I don't think I've ever

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:04.261
seen it like this either.

00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:05.965
If I had to take a wild guess

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.737
I'd say the Floor Boss came
charging through the cavern.

00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:10.975
- A Floor Boss from
the Lower Floors

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:12.813
would mean it's Amphisbaena.

00:06:12.913 --> 00:06:15.150
Is it possible someone
took that thing out

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.686
before we even got here?

00:06:16.786 --> 00:06:19.425
- Yeah, so like, where is
the Floor Boss right meow?

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:20.862
Do you think maybe
it bit the dust?

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:22.665
- We don't know
the details for sure.

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.335
The adventurers
who are fighting it

00:06:24.435 --> 00:06:26.039
might not have even survived.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.374
- Precisely right.

00:06:27.474 --> 00:06:29.378
There's only one thing
we know for certain,

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:31.048
whatever it is
that happened here,

00:06:31.148 --> 00:06:33.821
unfortunately we arrived
too late to help out.

00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:35.825
- [Anya] Ryu oughtta be
down on the 27th Floor!

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:38.597
Let's furrget this
place and get going.

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.066
- Easier said than done.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.505
I mean take a look! The
frickin' ground is missing!

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.342
What are we supposed to do, huh?

00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:46.613
- Well, I suppose that
means we've got no choice

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:48.082
but to scale the cliff.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.418
- Ugh. Are you kitten me?

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.155
- Don't worry, there aren't

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:52.959
any monsters around right meow.

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.898
So long as none show up, we'll
be good!

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:58.303
My older brother used to
go flying down these walls

00:06:58.403 --> 00:07:01.208
by himself all the time,
so we can do it too.

00:07:02.612 --> 00:07:04.849
Well, hopefully.

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.922
(all sighing)

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:08.957
- Gods dammit!

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:10.961
Fine! Let's just scale the
stupid thing!

00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:13.534
- Me-yeah. Can't be that bad,
right?

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:14.836
- Well, worst-case scenario,

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:17.441
we gotta set a few broken bones.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:22.918
- (shouts) Cat's the
spirit! Meow then, let's go!

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:25.290
(Welf growling)

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.029
(dramatic music)
(monster growling)

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.569
- Dammit! No matter how many
we kill, they just keep comin'!

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.973
(Ouka growling)

00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:35.209
- To your left Ouka, and
there's more behind us!

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:38.250
- They've got us surrounded.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.786
There's way too many!

00:07:39.887 --> 00:07:41.289
- Don't bother trying
to fight them.

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.794
We need to save our strength.

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:46.734
(dramatic music)
(monster snarls)

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.371
Their leader's wounded.
Jump ship while we can.

00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:52.845
- (panting) This is just the
worst!

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:56.553
It's been nonstop monsters
since we reached the 26th Floor!

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:58.724
At this rate, we won't
have the time or energy

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:00.360
to go looking for Bell.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.963
- You are still hung up on that?

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:03.868
The plan to save Master
Bell was set in stone

00:08:03.968 --> 00:08:06.105
the moment we chose
not to turn back.

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:07.474
- Look, I get that you guys

00:08:07.575 --> 00:08:09.780
don't wanna leave your
friend behind or whatever,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.683
but how are we supposed
to track him down

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.520
if we don't know where to start?

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.192
- Moving forward is our only
move.

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:17.628
We can't head back to 24

00:08:17.728 --> 00:08:20.501
until the Dungeon
completes its repair cycle.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.337
So we've gotta find
Bell Cranel first.

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:25.476
Then we'll head toward the
safety point on the Lower
Floors.

00:08:25.578 --> 00:08:26.713
- Sounds risky.

00:08:26.813 --> 00:08:28.383
- [Aisha] That's where we are.

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:30.387
Any adventurer with a
shred of common sense

00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:34.094
would know to turn back and
follow the normal route back up.

00:08:34.194 --> 00:08:36.900
Let's just hope we run
into him along the way.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.039
- I fear we still haven't
escape the despair,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.943
but why is that?

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:44.982
(water rustling)

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:48.089
(water gushing)

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:49.191
(Aisha grunts)

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.363
- (grunts) On your feet!
Something's coming!

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:54.201
(dramatic music)

00:08:54.302 --> 00:08:56.205
(Kelpie neighs)

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:57.542
- Is that a Kelpie?

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:59.879
- Kelpies spawn
on the 27th Floor!

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:01.449
I wonder how it got up here?!

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.020
(Ouka grunts)

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:06.560
(dramatic music)

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.928
- [Welf] Run!

00:09:08.028 --> 00:09:12.037
(dramatic music)
(all panting)

00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:12.905
(Aisha gasps)

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:15.611
- Lamias, Afancs, and Dodolas.

00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:19.051
Are you kidding me? Those
are all 27th Floor monsters.

00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:22.057
- What in the heck is
going on around here?

00:09:22.157 --> 00:09:23.093
- Ask the Dungeon!

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:24.563
It's the one who keeps

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.699
jerkin' us around after all!

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.436
(Kelpie neighs)

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.541
(Lamia screeches)

00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:32.545
(Aisha and Daphne yell)

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:35.784
(dramatic music)

00:09:36.418 --> 00:09:37.822
- (grunts) I swear,

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:40.126
it's like the Dungeon's got
it out for us or something!

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:44.167
- This is kind of excessive,
even for an... (grunts)

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:47.676
(dramatic music)

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:50.814
- You son of a bitch.

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:53.554
- That ore; it's from
the Lower Floors.

00:09:53.654 --> 00:09:55.891
What's it doing here?

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.697
(Welf grunts)
(Dodola growls)

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.636
(Aisha grunts)

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:02.839
(dramatic music)

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:04.543
- What's the matter
with you, Crozzo?!

00:10:04.643 --> 00:10:05.678
Get up, you lazy-ass!

00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:07.380
- Right (grunts).

00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:11.121
(Bors grunting)

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:12.891
- Sounds like someone's
down there.

00:10:12.992 --> 00:10:16.432
- It might be an adventure on
their way to the 27th Floor.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.671
- Hm (yells).

00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:20.206
- [Chigusa] Ouka, wait!

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:23.112
(Ouka grunting)

00:10:23.213 --> 00:10:26.151
(dramatic music)

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:30.126
(Ouka grunting)

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.335
- Hey, are you doing
all right, pal?

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:35.604
- Huh?

00:10:35.704 --> 00:10:37.274
- Wait you're from Rivira!

00:10:37.374 --> 00:10:39.378
- Master Bors?

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.281
- It... It's you guys.

00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:43.118
Thank the gods, I'm safe.

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:46.058
I am safe, right?

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:51.937
(Bors grunts)
(water splashes)

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:53.405
- Did you make it
here all alone?

00:10:53.506 --> 00:10:56.880
What happened to the others
who joined the manhunt?

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:02.090
- [Bors] They were murdered.
Every last one of them.

00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:03.092
My men included.

00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:04.361
- Huh?
- Wait,

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:05.598
but didn't you have a bunch

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.833
of high-class adventures

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.002
who went along with you?

00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:09.873
- How are there no survivors?

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:12.043
I refuse to believe that shit!

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:13.245
- Simmer down.

00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:16.219
You mean it's all Gale Wind?

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:18.923
She single-handedly wiped
out your entire party?

00:11:19.024 --> 00:11:21.997
- No, not her. It
was an Irregular.

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:23.399
It was a new type of beast.

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:26.438
I mean, I've never seen
anything like it before.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.941
- A new type?
- And I'm pretty sure

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.879
that you guys must
have heard it too.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.585
That deafening roar
when it spawned.

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.622
- Hmm. I see.

00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.158
That was the sound

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:39.064
of the Dungeon setting
free some monstrosity.

00:11:39.164 --> 00:11:41.435
- It is The Great Disaster.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:43.807
- That thing, it was unreal.

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:47.748
It can rip you apart with just
a single swipe of its claws.

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:50.921
Worst of all, you have no
chance of outrunning it.

00:11:51.856 --> 00:11:53.392
- Pardon me, Master Bors.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:55.564
- Huh?
- If I may,

00:11:55.664 --> 00:11:57.635
what happened to Master Bell?

00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:02.043
- Hmm. Poor little Rabbit
Foot didn't make it.

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:04.949
(Welf and Cassandra gasp)

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:06.485
Got one of his arms blown off.

00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:10.293
And the way his neck
snapped, I doubt he survived.

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:11.428
(tense music)

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:13.701
- You're lying.
- It's the truth, I tell you!

00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:15.470
That poor dumb, Rabbit Foot.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.407
And Gale Wind tried
to protect me,

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:18.810
but it killed all of them!

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.614
A blood bath!

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:23.286
That monster massacred everyone!

00:12:23.386 --> 00:12:25.423
- You're lying!
Master Bell can't die!

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:27.695
He's the one person in the

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.365
world who can't abandon me!

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:30.768
- Hey, calm down a Lil' Bit.

00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:33.873
(Lili sobbing)

00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:36.880
- But Master Bell can't be...

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.853
There's no way! He would
never do something like that.

00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:43.059
I know him! (sobs)

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:48.603
He just can't be. (sobs)

00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:52.645
- This can be true.
Anybody but him.

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:56.218
(Lili sobbing)
(water rustling)

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:59.793
(monster growling)

00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:01.929
(growling intensifies)

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.399
- Time to scoot.

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:04.702
- Let's hurry up.

00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:09.077
(all panting)
(dramatic music)

00:13:09.177 --> 00:13:11.048
- [Lili] Master Bell is dead?

00:13:11.148 --> 00:13:15.123
If that's really true, if he
isn't alive anymore, then-

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:17.628
- [Aisha] Monster incoming!

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:19.732
(Lili grunts)
(monster snarls)

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.939
- [Lili] Then there's
no point to any of this.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.711
- Holy crap, they're
coming from the front!

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.447
(monsters growling)

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:29.819
(Welf grunts)

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.296
(fireball whooshing)
(dramatic music)

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:40.439
(dramatic music continues)
(weapon clicks)

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.746
- [Welf] It's gonna shatter
the next time I use it.

00:13:43.847 --> 00:13:47.621
And when that happens,
we're screwed.

00:13:47.722 --> 00:13:49.491
(dramatic music)

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:50.828
- [Ouka] Hm.

00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:54.467
(dramatic music fades)

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:59.411
(glass shattering)

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:00.981
- [Daphne] Mm.

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:04.622
- [Ouka] It's a dead end.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:09.598
- [Lili] If monsters
attack us here,

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.937
there's quite literally
no way out.

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:13.105
We need to hurry.

00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:14.676
We need to get out of here

00:14:14.776 --> 00:14:16.078
as quickly as possible.

00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:19.885
But everyone's exhausted.

00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:26.231
And besides, Master
Bell is gone.

00:14:27.935 --> 00:14:29.070
- Hmm.

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.212
- Bors, question.
- Yeah.

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:35.483
- I want you to tell
me everything you saw.

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.320
- Huh? But I already told you.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.459
- In more detail this time
from beginning to end.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.032
Specifically the part about
the creature attacking Bell.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.804
And no doom-and-gloom crap.

00:14:45.904 --> 00:14:48.175
Describe to me exactly
what went down there.

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:51.816
- (growls) Rabbit Foot, he...

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:55.022
That thing ripped his
arm off with its claws.

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:56.660
(somber music)

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.699
And well, then the poor fella
took a pretty nasty blow

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.036
directly to the
back of the neck.

00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:05.109
(somber music)

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.450
His bones made a cracking noise.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:14.662
Look, I'm sorry, but I know a
fatal injury when I see one.

00:15:14.762 --> 00:15:16.799
(somber music)

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.969
- And then what?

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:19.270
Are you telling me that you

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.042
actually saw Bell Cranel's body,

00:15:21.142 --> 00:15:24.314
saw his corpse?
- Huh? Well, not exactly.

00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:25.149
(Lili gasps)

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:26.953
- But I saw Gale Wind casting

00:15:27.053 --> 00:15:28.890
some sort of healing magic.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.529
And magic can't fix
wounds like that.

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:33.466
- Hold on a minute!

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:36.338
So there's no way we can be
absolutely sure he's dead!

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:38.944
For all we know, he could
still be alive out there!

00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:42.016
- Hmm. I don't know.

00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:43.686
Given everything the
kid's been through,

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:46.158
he'd have to be
hangin' by a thread

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.131
but I suppose it's possible.

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:52.237
- (exhales) It's Master Bell.

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:54.307
Knowing him, I bet he's alive.

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:57.380
- Uh-huh. I got no doubt
he managed to make it.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.219
Our captain doesn't
give up so easily.

00:16:00.821 --> 00:16:02.190
- You heard the man.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.996
It means the plan,
it has not changed!

00:16:05.096 --> 00:16:06.799
We keep heading towards
the safety point

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.135
on the Lower Floors.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:09.572
We might have one foot in the

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:10.941
grave by the time we get there

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:13.079
but we will find Bell Cranel.

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.984
- Lady, I just said
there's an abomination

00:16:16.084 --> 00:16:17.721
roamin' the 27th Floor!

00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:19.424
I ain't goin' down there!

00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:24.067
It'll be a cold day in Hell
before I do that shit! (grunts)

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:27.808
- I seem to remember
a little something

00:16:27.908 --> 00:16:29.545
about Gale Wind protecting you.

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.716
And I believe Bell Cranel
saved your ass

00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:33.520
a few times too, didn't he?

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.555
(Bors grunts)

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:37.393
Do it for Bell Cranel
or for Gale Wind.

00:16:37.493 --> 00:16:40.867
If you have any sense of
gratitude, then man the hell up.

00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.205
(Bors grunts)

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:48.816
- A sliver of hope still
remains. Perhaps for us as well.

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:50.921
- (sighs) So what you're saying

00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:53.025
is we're about to
embark on a very long,

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:55.497
very unforgiving journey.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:56.666
Again.

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.402
- Hm.

00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:00.373
- [Lili] She rallied
the whole party.

00:17:00.473 --> 00:17:04.247
That's the power of
Antianeira, Lv. 4.

00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:08.355
Ordinarily, it would've been
my job as the commander.

00:17:08.456 --> 00:17:11.195
I need to work on getting
stronger.

00:17:11.295 --> 00:17:13.566
- Okay, if we're gonna
travel farther down,

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:15.469
we should head back to the
normal route.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.242
There's basically only one
way into this room, right?

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.981
We have to leave soon or else
we're gonna get pulverized

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.785
by those monsters
from the main area.

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:26.760
- While you make a good
point, I do have concerns.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.464
- Let's take a short break
first, all right everybody?

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:33.005
Sounds good to me. I'll
stand guard over by the exit.

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:35.076
Hey, Bors, lend me
a hand, wouldja?

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:37.080
- [Bors] Sure (sighs).

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.551
- [Lili] Thank you,
Lady Aisha, Master Bors.

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:45.663
She may have gotten
everyone on the same page,

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:48.870
but that doesn't necessarily
mean our situation's improved.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.808
Protect ourselves
and then slip away.

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:54.749
That's the goal, but we need
a strategy to pull it off.

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:56.218
- [Welf] What do we do now?

00:17:56.318 --> 00:17:58.322
How are we supposed
to reach Bell?

00:17:58.422 --> 00:18:00.126
If only I had another
magic sword,

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:02.163
we could fight our
way outta here.

00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:04.602
This thing's got one swing
left before it breaks.

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:07.240
And it's not enough to
keep the party safe.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.177
There's nothing left I can do.

00:18:09.277 --> 00:18:11.816
We can't survive on
one swing of the sword.

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:13.754
No, stop it. Think.

00:18:13.854 --> 00:18:16.458
Think, Welf! (growls)

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.830
Here we are in danger
with no magic sword,

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.332
and that's supposed
to be my job!

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:22.103
- Here, Master Welf.

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:25.142
It's not much but you
should eat something.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.681
- All right. Thanks.

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:30.219
(Lili giggles)

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.325
(gentle music)

00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:36.398
How can I help these guys out?

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:40.373
As a blacksmith, what
can I do to give back?

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:44.615
Lady Hephaistos. What's my
best course of action here?

00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:49.091
- Hammer and metal.

00:18:49.191 --> 00:18:51.862
And so long as you've got a
healthy flame,

00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:53.967
you can forge weapons anywhere.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:56.204
(Welf gasps)

00:18:56.305 --> 00:18:59.444
(water rustling)

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:01.949
- [Welf] All right, everyone.

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:03.252
- Huh?
- Hmm?

00:19:03.352 --> 00:19:05.623
- You willing to trust
me with your lives?

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:09.064
(all murmuring)

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:11.670
- What do you mean by that?

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.974
- I'm gonna wrestle up some
magic swords.

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:15.511
- [Cassandra] Huh?

00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:18.482
- Wait a minute.
Explain what you mean.

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:21.422
- I'll build a makeshifts
workshop. Do you follow me?

00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:22.925
Then I can craft new blades.

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.227
- But that's-
- You mean,

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:25.630
you want to set up a forge

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:26.733
to make swords here?

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:27.835
You do know we could be

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:29.471
attacked at any given moment!

00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:30.173
- Bingo.

00:19:30.273 --> 00:19:31.174
- How can you suggest

00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:32.243
something so absurd?

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:33.980
This isn't even a safety point.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.982
How can you make weapons

00:19:35.082 --> 00:19:35.985
in the middle of a Floor

00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:37.120
crawling with danger?

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.488
Don't you need tools
and a hearth?!

00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:40.660
And the materials to
actually make the swords?!

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.000
- Already covered. I
brought tools for repairs.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.370
(Lili gasps)

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.409
I can light a fire with
the last blade we have.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.618
And I picked up some
materials. It's Adamantite.

00:19:52.718 --> 00:19:55.990
AKA the most precious
ore in the whole Dungeon.

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:57.828
- Yes, but-

00:19:57.928 --> 00:20:00.132
- We wanna wreck those
ugly monsters, right?

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:02.704
And make it to the 27th
Floor in one piece?

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:04.007
This is our way.

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:06.679
The magic weapons,
they'll take us.

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:08.650
(Lili gasps)

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.188
Heads up once I start the
forging process.

00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:12.691
I won't be able to move.

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.365
Which means until I'm finished,
you have to protect me.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.770
I'll be trusting you with my
life as well.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.076
- You're making no sense!
Have you lost your damn mind?!

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:24.147
Who'd agree to a crazy
plan like that?!

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.519
- I don't care whether
you think it's crazy!

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:29.290
Do you have a better idea?! No?

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.597
Then do you have faith
in me or not?! Well!?

00:20:32.697 --> 00:20:33.933
Speak up!

00:20:34.034 --> 00:20:37.474
(dramatic music)

00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:38.576
- Hm.

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:42.584
- All right, let me
ask you a question.

00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:45.355
Can you swing it?
Be honest with me.

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:47.794
(dramatic music)

00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:50.700
- You've got the hammer,
you've got the metal.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.936
So okay, Welf,

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:54.374
there's only one thing you
need to ask yourself now.

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:58.381
Your fire. Is it burning
brightly?

00:20:58.482 --> 00:20:59.952
And be truthful.

00:21:00.052 --> 00:21:01.522
- Of course I can.

00:21:01.622 --> 00:21:05.262
I've got a hammer and some
metal and a healthy flame.

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:08.301
I can forge anywhere!
I'm a blacksmith!

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:09.805
It's all I need!

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:13.546
- Hm. Okay then, go for it.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.387
- Yeah, forge away. (chuckles)

00:21:17.487 --> 00:21:20.293
- All right, Welf,
you can do it.

00:21:20.393 --> 00:21:23.934
- (sighs) Okay, if you must.

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:27.173
- Yeah, I kind of had a
feeling this was gonna happen.

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.143
- Did you really?

00:21:29.243 --> 00:21:31.782
- Screw it. I ain't
gonna stop ya.

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:34.555
(dramatic music)

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:37.928
- We trust you with our
lives. Now get to it.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:40.600
- Roger.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.738
- Everyone in your battle
formations.

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:45.843
We're doing everything
we can for Crozzo!

00:21:45.944 --> 00:21:49.117
(dramatic music)

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:50.486
- No matter what happens

00:21:50.587 --> 00:21:53.125
don't let the monsters
get close to Master Welf.

00:21:53.225 --> 00:21:54.394
Is that clear?

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:55.930
- Mm.
- Hm.

00:21:56.031 --> 00:21:58.202
(dramatic music)

00:21:58.302 --> 00:21:59.504
- Hm.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.683
(flame whooshing)

00:22:06.552 --> 00:22:08.421
(weapon shattering)

00:22:08.523 --> 00:22:11.662
(dramatic music)

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.601
- Here goes nothing.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.543
(Ending song)

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:48.956
- [Cassandra] Next time:
"Welf Crozzo."
