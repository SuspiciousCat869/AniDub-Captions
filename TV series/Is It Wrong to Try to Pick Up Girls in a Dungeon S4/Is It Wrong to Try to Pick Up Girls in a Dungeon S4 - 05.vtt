WEBVTT

00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:05.443
(mysterious music)

00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:10.522
This is a grimoire.

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:14.028
- Uh-huh. It's a very convenient
item that can forcibly

00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:16.432
awaken new magic
within the reader.

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.638
Course, there's no
way of knowing exactly

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:19.874
what kind of magic it'll be.

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:21.843
- Ah, okay.

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:23.213
Honestly, an item, this precious

00:00:23.313 --> 00:00:25.017
is wasted on the likes of me.

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.522
- I thought I made myself clear.
- Uh?

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:29.425
- [Aisha] If providing a
level boost is your only trick

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:31.897
you'll be a burden to the party.
- Mm

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.834
- Doesn't matter what
magic you obtain

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.939
it can be healing
or attack spells.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.443
Just try to expand
your skillset.

00:00:38.544 --> 00:00:41.984
Whatever it is, may save
the lives of your friends.

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.421
If you really want to
stand up for your familia

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.192
then you should do
whatever it takes.

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:48.030
Forget about what
other people think.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.601
Let yourself be greedy
and play dirty.

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.205
Now. Time to get reading.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:55.443
Then we'll start
practicing your new magic.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:00:58.416
- Okay.

00:01:02.693 --> 00:01:05.731
(pages rifling)

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.737
(Haruhime gasps)

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.812
(Opening Song)

00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:45.931
(crabs growling)

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.806
- Here I go.

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:50.908
Kokonoe!

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:51.943
(magic gleams)

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.146
(dramatic music)

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:54.014
(crabs growling)

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:55.952
(warrior roars)

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:57.722
(explosions)

00:02:57.823 --> 00:02:59.092
(warrior roars)

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:01.061
(ax slashes)

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:03.099
(blade clashes)

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.238
(hair swishes)

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:08.209
- Ya!

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:12.184
- Oh beloved snow.
Oh beloved crimson.

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:13.319
Oh beloved lights.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.556
(warrior roars)

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:16.492
Choose the one who
must stay by my side,

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:20.334
those strong feelings
discovered after 2000 nights.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:24.475
My name is Fox Spirit, a
distractor of long past.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:30.287
I am the song of Desire, a
desire of long past for thee.

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:33.360
I shall harbor the
demon of nine within me.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.765
Resound, golden melody.

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:40.574
Call forth Tamamo, the yellow
haired king of nine tails.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.411
Oh, mystic beast.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:45.718
May you consume all
and grant every wish.

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:47.421
- Now let them grow.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:48.958
(magical force booming)

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:50.260
- She connected them.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.601
- Bless the vessel of
the divine power.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.640
- A tower of riches for
a tower of wishes.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.744
- And then until the
tolling of the bell

00:03:58.845 --> 00:03:59.946
(tails swishing)

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:02.686
I call upon glory and illusion.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:04.055
Now let them grow!

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:05.190
(sparks crackling)

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.260
Golden light provided
by the gods.

00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:10.166
This body has devoured
divine gifts.

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.639
With the pounding of a
mallet into the ground,

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.178
may thou be blessed with
good fortune.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.815
(mystical music)

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:18.917
- Oh

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.192
(magic gleaming)

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:24.461
- Oh

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.800
- Well, from what I can tell,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.737
this magic spell is one
that works in conjunction

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:30.440
with others that
you already know.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.812
- So hang on, is
it an enchantment?

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:35.383
- [Hestia] Right now, Haruhime
is capable of growing out

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.754
Five of those tales.

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:39.793
Hmm, which basically
means that she can cast

00:04:39.893 --> 00:04:42.397
her Level Boost on up to
five different people now.

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:43.433
(dramatic music)

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:44.334
(sparks crackling)

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:46.072
- Let them grow!

00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:49.278
(drone rising)

00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:50.915
Uchide no Kozuchi!

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:54.354
(explosion booming)

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:58.396
(energy pulsing)

00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:03.974
dance and whirl.

00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:06.913
(energy pulsing)

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:08.216
(power crashing)

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:09.085
- Perfect.

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:12.758
- Ahhh!

00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:15.532
(Welf roaring)

00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:17.367
- Hell yeah, lets go!

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:18.871
(Ax crashing)

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:19.973
- Ya!

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.047
(sword swishing)

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:27.487
(sword clanging)

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:28.958
(sword clashing)

00:05:29.058 --> 00:05:30.862
(shells crack)

00:05:30.962 --> 00:05:31.997
- Ha!

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:35.070
(sword spinning)

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.272
- Oh

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:39.278
(Haruhime hitting ground)

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:41.349
- Anyone know what the
hell just happened?

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.254
- Wait a second, her
magic multiplied?

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:46.225
- Remember what Lady Aisha said?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:47.762
Keep this a secret.

00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:53.774
It's our best chance
to get us home,

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:54.876
in one piece.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:55.978
- Oh, hmm?

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:58.918
- Yah!

00:05:59.018 --> 00:06:00.220
- Ha!

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.657
- Yah!

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:02.758
- Huh!

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:04.562
- Hiya!

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.934
(Sword smashing)

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:08.604
- [Voiceover] We managed
to bounce back

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:11.275
If we can keep this up, we
might get out of here alive.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:13.847
Just a question of what
the Moss Huge will do.

00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:16.653
There it is.

00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:18.322
(Ominous music)

00:06:18.422 --> 00:06:20.126
What the hell is it doing?

00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:22.965
(creature growling)

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:23.834
(rock crashing)

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:25.370
Huh!

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.340
Damn it, we fell for it.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.380
It was only after the
Magic Stones all along.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.249
(creature growling)

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.555
(stones clinking)

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.974
(creature convulsing)

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.084
- That's bad!

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.957
(wood breaking)

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:55.063
(skin stretching)

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:05.885
(creature roaring)

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:08.758
(footsteps crashing)

00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:10.060
- Hah!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.865
(Aisha straining)

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.738
(feet sliding)

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:17.441
- Lady Aisha!

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.915
(punches crashing)

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.417
- [Aisha] How many times
is this thing

00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:24.255
gonna catch us off guard?

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:25.123
- Damn!

00:07:25.224 --> 00:07:28.463
(sword clanging)

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.267
(flesh squelching)

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.235
- Argh!

00:07:31.335 --> 00:07:32.137
(blood oozing)

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:33.239
Ugh!

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:38.349
- No Lady Aisha!

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.723
(creature roaring)

00:07:44.128 --> 00:07:46.901
(Aisha straining)

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:47.668
- Aha!

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:51.108
(creature screaming)

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.786
(Aisha gurgling)

00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:59.291
- I really screwed up this time.

00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:02.665
(vines stretching)

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:05.070
- The parasite

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.242
(creature roaring)

00:08:10.247 --> 00:08:11.950
- Damn, ugly-ass freak

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.219
- [Welf] Move it.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.522
Koga Burn!

00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:17.895
(flames roar)

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.172
Gah.

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:26.178
(dramatic music)

00:08:27.213 --> 00:08:28.116
- It survived that attack?

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.251
But how?

00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.691
(creature growling)

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:35.532
- That's on undine cloth.

00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:36.833
- How did it get that?

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.906
- Bastard stole stuff
from dead adventurers.

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:42.210
- This could not get any worse.

00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:45.249
(flesh creaking)

00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.158
(sword shattering)
- Huh?

00:08:49.258 --> 00:08:51.261
- Here come the Bull Crabs!

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:52.431
(crabs creeping)

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:55.671
(insects buzzing)

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:59.679
(Ouka growling)

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:02.217
(footsteps pounding)

00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:04.288
(creature growling)

00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:07.661
(Aisha straining)

00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:10.266
- Ya!

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.139
(insects buzzing)

00:09:13.239 --> 00:09:14.307
- Hai, hai!

00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:16.245
- Huh, huh!

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.118
- Huh, huh, huh!

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:20.453
(ax crashing)

00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:24.027
(insects buzzing)

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:25.129
- This is bad.

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.267
- It might be the end.

00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:34.214
(footsteps clicking)

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:37.756
- It's crazy she can cast
Level Boost on multiple people.

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.959
It's pretty much like
the Ishtar Familia's

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.195
wish came true.

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:42.297
- Funny, huh?

00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:44.468
But we need to be extra careful

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:46.271
about when we decide to use it

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:51.115
Really, I think it's going
to be our last resort.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:53.754
It could be a problem if the
scales don't start to tip

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.824
in our favor after using it.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.697
- Agreed. That wouldn't be good.

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.637
- Well, I bet we won't
even have to use it anyway.

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:04.174
As long as you have Bell
and Aisha around.

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:05.310
I find it hard to imagine.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.147
You guys getting into trouble.

00:10:09.085 --> 00:10:10.587
(dramatic music)

00:10:10.688 --> 00:10:12.324
(sword crashing)

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:13.527
- Yah!

00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:15.129
(magic jingling)

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.602
- It's starting to
look pretty bad guys.

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:19.170
We're getting overrun.

00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:21.408
(sword smashing)

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:24.716
(creatures creeping)

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:26.351
- Unleash soul light!

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:29.291
(magic gleaming)

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:30.393
- Huh?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.802
- Argh!

00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:37.942
(sword slicing)

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:44.088
- [Lili, Voiceover] Think, there
has to be something we can do.

00:10:44.188 --> 00:10:48.395
As the strategist, I need to
find a way to turn this around.

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:53.038
- [Dormul] Get your weapons
ready, guys.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.142
(Dormul strains)

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.188
- [Lili] Master Dormul,
you're in no condition...

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.868
- Let us help you out.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:09.304
We would've died a long time ago

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:11.576
if you guys hadn't come
along and saved us.

00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:12.745
- I feel the same.

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:13.947
I may be missing an arm,

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:15.584
but I can at least
act as a shield.

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:17.922
- I forbid it! Stay put.

00:11:19.224 --> 00:11:22.363
(footsteps clatter)

00:11:36.192 --> 00:11:37.962
- Just run, whenever
there's a chance.

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:39.231
We'll draw their attention.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.168
- Someone has to return
to the surface.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.641
Let them know about
that damn thing.

00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.913
So focus on surviving as
many of you as possible.

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:49.585
- Hmm. Get moving,
Hestia Familia.

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:50.754
Leave us behind.

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:52.525
(Footsteps thud)

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:57.968
- Yah!

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.986
(dramatic music)

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.730
(weapons clash)

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.002
(soldiers scream)

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.443
- We are entering the
lower floors where we don't

00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:37.247
have any experience.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:39.719
That makes it harder to
predict what'll happen.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.656
And the strategist
needs to take the worst

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:43.594
possible scenarios into account.

00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.129
- Worst possible scenarios.

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:49.070
- Mm hmm. The dungeon is
a cruel tyrant.

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:52.511
There are going to be times
when you have to be heartless.

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:55.049
That being said,
I think you can make

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.720
level-headed decisions.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:57.689
(somber music)

00:12:57.789 --> 00:13:00.393
(Lili sobs)

00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:04.936
- They're right.
We should just run.

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:06.204
It's far from the first time

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:08.744
that we've known we
were outmatched.

00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:12.083
There's no reason
to hesitate now.

00:13:12.183 --> 00:13:15.322
And I know that Master
Bell won't fault us for it.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.318
Oh!

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:32.390
(insects buzzing)

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.929
(soldier grunting)

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.168
(energy booming)

00:13:39.973 --> 00:13:41.275
- We are staying.

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.112
You know why?

00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:45.918
Master Bell never abandoned
me or anyone?

00:13:46.018 --> 00:13:48.055
He never would, he'd fight.

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:50.026
I must follow his example.

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:52.430
Listen here! It's final.

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:55.070
I'm not leaving any
of you here to die.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.708
I refuse to give
up and run away.

00:13:57.808 --> 00:13:59.812
(inspiring music)

00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:03.353
(soldier grunts)

00:14:03.453 --> 00:14:04.387
You hear me?

00:14:04.487 --> 00:14:07.795
That's my duty because
I'm the supporter.

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:11.503
Thanks for stating the
obvious Lil Bit.

00:14:11.603 --> 00:14:12.403
- Hah!

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:15.176
(sword slicing)

00:14:15.277 --> 00:14:17.782
- [Haruhime] Lady Lili,
he's coming

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:18.917
- Huh?

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:22.256
- I can hear him.
It's Master Bell

00:14:25.597 --> 00:14:27.333
- [Bell] Lili!

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.405
(Footsteps pounding)

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:30.740
- Huh?

00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:31.943
(dramatic music)

00:14:32.043 --> 00:14:33.345
(Bell panting)

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:36.318
(magic pulsing)

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:39.390
(stones crashing)

00:14:41.462 --> 00:14:43.465
- Come on, take cover!

00:14:53.953 --> 00:14:57.026
Lady Aisa, find some place safe.

00:14:57.594 --> 00:15:00.934
(creature gurgling)

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:04.642
- Eat my fire bolt!

00:15:06.112 --> 00:15:09.250
(flames roaring)

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:14.394
(rock smashing)

00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:17.701
(creature screaming)

00:15:26.819 --> 00:15:29.291
- Master Bell, he's back.

00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:30.059
- Thank God.

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.564
- Master Bell, he's okay.

00:15:35.671 --> 00:15:37.508
- Master Bell!

00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:38.676
- Thank you, Lily.

00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:40.446
(cork popping)

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.418
(Bell glugging)

00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:49.297
- I hate to sit this
out, but it's up to you.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.276
- Guess we're not ready to
manage without him just yet.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.498
(wood stretching)

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.705
(creature gurgling)

00:16:27.709 --> 00:16:29.579
(drip splashing)

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:30.680
- Hiya!

00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:36.091
(sword crashing)

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:38.129
(punches smashing)

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:39.698
- [Lili] There they go.

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:43.974
- Isn't anybody going down
there to help him out?

00:16:44.074 --> 00:16:46.680
- It would only get
worse if it shoots more

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.484
of those seeds and infects
whoever goes to help.

00:16:49.585 --> 00:16:52.323
They'll only be
more of a problem.

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:54.261
- On one hand, you're not wrong.

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:55.897
But what about
shooting some arrows

00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:57.902
or using that level
boost from earlier?

00:16:58.002 --> 00:16:59.873
There has to be a way to help.

00:16:59.973 --> 00:17:01.442
It just feels kind of wrong.

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:04.147
I mean, we can't leave
him all alone down there.

00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:06.485
- But wait, Daphne. Take a look.

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:07.721
- Huh?

00:17:07.822 --> 00:17:10.760
(sword clanking)

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:17.240
(creature wailing)

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.710
- I'm really confused.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.979
I thought it powered up from

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.348
eating all those magic stones.

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:24.154
- It definitely did,
but it doesn't matter.

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:26.458
- Bell Cranel's skills
have improved to a point

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:28.095
even beyond that.

00:17:28.195 --> 00:17:30.232
- Sometimes when
using level boost

00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:31.770
I've noticed my senses are off.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.976
Like they can't fully process
the strength of my body.

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:36.011
- Ugh.

00:17:36.111 --> 00:17:37.715
- I wonder if this entire time

00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:39.184
Master Bell has felt that too.

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:41.523
Perhaps while he's been down
here fighting these things

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:43.826
his mind and his physique
have been at odds.

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:44.795
- You think so?

00:17:44.895 --> 00:17:46.365
- Sounds plausible.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.939
Bell has leveled up a lot in
a very short amount of time.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.476
Trouble adjusting to that is
only natural.

00:17:52.577 --> 00:17:55.416
- So all that intense fighting
on the lower floors finally paid
off

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.120
for the little guy, didn't it?

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.092
I mean, it's almost
laughable really.

00:18:00.894 --> 00:18:02.598
- Master Bell.

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:03.666
- Hah!

00:18:03.767 --> 00:18:06.940
(Sword thudding)

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.108
Something inside of me changed

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:09.778
ever since that moment,

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:18.930
that uneasy feeling
I had has gone.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.967
(creature growling)

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:23.940
(wood creaking)

00:18:24.041 --> 00:18:25.844
(wood snapping)

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:27.213
(bullets firing)

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:30.019
(projectiles deflecting)

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:31.990
(creature growling)

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.060
- It's slower than the Iguazu

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.663
(fighters gasp)

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:36.599
(punch crashing)

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:39.271
And in terms of power that
Minotaur

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:42.443
I fought before was
way stronger than this.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:55.871
I really want to beat that guy

00:18:55.971 --> 00:18:58.042
and the next time we fight

00:18:58.142 --> 00:18:59.344
I will win.

00:19:00.046 --> 00:19:02.918
(energy rising)

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:06.659
(sword smashing)

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.295
(wood breaking)

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:11.669
(creature roaring)

00:19:18.316 --> 00:19:21.388
(wood crashing)

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.772
(flesh squelching)

00:19:30.807 --> 00:19:32.276
(creature gurgling)

00:19:32.377 --> 00:19:34.748
(fighters gasp)

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:37.655
(wood creaking)

00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:39.224
(creature roaring)

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:41.394
- It can still regenerate
after that.

00:19:41.494 --> 00:19:43.365
- I really don't
like this asshole.

00:19:43.465 --> 00:19:44.702
- This could be bad.

00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:47.006
His magic power isn't
at its fullest anymore.

00:19:47.107 --> 00:19:48.877
A prolonged fight
will not be good.

00:19:48.977 --> 00:19:51.882
- He'll have to take it
out with a single strike.

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:57.493
(dagger tinging)

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:02.269
Now Fire Bolt.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.476
(flames roaring)

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:14.595
(mystical music)

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.401
(creature growling)

00:20:20.205 --> 00:20:21.609
- The flames are focused
around the knife

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:24.247
- An enchantment
within a weapon?

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:25.984
What's he doing?

00:20:26.085 --> 00:20:27.487
- But even though it
transmits magic

00:20:27.588 --> 00:20:30.226
well that doesn't mean it
can be magically empowered.

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:32.196
The blade will actually
disperse any magic

00:20:32.296 --> 00:20:34.200
that you try to imbue it with.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.206
- Oh man, you doing what
I think you are?

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:40.446
(flames roaring)

00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:44.522
- Okay goddess

00:20:44.622 --> 00:20:47.093
- Oh Vesta, don't
worry about it.

00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:51.234
Seeing you in this moment just
made me feel like saying that.

00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:52.671
It's just a symbol
of all the things

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:55.309
that I preside over
and a title too,

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:58.215
and another name
I happen to go by.

00:20:58.315 --> 00:20:59.685
- That name of yours.

00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:01.321
I'm borrowing it.

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:02.724
(creature growls)

00:21:02.824 --> 00:21:04.161
(footsteps clatter)

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:05.462
- Yah!

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:12.009
Exits closed.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.214
(creature roars)

00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:15.315
- Let's end this.

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:18.022
(flames thunder)

00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:20.092
Argo Vesta!

00:21:20.193 --> 00:21:22.631
(creature roars)

00:21:22.731 --> 00:21:23.766
- Yah!

00:21:25.837 --> 00:21:28.843
(explosions boom)

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:36.759
(slow music)

00:21:38.396 --> 00:21:41.535
(fighters cheer)

00:21:45.643 --> 00:21:46.812
- Oh

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:47.480
- Chigusa

00:21:47.581 --> 00:21:49.819
- Ouka, is that you?

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:50.920
- Yeah.

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:58.703
- Master Bell!

00:21:58.803 --> 00:22:00.005
- Guys, er...

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.980
- Thanks a lot, Bell.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.884
I'll miss you, shh.

00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.841
(Ending Song)

00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:48.689
- Next time, Rabbit's Foot.
