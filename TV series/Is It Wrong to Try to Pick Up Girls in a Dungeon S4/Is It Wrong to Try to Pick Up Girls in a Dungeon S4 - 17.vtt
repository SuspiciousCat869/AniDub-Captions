WEBVTT

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:03.941
- [Ryu] Take it back, Kaguya!

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:05.745
- [Kaguya] My sincerest
apologies,

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.148
but I simply don't see a problem

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:09.151
with anything that
I said to you.

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:10.655
- So then the needs of the many

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.458
outweigh the needs of the few?

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.132
Is that the kind of
justice Lady Astrea wants?

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:20.174
(somber music)

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:22.913
- You're an idiot!

00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:23.915
(Ryu gasps)

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.718
You're so unbelievably naive

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.756
it makes me want to throw up.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:31.162
Please keep in mind, Lady
Astrea is an inspiration

00:00:31.262 --> 00:00:32.966
and I deeply respect her,

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.203
but her silly idea of justice,

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:38.644
as harsh as it is,
it's just unrealistic.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:41.083
You should try not to
lead yourself astray.

00:00:41.183 --> 00:00:43.253
We don't have the power
to save everyone.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:44.421
- What's the point of peace

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.994
if we sacrifice people
to obtain it?

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:49.198
- Listen. You're quite strong.

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:52.672
Strong enough to be
considered my archrival.

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:56.346
But truthfully, when it comes
to your mind and emotions,

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.483
you're the weakest
in the Familia.

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:03.226
- (scoffs) Now you're just
insulting me! (groans)

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.531
- How many have
we lost to Evilus?

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.938
How many strong and capable
warriors have fallen?

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:10.407
And innocent citizens?

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:13.213
How much of their
blood has been shed?

00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:15.651
You want to save everyone?

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:17.087
Well, you can't.

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:18.891
(Ryu grunts)

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.128
The justice you like
to prattle on about?

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.268
It's nothing but
a convenient ideal.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.741
There will come a time
in everyone's life

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:28.677
when we're forced to choose.

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:31.315
That includes me and you.

00:01:32.384 --> 00:01:35.991
Perhaps you ought to try
opening up your eyes.

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:38.764
Maybe then you'll
finally see things

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.433
for what they really are.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:44.408
(solemn music)

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:49.886
(Ryu sighs)

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:52.457
- [Ryu] But still. I just.

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:56.767
(Opening Song)

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:27.214
(dramatic music)

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:31.389
(Bell panting)
(wolves growling)

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.961
- I've lost count of
how many we fought.

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:37.835
(Bell grunting)

00:03:37.935 --> 00:03:39.305
Gotta take 'em down fast,

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:42.712
or else they'll overwhelm
us again. (groans)

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:45.383
(Ryu sighs)

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:48.256
It's too late!
We're being overrun!

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:50.293
- [Ryu] Mr. Cranel, fall back!

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:53.233
- So what are we gonna do?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.106
- We don't have a choice.
The time's now.

00:03:56.206 --> 00:03:57.976
(Bell gasps)

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:59.278
Do it!

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.017
- Fire bolt!

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:06.292
(fire crashing and crackling)

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:11.904
(Bell grunts)

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:14.609
Miss Ryu, was that a...?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.884
- Correct. A Blazerock that
I confiscated from the Dwarf.

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:22.526
An item stolen from Jura's
men actually saved our lives.

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:23.861
How's that for irony?

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:26.232
- Yeah, do we have
any more of them left?

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.504
- We have five in total.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:30.240
- [Bell] Miss Ryu wants
us to avoid battle

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.643
wherever possible,

00:04:31.744 --> 00:04:33.981
but the monsters
just keep on coming.

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.085
Huge groups of them all at once.

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:39.224
- Wait, hang on.
Give me just a moment.

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:41.262
I need to update our map.

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:42.197
(Bell gasps)

00:04:42.297 --> 00:04:43.667
Keep an eye out for me.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:44.769
- Will do.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.046
Pretty good, I didn't
know you could make maps.

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:52.083
- Well, some basic ones, yes.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:53.954
But nothing like
a professional thief

00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:55.925
or a cartographer could make.

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.469
- [Bell] (sighs) It's always
Miss Ryu keeping me safe,

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.105
never the other way around.

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.778
I feel so weak.

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:08.985
- [Ryu] Mr. Cranel, you're
wasting too much energy

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:10.320
in battle.
- Hm?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.625
- [Ryu] You need a more
efficient approach.

00:05:12.725 --> 00:05:16.265
- Yeah, I know. You're
are absolutely right.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:18.302
But I just can't do it!

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.306
I can't keep going at this rate.

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:22.846
The monsters are too
strong and too fast.

00:05:22.946 --> 00:05:26.319
The more I panic, the
more mistakes I make!

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.356
If something doesn't change.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.663
I'm really sorry.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.468
(somber music)

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.011
- Mr. Cranel, you're still
nothing like most adventurers.

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:40.413
(Bell sighs)

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:42.519
You're doing a great job.

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:44.790
It's completely normal
to get flustered

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:45.892
and make mistakes.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:49.298
It is your first trip
into the Deep Floors.

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:51.870
Any other adventurer
would be yelling at me

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.410
for making unreasonable
demands and what not.

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.083
You're being way
too hard on yourself.

00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:59.218
You get it?

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:01.055
That's why you're different.

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:03.694
(Bell scoffs)

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:07.034
In fact, if you had just
a little more confidence

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:11.075
you could be even stronger
than you already are.

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:18.791
Uh.
(solemn music)

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.093
(Bell gasps)

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:23.567
Pay close attention to the
enemy's movements, study them.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.540
Monsters in the Deep Floors
are highly intelligent.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.711
They'll employ more
sophisticated tactics

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:32.050
than any of the monsters
you've encountered up til now.

00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:34.422
- [Bell] Got it.

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.459
- I've noticed your right
arm tends to get shaky

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.962
when you're nervous.

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:42.304
Aim for their stones, and
don't tense up your shoulder.

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:43.874
- Okay.

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:46.045
- And let me do some
of the heavy lifting

00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.414
from the back line.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:51.022
Because for now, we're
a party. You understand?

00:06:51.122 --> 00:06:52.224
- I do.

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:53.927
- Remember what I taught you?

00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:56.867
Apart from the aiming for
their magic stones advice?

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:59.137
- Use surroundings
to my advantage.

00:07:01.475 --> 00:07:03.948
- [Ryu] Don't forget that. Ever.

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:05.851
I know you can do it.

00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:08.857
(solemn music)

00:07:08.957 --> 00:07:09.760
- It's funny.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.095
It almost feels like you're

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:13.066
kinda my mentor or something.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.806
- Perhaps in another life,
maybe I could've been.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.748
- [Lili] Welcome to the
27th floor, everyone.

00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:23.420
- We finally made it.

00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:25.524
- Don't let your guard down.

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:27.595
(monsters growling)

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:29.565
- Monsters incoming!

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:32.805
(dramatic music)

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:35.878
(Welf yelling)

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:36.981
- Kazuki!

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:42.658
(fire roaring)
(triumphant dramatic music)

00:07:44.461 --> 00:07:46.901
- I guess he's got
this one covered, too.

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:49.438
- Okay, guys, is it me,
or does that thing

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.543
just keep getting stronger?

00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:53.914
- He's been blastin'
monsters left and right

00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:56.352
and that blade
still ain't broken.

00:07:56.452 --> 00:07:58.690
That's some good
stuff, blacksmith.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:01.495
- Now that's pretty impressive.

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:03.466
An indestructible magic sword

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:06.506
unlike anything
anyone's ever seen.

00:08:06.606 --> 00:08:08.242
(Welf panting)

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:09.311
You okay over there?

00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:12.818
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good. (grunts)

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:15.289
- Let's keep moving.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:19.533
- Mr. Cranel, are you
semi-familiar

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:21.703
with the 37th floor layout?

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:23.039
- If I remember correctly,

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.043
the floor's made up
of circular walls

00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:27.014
called "The Great Rings,"

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:29.886
and it's divided into
five different areas.

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:33.594
- That's right. A tunnel
leads to the 38th floor.

00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:37.100
It's actually located at the
heart of the innermost area.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.340
Then there's a tunnel
leading up to the 36th floor.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.410
That's the outermost area.

00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:44.481
Be sure to remember that.

00:08:44.582 --> 00:08:49.424
- So the outermost
area, up to 36.

00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.529
- [Ryu] We ought to
top off our health.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:54.101
- [Bell] Oh, good idea. (gasps)

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.038
(suspenseful music)

00:08:56.138 --> 00:08:57.876
- Please take it.

00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:01.550
- Mm. D-do I really have to?

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.421
- This isn't the time to
be squeamish, Mr. Cranel.

00:09:04.522 --> 00:09:05.824
Just drink it.

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:10.668
- Okay. Mm.

00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:12.203
Um, it looks pretty old,
don't ya think?

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:15.444
- A little mold in a potion
isn't going to hurt you.

00:09:15.545 --> 00:09:16.746
- Miss Ryu?

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:21.489
- Just take it. It should
work just fine, I think.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.227
- Wait, you think? (groans)

00:09:29.573 --> 00:09:32.243
(Bell sighs)

00:09:33.145 --> 00:09:35.449
(Bell gulping)

00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.657
(Bell screaming)

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.505
Hmm?

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.340
All the pain just went away.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.782
I feel like I can fight again.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:53.118
- Let's get going.
- Roger!

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:00.868
(Bell gasps)

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:04.207
(wolves growling)
(dramatic music)

00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:05.410
Do we run?

00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:07.782
- It's too late now.
We cannot escape.

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:09.552
Don't forget what
we talked about!

00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:12.190
- Right!

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.426
Here goes!

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.165
(suspenseful dramatic music)

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.606
(Tsubaki yelling)

00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.308
(Anya screams)

00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:24.214
(Chloe grunts)

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.087
- Eat this!

00:10:27.187 --> 00:10:30.259
(blood squelching)

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:33.534
(Lunor grunts)

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:36.739
(monsters screeching)

00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:40.615
I know that I'm no expert
on the Dungeon or anything,

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:43.720
but is it always this
frickin' noisy down here?

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.358
- Well, if they've always
been causing such destruction,

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:49.297
I imagine there would be a
lot more dead adventurers

00:10:49.397 --> 00:10:50.466
lying around on the floor.

00:10:50.568 --> 00:10:52.538
- I'm positive it
was an Irregular!

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.310
Never seen the Dungeon
act so ferocious!

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.147
- Mm.
- Hm?

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.218
What's wrong?

00:10:59.318 --> 00:11:02.357
- I can sense the presence
of a terrifying monster.

00:11:02.457 --> 00:11:04.862
- What? How do you know Chloe?

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:07.802
- [Chloe] Call it a
feeling. A hunch, I guess.

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:11.208
But it's making the fur
on my tail stand up.

00:11:11.308 --> 00:11:12.778
It could be on this floor.

00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:15.350
It could be above
us or below us.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.759
Either way, there's something
uncatural skulking around.

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:23.198
(suspenseful music)

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:30.346
(Ouka gasps)

00:11:31.817 --> 00:11:33.854
(Chigusa whimpers)

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:36.392
- [Lili] Members of
the search party?

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:40.567
- [Bors] Yeah. That ugly
beast made quick work of 'em.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:42.137
(Cassandra whimpers)

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:45.276
- [Welf] Bell fought against a
monster that did all of this?

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.347
- Yeah, but what in the hell is
capable

00:11:47.447 --> 00:11:48.984
of such destruction?

00:11:50.788 --> 00:11:51.957
- Master Bors.

00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:54.395
Take us to where you
last saw Master Bell.

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:56.431
Right now, please.

00:11:56.532 --> 00:11:58.402
- [Bors] Sure, sure thing.

00:11:58.503 --> 00:12:01.576
(suspenseful music)

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:03.880
- [Marie] (sobs) No. No, don't!

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.383
Please, don't go that way.

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.087
(Aisha gasps)

00:12:07.187 --> 00:12:10.193
(Aisha groans)

00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:13.098
(gentle music)

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:25.489
(monster growling)

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.403
(Bell sighs)

00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:36.713
- The monster you saw
is called a Peluda.

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:39.785
They infect their prey
with a toxic substance.

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:42.057
If I had to guess, the
adventurers in that room

00:12:42.157 --> 00:12:45.897
probably died as a result
of a Peluda's poison quills.

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:48.369
If circumstances allow,

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.674
it's best to flee altogether.

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:51.743
- Are there any other monsters

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:53.780
I should be on the lookout for?

00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:55.183
- [Ryu] Spartoi.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:58.055
They're extremely skilled
at hand-to-hand combat.

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.726
The fact that they're
armed with weapons

00:12:59.826 --> 00:13:01.329
certainly doesn't help.

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:03.533
- Peludas and Spartoi.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:05.369
I'll be sure to remember that.

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.486
(Bell sighs)

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:15.123
Uh, Miss Ryu?

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:18.229
(Bell gasps)

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:20.868
(Ooze squelching)

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.072
- What's that?
- Ooze.

00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:26.045
They secrete toxins from
their mucous membranes.

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:29.585
They come in a wide variety
of different colors.

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:31.623
And the blue ones
are safe to drink.

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:32.991
- [Bell] Oh, yeah?

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:37.200
(bright music)

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.546
- Drink up.

00:13:43.647 --> 00:13:45.150
- I don't wanna!

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.819
- Don't worry,
I'm going to drink

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:49.458
the other half this time, here.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.031
(gentle bright music)

00:13:57.474 --> 00:13:59.411
(Bell gulping)

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:03.219
- [Bell] (groans) Oh
Gods, it's disgusting.

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:06.559
It feels like my throat's
covered in slimy snot.

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:10.500
Here you go. Brace yourself,
Miss Ryu.

00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:13.540
And I'm sorry for putting
my mouth on the flask.

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:19.619
You're not going to drink it?

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:22.123
I mean, yeah, it's really
gross, but I still drank it.

00:14:22.223 --> 00:14:24.495
Come on, that's not fair.

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.533
You have to drink some, too.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.605
- We ought to ration
what resources we have.

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:31.510
This floor lacks a water source.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.582
- Yeah well, I still think
you should drink some.

00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:35.951
- [Ryu] Oh, I almost forgot.

00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:38.590
You were going to ask
me a question earlier.

00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:40.895
- [Bell] Oh, um.

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:44.167
Adventurers who go exploring
in the Deep Floors,

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:45.971
I was just wondering
if there were any

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:48.242
other two-man parties like us.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.914
- I highly doubt it.

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:53.820
At minimum, you'd want a
group of three, no, four.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.993
And ideally, you'd want
at least one healer.

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:59.498
(Bell sighs)

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:02.571
That's just how dangerous
it is down here.

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:06.980
(slow dramatic music)

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.451
- There's nobody here.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:10.654
I watched my men die.

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.827
How can their corpses just
up and vanish like that?

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.564
The hell's going on?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:18.837
- Okay, any ideas where Bell
and Gale Wind could have gone?

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:21.676
- There has to be a
clue. Let's look around.

00:15:29.224 --> 00:15:32.096
- This room's in even
worse shape than the last.

00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:34.400
Must've been one
hell of a battle.

00:15:37.808 --> 00:15:38.877
- [Ryu] This wall.

00:15:38.977 --> 00:15:40.547
- [Bell] One of the Rings?

00:15:42.184 --> 00:15:45.289
- Yes, I'm sure of it.
It's the Third Ring.

00:15:46.726 --> 00:15:48.128
There are five Rings in total,

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:52.036
but each one of the Rings
have a slightly different hue.

00:15:52.136 --> 00:15:54.975
Only the Third Ring, located
halfway into the floor,

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.548
is chalk white.

00:15:57.648 --> 00:16:01.856
It's hard to see, but the
wall appears to curve inwards.

00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:03.760
- (gasps) Then that means.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.533
- Precisely. It's the inner
side of the Third Ring,

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:10.039
so we're standing in
between two and three.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:12.712
Now that we've determined
exactly which area we're in,

00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:15.818
we can also figure out where
the outer exit is located.

00:16:15.918 --> 00:16:17.053
- Right!

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.391
We're finally making
some real progress.

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.163
We're actually starting
to get somewhere.

00:16:22.263 --> 00:16:23.533
Let's keep it up!

00:16:25.637 --> 00:16:27.107
We're going to survive.

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:30.714
And then we'll make it back
to the surface. Together!

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:35.122
(water whooshing)

00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:36.424
- What could've?

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:40.132
- [Welf] That is a big hole...

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.569
- [Lili] If it was the Lambton.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:43.472
(explosion booming)

00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:46.779
(monster screeching)

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:50.720
(suspenseful music)

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.092
Master Bell might be down there.

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:54.729
- You're kiddin' me.

00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:58.903
Wait a minute. He might be even
farther down than we thought?

00:16:59.003 --> 00:17:01.375
- We don't have
definitive proof,

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.078
but the one thing
we do know for sure

00:17:03.178 --> 00:17:05.216
is that Master Bell isn't here.

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:06.786
So let's keep-
(water splashing)

00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.055
(group gasps)

00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:09.926
(dramatic music)

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:11.762
- Voltimeria!

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.633
(monster growls)

00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:14.969
(Chigusa gasps)

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.075
- [Chigusa] Is that from the...?
(Bors growls)

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:21.583
- So you're the pieces of
shit that ate my people!

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.418
(Bors roars and grunts)

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.120
(dramatic music)

00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:26.158
(Aisha exclaims)

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.395
- These things have an
insane amount of durability.

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:30.133
Don't challenge them head-on!

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:31.836
- Make a break for the exit!

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:35.442
(water splashing)
(group gasps)

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:36.512
- We're trapped!

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:37.581
(Ouka grunting)

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.486
(Ouka yelling)

00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.727
(Daphne and Ouka grunt)

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:45.096
(monsters screeching)

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:48.402
- They just keep
on comin' at us!

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:51.241
- Finally, the 27th floor, meow!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:53.680
Ryu! Where are you, Ryu?

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:57.186
Ryu! Ryu, where are you!

00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:59.223
- Shut up, you stupid cat.

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:00.894
(Anya screaming)

00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:02.698
(monsters screeching)
(groups gasps)

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:04.835
- There's more of them?

00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:12.350
- [Anya] They left, meow meow.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.221
- Something doesn't feel right.

00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:16.091
We need to get out of here.

00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:18.195
(dramatic music)

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:20.399
- There's too many of them.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:22.605
- They're blocking
our escape path.

00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:23.840
Is there another exit?

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.142
- No, that tunnel
is the only way

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:26.913
for us to get out of here!

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:27.848
- Here goes!

00:18:27.949 --> 00:18:29.852
Out of the way!

00:18:29.952 --> 00:18:32.924
(dramatic music)
(fire roars)

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.561
- My turn. Die!

00:18:36.064 --> 00:18:38.636
(Aisha grunts)

00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:39.972
(Ouka grunts)

00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:43.245
(Daphne grunts)

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:44.748
- Shit. Shit!

00:18:45.817 --> 00:18:48.890
(Ouka and Bors grunting)

00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:50.660
(Lili whimpers)

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.338
- [Anya] Meow?

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:58.544
- The hell happened here?

00:18:58.644 --> 00:19:01.281
- I've never seen
anything quite like it.

00:19:01.382 --> 00:19:02.984
We might be looking
at the handiwork

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:04.922
of that thing you
mentioned earlier.

00:19:05.022 --> 00:19:08.128
- Uh. Someone's coming.

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:09.966
(group gasps)
- [Anya] Meow, there!

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.704
(dramatic music)
- You sons of bitches!

00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:15.209
(Aisha panting)

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.779
- Stubborn bastards!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.317
- [Daphne] If this keeps up,
we're gonna run out of energy

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:21.387
way before they do.

00:19:21.488 --> 00:19:23.092
- Every second that
we're stuck here

00:19:23.192 --> 00:19:25.196
is a waste of precious time.

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:26.999
(Welf panting)

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.406
(suspenseful music)

00:19:31.742 --> 00:19:32.712
(Welf yelling)

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:37.788
(fire roaring)
(dramatic triumphant music)

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:41.361
(monsters chittering)

00:19:42.129 --> 00:19:42.998
(Welf groans)

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.902
- He's reached his limit.

00:19:45.003 --> 00:19:46.939
(Welf exclaims)

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.146
(Welf groaning)

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:51.682
- Should we fall back?

00:19:51.782 --> 00:19:54.856
No, wait. Can't
lose more ground.

00:19:54.956 --> 00:19:55.924
(monsters howling)

00:19:56.024 --> 00:19:59.999
(group gasps)
(dramatic music)

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.068
- Seriously?

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:02.270
- Even more?

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.042
- Is this the end
of the line for us?

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:06.111
(Cassandra grunts)

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:08.683
- Lady Cassandra!
- Cassandra!

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:11.856
(Cassandra groans)

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:15.864
(Cassandra gasps)

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:18.803
(monster screeching)

00:20:18.904 --> 00:20:21.809
(dramatic music)

00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:27.554
(Laura grunts)

00:20:30.761 --> 00:20:33.299
(Laura screaming)

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.438
(monsters yelling)

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.141
- Fighting each other?

00:20:38.242 --> 00:20:40.479
- What in the hell
is going on here?

00:20:42.183 --> 00:20:45.624
- Could this really be?

00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:46.792
(Laura gasps)

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:48.395
It's the Xenos!

00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:51.435
(Laura chuckles)

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:52.805
(triumphant music)

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:56.077
- Hello again, my
surface-dwelling friends.

00:20:56.177 --> 00:20:57.648
- [Lili] How'd you
know where to find us?

00:20:57.748 --> 00:20:59.418
- Fels told us you were here.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:01.355
So glad we made it in time.

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.927
- We made a promise to
our dear friend Mr. Bell,

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:06.464
that the next time you and
your friends were in trouble,

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.703
we, the Xenos, would
come to the rescue.

00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:11.474
(Lili gasps)

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.490
- Hm, how much can I help
him grow before I disappear?

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:22.163
Expecting to sacrifice
myself right off the bat

00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:27.473
is a terrible plan, but I need
to be prepared for the worst.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:32.618
Something tells me the Deep
Floors won't be kind enough

00:21:32.718 --> 00:21:36.157
to let us both escape
with our lives.

00:21:36.257 --> 00:21:37.994
And eventually,
the time will come

00:21:38.094 --> 00:21:40.499
when a sacrifice has to be made.

00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:46.478
Even now, Mr. Cranel is chasing
after his ideal outcome.

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:49.083
A future where he and I survive.

00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:51.856
Did I used to go
chasing after ideals

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:54.460
with that same heartfelt
look in my eyes

00:21:54.561 --> 00:21:56.799
all those years ago?

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:57.901
Hm.

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:02.343
There will come a time in
everyone's life

00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:04.247
when we're forced to choose.

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:06.919
That includes me and you.

00:22:08.757 --> 00:22:11.194
You should be happy, Kaguya.

00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:13.633
It looks like I'm
on your side now.

00:22:15.804 --> 00:22:19.410
(Ending Song)

00:23:45.851 --> 00:23:48.522
[Ryu] Next time. Desperate.
