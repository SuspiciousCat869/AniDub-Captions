WEBVTT

00:00:01.738 --> 00:00:03.173
(dramatic music)

00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:04.977
- [Lili] Master Bell,
over there!

00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:06.780
Take out the nest!

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:10.020
(dramatic music)

00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:17.735
- Fire bolt!

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:21.042
(dramatic music)

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.860
- [Aisha] Stay sharp!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.697
More incoming!

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.666
(dramatic music)

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.339
(Welf and Ouka yelling)

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.548
(dramatic music)

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.727
("Tentou")

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:21.951
(gentle music)

00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:23.521
- Excuse me, Ouka.

00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:26.092
What exactly are we
doing all this for?

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:28.664
Is it a ritual to
keep monsters away?

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:31.202
- I don't think that's
quite right actually.

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:32.404
- [Bell] We're doing
it to take advantage

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.075
of the dungeon's nature.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.045
I only recently learned
about this myself,

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:38.450
but destroying the
terrain causes the dungeon

00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.255
to focus its attention on
repairing itself first,

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:44.428
meaning it will stop spawning
monsters for a brief time.

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.299
- Oh...

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.637
You're coming into
your own, Bell.

00:02:49.506 --> 00:02:51.376
And you're really taking charge.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:54.583
You're the one who defeated
the most monsters too.

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:58.289
Deep down inside, I always knew
that you were something special,

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.495
but now it's like you're
something else altogether.

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:02.264
- I agree.

00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:03.534
Level four adventurers are

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.103
in a whole different league.

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:06.807
- Yes, I think so as well.

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.615
Even the way you move is
different from the War Game.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:11.382
Ugh, sorry.

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.652
Dunno how to put it.

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:14.455
- His moves are
certainly sharper.

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:15.658
Is that what you
mean, Cassandra?

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.129
- Yes, that's
exactly what I mean.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.933
- Truly incredible.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:20.802
- Ah, gosh.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.137
Thanks, you guys!

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:23.807
(pot clanging)

00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:25.110
- Okay, enough chit-chat!

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.083
Everybody get back to work on
the double!

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:31.288
(hammer clanging)

00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:36.199
- What's got you worried?
Is it me?

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.438
- It is. I sensed you had
a very difficult time

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.612
when it came to the
situation with the Xenos.

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:45.818
I became concerned that you
couldn't fight against monsters

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:47.320
anymore after that.

00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:50.294
And, well, I must admit,

00:03:50.394 --> 00:03:53.033
seeing you fight on the
way here was a surprise.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.574
- I decided that being a
hypocrite was the only choice.

00:03:56.674 --> 00:03:59.245
- You are just a hypocrite!

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.650
- Those who are villified
as hypocrites,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.324
they are the ones who have
the makings of a hero.

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:08.530
- Defeating other monsters
in order to save the Xenos,

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:10.868
it may be morally wrong

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:14.342
and some people may speak
ill of me because of it,

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.479
but it is what I need to do.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.949
It is the only way.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:20.588
- I understand.

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.663
- So what's with
the long face, huh?

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.934
I don't see any reason
to be so concerned.

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.036
He's gonna be fine.

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:29.506
- Look, I realize that,

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:32.377
but Master Bell is
different now, you know?

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:35.183
He's more dependable than
before.

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:38.023
Yet at the same time,
something's off.

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:39.258
I can't help but feel

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:42.799
like he's drawing
farther away from me.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:44.770
- That doesn't change what
a supporter should do.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.573
You just have to
keep chasing after him

00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:48.711
and providing the
assistance he needs.

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:49.812
Isn't that right?

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.353
I'll be up in the front
right by his side.

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:55.558
Actually, I'm gonna
work to out-class him.

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:57.528
Whatever you're gonna be doing,

00:04:57.628 --> 00:04:59.533
try not to get left in the dust.

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.035
- That will not be a problem!

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.204
I'm his supporter and the best

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:03.373
dang partner he's ever had!

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:04.743
You hear me, Master Welf?

00:05:04.843 --> 00:05:06.513
I would never let
a loser like you

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:07.882
get the better of me!
- Yeah!

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:09.619
Now that's more like it!

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.723
Okay, that'll be enough of that!

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.028
- Eat it!

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:16.800
(soft music)

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:24.549
- [Aisha] This kid's presence
is having a positive influence

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:26.553
on the party as a whole.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.858
He's not just pulling them

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.194
along with his strength.

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:31.597
He's encouraging them

00:05:31.697 --> 00:05:34.503
and making sure they all
share the same commitment,

00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:36.540
which stimulates their growth.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.779
Well, look at that.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.952
That makes you a real
hero, Bell Cranel.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.831
- [All] Let's dig in!

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.835
- Everyone, eat as
much as you'd like.

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:53.608
There's plenty of extra
helpings to go around.

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:55.878
- I'm sorry that you have
to eat all by yourself

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:57.047
over there, Bell.

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.316
- Oh, no worries.

00:05:58.416 --> 00:05:59.752
Food's still good.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.326
- [Mikoto] I asked Lady
Aisha for some help.

00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:04.662
We added medicinal herbs

00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:06.667
and fruits that grow
right here in the dungeon.

00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.504
Have to say, it
turned out tasty.

00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:11.810
- Yeah, it's a unique
flavor, but I like it.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.783
Don't think I've ever had
anything like this before.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.421
- No ingredients like
this in the Far East.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:19.425
The dungeon food
tastes kind of weird.

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:21.563
- Master Ouka, you should
be praising the cooks

00:06:21.663 --> 00:06:25.303
for their work instead,
particularly Lady Chigusa.

00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:28.476
- No, Lili, don't
concern yourself with me!

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:31.550
- Pardon? While the food
is quite delicious,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.223
aren't you kind of concerned
about using too much water?

00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:37.762
I've had experiences
like that before,

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:40.033
running out of water
mid expedition

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.706
and being forced to turn
back after coming so far.

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:44.408
- There are a number
of springs around

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:45.611
where we can get water.

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.548
Even more if we
proceed further down.

00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:49.819
And we don't have to worry
about different factions

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.090
like the Apollon Familia
stealing it.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.094
They won't be anywhere near us.

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:55.831
- I suppose if you say so.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.502
- Quit bringing up
all the problems.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:58.804
Don't be such a downer.

00:06:58.904 --> 00:07:00.073
- [Cassandra] I'm not
being a downer!

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.242
- [Lili] She's right!

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:03.681
- [Cassandra] I'm
just being real!

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:06.553
- I have to say, this
feels very strange.

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:09.091
We're washing dishes in
the middle of the dungeon.

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:12.230
- Right? It almost feels like
we're still back at home.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.669
- It's hard to believe
we've made it all the way down

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:17.575
to the 24th floor and
we did it so fast.

00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:19.445
I doubt we would've
made such quick progress

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:21.149
without Master Bell
in our party.

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:22.785
He's something special.

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:25.691
- I was overjoyed.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:28.630
When Master Bell came and
asked us to join the expedition

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.035
so that we could grow
stronger together,

00:07:31.135 --> 00:07:34.441
I mean, I'm still just
a novice sorcerer,

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:36.479
but I wanted to prove
useful to him.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.849
Though I do worry

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.522
that I may be a hindrance
to you and the others.

00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:42.157
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.169
Come what may, I fully
intend to protect you

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:50.541
with my life, Lady Haruhime.

00:07:50.642 --> 00:07:51.743
- Oh, Mikoto...

00:07:51.843 --> 00:07:52.912
- I made sure to prepare.

00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:54.549
Master Takemikazuchi
put me through

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:57.387
some really rigorous
training, let me tell you.

00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:00.761
(sword scratching)

00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:02.565
- What do you think?

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.201
Is Hakugen again easy to use?

00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.905
- It's the absolute best!

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:08.611
Honestly, I was stunned
by how impressive it is.

00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:09.946
It can cut through even

00:08:10.046 --> 00:08:11.917
the toughest of monsters
like they're nothing.

00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:15.624
- Well, yeah, I did use a
Unicorn Horn to make it after
all.

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:18.564
Little Bit gave me a nasty
tongue-lashing for it too.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.135
Says I shouldn't give you
any preferential treatment.

00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.707
All done. Kay, now let's
see your other one.

00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:25.744
- [Bell] I'm trying to get
used to wielding Hakugen

00:08:25.844 --> 00:08:28.449
so I haven't been using the
Goddess's Knife much at all.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.619
- [Welf] I figured.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.223
But it doesn't hurt
to be prepared.

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:34.529
- Say, Welf, what's it made of?

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:36.199
I assume it's probably mithril?

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.904
- Yep. Not only is it easy
material to work with,

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:41.042
but it also has high
magic conductivity.

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:42.945
It's one of the best
ingots gets you can get.

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:44.750
But even though it
transmits magic well,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.555
that doesn't mean it can
be magically-empowered.

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:49.559
The blade will actually
disperse any magic

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.596
that you try to imbue it with.

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:57.240
- So it has high magic
conductivity,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.079
but it can't store any of it.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:02.818
- [Daphne] You've done even
better than I expected.

00:09:02.918 --> 00:09:04.755
Your orders were pretty precise

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.026
and not a single
person doubted them.

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:10.500
It's just like I figured,
you're perfect for a strategist.

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:11.737
- That really means a lot.

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:13.273
Thanks. I owe it all to you

00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:15.744
for teaching me what I needed
to know before we left.

00:09:15.844 --> 00:09:17.081
- Only one problem.

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:18.550
- Huh?

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.952
- We are entering the
lower floors

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:22.558
where we don't have
any experience.

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.796
That makes it harder to
predict what'll happen

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:26.466
and the strategist
needs to take

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:28.671
the worst possible
scenarios into account.

00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.808
- Worst possible scenarios?

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:31.910
- Mhmm.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.180
The dungeon is a cruel tyrant.

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:37.421
There are going to be times
when you have to be heartless.

00:09:37.522 --> 00:09:42.130
That being said, I think you
can make levelheaded decisions.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.705
- [Cassandra] I still felt
an awful sense of foreboding

00:09:45.805 --> 00:09:48.075
even after I woke up.

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:49.712
And no matter what
I say to Daphne,

00:09:49.812 --> 00:09:51.315
she just won't believe me.

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:55.423
- Oh? Was your nightmare
honestly that horrifying?

00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:57.662
- I saw this very
creepy green moss

00:09:57.762 --> 00:09:59.933
that grew and spread
all over everything.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:03.807
It's definitely a sign
of bad things to come.

00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:05.845
- It's going to be okay.

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:07.882
No matter what
happens out there,

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.119
I know our party can handle it.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.123
- But Chigusa...

00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:13.293
- Just relax.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:14.829
Try to get some sleep.

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:17.167
We all need our rest, don't we?

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:23.379
- [Cassandra] Sure.

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:30.728
- [Bell] It's time
for a shift change.

00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:33.967
- Oh? Doesn't feel
like it's been that long.

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:37.107
- Miss Aisha, thanks
for helping us.

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.646
I'm glad that we have
you on this expedition.

00:10:39.746 --> 00:10:42.017
- Happy too. We're
close, you know?

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:43.921
Just a stone throw away
from the passage

00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:45.490
that leads further down.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.563
We'll be launching our attack
on the lower floors tomorrow.

00:10:48.663 --> 00:10:49.966
- So soon.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.838
- [Aisha] Our success
depends entirely on you.

00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:54.676
If you bite the dust out there,

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:57.314
the whole party will follow
suit.

00:10:57.414 --> 00:10:58.650
The next part of the dungeon

00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:01.021
is an entirely
different beast, Bell.

00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:03.693
So listen, you need to be ready.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:05.564
The further we go down,

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.602
the more clearly you
will come to realize

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.541
just how brutal
the dungeon really is.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:12.779
Bell Cranel, are you truly ready

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:15.216
to step foot into
that kind of world?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.291
- Until the deepest level
of the dungeon is conquered,

00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:23.165
coexistence between humanity
and the Xenos is impossible.

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:28.009
- I would be lying to you
if I said I wasn't afraid.

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.883
But still, I really wanna
keep pressing onward.

00:11:33.018 --> 00:11:34.889
- That's the face I like to see.

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:36.893
It's even better than before.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.783
(footsteps shuffling)

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:55.129
(water crackling)

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:04.849
- [Welf] Whoa.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:07.955
- So this is the 25th
floor, the Water City.

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:10.527
- So here it is, guys.

00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:12.130
The Great Falls.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.802
- [Aisha] That humongous
waterfall

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:17.709
continues all the way
down to the 27th floor.

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:19.679
There's basically no
chance of survival

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:22.483
if you fall, so watch your step.

00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:23.988
- [Cassandra] I definitely will.

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:27.595
- [Welf] So anybody know
how far this path goes?

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:28.830
- It says on the map

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.034
we'll be reaching a
side tunnel shortly.

00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:32.872
After we enter, Lady Aisha said

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:35.911
that things will return
to the usual maze layout.

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:37.782
- Is that the spot
where we came in?

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.117
- Everything's so huge,

00:12:39.217 --> 00:12:41.789
it screws with your
distance perception, huh?

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:43.092
- There's so much water in here.

00:12:43.192 --> 00:12:45.898
I have to wonder where
it all ends up going.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.802
I know that the dungeon
is pretty vast,

00:12:47.902 --> 00:12:49.739
but it feels like it
would overflow, right?

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:52.076
- From what I understand,
most of it eventually

00:12:52.177 --> 00:12:54.982
flows into a lake
outside of Orario.

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:56.418
And I heard that long ago,

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:59.257
aquatic monsters actually
expanded out into the sea

00:12:59.357 --> 00:13:00.727
through that route.

00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.264
- Well, then if that's the case,

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:04.702
there must be monsters lurking
in these water as well.

00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:06.371
- [Bell] I would think so.

00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:08.576
- [Lili] Okay, everyone,

00:13:08.676 --> 00:13:10.213
it's time to review our mission.

00:13:10.313 --> 00:13:14.154
The items we need to retrieve
are 10 shells from Blue Crabs,

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:16.660
along with three fins
from Aqua Serpents

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.563
or 30 fangs from Raider Fish.

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:20.066
Or if we aim for rare monsters,

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.972
then we just need one Mystic
Crystal from the Carbuncle.

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:24.374
If we choose resources,

00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:27.079
we need to gather a thousand
grams of Azure Stone.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.086
As for the expedition itself,
we've already made it as far

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:32.725
as we need to for the floor
requirement.

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:34.027
I don't think it's necessary

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:36.833
for us to push any
further to the 26th floor.

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.001
- I agree with that.

00:13:38.102 --> 00:13:40.039
Everything has gone smoothly so
far.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.843
But we should take things
slowly.

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:42.945
- For sure.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:44.648
For the rest of our expedition,

00:13:44.748 --> 00:13:46.018
I suggest we use the camp ground

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.055
from yesterday on 24 as a base.

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:49.825
Then each day, we'll
come down here

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.363
to gradually explore
the 25th floor.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.036
Master Bell, does
that work for you?

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:57.106
- Sounds like a plan.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:03.019
- Notice there are rapids

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:05.423
that run across various
areas on the floor.

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:07.193
Although we're equipped
with the Undine Cloth

00:14:07.293 --> 00:14:09.932
to help protect against
water-based attacks,

00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:12.805
it's best to exercise caution.

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:14.875
Now, I don't wanna be
a cheapskate about it,

00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:16.913
but aside from Lady Aisha,

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:19.451
we've prepared supplies
and equipment for everyone,

00:14:19.552 --> 00:14:21.054
including the Undine Cloths,

00:14:21.154 --> 00:14:23.392
plus a newly made Goliath Robe,

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:26.867
and not to mention an
extravagant amount of rare items

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:29.170
that Master Welf brought
to craft new gear.

00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:32.878
Needless to say, it ended up
costing us a really hefty sum.

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:34.081
Remember that!

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:35.917
You're going to have to work
extra hard

00:14:36.017 --> 00:14:38.089
on this expedition and
help us recoup the cash

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:40.259
that has been spent to get
here in the first place!

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:42.999
To be blunt, anyone who
lets themselves get defeated

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:45.170
by monsters is just wasting
precious time

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.706
and money!
- She scares me.

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:49.979
- Well, provided that our
expedition ends as planned,

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:53.118
we should easily be able
to earn that and then some.

00:14:54.455 --> 00:14:56.358
We have company.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.329
- [Bell] Blue crabs!

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:00.968
- Ugh, I've never seen
a crab walk like that.

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.038
- There's no time for talk!

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:06.211
(intense music)

00:15:10.153 --> 00:15:11.255
- That was easy!

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:13.560
We already have two
Blue Crab shells!

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.929
What a fantastic start!

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:17.000
- Gotta say that was
kind of anti-climactic

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.004
for our first battle
on the lower floors.

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.041
Shouldn't let it go
to our heads though.

00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:23.278
- It's crazy, there
really is water flowing

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:25.482
just about
everywhere on this floor.

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:28.757
- Remember that it's not the
water you have to worry about.

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.161
Please, I already told
you to be careful

00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:33.365
near the edge, didn't I?

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.034
- Right...

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:35.469
I'll watch my step.

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:37.207
(ominous music)

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.411
- It really does move fast.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:42.618
Falling in would send you
downstream in no time.

00:15:42.718 --> 00:15:43.920
- That is part of the problem.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.258
But the real danger
comes from the monsters.

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:47.694
Spend too long treading water

00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:50.968
and you'll be eaten after
becoming their plaything.

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:53.305
- Oh, that doesn't
sound very good at all.

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:55.276
- [Aisha] All of the water
that flows on this floor

00:15:55.376 --> 00:15:57.314
is connected to the Great Falls.

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.284
Even if you manage to
escape the monsters,

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:02.224
you'll almost certainly be
smashed into a bloody pulp

00:16:02.324 --> 00:16:03.560
if you fall into the basin.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.967
- Oh... It's terrifying just
thinking about it.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:08.435
- Aquatic monsters obviously

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.472
have the advantage
when underwater.

00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:13.145
We'd have no hope of putting
up a fight against them.

00:16:13.246 --> 00:16:14.949
- Also, I cannot
stress this enough,

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.554
but do be very wary
near the water's edge.

00:16:17.654 --> 00:16:22.130
- Well, what for exactly?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.769
(Haruhime screaming)

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:28.141
(triumphant music)

00:16:28.777 --> 00:16:31.515
(all gasping)

00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:35.156
- Nicely done, Mikoto.

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:36.491
You'll be just fine protecting

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:39.364
that bungling little fox
on your own.

00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:41.234
- I swore to her just last night

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.537
that I would keep her safe

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.775
no matter what happens
to come at us.

00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:46.111
- [Haruhime] Mikoto,
you saved me!

00:16:47.514 --> 00:16:49.451
(all clapping)

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:51.288
- Uh, um, thanks...

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:55.664
- [Welf] Hey, look
over there, Bell.

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:56.766
- Is that what I think it is?

00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:58.637
Under Coral?

00:16:58.737 --> 00:16:59.939
I remember in the field guide

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:02.009
that this is the only
place it can be found.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.112
- That's right.

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:04.348
Saw it once when I paid

00:17:04.448 --> 00:17:06.151
Goddess Hephaestus a visit.

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:08.790
I think it would make
for a good weapon.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.426
Any way we could snatch some?

00:17:10.527 --> 00:17:12.464
- Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Master Welf!

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:15.537
We just saw firsthand what kind
of threat the water here poses.

00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:18.275
There's too much risk in trying
to cross it just for that.

00:17:18.376 --> 00:17:21.348
- I bet we could sell that
Under Coral for a small fortune.

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:24.388
Oh, wow. There's actually an
Under Pearl stuck inside it.

00:17:24.488 --> 00:17:27.160
- Okay, fine! Just hurry across
and get as much as you can!

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.732
- [Welf] You're ticking
me off, Little Bit.

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:32.805
- I wasn't expecting
the two of us

00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:35.844
to get saddled
with fetching duty.

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:37.113
- Well, we don't have any
specialists

00:17:37.213 --> 00:17:39.785
like a thief or a
scout in our party.

00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:40.988
Whoa, look at that!

00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:42.858
There really is an
Under Pearl in here!

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.828
- Wonderful job, Bell!
You're the best!

00:17:44.928 --> 00:17:46.065
Now let's get moving, everyone!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.668
Don't get too greedy!

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:49.137
- Rich coming from you

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:50.006
- [Bell] Sure thing.

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:51.308
On our way.

00:17:53.814 --> 00:17:54.749
(rocks booming)

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.487
(Bell and Aisha gasping)

00:17:57.588 --> 00:18:00.660
(monster growling)

00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:10.346
- Oh, nice somersault!

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:15.089
(calming music)

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:17.327
- That was a crazy move
you used back there.

00:18:17.427 --> 00:18:18.730
- It's a martial art technique

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.703
that Lord Takemikazuchi
taught me before we left.

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.707
I must say that it
certainly came in handy.

00:18:23.807 --> 00:18:26.946
- [Welf] Sweet. This is
some high-quality stuff.

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:28.349
- You're not joking.

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:30.787
This alone could fetch
upwards of 3 million Valis.

00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:33.760
- Oh, you know what? You could
get three and a half million

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.162
with some smooth-talking.

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:38.168
- Did you say three and
a half million Valis?

00:18:38.268 --> 00:18:39.304
I love these expeditions.

00:18:39.404 --> 00:18:40.707
The lower floors are the best!

00:18:40.807 --> 00:18:43.680
- Lili, your eyes are
kind of freaking me out.

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:45.884
- Now it's really starting

00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:47.353
to feel like an expedition.

00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:50.292
- [Eina] I sure hope Bell
is doing okay down there.

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:54.033
They say the middle and the
lower floors are worlds apart.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.438
I wish I could have
given him more info.

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.580
Quests like these are
really on the rise lately,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.684
search parties looking
for missing people

00:19:02.784 --> 00:19:04.354
on the lower floors.

00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:06.859
If I remember right,
Mr. Luvis and Mr. Dormul

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.466
were also headed for the lower
floors to perform a search.

00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:15.242
Maybe I'm just
overthinking it, but...

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.317
I hope that it's
nothing serious.

00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:24.060
- We're still on the same floor,

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.198
but the terrain keeps going up
and down.

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:28.269
It's such a bizarre layout.

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:31.074
- And it feels like we've
walked pretty far in.

00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:32.911
- It's dangerous for
us to get too deep

00:19:33.011 --> 00:19:34.447
on our first day of exploring.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:37.320
Let's get ready to turn back
after a little more progress.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.992
- Good point. We still
haven't even gone halfway

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:41.829
through the established route.

00:19:43.065 --> 00:19:44.400
- What-

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:49.177
An adventurer?

00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:50.647
- Sure seems like it.

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:52.952
But there shouldn't be
another Familia down here

00:19:53.052 --> 00:19:54.253
on an expedition.

00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:56.926
At least not one
that overlaps ours.

00:19:58.228 --> 00:19:59.731
- I recognize him!

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.569
It's Luvis!

00:20:03.974 --> 00:20:04.942
- Get ready.

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:06.612
He's acting strange.

00:20:10.052 --> 00:20:12.791
(all gasping)

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.736
- Help me...

00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:23.646
(menacing music)

00:20:30.828 --> 00:20:32.062
- No you don't!

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:35.235
(menacing music)

00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:47.961
It's reading all my moves!

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:54.709
This thing is different than

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:56.979
any monster we've
ever fought before.

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:58.081
Wait a sec...

00:20:58.182 --> 00:20:59.885
Is it enhanced?

00:20:59.986 --> 00:21:02.924
(menacing music)

00:21:13.044 --> 00:21:15.049
- [Aisha] Don't go in too deep!

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:17.420
- Backup's on the way!

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:19.323
- No, please don't!

00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:20.994
You need to run!

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:25.069
Don't attack it!

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:26.672
Don't get hit!

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.479
(menacing music)

00:21:44.274 --> 00:21:45.577
- Lady Chigusa!

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:57.367
- Wait, it ran away?

00:21:57.467 --> 00:21:58.570
- [Ouka] Chigusa!

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.372
Hang in there, Chigusa!

00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:10.392
- It's the moss from my dream.

00:22:10.492 --> 00:22:13.098
It's going to overtake
everything.

00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:17.807
("Guide")

00:23:46.184 --> 00:23:48.455
- [Bell] Next time, "Parasite".
