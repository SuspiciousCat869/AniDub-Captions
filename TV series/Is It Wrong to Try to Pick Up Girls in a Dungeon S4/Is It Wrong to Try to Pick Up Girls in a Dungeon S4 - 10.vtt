WEBVTT

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.375
(foreboding music)

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:06.445
(Ryu gasping)

00:00:06.546 --> 00:00:07.682
- Listen.

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:11.657
(Ryu whimpers)

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:17.367
(loud screeching)

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.142
- Ryu?

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.146
- Not again.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.251
It's the same thing.

00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:27.555
It's coming, isn't it?

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:32.264
Alise...

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:35.739
- Ryu, I...

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:36.607
- Run away.

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:37.676
- Huh?

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:38.645
- Run away!

00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:39.947
(Bell gasps)

00:00:40.047 --> 00:00:41.082
- Hurry, get away!

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.019
You have to leave
here right now.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:44.355
Hurry up!

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.027
- (evil laugh) It's
far too late.

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:48.196
It has begun.

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:50.501
We're in the presence of
despair.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:54.308
Let's bring it on! Reveal
yourself right now!

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:57.849
One more time.
Let us see it up close!

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.153
(menacing laugh)

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:03.426
(grunts in pain)

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:07.502
- A great disaster cometh.

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.311
(loud burst)

00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:15.384
(loud screeching continues)

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:17.956
- Take heed.

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:20.761
It is a banquet of tragedy.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.636
(low growling)

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:31.248
(Opening Song)

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.066
(intense roaring)

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.001
- No!

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:05.871
I don't like this sound.

00:03:08.142 --> 00:03:09.344
I hate it!

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.318
I heard about it.

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:14.121
They say something very
terrifying happens

00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:15.891
when you hear this sound.

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:19.933
- I'm scared, so scared.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.408
(screaming continues)

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:27.481
- What's that sound?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.018
It's almost like the dungeon

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:30.453
itself is screaming in pain.

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:33.327
- Seems like it's coming
from somewhere below.

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:35.263
Maybe the 27th floor?

00:03:35.364 --> 00:03:37.769
- Do you have any ideas,
Lady Aisha?

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.272
- Dunno.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:41.777
First time I've ever
heard this sound.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.724
- Cassandra, what is
it? What's the matter?

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:53.534
(shudders)

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:54.970
- Get out.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.272
- Eh?

00:03:57.976 --> 00:03:58.744
- Get out of here.

00:03:58.845 --> 00:03:59.846
- What the hell?

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.550
- I've never heard
anything like this before.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.288
- We need to get off this
floor as soon as possible.

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:06.025
This is bad.

00:04:06.126 --> 00:04:06.894
- Come on, Bors!

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:08.229
- Huh?

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.164
(screeching stopped)

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.302
(water running)

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:12.738
- It stopped.

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.680
(rocks cracking)

00:04:20.054 --> 00:04:22.826
(loud stomping)

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:25.998
(crashes on water)

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:32.979
(water splashes)

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:36.953
- Huh!

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.993
- It can't be.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:42.297
- What's happening, Ouranos?

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:44.569
That thing has spawned.

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.340
- That thing? What are you
talking about?

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.581
I can't believe it's
happening again.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.923
It will be an awful
tragedy just like before.

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:58.229
- I don't understand, Ouranos.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:59.732
Ouranos!

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:03.072
A terrible disaster is reborn.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.947
(loud roaring)

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:14.963
- Did you guys just hear that?

00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:16.867
- Something doesn't feel right.

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:20.106
We need to hurry and
find Bors' group.

00:05:21.943 --> 00:05:22.745
- Let's move.

00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:23.847
- Right.

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:27.387
(blood splatter)

00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:28.857
(woman gasping)

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.401
(squish)

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:37.542
(loud stomping)

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:44.989
(everyone screaming)

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.031
(earth cracking)

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:50.334
(woman panting)

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:53.874
(flesh ripping apart)

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.479
(dramatic music)

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.750
(creature stomping)

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.489
(man panting)
(man screaming)

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.230
(woman screaming)

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.766
- You guys hear that, right?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:07.635
- Uh-huh.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.404
- What do you think is going on?

00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:11.577
- Let's go.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:12.579
- Wait a second, Bors!

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.148
- Hurry up. My gut says

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.851
we're in deep shit.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.395
(loud screeching)

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.900
- What the hell is happening?

00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:25.204
(menacing laugh)

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.241
Is this all because of you?

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:28.176
Tell me!

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.679
What have you done?

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.284
- Just a small ritual.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:34.021
One that will finally wake me up

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:36.058
from this living nightmare.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:38.831
Seeing Ryu Lion act so spooked

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.770
hasn't tipped you off yet,
Bell Cranel?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.172
- Huh?

00:06:43.273 --> 00:06:45.545
(violin playing)

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.447
- I summoned a monster.

00:06:47.548 --> 00:06:48.884
It's the same one that butchered

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:51.557
the Astrea Familia all those
years ago,

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:55.798
and it's coming here
to the 27th floor.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.569
(maniacal laugh)

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.405
- The Astrea Familia?

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:03.079
That's the group that
Ryu used to belong to.

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:04.181
- Five years ago.

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.651
The members of the
Astrea Familia

00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:07.287
were constantly fighting against

00:07:07.387 --> 00:07:09.692
those of us in
the Rudra Familia.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:12.565
For them there was some
sort of crusade of justice,

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.903
but to us they were
nothing but pesky flies

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:17.040
who kept getting
in the damn way.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.476
So what did we do?!

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:22.117
We set a trap in the
dungeon to get rid of 'em!

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.921
- You bastard.

00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.990
- This reminds me,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.129
when I met with Ryu
on the 18th floor.

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:31.068
- So where are we?

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.439
- The grave of my comrades

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.243
from my original Familia.

00:07:36.446 --> 00:07:38.483
You see, we fell into a trap

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:41.155
that was set by an
enemy Familia.

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.892
I was the only one who survived.

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:45.731
The rest, they were
all murdered.

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:49.639
(breathes deeply)

00:07:51.142 --> 00:07:53.880
(cello plays)

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.456
- That means this guy
is responsible

00:07:58.557 --> 00:07:59.759
for the death of her Familia!

00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:01.362
- Curious how we did it?

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:02.832
We stocked up on
all of the blaze

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.702
rocks that we could
get our hands on.

00:08:04.803 --> 00:08:07.040
We lured her Familia
into the dungeon

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.242
intending to blow it up,

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:10.748
and leave them buried
alive under all the rubble.

00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:12.618
However, those assholes from the

00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:15.223
Astrea Familia just
would not die.

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:17.361
They're like damn cockroaches!

00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:18.731
That really turned the tables

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.469
and put us in a bad situation,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.907
but something happened that

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:26.145
none of us could have foreseen.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.615
- Yeah and what was that?

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.820
(crazy chuckle)

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.126
- The dungeon gave
birth to an abomination.

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:36.032
A totally insane monster
that no one had seen

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.035
or even heard of before.

00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:41.943
(unhinged cackle)

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.692
- Normally, nothing
like this should occur.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.999
Destroying part of the
dungeon is inconsequential.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.971
It should only prompt it
to restore itself back

00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:57.542
to its usual state.

00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:01.015
- However, if the damage
exceeds what it can repair

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:04.021
or rather, if someone
made it a point to inflict

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.892
an overwhelming
amount of damage-

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:08.864
- Exactly! The dungeon
would prioritize

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:11.637
eliminating it over
anything else.

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:15.544
Damage triggers its
preservation instincts.

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:18.684
The dungeons suffer so
much misery from this.

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:22.257
Not even my prayers
can reach it.

00:09:22.357 --> 00:09:26.800
- Then what happened five
years ago will happen again.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.006
- Mmm, I'm afraid so.

00:09:30.107 --> 00:09:31.844
(menacing laugh)

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:35.150
- On that day, all of my
allies were slaughtered

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.987
until only I was left.

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:38.355
Just me.

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:40.360
But guess what?

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.397
So were all of those
stupid bitches

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:44.368
from the Astrea Familia.

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.506
(growls)

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:49.579
I spent the past five
years studying, okay?

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.417
Those guys from Evilus
that I hung around with

00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:55.591
had no idea because I did it all
myself.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.461
What triggered the dungeon to
spot it?

00:09:57.562 --> 00:10:01.102
And what would I need to make
that abomination appear again?

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:04.776
I studying it down
to the last detail.

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:07.147
And, oh boy, did I learn a lot.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:09.719
Like the fact that going
beyond the middle floors

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:12.191
and intentionally causing
a staggering amount

00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.662
of damage to the dungeon on a
lower floor

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:18.470
would then spawn the monster
on that very same floor.

00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.108
Also, the crucial fact
that the dungeon can

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:25.785
perceive floors 25 through
27 as one single space.

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:28.089
(triumphant laugh)

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:30.393
Oh, cheer up.

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:32.331
You have the honor of

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.600
witnessing my triumph

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.205
as I announce it to the world.

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:39.378
(evil laugh)

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:41.249
- Jura, damn you!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.552
- Why?

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:44.789
Why would you summon
a horrific monster

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.926
and for the second time no less?

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:49.666
- Hmm. Isn't that obvious?

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.404
Because I'm going to tame it,
you dumbass.

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:53.541
- Huh?

00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:55.443
- Tame it? Seriously?

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:57.648
Are you completely
out of your mind?!

00:10:57.748 --> 00:10:59.051
- Tell me something.

00:10:59.151 --> 00:10:59.986
(groans)

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:01.723
- Whenever you saw
it did you think

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:04.796
it was an absolute
monstrosity back then?

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:06.933
I remember my thoughts
even though

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:08.937
I was shitting my pants
in sheer terror

00:11:09.037 --> 00:11:11.810
I found myself mesmerized
by its allure.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:14.583
By the way, it laid
waste to everything.

00:11:14.683 --> 00:11:17.053
By the way it totally
butchered everyone.

00:11:17.153 --> 00:11:19.759
In my eyes, it was a
thing of such beauty

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:22.565
that even goddesses
pale in comparison,

00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:25.036
and I fell in love with it.

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:28.677
A beast of overwhelming power.

00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:30.347
Oh, I wanted it.

00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:31.549
I needed it.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:32.384
(music swells)

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.687
Now it's all mine!

00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:34.822
- You're insane!

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:36.693
It's practically the devil
itself.

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:39.030
There's absolutely no
way you could control it.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.035
- In normal circumstances, sure.

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.470
- Huh?

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.941
But look!

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.578
(chuckles victoriously)

00:11:45.678 --> 00:11:48.016
I have this baby right here.

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:49.484
- Oh right!

00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:51.723
He used that to
control the lambton.

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:53.860
That's a magic item.

00:11:54.596 --> 00:11:55.531
- And then once I have

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.899
complete control of that thing

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.171
then nothing will
scare me anymore.

00:11:59.271 --> 00:12:01.643
No one will ever
threaten me again.

00:12:01.743 --> 00:12:05.049
No, not even Ryu Lion.

00:12:06.319 --> 00:12:09.959
I haven't gone a single day
without you haunting my dreams

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:13.399
but summoning that creature
here will change that.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:17.440
I'll finally be able to
overcome the trauma of my past.

00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.679
I won't let anyone else have it!

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:22.317
It will be mine, all mine!

00:12:28.363 --> 00:12:30.400
(water running)

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.840
(melancholic music)

00:12:38.416 --> 00:12:40.921
(Lili panting)

00:12:41.022 --> 00:12:44.094
(water running)

00:12:54.347 --> 00:12:57.621
- I can't tell what's
going on down there yet.

00:12:57.721 --> 00:12:59.225
(distant screaming)

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:00.159
(gasp)

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:02.698
- What's the matter, Lady
Chigusa?

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:05.670
- I just heard someone.

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.042
I think they were screaming in
pain.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.487
- Lady Chigusa, are you sure?

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:16.358
- Yes, I'm sure.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:17.427
- It was very faint

00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:20.233
but yes, I also heard the
screams as well.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:21.837
Seemed to me like
they were the cries

00:13:21.937 --> 00:13:23.941
of adventurers biting
the dust.

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.110
- That settles it.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.946
There's definitely something

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:28.316
strange going down on 27.

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:31.623
- Do you think Master
Bell has gotten involved?

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:33.392
(grunts)

00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:35.062
- Wait, Lil Bit!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.435
- Come on you guys.

00:13:38.536 --> 00:13:39.772
Let's go down there.

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:42.310
Master Bell needs our
help right now.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.914
(gasps in surprise)

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:45.216
- Cassandra?

00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:46.853
- What are you doing?

00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:48.022
Let me go!

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:49.091
He needs our help.

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:51.461
We don't have time to waste.

00:13:51.562 --> 00:13:53.232
(sobbing)

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.902
- I'm sorry.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.374
I'm so sorry.

00:13:57.474 --> 00:14:02.283
I knew all along that
a disaster was looming

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:05.657
but I couldn't do
anything about it.

00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:09.197
And because you guys
are alive right now,

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:12.070
I'm sure that down on
the 27th floor

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.309
many others are dying instead.

00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:19.250
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:23.325
I'm so, so sorry.

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.100
(sobs openly)

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.037
- I can feel it.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.441
It's already started.

00:14:32.812 --> 00:14:37.086
I'm scared, so scared.

00:14:37.186 --> 00:14:38.824
I need to get away.

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:40.359
Far, far away.

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:42.798
Somewhere deep.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:45.002
Somewhere deep within
the waters.

00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:52.049
(sad music plays)

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.836
I want to be with him,

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:04.441
with Bell right now.

00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:08.348
Bell, where are you?

00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:14.762
- A taboo of the dungeon
that no one is aware of.

00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:17.267
Making it an official
regulation is hard

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:19.972
because inversely doing
so would make

00:15:20.072 --> 00:15:24.080
everyone aware of its existence.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.187
We had no choice but to
cover up anything related.

00:15:27.287 --> 00:15:30.326
Disclosing nothing
to the public.

00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:33.700
Naturally, there is no
information on it.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.138
Not even in the guilds records,

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:38.375
but there is one exception.

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:40.246
That was the Xenos.

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:43.318
Five years ago sensing
something was wrong,

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:46.325
they were more terrified
than anyone.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:51.168
So I told them everything and
asked for their assistance

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:55.142
in making sure nothing like
this ever happens again.

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:58.316
- But now, in a case
of awful timing

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:02.424
they are busy helping us seize
complete control over Knossos.

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:07.200
- Yes, we have no way to
respond to this swiftly.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.542
It would seem to be located
mainly on the lower floors.

00:16:11.642 --> 00:16:15.049
My God, the adventurers
who happen to be

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:20.092
in its path are from
the Hesta Familia!

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:22.998
- So there's a monster
powerful enough

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:24.702
to kill Ryu's entire Familia,

00:16:24.802 --> 00:16:28.275
and you honestly just summoned
it to this very floor?!

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:31.515
(chuckles)

00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:35.089
- Bors!
- Hold on!

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:37.861
- But Ms. Ryu we need to
hurry and save everybody.

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:39.599
- Impossible.

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:41.936
You can't go out there.

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:45.009
Fighting it is a death sentence.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:50.888
- Of course!

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:53.994
It makes sense that you
wouldn't let him go.

00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:56.164
You know even more than I do
about

00:16:56.264 --> 00:16:58.302
how horrific that thing is since

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:01.375
you got to experience
fighting it firsthand.

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.847
And let's not forget you
were so desperate to keep

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:07.387
yourself alive during that
battle that you let all your

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:11.028
precious little friends die
without even trying to help.

00:17:11.128 --> 00:17:12.732
- Shut your mouth.

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:14.067
- Ow, my mistake.

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:16.873
You actually just
slaughtered all your friends

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:18.543
with your own two hands.

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:19.812
- Shut up!

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:25.924
- Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.562
shut up.

00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:31.903
(breathes erratically)

00:17:32.003 --> 00:17:33.405
Shut up.

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:40.152
(groaning noise)

00:17:41.656 --> 00:17:44.060
(trumpets blasting)

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.632
(panting)

00:17:50.841 --> 00:17:53.445
(screaming)

00:18:05.236 --> 00:18:09.177
(trumpets pick up tempo)

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:14.321
- The name of this fiend is
Juggernaut.

00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:16.358
A destroyer that massacres any

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:19.130
and all adventurers it finds.

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:21.402
(squelching)

00:18:21.503 --> 00:18:25.376
- Ouranos, isn't there anything
we can do?

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:29.150
- No matter what we do,
it will be too late.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.990
That thing will keep going until

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.160
it's killed everyone
in the area.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.029
(yelling)

00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:36.398
- That's the entire

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:38.903
purpose of its existence.

00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:42.043
(groans in pain)

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:43.713
(bones crack)

00:18:43.813 --> 00:18:44.615
(chuckles)

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:45.784
- Just you wait.

00:18:45.884 --> 00:18:49.190
I'm gonna make you mine
soon enough, my darling.

00:18:51.194 --> 00:18:52.097
- Bring it on.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.735
You don't get me that easy.

00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:59.143
(choking on blood)

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:01.181
- Wait, don't!

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:06.492
(screaming)

00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:07.594
- No!

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.732
- Ahh!

00:19:18.784 --> 00:19:21.722
(gasps in shock)

00:19:28.402 --> 00:19:29.672
- Hang on, Bors!

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:31.241
- Wait, Bell, no!

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:33.846
- That's enough!

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.786
(intense music)

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:39.758
- Look out, Rabbit's Foot!

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:43.599
(creature stomps forward)

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.851
(growls)

00:19:54.053 --> 00:19:56.224
- It hardly has any armor.

00:19:56.324 --> 00:19:58.997
That means it's built
for speed and offense.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.499
I can handle that.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:04.307
It all comes down to
striking first.

00:20:05.577 --> 00:20:07.714
(yells)

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:11.856
(violin strumming)

00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:15.864
- Where'd it go?

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:18.468
(creature hissing)

00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:22.443
- Impossible. It moved that
far in the blink of an eye.

00:20:22.544 --> 00:20:24.682
- It's as strong as
a floor boss.

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:28.321
No, this monstrosity
is even beyond that.

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:32.163
It avoided that?

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:33.365
But it's so huge.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.837
It must be even faster
than the Iguazu.

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:39.110
Look, Bors and his
group are still here,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.713
and so is Ryu.

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.052
- Running is not an option.

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:45.489
(yells)

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:49.431
(sword shatters)

00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:52.169
- Get outta there.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.675
Okay, let's see how
it handles this.

00:20:54.776 --> 00:20:55.644
Hope this works.

00:20:55.744 --> 00:20:56.545
- No, don't!

00:20:56.645 --> 00:20:57.914
Fire Bolt!

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.722
Ah!

00:21:05.229 --> 00:21:07.299
What was that?

00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.141
Not good.

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:12.711
Gotta counter.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.019
(music fades)

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:27.006
(arm splashes in water)

00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:30.446
(blood gushing)

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:33.753
(screams in pain)

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:35.623
- Run away!

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:45.309
(loud thud)

00:21:47.314 --> 00:21:50.385
(water running)

00:21:53.191 --> 00:21:55.997
(gasp in fear)

00:22:11.428 --> 00:22:14.033
(screaming) Bell!

00:22:15.469 --> 00:22:18.709
(Ending Song)

00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:48.889
- Next time: Endless.
