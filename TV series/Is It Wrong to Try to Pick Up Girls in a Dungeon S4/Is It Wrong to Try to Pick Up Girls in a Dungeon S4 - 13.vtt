WEBVTT

00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:05.143
(metal clanking)
(birds chirping)

00:00:05.244 --> 00:00:07.983
(Tsubaki groans)

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.020
- Ah, shoot.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.322
Agreed to house-sit for him,

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:12.892
and helped myself to the forge,

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:15.731
and promptly broke
one of his hammers

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.303
Ugh, Welfy's gonna throw a fit.

00:00:19.238 --> 00:00:22.411
I sure hope it's not
a bad omen for us.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:23.313
(door creaks)

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:24.415
Hmm?

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:29.358
- Hello, Tsubaki Collbrande.

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:33.499
Pardon us, but I'm afraid we
need your help in the Dungeon.

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.771
- [Tsubaki] Hmm.

00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.583
(Opening song)

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.066
- [Bell] I was right.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:15.036
We have to move.

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:18.911
We've gotta go as far
away as we possibly can.

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:23.252
There'll be more monsters
past this tunnel.

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:26.727
But if we don't get
out of here now.

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.871
(Juggernaut growls)

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:34.642
(Bell gasps)

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.187
(Bell screams)

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:42.525
No, no, no.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:44.261
(Bell panting)

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.676
(Juggernaut growls)

00:02:58.256 --> 00:02:59.458
Fire bolt!

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.687
(Bell groaning)

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.406
Pure luck, that's all it was.

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:26.312
That thing will be back.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:28.951
(Ryu grunts)

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.253
Miss Ryu?

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.258
- Huh?

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:34.696
Mr. Cranel.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.668
(brooding music)

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.040
I see.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.310
So we're in the Deep Floors.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:45.016
- Oh, Miss Ryu.

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:47.655
You need to heal up, okay?

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:49.526
And I already ran out of items,

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:51.696
so use your magic on yourself.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:01.282
- The song of a now
faraway forest.

00:04:01.383 --> 00:04:06.058
The comforting, the
melody of life.

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:07.929
Noah Heal.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.473
- [Bell] No, not on me.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.813
You need treatment soon
or else you'll-

00:04:16.913 --> 00:04:18.951
- It's for the best.

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.526
I'm too far gone.

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:25.396
I'm only gonna slow us down.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.737
That spell was the
last of my magic.

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:31.977
It makes more sense
to heal you instead.

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.589
- That doesn't make any
kind of sense at all.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.356
Really?

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:39.826
How can you say that now?

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:40.928
- Mr. Cranel,

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:45.771
go on without me.

00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:47.675
Just leave me here.

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.785
(both gasps)

00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:58.329
(ominous music)

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.436
- Is that a...

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:03.540
is that a Skull Sheep?

00:05:04.075 --> 00:05:07.013
(brooding music)

00:05:12.357 --> 00:05:13.928
- [Luvis] Wait, let me
get this straight.

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:16.801
You're saying the Hestia Familia
is stranded in the Dungeon?

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:17.802
- [Dormul] Oh, I see.

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:18.570
So you turn tail and

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.040
left it there, didn't you?

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.277
- Whatever man,
we had no choice.

00:05:22.377 --> 00:05:23.981
We didn't really
have any weapons.

00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:25.652
Well, not the right ones anyway.

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:28.757
Besides, we nearly died
trying to get back here.

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:31.261
- Unbelievable.

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:33.667
I cannot abandon
the Hestia Familia.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.105
I'm heading down
into the Dungeon.

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.241
- The hell you are!

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:39.111
With your injuries,
it's suicide.

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.781
I'm gonna go, you stay here and-

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:41.883
- [Tsubaki] Yo!

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:47.228
You were saying something
about the Hestia Familia?

00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:49.431
Give me all of the details.

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:50.868
- Wait, hold on.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.740
You're, you're Tsubaki
Collbrande.

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:58.349
- You're the head captain
of the Hephaistos Familia.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.555
What are you doing here?

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:02.959
- Well, that's a long story.

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:04.762
Come on, why don't we share.

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:13.647
A floor boss and the
25th floor exploded.

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:15.083
And to make matters worse,

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.487
the monsters are
acting weird too.

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:20.294
- [Luvis] Yeah, something's
definitely amiss.

00:06:20.394 --> 00:06:22.532
We can't wrap our heads
around it either.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:23.601
- What's going on?

00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:25.003
- I'm not sure, but it sounds

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:27.440
like a real dumpster fire
down there right meow.

00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:29.211
- It doesn't matter, guys.

00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:31.015
We're supposed to be
reinforcements,

00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:32.618
so let's focus on saving Ryu

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.756
and Mr. White Rabbit
and the others.

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.894
Woo!

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:39.832
- [Lunor] Wait. Come
back here, you dumb cat.

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.470
- Interesting friends
you got there.

00:06:42.572 --> 00:06:43.439
(Tsubaki laughs)

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.012
- Yeah, sorry about them.

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.314
Well, at any rate, guess

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:49.051
we ought to go get ourselves

00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.455
a quick peek at the 25th floor.

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:54.629
(ominous music)

00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:58.737
- Not good.

00:06:58.837 --> 00:06:59.839
Do we run?

00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:02.444
I doubt we'll get very far.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:05.784
I guess fighting is
our only option.

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:08.356
Should I let it get closer?

00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:10.159
No, I have to move.

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.384
Is it gone?

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:23.687
- No.

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.795
Its skin, it's camouflaged.

00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:35.076
- [Bell] Where, where did it go?

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.849
Calm down.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:38.950
Breathe.

00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:41.556
- Look out!

00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.597
(Bell groans)

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.804
(brooding music)

00:07:57.154 --> 00:07:59.892
(Bell grunts)

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:04.101
- [Ryu] No, get out of there.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:07.708
(Bell groans)

00:08:24.007 --> 00:08:26.914
(Bell panting)

00:08:27.014 --> 00:08:28.851
- Just one battle.

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:32.825
That's all it took to do
this much damage.

00:08:35.496 --> 00:08:37.167
These are the Deep Floors.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.175
How in the world are
we going to survive?

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:56.171
(footsteps echoing)

00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:57.908
Miss Ryu?

00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:02.016
- [Ryu] Leave me behind and go.

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:05.691
I'm dead weight.

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.864
At this point I'll
only get in the way.

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:10.667
- Come on now.

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:13.640
- [Ryu] Go on without me.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.447
(somber music)

00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:18.517
- Not a chance.

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:21.355
No, there's absolutely no way.

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:23.259
I will not abandon you!

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:25.864
- [Ryu] Please.

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:27.669
- And besides, I can't traverse

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:28.870
the Deep Floors alone.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.708
I'd be chopped into tiny pieces

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:31.977
in a matter of minutes.

00:09:32.077 --> 00:09:33.680
I barely made it through
that last fight

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.083
even with your help.

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:36.285
You're not dead weight.

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:38.991
You've been to the Deep
Floors before, Miss Ryu.

00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:40.226
I need you.

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:44.201
(somber music)

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:52.250
- Perhaps I was being too hasty.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.758
It seems that I may
have lost my composure.

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:58.329
- [Bell] Miss Ryu, let's go.

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:00.266
- Let's head for a room.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:04.241
One with the dead end,
a small one preferably.

00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:05.477
- [Bell] A room?

00:10:05.578 --> 00:10:06.546
- That's correct.

00:10:06.646 --> 00:10:08.550
We'll hole up there for a while

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.921
and take some time
to catch our breath.

00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:12.592
- Sure.

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:14.762
- Like you said, Mr. Cranel,

00:10:14.862 --> 00:10:18.202
it would appear that I
could still be of some use.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.912
(suspenseful music)

00:10:28.356 --> 00:10:31.094
(Ouka growls)

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:37.407
(Mikoto screams)

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:40.113
(Welf growls)

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:43.419
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.828
- All of the new
footholds are up.

00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:49.431
Regroup at the front line,

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:51.836
but kill the other
monsters first.

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:55.276
(suspenseful music)

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:05.831
- [Ouka] Let's move.

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.902
- Lady Cassandra and
Lady Haruhime,

00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:09.573
I want you to cast your spells
as soon as they're ready.

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:11.241
- Copy that.
- Sounds good.

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:14.682
(suspenseful music)

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:17.453
- Eat this.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:26.271
- It went under again.

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:27.407
- Mikoto!

00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.749
- [Mikoto] Daphne,
get out of there.

00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:37.427
Zekka!

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:47.114
(Ouka growls)

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:48.650
- [Aisha] The party's
working together

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.053
like a well-oiled machine,

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.958
giving Amphisbaena a run
for its money.

00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.333
We finished off most
of its friends too.

00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:01.241
The ugly bastard's
running out of steam.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.737
- Hey, I think we might be
pulling it off.

00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:16.940
Aren't we?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.812
- Yeah, seems like luck's
on our side.

00:12:24.388 --> 00:12:25.658
You can't hide.

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:27.962
- Mikoto.
- [Mikoto] On it.

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:30.433
- When it comes up, hit
with all you've got.

00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:31.836
- [Ouka] Right.

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:35.276
(suspenseful music)

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.395
- The waterfall.

00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:45.564
- What the?

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.603
It's going up?

00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:50.373
- Where's it trying to go?

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:55.817
Oh God, no.

00:13:05.303 --> 00:13:08.075
(Welf screams)

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:16.291
(everyone screaming)

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:21.001
(suspenseful music)

00:13:32.024 --> 00:13:35.096
(Mikoto groans)

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.909
(footsteps echoing)

00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:48.156
- [Bell] We have to hurry.

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:51.094
If something else attacks us,
we're doomed

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.572
(Bell gasps)

00:13:58.442 --> 00:14:00.113
- Please calm down.

00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:03.620
I'll keep an eye out for any
monsters that may be nearby.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.624
All you need to do is
concentrate

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:07.461
on getting us somewhere safe.

00:14:07.562 --> 00:14:08.597
(Bell sighs)

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:09.865
- Okay.

00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:13.841
- [Ryu] When we come
to a fork in the road,

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:16.679
choose the narrower
of the two paths.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.752
That should eventually
lead us to a room.

00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:21.522
- [Bell] Got it.

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:32.444
But still, even if
we make it to a room,

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.147
what comes after that?

00:14:34.247 --> 00:14:37.320
(Bell gasps)
(ominous music)

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.828
Assuming we do get to
rest, what's our next move?

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:43.634
How are we going to
escape the Deep Floors?

00:14:43.734 --> 00:14:45.269
Will we get to go home?

00:14:46.472 --> 00:14:48.208
No, stay focused.

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:49.979
One step at a time,

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:52.116
just do as Miss Ryu says.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.368
(Bell gasps)

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.705
A monster?

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.176
- [Ryu] No, I don't
sense danger.

00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:07.915
- Huh?

00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:09.418
That light.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.087
Could it possibly be?

00:15:15.262 --> 00:15:18.035
It is a magic stone lamp!

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:20.005
- Then that must mean
we're not alone.

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:21.509
- It's a person.

00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:23.212
There's an adventurer here

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:27.053
Our luck's turning around.

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:28.924
We're not alone anymore.

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:30.192
We're saved.

00:15:31.696 --> 00:15:34.100
Please help us, we're desperate.

00:15:34.201 --> 00:15:35.604
Can you spare a-

00:15:42.585 --> 00:15:45.456
(ominous music)

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:50.700
No.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.544
I knew it.

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:57.514
We're going die here.

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:02.223
(ominous music)

00:16:18.088 --> 00:16:19.290
Stay away.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.796
Stay away!

00:16:21.896 --> 00:16:23.098
Fire bolt!

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:28.141
(Bell screams)

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.032
(Bell pants)

00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:43.707
- Mr. Cranel.

00:16:43.807 --> 00:16:45.376
It's all right, okay?

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:47.681
All three of them fled the area.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:51.288
Mr. Cranel?

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.800
- This, is where we-

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.968
- You must calm down.

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:00.072
Get a hold of yourself.

00:17:03.145 --> 00:17:05.684
- [Bell] I can't anymore.

00:17:05.784 --> 00:17:07.621
- It's Mind Down.

00:17:08.188 --> 00:17:11.194
(Ryu groaning)

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.467
Look at me, Mr. Cranel.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.737
Just look at me.

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:22.083
- I'm so sorry.

00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:26.324
(slaps)

00:17:33.606 --> 00:17:34.608
Miss Ryu?

00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:40.086
- I know it's difficult, but
listen to me.

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:44.260
Mr. Cranel, there is no
reason for you to weep.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.664
Okay, so yes, we stumbled

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:48.469
across the remains
of fellow adventurers,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.077
but that changes nothing
about our situation.

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:54.949
- You think it, it doesn't?

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:56.519
- No, it doesn't.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:18:00.092
Rather we've reached our
destination of room to rest.

00:18:00.193 --> 00:18:02.330
That's at least progress,
isn't it?

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.436
So please don't let any
of this discourage you.

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:09.011
(Bell sighs)

00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:11.448
Five minutes.
- Huh?

00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:15.156
- [Ryu] I'll stand guard.

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:18.529
Use that time to take
a short nap.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.834
Give your body a chance to
recuperate

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.138
as much as humanly possible.

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:25.376
- In five minutes?

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.515
- Down here in the Deep Floors,

00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:29.752
and especially in our current
predicament,

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.589
it's all we can afford.

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:35.964
Sleeping anytime, anywhere,

00:18:36.064 --> 00:18:38.636
make an effort to get back on
your feet.

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:41.374
It's the mark of a true
adventurer.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.014
- A true adventurer?

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.216
- [Ryu] That's right.

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:47.220
Lucky for us, your
last fire bolt

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.725
damaged the walls and ceiling,

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:52.864
which means the room
won't spawn monsters

00:18:52.964 --> 00:18:54.802
for the next five minutes or so.

00:18:56.237 --> 00:18:59.277
And whether your body and
mind are able to recover,

00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:00.980
that'll determine your,

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.853
I mean, our likelihood of
survival.

00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:07.460
You rest first, okay?

00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:10.800
And after a few minutes,
it'll be my turn.

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.303
- I understand.

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.616
- Sleep well, Mr. Cranel.

00:19:21.756 --> 00:19:24.561
(somber music)

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:38.589
Five minutes.

00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:48.342
(Haruhime and Cassandra
coughing)

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:50.547
- [Lili] Are you all right?

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:51.883
- I, I'm fine.

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.087
(Haruhime coughs)

00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:55.657
- And the others?

00:19:57.995 --> 00:20:01.201
(Welf coughs)

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:02.905
- [Welf] Ugh, damn it.

00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:05.076
(Ouka grunts)

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.547
- That was a disaster.

00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:09.251
- [Aisha] Is everyone
accounted for?

00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:12.591
(Chigusa panting)

00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:15.663
(Chigusa gasps)

00:20:15.763 --> 00:20:16.833
- Mikoto!

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:19.171
- Does anybody see her?

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:21.742
- No.
(Daphne gasps)

00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:24.782
(brooding music)

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.552
Mikoto!

00:20:27.687 --> 00:20:28.856
Oh.

00:20:28.956 --> 00:20:32.296
(suspenseful music)

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.436
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:20:35.537 --> 00:20:38.810
- Ugh, damn it that son
of a bitch won't quit.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.016
Be careful!

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:03.527
- But I thought because
we held out for so long,

00:21:03.627 --> 00:21:06.331
we could escape being
consumed by despair.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.805
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.078
- [Lili] Cassandra, look out.

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.850
(Lili gasps)

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:22.396
- [Cassandra] Haruhime.

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:27.807
(suspenseful music)

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:31.014
- [Lili] Haruhime!

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:36.625
(suspenseful music)

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:40.465
- Haruhime.

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:47.514
- This can't really be the end.

00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:55.262
- Mikoto!

00:21:55.362 --> 00:21:57.601
Haruhime!

00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:01.609
(Aisha groans)

00:22:01.709 --> 00:22:05.584
If it's the last thing I
ever do, you're gonna pay!

00:22:05.684 --> 00:22:10.392
- I am gonna rip your head
off, you piece of shit!

00:22:15.202 --> 00:22:18.809
(Ending song)

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.455
- [Cassandra] Next time,
"Daphne Lauros."
