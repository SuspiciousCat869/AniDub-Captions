WEBVTT

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.511
- I'm sorry, Bell.

00:00:06.312 --> 00:00:07.616
For making you waste valuable

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.619
Mind energy to start a fire.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.059
- Hey. Something small like
that doesn't take much.

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:16.299
How strange. There
are no monsters.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.136
- [Ryu] It's been a
while since we saw one

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.307
and I don't sense any nearby.

00:00:20.407 --> 00:00:22.277
Not even any breathing.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:25.484
Anyway. Again, I'm sorry.

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:29.259
- [Bell] Um, I should
be the one to apologize.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.597
- [Ryu] Hm? For what?

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:32.599
- For getting you all wet

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.170
when I passed out in
the river before.

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.447
- [Ryu] You don't need
to worry about it.

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:43.687
Right now, we need to focus on
getting these wet clothes off

00:00:43.787 --> 00:00:45.423
and warming ourselves up.

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.865
Given our current state of
exhaustion,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.134
it could be fatal for us

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.073
to let our body temperatures
drop too low.

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.645
- Yeah. You're right.

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.884
- This whole situation is
extremely uncomfortable.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:00.420
I can't believe
we're nearly naked

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.391
in the middle of the Dungeon.

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:04.629
- [Bell] H-here you go.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:07.769
- No, you should
probably keep it.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.171
- [Bell] But it's
yours, Miss Ryu.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.810
- [Ryu] You need to
let your body heal.

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.746
I can't use it!

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:14.281
- I'd rather you ha-

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:23.366
- Don't worry, I promise my
eyes are completely closed.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.771
- Thank you.

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:30.848
- Sure.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.494
(Opening Theme)

00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:10.447
(fire crackling)

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.797
- [Ryu Voiceover] I don't
understand.

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:22.204
I feel unusually aware of his
presence.

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:25.276
It wasn't even this
bad when he spied on us

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:27.715
in the bath that one time, but.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.521
- S-sorry!

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:33.895
- It's fine, I'm the one
who should apologize.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:38.537
This is neither the time nor
place to feel embarrassed.

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:42.511
Right. We cannot afford to
get distracted right now.

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:46.520
So Bell, I need you to be
honest with me about something.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.292
- Uh, sure thing,
ask whatever you want.

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.432
- Why'd you come back for
me anyway? At the Colosseum.

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.905
One wrong step, and...

00:03:56.005 --> 00:04:00.280
No, even in the perfect
scenario, we both could have
died.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.218
Anyway, did you already know

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:04.923
that there was a room
right under the Colosseum?

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:06.226
- [Bell] No.

00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:08.630
- Then why in the
world did you do it?

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:13.339
- Easy. I cannot
let anyone else die.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.045
That was the only
thing on my mind.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:17.648
- He's telling the truth.

00:04:17.748 --> 00:04:21.189
It wasn't calculated. There
was no ulterior motive.

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.295
His goal was to save
my life, nothing more.

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.800
Uh. Hey, Bell.

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:30.107
Can I tell you the story?

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:31.242
- Huh?

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:32.845
- Of what happened to us,

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.783
the Astrea Familia,

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:36.419
on that fateful day?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.358
It would mean a lot. if
you knew what happened.

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:42.063
- Of course.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.111
- And well then,
that's how it ended.

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.915
That man, the tamer.

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:53.820
What Jura said about
slaughtering my friends.

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:56.793
My life, was spared

00:04:56.894 --> 00:04:59.866
in exchange for those
in my Familia.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.536
It was so unfair.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:05.878
So. That's why I...

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:09.719
- Well then. I guess you've
got to go on without them, huh?

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:13.594
It's clear they
were important to you,

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:16.900
and they fought hard because
they wanted you to survive.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.508
Even a dummy like
me can see that.

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:23.113
If you were to die
now, Miss Ryu.

00:05:23.213 --> 00:05:26.753
I bet Miss Alise and the rest
of your friends would be mad.

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:29.993
- My chest feels warm.

00:05:30.093 --> 00:05:32.430
But my body feels icy cold.

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:37.340
Um. Bell...

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:39.679
- Go on.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.522
- I-I think we ought to
consider, skin-to-skin contact.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.160
(Bell gasps)

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.402
W-well, our current method is
proving to be i-ineffective.

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:52.605
(Bell gasping)

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:54.509
S-so if you really
want the both of us

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:56.646
to make it home, then...

00:05:57.515 --> 00:05:58.651
We need to increase
our body heat

00:05:58.751 --> 00:06:00.554
by huddling close together!

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:04.194
Now's not the time to be shy.
Hurry up.

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:06.901
before it's too late, we could
very likely freeze to death!

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.872
- B-but, you're an Elf,
Miss Ryu and, uh.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.981
- You don't need
to worry about that.

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:15.451
If it's an emergency,

00:06:15.552 --> 00:06:17.354
Elves would do anything,
even hug a Dwarf!

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:19.826
- Huh! Wait, really?

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:22.865
(Bell grunts)

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.669
- Yes. Perhaps.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.309
- Ah.

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.514
- But, but, uh, Bell um.

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:33.654
You, um, have to
promise not to uh,

00:06:34.556 --> 00:06:36.191
have any indecent thoughts.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.062
- What?

00:06:38.162 --> 00:06:41.503
- Because if you do, I
might accidentally slap you.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.143
O-or, um, maybe punch you in the
face.

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:49.385
Th-that's not to say I
think you'd be attracted

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.455
to a body like mine.

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:54.461
I-it's just, er, w-well, I...

00:06:56.332 --> 00:07:01.610
Huh?
(Bell laughing)

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.881
Hey. What's so funny, Bell?

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:07.521
- Sorry! (laughs) I'm a
little relieved, is all.

00:07:07.622 --> 00:07:09.726
You haven't changed
a bit, Miss Ryu.

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.534
Uh, so then, how
should we do this?

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:15.303
Hugging each other
might be kind of awkward

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:20.313
since we're not wearing any
clothes, and, uh, also, um,

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:21.616
Huh?

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:25.791
- That's fine by me.

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:30.199
(Bell gasping)

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.587
(gentle music)

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:46.766
- Are you warm now? Did it help?

00:07:49.973 --> 00:07:52.478
(Ryu sighs)

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:54.281
- Yes, very.

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:55.851
- [Bell] Good.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.922
- [Ryu] Yeah.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.105
- Um, Miss Ryu?

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:11.716
Guess I never, never
realized how small you are.

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.054
- I don't think I'm that
much shorter than you,

00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:15.524
if I'm being honest.

00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:19.031
- Oh, uh, yeah I know that.
That's not what I meant.

00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:21.035
- What did you mean?

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:22.337
- Actually, never mind.

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:23.373
- No, tell me.

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:24.609
- B-but. I shouldn't.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:25.644
- Spit it out.

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:26.946
- It's, just that...

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:28.283
- Say it!

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:30.655
- You're petite,
and your skin is soft.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:34.294
I was like, Well,
duh, she's a woman.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.032
- Huh.

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.704
- Whenever guys say
that they have the urge

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:43.012
to protect a woman, I
think I understand why.

00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:48.222
- You're being, unfair.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.938
(Ryu sighs)

00:08:56.038 --> 00:08:57.174
- [Bell] Miss Ryu?

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:59.244
- [Ryu] Yes?

00:08:59.344 --> 00:09:03.219
- [Bell] What do you want
to do when you get home?

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.494
- The thing I want the most.

00:09:07.596 --> 00:09:09.999
Is to eat some of Mama Mia's
cooking.

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:11.068
- Ah! Me, too.

00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:12.905
We should go to the tavern
together.

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:15.811
- But I'm sure, Everyone will
yell at me

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:18.082
before I get a chance
to enjoy it,

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:20.320
I'll get an earful
the second I get back.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.455
- Yeah.

00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:22.424
Probably true.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.760
- What about you?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.269
- Easy. Welf, Lili, Miss
Mikoto, Miss Haruhime.

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:30.808
I want to walk home with them,

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:33.078
to see Goddess Hestia.

00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:34.582
Tell her, I'm back.

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:36.953
- I see. That sounds nice.

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:39.625
Be sure to cherish your Familia.

00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:41.629
- [Bell] I will. Just like you.

00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:44.201
They'll always be special to me.

00:09:52.686 --> 00:09:54.020
How's your leg?

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:56.860
- Let's see here.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.830
The bones are slightly
misaligned,

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.972
but at the very least, I should
be able to walk on my own.

00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:04.843
Okay, are you
feeling alright, Bell?

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:08.717
- Sure am! I think that I've
gotten most of my strength back.

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.594
- In all likelihood,
this is the only oasis

00:10:13.694 --> 00:10:15.129
on the 37th Floor.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.870
If we wanted to, we could rest
here for as long as we like.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.777
The problem is,
there's no food supply.

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.014
- Yeah.
- Besides...

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:25.851
I've pretty much done
everything in my power,

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:28.957
to try and mend your left
arm, but you won't be making

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:31.295
a full recovery until
we reach the surface.

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:32.698
- I see.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:34.603
- [Ryu] The Dungeon doesn't
allow those who choose

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:37.742
to languish in its depths
to return home alive.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.447
Whenever you're ready,
we should get going.

00:10:40.548 --> 00:10:41.916
- Sounds like a plan.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.895
That moment may have
been a one-time thing.

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:51.068
But, it'll be with me forever.

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:53.405
Let's move.

00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:55.376
- Roger!

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:08.369
So does that mean we're
standing in uncharted territory?

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.910
- In the sense that it's never
been recorded on a map, yes.

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:13.680
And well,

00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:15.149
there's something
about this place,

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:18.189
it seems kinda peculiar
for some reason.

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:19.491
- You see these flowers?

00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:22.030
I've never come
across them before.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.998
They don't look like anything

00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:24.167
in the Dungeon field guide

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.838
at the Guild.

00:11:25.938 --> 00:11:28.777
- Could be the only
vegetation that grows here,

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:30.413
in the White Palace.

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.486
(Ryu sniffs)

00:11:33.587 --> 00:11:35.457
Bell. check it out.

00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:36.926
- Uh, okay.

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:40.434
(Bell sniffs)

00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:41.936
Oh, wow! Smells sweet!

00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.941
- I know it's just
a small little thing.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.945
But it can still make
you feel better.

00:11:46.045 --> 00:11:49.251
- Uh-huh!, Yeah I think
it did!, Thank you!

00:11:50.688 --> 00:11:53.960
(foreboding music)

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:04.949
A dead end.

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:07.955
Maybe we shouldn't have
come this way, you think?

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:13.934
- Look up there.

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:17.273
Those rocks. Their
composition is different.

00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:22.283
(Bell grunts)

00:12:22.952 --> 00:12:25.958
(knife clangs)

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:32.170
(rock cracking)

00:12:40.855 --> 00:12:43.493
Okay, we are on
the 37th Floor now.

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:46.131
- Miss Ryu. Look over there.

00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:49.071
- [Ryu] I sense it,
too. Monsters are close.

00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:53.546
- We're back, aren't
we? In the real Dungeon.

00:12:57.956 --> 00:13:01.996
(footsteps crunching)
(suspenseful music)

00:13:02.096 --> 00:13:04.969
We still haven't
seen any monsters.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:08.242
- I must admit, the
silence is rather eerie.

00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:11.448
Let's enjoy it while we
can. Stay on your toes.

00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:12.551
- Roger.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:21.503
(suspenseful music continues)

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:24.174
(both gasp)

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:29.184
Miss Ryu, am I seeing things.?

00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.457
- No. It's one of
the Great Rings.

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:36.331
This path. It's the normal
route, I'm certain of it.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:39.104
The wall is an ashen gray.

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:42.811
Which means one thing.
It's the Fourth Ring.

00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:45.183
- So, if we can make it
past that wall, then?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.320
- [Ryu] All that's left
is the Fifth Wall.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.726
And once we cross that,
it's a straight shot

00:13:49.826 --> 00:13:53.365
to the 36th Floor's
adjoining tunnel.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.602
- Let's keep going!

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:57.007
- Okay.

00:13:57.107 --> 00:14:00.246
- Finally. Luck's on our side.

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:02.785
No, that's not it, it's not
luck.

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:05.423
We kept pushing, we kept
fighting,

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:07.193
and our hard work paid off.

00:14:07.762 --> 00:14:11.034
(melancholy music)

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.945
We can make it home.
And we will.

00:14:33.046 --> 00:14:36.084
To the surface.
To all our friends.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.489
Both me and Miss Ryu.

00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:41.529
(both gasp)

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:42.932
- Do you feel that, too?

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:46.438
- I do. Something isn't right.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.559
I don't see any monsters.
But I can sense it.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:59.698
A bloodthirsty malevolence
closing in on us.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.206
(ominous music)

00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:06.245
(object thuds)
(Bell gasps)

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:08.415
(both gasp)

00:15:08.517 --> 00:15:09.451
(monster growls)

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:12.290
(tense music)

00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:17.300
(monster growling)

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.306
The Juggernaut,
it's right there.

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:23.179
(Ryu panting)

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.483
Was it waiting for us?

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:27.453
Here?

00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:30.126
At the very last obstacle

00:15:30.226 --> 00:15:32.564
keeping us from the 36th Floor.

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.304
It's got it's arm back?

00:15:37.842 --> 00:15:40.046
But I, I'm positive
I sliced it off

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:41.716
the last time I fought it!

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:46.324
What IS that?

00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:49.732
A Skull Sheep?!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:51.235
- It can't be.

00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:54.374
- Did it devour, another
monster?

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.284
- But that's not possible.
How could it do that?

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:04.394
(monster growling)
(tense music)

00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:05.396
(Bell gasps)

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:08.903
(Bell grunts)

00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:11.308
- That's not just a Skull Sheep.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:14.047
That looks like the
flesh of a Barbarian!

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:17.153
And those are, the
bones of a Spartoi!

00:16:18.256 --> 00:16:21.261
(monster eyes zapping)
(Bell grunts)

00:16:21.362 --> 00:16:23.534
The rest of its
tail grew back, too.

00:16:23.634 --> 00:16:26.505
Those look like Lizardman
scales on the outside!

00:16:29.078 --> 00:16:31.014
(monster growls)

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.720
It ate a bunch of
different monsters

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.523
and fused them with its body!

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.698
Almost like some
sort of chimera!

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:41.870
(Bell grunts)

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.039
(Bell yells)

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:44.576
It's slower than before.

00:16:44.676 --> 00:16:46.445
I can follow its movements!

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:49.785
Don't panic. At this
rate, I can take it down-

00:16:51.957 --> 00:16:52.792
(Bell gasps)

00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:54.529
(Bell grunts)
Spikes!

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.398
It can attack like a Skull
Sheep, too?

00:16:56.499 --> 00:16:58.837
(Ryu gasps)
(tense music continues)

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.509
(Bell grunts)

00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:03.580
It's compensating for
its slower speed

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.816
with these new abilities!

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.586
(spikes rattling)

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:09.859
(Bell panting)

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.394
- My body's frozen.

00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:15.637
This is a disaster. A
nightmare come to life.

00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:20.212
But I can't give up. I
don't want to lose him!

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:22.250
Anyone but Bell!

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:25.657
(Ryu gasps)

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.431
- Miss Ryu!

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:32.203
(monster growls)
(ominous music)

00:17:32.304 --> 00:17:35.076
(claw thudding)

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:37.146
(both grunt)

00:17:38.883 --> 00:17:43.826
- Impossible. That attack
belongs to the Floor Boss,
Udaeus!

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.099
(Bell gags)

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.703
You hurt?

00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:52.043
(Bell groaning)

00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:54.748
(Ryu gasps)

00:17:57.521 --> 00:17:59.258
- Fire Bolt!

00:17:59.358 --> 00:18:03.098
(Bell screams in pain)

00:18:06.606 --> 00:18:08.910
(monster growling)

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.682
(Ryu grunts)

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.257
(tense music continues)

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.103
(Ryu grunting)

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:28.482
(Ryu grunting)
(monster growling)

00:18:31.288 --> 00:18:34.561
(monsters hissing)

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.233
- [Ryu] More monsters.

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.738
But it's the only choice
we've got!

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:44.247
(monsters growling)

00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:54.234
(spikes thudding)
(Ryu grunting)

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.304
We're out of range!

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.621
(monster growling)

00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:08.529
(Ryu grunts)

00:19:15.075 --> 00:19:17.547
I'll use my healing magic.

00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:22.824
(magical buzzing)

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:30.038
It's too late. We're done for.

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:32.711
Bell and I have lost
too much blood.

00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:34.715
(somber music)

00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:40.927
We may have survived for this
long, but it's all over now.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:44.635
(Bell coughing)

00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:46.404
Bell!

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.308
- Miss Ryu?

00:19:49.143 --> 00:19:53.285
- Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

00:19:54.989 --> 00:19:57.093
- And the, Juggernaut?

00:19:57.193 --> 00:20:01.603
- Don't you worry. It's gone.

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:02.838
We're safe.

00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:06.812
Okay? So, just rest up.

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:13.058
- Guess it must've given
up, on catching us.

00:20:13.158 --> 00:20:14.394
- Yeah.

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:18.636
- That means we can go
home, right? Both of us.

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:22.644
Back to Miss Syr and,
the others.

00:20:22.744 --> 00:20:27.486
- Yeah. We're going home,
we'll be there soon.

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:29.892
(somber music continues)

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:31.128
Bell.

00:20:31.228 --> 00:20:32.764
- [Bell] Yeah?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.972
- Can you hold me, one last
time?

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:42.651
(Bell grunts)

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:47.894
(gentle music)

00:20:54.174 --> 00:20:55.375
So warm.

00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:01.355
I feel closer to him than
anyone else in the world

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:03.291
at least for right now.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.298
Who would have thought
the final moments

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.638
of a fruitless death
could be so sweet?

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:13.946
I'm glad we're together.

00:21:17.454 --> 00:21:21.529
Bell, I need to get
some rest, for a bit.

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:23.399
- Yeah, Please.

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:25.469
I'll wake you up soon.

00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:31.081
(Ryu breathes softly)

00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:32.551
It's for the best.

00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:36.559
Poor Miss Ryu. She's already
been through so much.

00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:39.765
Please, let her
have sweet dreams.

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:42.904
At least until it's all over.

00:21:43.874 --> 00:21:46.946
(Bell grunting)

00:21:47.047 --> 00:21:49.317
(dramatic music)

00:21:49.418 --> 00:21:51.923
My entire body is
screaming in pain.

00:21:52.023 --> 00:21:53.292
But...

00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:57.099
As long as I can feel
the pain. I can move!

00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:06.017
(Bell grunting weakly)

00:22:07.788 --> 00:22:11.361
Don't you worry Miss
Ryu, I WILL protect you!

00:22:15.837 --> 00:22:18.643
(Ending Theme)

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:48.121
Next time: Luvia.
