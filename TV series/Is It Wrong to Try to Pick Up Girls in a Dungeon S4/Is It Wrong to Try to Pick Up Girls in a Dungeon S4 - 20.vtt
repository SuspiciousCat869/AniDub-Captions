WEBVTT

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:06.376
(explosions)

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.038
(Ryu grunts)

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.445
(Alise landing)

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.658
- (yelps) That was a close one!

00:00:46.758 --> 00:00:48.529
- It appears it was a trap.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.369
But seriously, trying to
bury us alive with bombs?

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.374
That's both tacky,
and laughable.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.287
- How the hell did they survive?

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:04.159
Damn you, Astrea
Familia bitches!

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.800
Do you have any idea how much
those blaze rocks cost us?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.470
- [Isuka] Well of course we
survived.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.376
In case you forgot, we're
the Astrea Familia.

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:15.214
- Still, that was a pretty huge
explosion.

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:18.354
You must have spent quite a
bit of time planting 'em, huh?

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:20.926
- It's such a pity it was all
for nothing.

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.665
- (grunts) Gods damn you all!

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.503
- Prepare yourself, Jura.

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:28.407
Your sinister plot ends now, got
that?

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:30.411
- There's no where left for you
to run.

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:33.251
- We're going to finish this
here.

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.725
- And you will be answering
for all your crimes.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.394
Every last one of them!

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:39.664
(sword draws)

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:40.966
- Let's put an end to this,

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.306
to Evilus, and their reign of
terror!

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:50.920
- (winces) Oh, gimme a damn
break.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.692
There's no way I'm gonna let it
end here.

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:58.334
(Juggernaut screaming)

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:02.108
- Mm?

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.079
- What was that?

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.083
(Jura groaning)

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:09.457
(creature wailing)

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:16.804
(stone cracking)
(water rushing)

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:21.614
(creatures echoing)

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.587
(water gushing)

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.597
(stones rumbling)

00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:34.874
(eye flashes)

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:36.077
(Neun gasps)

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:38.147
(Juggernaut growling)

00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:41.119
(Neun moans)

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:45.094
- No, what is happening?

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:48.300
(dramatic music)

00:02:50.706 --> 00:02:53.511
(Asta screams)

00:02:57.954 --> 00:03:00.826
(Juggernaut bites)

00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:11.715
(Ryu panting)

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:15.154
(Juggernaut snarling)

00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:17.860
(Ryu yells)

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.764
- Lion, don't!

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.874
(Ryu yelling)

00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:26.978
(Ryu grunts)

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:32.456
(Ryu sputtering)
- Idiot! (grunts)

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.035
(sword falling)

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:42.510
(Kaguya panting)

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.244
(Ryu gasps)

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:47.118
(blood splattering)

00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:50.191
- Celty, on my mark, open fire!

00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:51.961
- Mm!

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:53.965
- Ha--
- Ha!

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:57.171
(energy buzzing)

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:06.023
(energy exploding)

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:08.829
(Ryana &amp; Celty yelping)

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.868
(Ryana screaming)

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:15.175
- Celty, no.

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:16.477
Ryana?

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:19.817
(Juggernaut lands)
(Isuka yelping)

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:21.320
(blows landing)

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.627
(Isuka screeching)

00:04:24.727 --> 00:04:29.269
(Juggernaut snarling)
(Isuka whimpering)

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.375
(Isuka screams)

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.747
(weapon clattering)

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:37.653
(Marrue panting)

00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:40.559
- Marrue!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.533
(Marrue panicking)

00:04:46.237 --> 00:04:48.207
(Alise panting)

00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:49.375
(Alise yells)

00:04:49.477 --> 00:04:52.917
(Alise groans)
(Juggernaut stabbing)

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:54.754
(Alise coughs)

00:04:54.854 --> 00:04:57.926
(tail withdrawing)

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:01.468
- Alise, no.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.304
- Stop, you stay back!

00:05:03.404 --> 00:05:06.477
(Rudra Familia screaming)

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.106
(Alise panting)

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.611
- Kaguya, Lion, you okay?

00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:29.724
- (grunts) Do we look okay to
you?

00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:32.729
Captain, I think you might
need to get your eyes checked.

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:38.442
Poor Lion, physical injuries
aside, she's in shock.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.113
She's in no shape
to fight right now.

00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:42.182
(Alise sighs)

00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:47.125
- Alise. (whimpering)

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.298
I'm sorry, that
thing got me too.

00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:51.801
Gods damn it!

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:53.705
I can't see a thing.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.343
(Kaguya shudders)

00:05:56.444 --> 00:05:59.382
(Alise sighs)

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:03.591
(Lyla whimpering)

00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:06.330
- Forgive me.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.171
Kaguya, Lyla, I need you
to lay down your lives,

00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:13.211
because I need us to save Lion.

00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.014
(Ryu grunts)

00:06:15.114 --> 00:06:17.686
- Sure, count me in.
(Ryu panting)

00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:21.160
Even though my life is more
important than anyone else's,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.364
I gotta say, if this
is my last fight,

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:26.537
I can't really think of a
better group to go out with.

00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:30.579
- Yes, if I die here,
then so be it.

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:34.419
It means the time has
come to make our choice.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.926
But Captain, you
need to survive.

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:41.099
So long as you and
Lady Astrea are alive,

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.936
true justice will prevail.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:44.740
- Not quite, Kaguya.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.980
There's as many types of
justice as there are people.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.751
How do you define justice?

00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.456
I still don't know the answer
truthfully.

00:06:53.157 --> 00:06:54.760
But I do know Lion.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.332
She always does the right thing.

00:06:57.432 --> 00:07:00.037
She stays true to her own
justice.

00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:04.212
(Ryu whimpering)

00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:06.584
Lion, listen.

00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:08.420
We need to use your magic.

00:07:08.522 --> 00:07:10.992
We need you to kill
that damn thing.

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:17.673
We're going to tear off
its shell, okay?

00:07:17.773 --> 00:07:19.810
Stay here, and start chanting.

00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:23.484
(Ryu whimpers)

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:27.593
Please, promise me, Lion.

00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:34.474
And be sure to make it happen
someday,

00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:36.844
those lofty ideals of yours.

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:41.954
(Ryu sobbing)

00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:49.102
Bye for now, Lion.
- You make sure

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:50.572
to keep it together.

00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:53.478
Live enough for the rest of us.

00:07:55.047 --> 00:07:56.651
- I'm giving these to you.

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.489
Don't just keep them,

00:07:58.589 --> 00:08:00.057
you need to use them.

00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:02.062
You understand me, arch rival?

00:08:02.162 --> 00:08:03.798
Stay strong out there.

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:13.016
(Juggernaut snarling)

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:24.172
- Now, in the skies of the
distant forest,

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:31.721
to the infinite stars mounted
upon the eternal firmament

00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:34.794
to the night (whimpering),

00:08:34.894 --> 00:08:40.270
This fool doth entreat, just
once for the the divine
protection

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:43.978
of the star's fire.
(Kaguya grunts)

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:48.120
(Kaguya shrieks)

00:08:48.221 --> 00:08:52.929
Grant thy benevolent light to
the one who abandoned thee,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.804
(sobbing) come forth,
wandering wind

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:59.209
my fellow drifter--
- AGALLIS ARVESYNTH!

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:03.283
- [Ryu] Cross the skies,
speed through the wastelands,

00:09:03.383 --> 00:09:05.855
race more swiftly
than any other.

00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:07.793
(Alise grunting)

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:11.501
Let the light of stardust
occupy me, and strike...

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:12.536
(Alise growls)

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:13.838
(tail stabs)
(Alise shrieks)

00:09:13.938 --> 00:09:14.907
my enemy.

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:19.550
(soft music)

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.888
(flames bursting)

00:09:21.988 --> 00:09:24.827
(Alise yells)

00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:25.995
- Arvelia!

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:27.633
(Juggernaut explodes)

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.137
(Juggernaut wailing)

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:33.176
(Alise groaning)

00:09:36.484 --> 00:09:39.155
(Ryu wails)

00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:41.092
Ryu...

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.566
- Luminous Wind!

00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:07.913
- [Ryu Thinking] A wave
of emotions washed over me.

00:10:08.013 --> 00:10:10.552
Devastated by the
loss of my friends,

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.023
enraged that I
couldn't finish the job,

00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:16.129
confused as to how
it escaped, (Ryu wailing)

00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:18.902
and ashamed that I
had somehow survived,

00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:22.375
despite bearing the
mark of incompetence.

00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:25.415
I was resolved not
to lose my life there.

00:10:25.516 --> 00:10:27.853
My friends' death
would have been in vain.

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:31.093
I left, albeit begrudgingly,

00:10:31.193 --> 00:10:34.031
to avoid attracting
monsters to the area.

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:38.240
When I returned to the surface,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.580
I couldn't bring myself to
set foot in our Familia home,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.851
because it reminded me of Alise.

00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:48.360
Plus, I had no idea what
to say to Lady Astrea.

00:10:48.462 --> 00:10:52.034
Once my wounds were healed,
I went back to the 30th floor

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:54.640
to give my friends
a proper burial.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:57.111
However,

00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.350
not a single one of
their corpses remained.

00:11:01.554 --> 00:11:04.225
They were devoured,
bones and all.

00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:06.964
And as for that thing...

00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:14.045
I had to find it and fight it.

00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:18.788
I was prepared to die,
to avenge my friends,

00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:21.292
to be judged for my sins.

00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:24.867
(Nordic music)

00:11:28.674 --> 00:11:31.146
- What am I supposed to do now?

00:11:31.246 --> 00:11:34.218
Tell me, Alise, please.

00:11:35.354 --> 00:11:37.860
- [Ryu Thinking] I felt
utterly helpless.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.530
My duty to stay alive,

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.401
and my longing for
death blurred together.

00:11:42.502 --> 00:11:45.476
It tormented me to no end.

00:11:45.576 --> 00:11:47.078
Before long, the pain began

00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:50.350
to turn into despicable
thoughts.

00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:51.888
- They will pay.

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:58.801
The Rudra Familia, Jura, if
it's the last thing I do.

00:11:59.703 --> 00:12:01.006
- [Ryu Thinking] It
wasn't what anyone

00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:04.613
would have called justice,
neither a noble cause,

00:12:04.713 --> 00:12:09.990
nor an ideal, it was
hatred, pure and simple.

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:15.669
(somber music)

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:17.404
- [Ryu] I'm begging you.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:22.414
- [Ryu Thinking] I
pleaded with Lady Astrea

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:26.123
to leave Orario,
no questions asked.

00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:28.662
My emotions were
dictating my actions,

00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:31.332
and I didn't want to
be seen like that.

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:33.136
But most of all,

00:12:33.237 --> 00:12:35.208
I wouldn't let anyone
get in the way

00:12:35.308 --> 00:12:36.477
of my plan.

00:12:38.482 --> 00:12:39.883
- [Astrea] Okay then.

00:12:40.652 --> 00:12:43.791
(Astrea walking)

00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:49.035
Ryu, you should
give up on justice.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.370
(Ryu gasps)

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.011
- [Ryu Thinking] I was
excommunicated

00:12:54.111 --> 00:12:56.149
by the goddess of justice.

00:12:57.084 --> 00:12:58.921
She didn't resent her blessing,

00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:02.897
though that was probably
an act of mercy on her part.

00:13:02.997 --> 00:13:05.367
The justice I championed
went up in smoke,

00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:08.908
leaving a pitiful pile
of ashes in its place.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.183
That's when the bloodbath began,

00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:15.789
people, buildings,
and command posts

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:19.161
with ties to the Rudra
Familia or Evilus.

00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:22.335
I didn't give the other
Familias time to intervene.

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:26.175
I destroyed it all,
sneaking in at night,

00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:31.019
planning ambushes, laying
traps, no method was beneath me.

00:13:31.119 --> 00:13:34.793
Succumbing to my
emotions, I cut down evil,

00:13:34.893 --> 00:13:37.899
along with anyone who seemed
suspicious.

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:41.406
Not once did I pause to
consider the consequences.

00:13:41.507 --> 00:13:44.714
I was looking for
somewhere to dig my grave.

00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:46.049
And then...

00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:48.788
- [Man] (gasps) It's Gale Wind!

00:13:48.888 --> 00:13:54.265
(blood splatters)
(man sputtering)

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:59.977
- You son of a bitch, Lion!

00:14:00.077 --> 00:14:04.285
- Jura, you're going to
pay for what you've done!

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.791
(Jura whimpering)

00:14:06.891 --> 00:14:08.561
(flames erupting)

00:14:08.662 --> 00:14:11.968
- [Ryu Thinking] Everything
after that gets kind of hazy.

00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:15.074
Blinded with white hot
rage, I attacked Jura.

00:14:15.174 --> 00:14:18.179
I stabbed him over
and over with my blade.

00:14:19.449 --> 00:14:22.789
And while he did live,
I wouldn't find that out

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:24.560
until much later on.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.501
- (laughing) Not bad,
little elf.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.636
(Ryu grunts)

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.807
Oh, would you go so far as

00:14:31.907 --> 00:14:34.078
to murder a god in cold blood?

00:14:34.178 --> 00:14:39.288
(chuckling) Oh my,
if looks could kill.

00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:41.894
That expression on your face,

00:14:41.994 --> 00:14:45.233
it makes me think I ought to
recruit you into my Familia.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.910
(snickering) Ta-ta.

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:56.222
- [Ryu Thinking] I
had exacted my revenge,

00:14:57.058 --> 00:15:00.598
and yet somehow, I survived.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:05.340
(rain pattering)
I wanted to die,

00:15:05.442 --> 00:15:07.344
but I couldn't.

00:15:07.446 --> 00:15:10.485
I was engulfed by
a vast emptiness.

00:15:10.585 --> 00:15:12.489
I felt nothing else.

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:15.662
(Ryu collapses)

00:15:15.762 --> 00:15:18.467
Why had I been left alive?

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.311
Why had I wielded
all those blades?

00:15:24.412 --> 00:15:27.519
Do I go on living, since my
friends sacrificed themselves

00:15:27.619 --> 00:15:32.327
for me, or should I die as
punishment for my crimes?

00:15:33.063 --> 00:15:34.466
I had no purpose.

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:38.206
I didn't know what to
do with myself anymore.

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:40.745
That was around the time
Syr rescued me,

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:43.049
just like Alise had.

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:47.224
But, I didn't want it this time.

00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:50.765
I had yet to be
judged for my sins.

00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:53.671
(somber music)

00:16:02.856 --> 00:16:05.962
- Ah, my friends!

00:16:06.697 --> 00:16:09.335
Kaguya, Lyla, say something!

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:13.444
Neese, Marrue, take me with you!

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:17.485
Ryana, Asta, Neun, Isuka, Celty!

00:16:24.265 --> 00:16:25.668
Alise!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.943
Come back, don't leave me alone!

00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:35.287
(rubble shifting)

00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:41.066
- (grunts) Mr. Cranel.

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:43.705
- Miss Ryu, thank goodness.

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.711
(Ryu grunts)

00:16:46.811 --> 00:16:48.681
- [Ryu] Where are we?

00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:54.125
I remember being surrounded
by monsters in the Colosseum.

00:16:54.225 --> 00:16:57.666
The Colosseum's floor was
destroyed by the explosion.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.536
Did we fall through it?

00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:03.744
There was a passage
below us this whole time.

00:17:03.844 --> 00:17:06.315
- Let's head out, come on.
(winces)

00:17:07.653 --> 00:17:10.290
(Ryu gasps)

00:17:13.998 --> 00:17:17.005
- Tell me, what was the reason?

00:17:17.105 --> 00:17:20.310
Mr. Cranel, why did
you come back for me?

00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:22.982
Why didn't you just
leave me behind?

00:17:23.082 --> 00:17:25.521
Answer me!

00:17:25.621 --> 00:17:29.930
- It's simple really, because
you'd do the same for me.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.098
(Ryu gasps)

00:17:31.199 --> 00:17:33.136
- You're wrong,
I wouldn't save you,

00:17:33.236 --> 00:17:35.641
even if it meant that I'd--
- That's a lie.

00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:37.779
- (gasps) Put me down right now.

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:40.283
Just go away and leave me here.

00:17:40.383 --> 00:17:41.286
- I can't.

00:17:41.386 --> 00:17:43.958
I refuse, because you'll die.

00:17:44.058 --> 00:17:46.028
- Then you're going to die!

00:17:46.864 --> 00:17:48.701
I said that's enough,
Mr. Cranel.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.139
Please don't waste any
more of your strength on me

00:17:51.239 --> 00:17:52.876
than you already have.

00:17:52.976 --> 00:17:56.149
Don't do this,
I'm begging you to stop.

00:17:56.249 --> 00:18:00.057
- [Lyla] Lion, live
enough for the rest of us.

00:18:00.157 --> 00:18:02.394
- Let me die here with them!

00:18:06.904 --> 00:18:10.176
I'm a filthy criminal.

00:18:10.276 --> 00:18:13.785
I let my Familia die, and
murdered my dearest friend

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:16.356
with my own two hands.

00:18:16.457 --> 00:18:20.364
I was the only one who
walked away with their life.

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:24.973
I let despicable thoughts
consume me, I killed people.

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:27.144
There was no justice in that.

00:18:27.244 --> 00:18:30.116
The very thing my friends
risked their lives for

00:18:30.216 --> 00:18:34.459
that they trusted me with,
and like Lady Astrea said,

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.929
I gave it up.

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:39.301
There's no justice left in me.

00:18:39.402 --> 00:18:42.074
I don't deserve to
be rescued by you.

00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:44.813
Please believe me.
- Justice, huh?

00:18:44.914 --> 00:18:47.050
I don't know all
that much about it.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.192
But, you've given me so
many things Miss Ryu.

00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:54.667
That's got to be it,
that's justice.

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:56.403
(Ryu gasps)

00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:59.074
You've saved other
adventurer's lives.

00:19:00.544 --> 00:19:03.316
Goddess Hestia, Lily, Welf, me.

00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:08.861
You've saved my life
countless times.

00:19:10.865 --> 00:19:15.340
So truthfully, in my eyes,
you were always the hero,

00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:16.977
a righteous champion of justice

00:19:17.077 --> 00:19:19.181
who swoops in and
saves us many times.

00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:21.086
- No, stop it.

00:19:21.186 --> 00:19:22.555
I was still wrong!

00:19:22.655 --> 00:19:26.797
I lost control, and tossed
justice aside.

00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:28.968
- No one can tell me otherwise.

00:19:29.068 --> 00:19:31.105
Not even you, you understand?

00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:33.611
(Ryu whimpers)

00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:36.583
I don't know much
about the old Miss Ryu.

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.021
And maybe, maybe you did make

00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:41.593
a few mistakes along the way.

00:19:41.693 --> 00:19:45.935
However, the Miss Ryu
I know was always right.

00:19:46.035 --> 00:19:49.676
She knew better than everyone.

00:19:49.776 --> 00:19:54.619
So, you didn't give it up
or cast it aside, okay?

00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:59.930
That justice, it still lives on.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.604
It lives on within
you, in your heart.

00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:07.645
- But I do know Lion, she
always does the right thing.

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:12.855
- [Ryu Thinking] Oh, Alise.

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:16.362
- And right now, my justice

00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:18.968
is making it home
alive with you.

00:20:19.068 --> 00:20:20.170
Is that clear?

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.345
I won't ever let you go.
(Ryu whimpers)

00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:26.550
- [Ryu] Maybe I can go home,

00:20:29.055 --> 00:20:30.624
with Mr. Cranel.

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:38.340
(rocks exploding)
(Bell gasps)

00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:39.977
(monster snarling)
- A barbarian!

00:20:40.077 --> 00:20:44.786
(Bell grunting)
(impact landing)

00:20:44.886 --> 00:20:46.222
- [Ryu] Mr. Cranel!

00:20:46.322 --> 00:20:50.832
(Ending Song)

00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:54.873
Wake up, wake up! (grunting)

00:20:55.642 --> 00:20:58.379
Please say something to me!

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.218
No!

00:21:02.254 --> 00:21:05.127
Wake up, Bell, please.

00:21:05.227 --> 00:21:08.066
(monster snarling)
Speak to me, answer me.

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.838
Come on, just wake up.

00:21:15.047 --> 00:21:17.685
(Ryu gasps)

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.795
(Ryu screams)

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:27.805
(monster explodes)

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.724
- Sorry about that, I heard
you calling my name but,

00:21:36.824 --> 00:21:39.596
I was trying to lure
the monster in closer.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.200
And...

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.474
(Ryu whimpering)

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:52.555
I'm sorry, that
must have been scary.

00:21:55.828 --> 00:21:57.966
- One request,

00:21:58.066 --> 00:22:01.940
please don't ever do that
to me again, all right?

00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:03.977
- (sighs) Okay.

00:22:04.077 --> 00:22:05.280
I promise.

00:22:11.693 --> 00:22:16.035
Miss Ryu, look there.
(Ryu pants)

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:18.640
- A blue light?
- What is it?

00:22:19.409 --> 00:22:21.212
- [Ryu] I'm not sure,

00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:23.417
this is the first
time I've seen it.

00:22:23.518 --> 00:22:24.886
- Let's check it out.

00:22:28.327 --> 00:22:30.631
Is that a river?

00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:34.539
- Yes but, a water
source on the 37th floor?

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:38.346
I've never heard anyone
mention anything like that.

00:22:38.447 --> 00:22:41.286
It was underneath the
Colosseum the entire time.

00:22:41.386 --> 00:22:43.658
I guess, maybe no one
knew it existed,

00:22:43.758 --> 00:22:46.630
because everyone steers
clear of the area.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.536
- Either way, we should
take a break (grunts).

00:22:52.809 --> 00:22:56.116
(Bell panting)

00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:59.989
- Bell!
(water splashing)

00:23:01.526 --> 00:23:03.931
Song of a now far away forest,

00:23:04.031 --> 00:23:06.102
the comforting melody of life.

00:23:06.202 --> 00:23:09.809
Noah Heal.
(magic shimmering)

00:23:14.085 --> 00:23:17.023
(water splashes)

00:23:18.594 --> 00:23:20.965
It's drinkable, that's good.

00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:30.451
Have some, here,
drink up, you need it.

00:23:32.187 --> 00:23:35.360
(Bell sips)
Ah.

00:23:36.897 --> 00:23:40.370
- (grunts) Miss Ryu?

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.812
- Oh Bell, thank goodness.

00:23:47.283 --> 00:23:50.089
- [Ryu] Next time, "Day Dream".
