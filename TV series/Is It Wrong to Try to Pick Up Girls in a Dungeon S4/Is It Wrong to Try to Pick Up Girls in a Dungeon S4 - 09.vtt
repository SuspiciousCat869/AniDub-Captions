WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.307
(suspenseful music)

00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:06.681
- [Cassandra] A great
disaster cometh.

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.655
The fairy who was sworn
to be an usher of doom,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:15.196
shall drag the surging white
flames into severe plight.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.745
Take heed. It is the
banquet of tragedy.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.289
(Opening Song)

00:01:58.804 --> 00:01:59.707
(running footsteps)

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:01.475
- Miss Ryu was the murderer?

00:02:01.577 --> 00:02:03.113
I really don't want
to believe that,

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:05.216
but if that Jura guy

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:07.756
really did help kill
her old familia,

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:08.624
then...

00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:10.895
(panting)

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.834
(explosion)

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.607
(grunting)

00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:18.711
Was that Ryu's magic?

00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:24.054
(gentle mysterious music)

00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:26.760
(panting)

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:28.096
(footsteps stop)

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:30.200
- [Jura] Bell Cranel?

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.539
- It's you!

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.710
Please! You've gotta save me!

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.582
She's going to kill me,
she'll do it!

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:38.618
(crying in fear)

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:39.686
Please!

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:43.661
(slow footsteps)

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.234
(slow, dramatic music)

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:48.704
- Ryu, wait.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:55.518
(suspenseful music plays)

00:02:55.618 --> 00:02:59.324
- Why are you always
getting involved?

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:05.270
Go somewhere else,
you're in the way.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.911
I can't slay that bastard
with you standing there.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.683
(whimpering and crying)

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:14.923
I have only ever made
one real mistake,

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:18.163
and that was not making
sure you were dead, Jura.

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.135
My arrogance got
the better of me.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.270
I thought I'd killed you

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:24.876
and it fills me with
so much regret.

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.521
(footsteps)

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:33.093
I should have completely
snuffed out your life

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:35.164
when I had the chance.

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:36.499
- Wait, but Ryu...

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.536
(gasps)

00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:41.710
(suspenseful music playing)

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:46.687
- I won't hesitate to cut you
down if you try and stop me.

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:48.924
(gasps)

00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:57.274
- [Bell] Is it true that
you're responsible for this man

00:03:57.375 --> 00:03:58.744
losing his arm?

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:02.217
- That's right, I am the
person who sliced it off.

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:04.589
I took off his ear
while I was at it.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.729
So, what about it?
You got a problem?

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.031
- Be honest with me.

00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.367
Are you the one
behind the murder

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.903
that happened back in Rivera?

00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:14.542
- I don't have time for
questions and answers.

00:04:14.642 --> 00:04:17.616
- [Bell] A man was found
dead in the outskirts there.

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.120
And there are witnesses who
saw you fleeing the scene.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.590
- [Ryu] Get out of my way.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.662
- [Bell] Tell me. I need to
know the truth about this!

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.067
Are you the one who
killed that man, or not?!

00:04:27.168 --> 00:04:28.737
- No, I did not!

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:33.547
- [Bell] Very well then Ryu.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.850
- [Jura] What are
you talking about?

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.085
You've got to do something.

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:37.588
You've got to take
that murderer down.

00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:39.659
- My friend said that
she didn't kill anyone,

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.297
and I'm going to believe that.

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:43.934
(gasps)

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.838
(Jura gasping)

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.879
- [Bell] See this? This was on
the ground in the passageway

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.286
where we found you. It's
blazed-rock, isn't it?

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:56.359
An item dropped, that is
incredibly combustible.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.898
The explosion that
happened in the passage

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.601
was actually your doing.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.970
(gasps)

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.143
On top of that, I'm pretty
sure those wounds of yours

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:06.613
are from a long time ago,

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:09.519
back when the Gale Wind
hunted you down.

00:05:12.057 --> 00:05:15.330
(gasps and grunts)

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.549
(evil laughter)

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.220
- Cat's out of the bag.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.926
(sounds from a whip)

00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:36.405
You and those morons from
Rivera are so goddamn useless.

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:39.078
Seriously, I knew you
couldn't take her down,

00:05:39.178 --> 00:05:42.117
but I thought you could at
least keep her busy for me.

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:45.356
(glass breaking)

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:53.607
- I'm truly sorry Ryu, I
should have trusted you.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:56.813
- No, I should apologize.
I honestly lost my temper,

00:05:56.913 --> 00:06:00.219
and it really clouded
my judgment.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.428
I do appreciate you believing
me, despite my foolishness.

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.398
I must thank you for that.

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.708
He must be stopped.

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:12.812
So, please help me
deal with him.

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:14.448
- Sure.

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.119
- Jura, give yourself up.

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.125
Your plan of provoking that
large group of adventurers

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:21.062
into killing me has failed.

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:22.866
No one is here to help you.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.671
- [Jura] Now, don't tell
me you forgot who I am.

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.842
I'm a monster tamer. Ah!

00:06:27.943 --> 00:06:29.211
(evil laughter)

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:32.718
(sounds from a whip)

00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:37.728
(rocks falling)

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.402
(crashing)

00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:43.139
(footsteps)

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:45.476
- [group member] It's just
as you expected, Ouranos.

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:48.817
I've discovered a room
full of caged monsters.

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:52.057
It seems the Ikelos familia
weren't the only ones

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.426
to use this place.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:55.496
There must have been
remnants of Evilus

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.169
carrying out some sort
of experiment.

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:01.509
In any case, this is
astonishing.

00:07:02.678 --> 00:07:05.384
I can't believe they were
able to capture monsters

00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:07.153
from the deep floors.

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:10.628
- What's the meaning of this?

00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:14.736
- Oh, I see, there wasn't
just one rotten apple.

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:17.608
- It was the entire barrel, huh?

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:18.778
- We're short on time and

00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:20.615
you keep getting
in the damn way.

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.552
So now we have to kill you.

00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:25.423
Jura's plan is
happening, it's on!

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:27.928
(sound from a whip)

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.900
(rocks falling)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.168
(gasps)

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.872
- Move it!

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:35.545
(gasps)

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.751
(dramatic music playing)

00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:39.519
(gasps)

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:43.627
(dramatic music continues)

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:51.776
(dramatic music continues)

00:07:55.984 --> 00:07:57.354
- Oh man.

00:07:57.454 --> 00:08:01.495
(dramatic music continues)

00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:07.608
(dramatic music continues)

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:09.913
The holes must be
from this monster.

00:08:10.013 --> 00:08:11.950
- A lambton,

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.987
a serpent monster that
tunnels through the ground

00:08:14.087 --> 00:08:16.492
that can pass from
floor to floor.

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:18.730
- [Bell] Lambton? Hold on,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.569
these things are found
on this floor too?

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:24.208
- Not quite, it's
normally supposed to reside

00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:25.711
in the deep floors.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.686
- [Group Member 1] A monster
from the deep floors?

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.790
- [Group Member 2] What
is it doing up here?

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.896
- No time to worry about
that, run for it!

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:36.800
(evil laughter)

00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:39.037
- Brought this big boy
from Knossos.

00:08:39.138 --> 00:08:43.113
All right, let's get this party
started already, shall we?

00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:44.448
Now Lambton.

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:45.316
(whip cracks)

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:46.520
(suspenseful music)

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.892
(creature shrieks)

00:08:52.497 --> 00:08:53.834
(gasps)

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:58.042
(rocks crumbing and falling)

00:09:00.648 --> 00:09:03.053
(creature shrieking)

00:09:03.153 --> 00:09:05.257
- It's crushing everything
by just moving around.

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:07.261
- It's going to wipe us out.

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:08.964
- How is it doing that?

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:10.534
I thought that being
on this floor

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:13.473
meant everyone could
safely avoid the disaster.

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:16.145
Did I, did I make a mistake?

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:18.884
- [Welf] This way.

00:09:22.858 --> 00:09:25.329
- We can't put up any sort
of real fight around here.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.100
Hey, pipsqueak, find
a field for us.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.606
- A field? What's that
supposed to mean?

00:09:29.706 --> 00:09:31.175
- [Aisha] One of those
rooms on this floor

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:32.679
that comes to a dead end.

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:34.415
If there is no flowing
water around it,

00:09:34.516 --> 00:09:35.618
it should have a field.

00:09:35.718 --> 00:09:37.855
You've got to lead us
to one of those.

00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:38.657
(panting)

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:40.226
- I can't hear it, can you?

00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:41.429
Did we lose it?

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.636
- No, it's nearby.
It must be digging.

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:46.004
But, where?

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.274
Wait, below us.

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:48.142
- Go!

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:48.810
(crashing)

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.483
(suspenseful music)

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:53.788
(crashing sound)

00:09:53.888 --> 00:09:55.825
- This is completely insane.

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:57.796
- So, there's even more
monsters like this

00:09:57.896 --> 00:09:59.766
on the deeper floors?

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.437
- It's impossible to
follow that Turk-guy now,

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:04.241
but I hate not being
able to come through

00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:06.278
after Bell put his trust in me.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.684
- Now is our chance, get moving

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.821
and finish the preparations.

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.432
(panting)

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:18.169
- [Jura] Lambton, after him!

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:21.008
(whip cracks)

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:28.823
(gasping and grunting)

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:32.765
(grunting)

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.502
- Damn it.

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:36.371
(evil laughter)

00:10:36.471 --> 00:10:38.242
- Wondering where it went, huh?

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:41.148
- Where is it?

00:10:43.954 --> 00:10:45.725
It could be anywhere.

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:49.064
- [Jura] Do you think
it's coming for you?

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:51.570
(evil laughter)

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.545
Run, sucker!

00:10:55.645 --> 00:11:00.988
- Watch out!

00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.229
It's way too erratic.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.802
(evil laughter)

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:11.075
- [Jura] Ryu Lion. Yoo-hoo
I hope you and your pal,

00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:15.016
Bell Cranel are ready to
become this lambton's dinner.

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:17.855
- Jura!

00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:23.934
(grunts)

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:28.777
(grunting and tumbling)

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:32.785
- [Jura] (chuckles maniacally)
Such a good boy, isn't he?

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.989
- Um, Ryu, is this
guy some kind of

00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:37.895
high level monster tamer
or something?

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:41.536
He's manipulating this lambton
like it's nothing at all.

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:44.241
- No. Jura was
never that strong.

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.446
- Having a hard time
understanding why my pet

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:48.850
follows my every whim?

00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:50.453
(evil laughter)

00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:51.957
This is why.

00:11:52.057 --> 00:11:55.396
It's a magic item that
can enslave monsters.

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:57.267
Those guys who are in Knossos

00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:59.939
managed to create
this forbidden item

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.542
and with its power,

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:04.782
any monster becomes
an adorable pet.

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:10.827
Ryu Lion, you fill me
with so much hatred.

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:13.633
Look at my hand,
won't stop shaking.

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:17.373
It's rage built up from the
trauma you've inflicted on me.

00:12:17.473 --> 00:12:20.881
There was a sea of blood
after you went on a rampage.

00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.520
I can't get the sight of
you slaughtering our familia

00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.990
out of my head.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.495
I still see it every time
I close my eyes.

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:33.038
Which is why I will enjoy
every second of watching

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:35.777
this monster rip you to shreds.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:39.986
(creature shrieking)

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:51.876
(running footsteps)

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:54.682
- This is it. We found a field.

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:56.986
- Haruhime, it's
level boost time.

00:12:57.086 --> 00:12:58.757
Start chanting the spell.

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:00.827
- Do you mean Kokonoe?

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:02.832
You want me to cast it on
everyone?

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.234
- No, just two of us.

00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:06.471
You collapsing from
exhaustion would hurt us

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:07.675
in the long run.

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:09.712
Boost the two in the vanguard.

00:13:09.812 --> 00:13:12.017
The rear guard should ready
their bows.

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:13.821
- Right. Magic swords

00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:16.726
- Don't bother. You would
just be wasting them.

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:19.598
That monster has a very
keen sense for magic.

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.337
We start by taking out its eyes.

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:26.011
First, that enhanced species
and now this.

00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:27.849
Being together with you guys
never fails

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:29.619
to keep me entertained.

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.890
- That is something I never
thought I'd hear from you,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.394
even in my wildest dreams.

00:13:34.494 --> 00:13:36.031
- Agreed, I'm surprised.

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.469
Or should I say honored?

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.475
- Uchide no Kozuchi

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:42.611
- Get ready!

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:45.951
(crashing)

00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:50.092
- Dance and whirl!

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.332
(crashing)

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:57.875
(dramatic music playing)

00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:03.318
(monster screeching)

00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:09.431
(grunting)

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:10.768
- This thing is tricky.

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:12.337
- That's true, but I've
already figured out

00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:15.577
how the monster moves in
response to his direct orders.

00:14:15.677 --> 00:14:16.746
- [Bell] Huh?

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:17.782
- [Ryu] We could destroy

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:19.050
that necklace pretty easily.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.153
But freeing from his power

00:14:20.253 --> 00:14:21.321
might make things worse

00:14:21.422 --> 00:14:23.459
if it goes on a rampage
afterwards.

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:26.131
I'm going to take it down.

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.735
I need you to cover me, Bell.

00:14:27.835 --> 00:14:29.037
- Ugh. Okay.

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.974
- Whenever it makes a
move to go underground

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:33.446
I want you to try and
stop it with your magic.

00:14:33.547 --> 00:14:35.216
- Sure, I'll do my best.

00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:38.455
- Luckily, this isn't my
first fight with a lambton.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:40.292
I should come out on top.

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:48.475
- [Jura] Bell Cranel,
take it from me,

00:14:48.576 --> 00:14:53.052
Being around that bitch is
nothing but a death sentence.

00:14:53.152 --> 00:14:55.123
- Don't let that puke
get a rise out of you.

00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:57.494
- [Jura] Come on, hear me out.

00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:00.768
Just how many people do
you think died as a result

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.103
of her finding me?

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:04.475
I knew she wouldn't stop
until she'd caught me,

00:15:04.576 --> 00:15:08.082
which is why I used
Turk to deal with her.

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:11.155
He turned all those
Rivira fools against her,

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:13.693
just so she'd have
a hard time keeping up.

00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:16.265
And you can bet Jean was killed

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.970
to spur them into
forming an execution squad

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.774
that would hunt her down.

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:24.081
Turk is a pretty crafty
guy like that.

00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:26.318
- But that Jean guy was
on your side, right?

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:29.224
- Sure, sure. He was one
of my good buds,

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.930
but well, plenty of my
other pals burned to death

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.234
for me in the explosions, too.

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.773
- [Bell] All the dead people in
that passageway were with you?

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:40.480
- I bet seeing that really
motivated the execution squad.

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:43.753
They freaked out thinking
Gale Wind was so cruel!

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:46.692
(music building)

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:49.532
- You won't get away with this.

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:51.869
- [Ryu] Jura, quit
tying to drag this out

00:15:51.969 --> 00:15:53.272
with your bull crap.

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:56.445
Bell Cranel, don't listen
to a word he has to say.

00:15:56.546 --> 00:15:59.051
Just stay focused on
the task at hand.

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:01.790
We'll wipe out that
monster and capture him.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:02.891
- Okay.

00:16:02.992 --> 00:16:06.131
(dramatic music)

00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:12.276
(yells and grunts)

00:16:15.584 --> 00:16:17.922
(monster screeching)

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:19.659
- [Ryu] Now, in the skies
of the distant forest

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:22.598
to the stars mounted upon
the eternal firmament

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:23.533
of the night.

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:25.202
- Shit!
(whip cracks)

00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:26.606
- [Ryu] This fool doesn't treat,

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:29.243
just once, for the protection
of the star's fire.

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:32.952
Grant thy benevolent light to
the one who abandoned thee.

00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:34.387
- Yes, Keep it up.

00:16:34.487 --> 00:16:38.029
- Come forth, wandering
wind, the vagabond traveler;

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:40.166
run with great
swiftness like no other

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:41.936
across sky and wilderness.

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:43.105
- God damn it!

00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:44.074
Lambton, under!

00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:47.113
(whip cracks)

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:49.752
- Not today!

00:16:50.687 --> 00:16:51.689
Fire bolt!

00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:57.467
- [Ryu] Let the light
of star doth occupy me

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:58.637
and strike my enemy.

00:16:58.737 --> 00:17:01.207
Luminous wind!

00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:05.282
(magic crackling)

00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:10.225
(crashing rocks)

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.641
- Incredible.

00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:18.844
(screeching monster)

00:17:18.944 --> 00:17:21.448
- Hang tough Vanguard,
one more to go.

00:17:27.493 --> 00:17:29.832
(grunting)

00:17:33.205 --> 00:17:34.808
- Awaken soul light.

00:17:39.952 --> 00:17:43.191
- It stopped. You're up
Lady Chigusa!

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:47.400
(dramatic music)

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:50.840
- This will end it for sure.

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:56.418
(dramatic music swells)

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.556
- Hell Kaios!

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:01.562
(explosion)

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:03.099
(wet squelching)

00:18:03.199 --> 00:18:05.837
(explosion)

00:18:05.938 --> 00:18:08.843
- We did it, guys!
(laughs joyfully)

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:10.980
- We just beat a deep
floor monster!

00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:12.483
- What a fight.

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:15.089
Every part of my body
is sore right now.

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:16.458
(laughs)

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:18.329
- And we got a juicy item drop.

00:18:18.429 --> 00:18:21.135
- Your greed really
knows no bounds, Lily.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:23.405
- Lady Cassandra,
if you wouldn't mind

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:26.712
would you please cast another
healing spell on everyone?

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.353
Hey, Lady Cassandra?

00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:33.492
- Was this the great disaster?

00:18:33.594 --> 00:18:35.196
It couldn't be.

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:40.339
There's not enough fear,
not enough despair.

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:44.682
It was too easily defeated
to be an embodiment of ruin.

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:46.519
This is wrong.

00:18:47.353 --> 00:18:49.725
This is not the disaster.

00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:53.867
(evil laughter)

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.269
- [Jura] You think
this is the end?

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:58.008
So sorry, it's
just the beginning.

00:18:58.108 --> 00:19:00.847
- [Ryu] What are
you talking about?

00:19:00.947 --> 00:19:04.220
- I am just a distraction.

00:19:07.829 --> 00:19:10.700
(water running)

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.038
- That's all of them.

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:14.909
Now, let's do this.

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.211
Light them up.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:19.051
(sword unsheathes)

00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:20.019
Do it.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:23.392
(explosion sounds)

00:19:31.342 --> 00:19:32.745
- What is that?

00:19:32.845 --> 00:19:36.018
(crumbling rocks)

00:19:36.118 --> 00:19:37.588
The floor is collapsing.

00:19:37.688 --> 00:19:39.157
- Run, run!

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:42.130
(people screaming)

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.165
- What now?

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.167
- What's this?

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.972
What the hell is happening?

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:50.514
- [Jura] My boys got to work
while you were busy chasing me

00:19:50.614 --> 00:19:53.620
and just now they ignited
every last blaze rock

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.521
that we had on us.

00:19:54.621 --> 00:19:57.293
(evil laughter)
- [Ryu] What?

00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:59.498
- [Jura] This area, where
the great falls penetrate,

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:02.437
can be perceived as an
entire floor itself.

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:06.144
Everything gets shared,
including the damage it takes.

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:08.215
That's how the dungeon reacts.

00:20:08.316 --> 00:20:09.786
It's gone manic.

00:20:09.886 --> 00:20:12.625
- What do you mean by manic?

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:13.994
- No.

00:20:14.094 --> 00:20:16.265
- Oh yes, that's right.

00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:18.503
I've summoned despair!

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.709
- [Ryu] Jura!

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:24.815
Do you really understand the
gravity of what you've done?

00:20:24.915 --> 00:20:26.218
Do you?

00:20:26.318 --> 00:20:27.988
- You know what I did
since you tried to kill me?

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.158
I researched for
five full years.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.663
Where's the best place to
trigger it

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:34.768
and how could I pull
off something so crazy?

00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:38.342
I also imagined how
I'd mess you up.

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:40.714
Like, how I could destroy
your pretty little face.

00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:43.519
That's what I thought
about the entire time.

00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:48.630
- [Ryu] You bastard!

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.466
- [Bell] No, don't do it Ryu!

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:52.805
- Let me go! I said, let me go!

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.541
(rumbling in distance)

00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.577
(gasping)

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:56.679
- Listen.

00:20:58.182 --> 00:21:00.854
(whimpering)

00:21:01.523 --> 00:21:04.595
(deep rumbling)

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:10.305
Um, Ryu?

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:12.443
- [Ryu] Not again.

00:21:12.544 --> 00:21:14.348
It's the same thing.

00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:16.552
It's coming, isn't it?

00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:21.294
Alise...

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.902
- [Bell] Ryu, I...

00:21:25.436 --> 00:21:26.906
- Run away.

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:28.341
Run away!

00:21:28.441 --> 00:21:32.116
Hurry and get away! You have
to leave here right now.

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:33.285
Hurry up.

00:21:33.386 --> 00:21:34.287
(evil laughter)

00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:35.857
- [Jura] It's far too late.

00:21:35.957 --> 00:21:37.159
It has begun.

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:39.865
We're in the presence
of despair.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.334
Let's bring it on.

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:43.405
Reveal yourself right now.

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:44.975
One more time.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:47.046
Let us see it up close.

00:21:47.147 --> 00:21:50.018
(evil laughter)

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:57.667
- [Cassandra] A great
disaster cometh.

00:22:00.808 --> 00:22:03.746
(crashing rocks)

00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:06.384
Take heed.

00:22:07.353 --> 00:22:10.158
It is a banquet of tragedy.

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:13.398
(crashing rocks)

00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:18.676
(Ending Song)

00:23:46.018 --> 00:23:49.457
- [Narrator] Next time,
Juggernaut.
