00:00:01.637 --> 00:00:02.639
(sword breaking)

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:04.475
- [Ryu] Get outta there!

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:07.682
- Okay, let's see how
it handles this!

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:08.551
Hope this works.

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:09.485
- No, don't!

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:10.922
- Fire bolt!

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.761
(explosions)

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.606
What, what was that?

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:23.848
Not good.

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:25.350
Got a counter.

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:30.728
(Celtic music playing)

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.158
(groaning)

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:48.496
- Run away!

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:57.281
(dramatic music playing)

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:08.771
(dramatic music continues)

00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:27.942
- [Ryu] (screaming) Bell!

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.583
(Opening Song)

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.082
- Please no.

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:14.722
(somber music playing)

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:24.241
- He's alive.

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:27.516
This scarf must have
protected him.

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.185
Just barely.

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:31.222
He can still be healed.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:43.848
The song of a now far
away forest.

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:46.319
The comforting melody of life.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.622
Noah, heal.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.837
- How is that damn twerp
still alive?

00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.139
Why won't you freaking die?

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.644
(screaming)

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.685
(death grunt)
(blood splattering)

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:10.400
- Please, help me.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:25.430
- Screw you.

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:36.920
- Damn it.

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.799
- Hey, hey, don't
just stand there.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.603
Hit it with everything
you've got.

00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:03.774
Start casting your spells.

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:11.790
- It's so strong.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.059
Too strong.

00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:17.134
I knew it.

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:19.038
Fighting against this
monstrosity

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:20.608
head on is impossible.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.485
It was the same back then,
when all of my friends died.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:30.828
Don't think about it.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.294
- Now. This is our only chance.

00:05:47.394 --> 00:05:49.464
Time to take this thing out.

00:05:52.004 --> 00:05:54.509
- No, you can't do that.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.925
I said nooooooooooo!

00:06:17.287 --> 00:06:19.024
- Son of a bitch.

00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:36.893
(sizzling flesh)

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:53.827
- No, please no.

00:06:57.034 --> 00:06:58.035
No, No!

00:07:01.843 --> 00:07:02.845
- Get up.

00:07:04.783 --> 00:07:06.987
Run for it right now.

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.898
- Gale Wind, it was you.

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:24.622
You really were at the
black Goliath battle.

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:36.078
- Just run, do it now.

00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:47.100
(screaming)

00:07:56.853 --> 00:07:58.089
I failed.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.896
I couldn't put a stop
to that bastard Jura.

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:05.470
And this is it,
where I meet my end.

00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.512
I'm sorry Syr, Mia, everyone.

00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:12.785
You gave me a place
to call home,

00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:15.289
but I was never able
to repay you.

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:21.301
At least I can be with
Alise and the others now.

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:24.609
At long last, I'll be free

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:27.180
from the sin of killing them.

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:33.894
(soft music playing)

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:37.968
- [Marie] Bell! Bell!

00:08:39.105 --> 00:08:42.711
(soft music continues)

00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:46.820
Bell.

00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:51.563
(soft music continues)

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:14.909
Hey Bell.

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.400
Bell.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.670
I'm here.

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:31.409
Please hang on.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.980
Come on Bell, don't die.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:41.028
Please, wake up.

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:43.199
Come on.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.887
(gasps)

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:56.926
- Marie?

00:09:57.026 --> 00:09:58.028
- Oh Bell.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:02.738
- My arm is okay.

00:10:15.464 --> 00:10:17.133
Thank you Marie.

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:28.155
I'm off to fight.

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:31.261
- Remember your promise.

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:33.232
You better not lose.

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:41.850
- [Bell] Ryu!

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:55.243
- Is that you, Bell?

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:03.325
(intense music playing)

00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:11.743
- He's using the scarf
this like it's a shield.

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:22.397
- It doesn't have a magic stone.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.205
- I think I see it.

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:46.846
Bell's trying to take it down
in close quarters combat.

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:50.921
- Now bring it on.

00:11:58.636 --> 00:12:01.609
- Thanks to Welf and Cassandra,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.915
I can block with
this Goliath scarf,

00:12:05.015 --> 00:12:08.188
and then, with the goddess's
knife in my other hand,

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:10.459
I can go on the offensive.

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:12.831
I can take it down.

00:12:20.012 --> 00:12:23.352
(shattering sounds)

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:27.494
I've stopped it
from jumping around

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:29.397
but it still moves so fast.

00:12:30.768 --> 00:12:33.439
(screeching)

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:35.844
- Be safe.

00:12:35.944 --> 00:12:37.381
- I need to keep it
in this area,

00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:39.384
otherwise it will definitely
go after Lili

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:40.621
and all the others.

00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.759
And I have to stop it
from doing that.

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:44.494
I will defeat it here.

00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:52.310
- It's amazing.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.282
I can't believe how strong
you've gotten.

00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:07.040
- It backed away.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.548
I know that he would
never back off in a fight

00:13:10.648 --> 00:13:11.916
and she would keep swinging

00:13:12.016 --> 00:13:13.987
her sword until the very end.

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.203
I must do the same.

00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:26.713
- No, you can't do it.

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:28.216
Don't try it.

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:29.384
- Fire bolt!

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:03.118
(intense music playing)

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:12.270
Argo Vesta!

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.055
(panting)

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.179
- I didn't let it
charge enough, crap.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.416
I need to beat it here and now.

00:15:02.705 --> 00:15:06.178
(eerie music playing)

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.097
(laughing)

00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:20.239
- Oh hell yeah.

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.176
I thought this loser
was dead meat.

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:24.682
I'm surprised he somehow
managed to knock this freak

00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:25.884
on its ass.

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:27.286
- Jura.

00:15:27.387 --> 00:15:28.757
- [Jura] But it works
out perfectly

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.262
because now it belongs to me.

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:32.664
(whip)

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:35.203
Your turn! Go my ultimate flav,

00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:37.608
tear the two of them apart.

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:38.710
Go!

00:15:39.778 --> 00:15:41.983
(laughing)

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:44.088
Do it! Butcher them.

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.491
Grab them with your classic.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.437
- That's still focused on me.

00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:17.788
- The Lambton. It's still alive.

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:21.629
- [Bell] No. Did it somehow
hear the command from Jura?

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:24.668
- Ryu!

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:30.379
- Stay away, just leave me.

00:16:32.952 --> 00:16:36.157
(rocks crumbling)

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:50.085
- Oh no.

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:53.425
Bell!

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:58.403
- [Lili] Lady
Cassandra, let me go.

00:16:58.504 --> 00:17:01.175
- [Cassandra] No,
Lili, you have to stay.

00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:03.847
Do not go to the 27th floor.

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.216
- [Daphne] Cassandra,

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.655
we don't have time for
this right now.

00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:10.193
- I cannot let any of
them go down there.

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:12.230
No matter what happens.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.002
As long as we stay here on the
25th floor

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.641
then we should be able
to avoid the disaster.

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:22.116
(rocks crumbling)

00:17:22.216 --> 00:17:23.620
- What's happening?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.422
- It's coming from below.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.397
(rumbling)

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:32.470
- Uh oh. This rumbling,

00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:34.107
it's a floor boss.

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:35.977
- You have got to be kidding me.

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.114
What's going on?

00:17:37.214 --> 00:17:38.784
- That's not possible.

00:17:38.884 --> 00:17:40.153
I made certain of it.

00:17:40.253 --> 00:17:42.858
We should have two weeks
until it's spawns again.

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:45.096
- We're going to have to throw
common sense out the window

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:47.367
at this point.
- What?

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:49.705
- Think about that huge
explosion earlier.

00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:52.778
Plus those strange noises
that sounded like screams.

00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:56.619
Wise up, this is not the same
dungeon we're used to anymore.

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:03.199
- So even though it
shouldn't spawn anytime soon,

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:05.436
you're saying it's
possible the monster rex

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:08.342
of this floor could
just show up?

00:18:09.846 --> 00:18:12.885
(rocks tumbling)

00:18:12.985 --> 00:18:14.253
- Let's go.

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:16.091
- What's going on?

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:19.364
- Get going. Everybody
make a break for it.

00:18:42.878 --> 00:18:44.480
- It's climbing up here.

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:48.589
- Hightail it you guys.

00:18:49.158 --> 00:18:52.397
(water gushing)

00:18:52.497 --> 00:18:54.635
- Hurry up Cassandra.

00:18:57.641 --> 00:19:00.312
(explosions)

00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:20.820
(coughing)

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.797
(intense music playing)

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:43.633
(roaring)

00:19:48.108 --> 00:19:52.149
- That is the monster Rex,
of the twenty seventh floor.

00:19:52.249 --> 00:19:56.024
- It is Amphisbaena.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:59.330
- No, it wasn't over yet.

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:04.508
- Take heed, this is it.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.781
A banquet of tragedy.

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:43.773
(rocks tumbling)

00:22:16.138 --> 00:22:18.375
- Ryu. Ryu.

00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:20.113
Come on.

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:22.082
Please, you have to wake up.

00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:26.457
Ryu.

00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:31.000
(eerie sounds)

00:22:35.577 --> 00:22:37.480
What is that?

00:22:37.581 --> 00:22:40.052
I've never heard a growl like
this before.

00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:44.928
And, why is it so dark?

00:22:52.611 --> 00:22:55.783
The Lambton can travel
between different floors.

00:22:55.883 --> 00:22:59.858
So then did it take us
somewhere else in the dungeon?

00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:03.164
If that's true,
then this must be.

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:05.269
- Here's a fun fact.

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:06.839
Between some floors, the color

00:23:06.939 --> 00:23:09.512
of the terrain and the
walls is very different.

00:23:09.612 --> 00:23:12.817
Like down on the 37th floor,
everything is milky white.

00:23:12.917 --> 00:23:14.187
That's how it got its nickname.

00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:16.324
You've heard of the
White Palace.

00:23:16.424 --> 00:23:17.995
It's a scary place where
even first class

00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:20.833
adventurers run the risk
of dying from something.

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:22.671
But I wouldn't worry about that.

00:23:22.771 --> 00:23:24.741
You won't be there anytime soon.

00:23:27.313 --> 00:23:28.582
- Oh my Gods,

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:31.689
this is it,

00:23:32.658 --> 00:23:34.160
the White Palace.

00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:41.709
And that means, I'm
deeper than ever before.
