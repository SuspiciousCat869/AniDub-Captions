WEBVTT

00:00:01.402 --> 00:00:06.747
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:12.257
- [Bell] Good morning, Lili.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.234
- Hey, Master Bell, top
of the morning.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.944
So our first expedition
turned out to be

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:23.981
kind of a nightmare, didn't it?

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:26.052
- (chuckles) You aren't kidding.

00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:28.090
I'm sure everyone must
be exhausted.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.126
Let's take it easy for
a little while.

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:31.530
Now that we've reached
the safe zone,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.101
we can go back to
the surface anytime.

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.276
- Master Bell.
- Hmm?

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:40.515
- Can you spare some time
for me later?

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:43.120
I'd like a chance to talk to you
one-on-one if that's all right.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.491
- You wanna talk right now?
- It can wait.

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:47.295
Let's chat after you
take care of business

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.231
and have nothing else to do.

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.108
- [Bell] Sure, sounds good.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.116
(Opening song)

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.042
- It's about time that
we had another Denatus.

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:36.345
Can hardly remember
when the last one was.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:38.283
- Come on, don't you
remember when Ikelos

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:39.719
caused all that fuss?

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.688
- Oh yeah.

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.725
That's why it got
postponed, right?

00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.796
- The Denatus is our
traditional meeting

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:48.036
every year for us Gods,
but small talk and gossip

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.907
are really the only
things that happen here.

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:51.275
- You said it my friend.

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.748
The gods are only here
to kill time, honestly.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:56.185
- Yeah, but there's
something important going on

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.390
that I absolutely had to
show up for.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.260
- [Hephaistos] I heard
all about it, Hestia.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.563
- Hey, Hephaistos.

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:03.467
- On the lower floors,
your children

00:03:03.568 --> 00:03:05.437
ran into some real trouble.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:06.573
But if I heard right,

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:09.345
now they're safe back
on the 18th.

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.584
- That's exactly what
I'm hearing too.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:13.520
And everybody made
it back alive.

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.794
- Great, I'm sure it was a
productive experience for them.

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.667
- I'm looking forward to all
the stories they'll bring back.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.335
- (chuckles) Which is
all the more reason

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.373
we have to have this
meeting today.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.747
- And the naming ceremony
for the adventurers.

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.684
- I gotta work this
so both Bell and Welf

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:31.322
can somehow walk away
with decent nicknames.

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:34.562
- Same for Chigusa,
my other children.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:36.332
Gotta make sure they
don't end up with one like

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:38.237
Mikoto's Absolute Shadow.

00:03:38.337 --> 00:03:41.442
- Behold, I am Ganesha

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.113
and I have been
assigned the role

00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.317
of mediator for this Denatus.

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:48.022
Who's ready for Ganesha?

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:49.793
(crowd murmurs)

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:54.235
Now, the alias for Welf Crozzo
from the Hestia Familia.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.606
Written as Durae
but read as Ignis,

00:03:56.706 --> 00:04:00.582
Ganesha herby grants the
name Ignis Never Cold.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:02.151
(gong bangs)

00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.255
(Hestia sighs)

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:07.094
Now, last up, it's time
to discuss the new alias

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:09.264
for the ever popular
Bell Cranel.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:10.601
(crowd cheering)

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:12.338
- [Crowd Member] But we
just gave him an alias

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:14.509
not too long ago.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.647
- [Crowd Member] It's
incredibly fast, unbelievable.

00:04:16.747 --> 00:04:20.119
- [Freya] Might I offer a
suggestion?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.890
- [Crowd Member] Oh,
from Lady Freya?

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.295
- [Crowd Member] Little rookie
must have caught her eye.

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:25.832
- [Crowd Member] Seriously,
are you part

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:27.134
of Bell's fan club now?

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.369
- Indeed.

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.140
It was after I saw him battle

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.710
that monster the other day.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.417
I must admit he really
got my heart pounding.

00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:37.120
- Well Freya,
that's nice and all,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.391
but this is my Bell
we're talking about,

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:41.462
so you better come up with
a darn good name for him.

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:43.432
Something regal and courageous.

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:46.372
- Of course, have no
worries, Hestia.

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:48.042
(Hestia cackles)

00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:55.256
So hear me out, I suggest
we call him Vanadis Odr.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:56.727
'tis a fitting name.

00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:58.931
(gong bangs)

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:00.200
- Oh hell no.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.503
You don't get to call
him husband!

00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:03.875
Bell is my Familia,
mine you floozy!

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:05.545
- Don't like my idea?

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:07.615
- [Hestia] There's nothing
to like about it, tramp!

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:09.285
- That's what happens
when you've got nothing

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:11.221
but booty on the brain.

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:13.795
I've actually got
my own idea, guys.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:15.264
How's about Loizarus?

00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:17.401
(gong bangs)

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:19.573
- Where do you get off
calling Bell your boy toy?

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:21.308
Start taking this seriously.

00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:22.444
- Up here.

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.182
I've got a really
good one, guys.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.119
How's Chestnut Cream?

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.287
(gong bangs)

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:28.624
- [Crowd Member] Are
you kidding me?

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.093
That doesn't even make sense.

00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:33.734
- [Crowd Member] Marry me,
Bell, I hear Wedding Bells!

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:37.107
- [Ganesha] Hot damn,
that's a good one.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.779
- [Crowd Member] I think Lady
Freya's getting ticked off.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.885
- What do you think of
this one, Mimirin!

00:05:44.154 --> 00:05:45.792
- You're just being silly.

00:05:45.892 --> 00:05:47.596
- [Crowd Member] Anybody
else have an idea?

00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:48.931
- Yeah, just leave it to me.

00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.935
You remember the rumors
from a while ago about

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.406
that kid who has the hots
for the monsters, right?

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:56.246
- Oh yeah. I did hear
something about that guy.

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:57.481
- So if you think about it.

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.318
- Oh, I get ya.
Bell is a fella

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:01.723
who gets turned on
by humans, monsters

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:02.792
and even Gods.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:05.764
- [Both] I know, Okay With All!

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.704
(crowd jeering)

00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:12.578
(Hestia screaming)

00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:14.047
- Stop it right now!

00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:15.483
Quit acting like my Bell is just

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:17.087
a plaything for your amusement!

00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:18.523
- Calm down, Hestia.

00:06:18.623 --> 00:06:19.726
- [Hestia] I'll calm down after

00:06:19.826 --> 00:06:21.630
they shut their freaking faces!

00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.410
Man, everyone made
fun of us today.

00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:30.080
- You gonna be okay Hestia?

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.550
- No surprise, since
your Familia

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.752
is rising up in the world.

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:34.856
Just part of the rite of
passage.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:37.160
- Come on. All's
well that ends well.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.396
You stood firm and managed

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:40.467
to make sure his
name's rather innocuous.

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.404
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.644
Rabbit's Foot.

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:47.849
(gong bangs)

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.354
That's going to be your
new second name, Bell.

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:51.656
Hope you like it.

00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:54.829
- [Bell] How is everyone doing?

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.533
- [Luvis] Getting
better every day.

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:58.971
The healer says that everyone
is making good progress

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:01.309
on their way to recovery.
- Same over here.

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.580
We're all doing well
with no problems.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.584
We really owe you big time

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.557
- You guys, I'm sorry.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.394
- We couldn't fully heal you.

00:07:10.494 --> 00:07:11.395
- It's fine.

00:07:11.495 --> 00:07:13.199
I consider myself lucky.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.703
I truthfully shouldn't
even be alive

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.105
after all that happened.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:17.675
So don't let it bother you.

00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.746
In fact, we only have
ourselves to blame

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:21.983
for getting into that
mess in the first place.

00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:24.956
It's simply the nature of going
on adventures in the dungeon.

00:07:25.056 --> 00:07:27.427
There's always a price
that we must pay,

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:29.599
especially when
seeking the unknown.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.037
It's a reality we must accept.

00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:35.711
After we return to the surface,

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:37.782
we'll visit the
Dian Cecht Familia

00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:41.355
and have them outfit us with
some good prosthetic limbs.

00:07:41.455 --> 00:07:42.825
I can already imagine our patron

00:07:42.925 --> 00:07:44.796
God whining up a storm
when he finds out

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.133
that we'll also be
living in debt.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.874
You have my thanks, Bell Cranel.

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.581
On the honor of my name,
Luvis Lilix,

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.419
I swear to return the
favor to you someday.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.625
You are an ally to the
elves, so thank you.

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:01.128
- Thanks Luvis.

00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:04.268
- Does everything have to be
so dramatic with you Elves?

00:08:04.368 --> 00:08:06.539
But seriously, thanks
a million guys.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.309
If you ever find
yourself in trouble,

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:10.480
then we'll come help you out.

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:13.620
- Yeah, we really
appreciate that, Dormul.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.561
- Oh, one more thing for
the little Prum lady here.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.901
I gotta say, the speech
you gave to everyone

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:24.643
after we thought all hope
was lost, it really hit home.

00:08:24.743 --> 00:08:26.613
That lit a fire in us.

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.717
- You really mean that?

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:31.957
- Absolutely, you were a
true inspiration to us all.

00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:34.529
Truthfully speaking,
without true encouragement

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:36.901
I doubt we would've held
on as long as we did.

00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.640
- Yep, you make one
hell of a strategist.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.243
- Well, it was no big deal.

00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:56.038
So, by the way, Master Bell,

00:08:56.138 --> 00:08:58.744
are you all finished with
your business for the day?

00:08:58.844 --> 00:08:59.879
If you've got some free time,

00:08:59.979 --> 00:09:01.482
then maybe we can
have that chat?

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.585
- [Bell] Oh, not yet.

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:03.920
Sorry Lili.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.325
I need to go see Ouka
and Chigusa real quick.

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:08.530
They also wanted
to speak with me.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.503
I can talk to you right
after that if that's okay.

00:09:11.603 --> 00:09:13.072
- That sounds good.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.947
- I really screwed
things up back there.

00:09:17.047 --> 00:09:19.085
I allowed Chigusa to get hurt

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:22.157
and failed my responsibility
as a vanguard.

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:23.492
I apologize.

00:09:23.593 --> 00:09:25.931
- Ouka, no, please don't
take on all the blame.

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.071
I mean, I was the one who
dragged the party down in the
end.

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:30.339
- But still

00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:32.377
- Come on, please stop, you two.

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.215
You were already doing
us a huge favor

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:36.285
by agreeing to come with us.

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:39.324
- Is that what they wanted
to talk to him about?

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:42.732
Master Ouka and Lady Chigusa
are some good people.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.002
- [Ouka] Even so, I keep
thinking about it.

00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:47.642
If I had just kept her
safe during the attack,

00:09:47.742 --> 00:09:50.781
then we wouldn't have been
in such a bad situation.

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:52.150
- [Chigusa] Ouka.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.285
- We're all allies.

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.189
No matter what Familia we're in.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.870
We cooperate to cover
for whatever is missing,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.842
and we prop each other up
when mistakes are made.

00:10:04.942 --> 00:10:06.846
That's how a party works.

00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:09.786
It's why we survived
that adventure.

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:12.692
In the end, I think that's
all that really matters.

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:15.396
- Impressive. Master Bell's
really come into his own.

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:18.369
I'm gonna make sure he listens
to everything I have to say.

00:10:18.469 --> 00:10:20.073
- [Daphne] Look, there he is.

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:21.075
- [Bell] Hey Daphne.

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:22.477
Hey Cassandra.

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.248
- We're having some
trouble, Bell.

00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:25.685
Help us out!

00:10:25.785 --> 00:10:27.321
Can we borrow him for a sec?

00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.924
- Oh, pretty, pretty please.

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:31.630
- Well, I think we've said
everything that needs to be
said.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.098
- Great, let's go.

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:37.140
(Bell screams)

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:39.745
- They just hauled him away.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.754
- [Worker 1] Ryu still
hasn't come back, huh?

00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:45.424
- [Worker 2 Yeah, this is the
third Day

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:46.660
since she went meout.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.862
- I know she makes it a habit

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:49.733
of disappearing
from time to time,

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.936
but I don't think she's
ever left a note before.

00:10:52.036 --> 00:10:54.207
- She's been on pins
and needles lately,

00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:56.278
and I kind of think she
was remembering stuff

00:10:56.379 --> 00:10:58.082
about her past.

00:10:58.182 --> 00:10:59.986
- It gives me a sinking feline.

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:01.956
I know nothing bad
has happened yet

00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:04.563
but we might be about
to have some purroblems.

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:05.864
- Shh.

00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:10.574
(door slams)

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:11.910
- Quit slacking, you
bunch of dum-dums.

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.314
Wake up and get ready for
tonight's rush.

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:20.561
- Mama Mia, do you know
what's been going on?

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:22.363
- If she didn't tell you
anything,

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:24.367
she sure as hell didn't tell me.

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:30.146
Good grief, never should
have hired that elf.

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:38.564
- Oh, come on.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.401
Bringing Bell Cranel with
you isn't fair.

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:42.839
- What, it's totally fair.

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:44.374
We're in the same party.

00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:46.612
Right?
- That's right.

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:49.050
I had them join me
on an expedition.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.223
- (grunts) All right
then, can't deny I owe you

00:11:52.323 --> 00:11:54.996
from back when that Black
Goliath went on a rampage.

00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:57.635
I'll give you a discount,
but it's a one-time deal.

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:58.738
- Thank you.

00:11:58.838 --> 00:11:59.939
- You're a lifesaver.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.309
Thanks a bunch Bell.

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:03.647
We needed to stock up on
items for the trip back,

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:05.651
but he was charging us an arm
and a leg.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:07.186
- [Bell] Oh yeah?

00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:09.992
- They're using Master Bell
like a stinking coupon.

00:12:10.092 --> 00:12:11.495
Man, that rubs me the wrong way.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:14.067
They just took the deal
that we should have gotten.

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.537
- I know you're
level four and all,

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:18.142
so this may seem like I'm
just stating the obvious,

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:21.917
but I was honestly surprised
by how tough you've become.

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:23.352
Once you got back to us,

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:26.225
I didn't expect you to
defeat that monster yourself.

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:28.262
You made beating
the crap out of it

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:29.766
look so easy.

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:31.970
It's like we had
nothing to worry about.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.474
Seriously, I'm impressed.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.314
- I also wanted
to say thank you,

00:12:37.414 --> 00:12:40.220
you know, for proving
my clairvoyance wrong.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.792
- Clairvoyance?
(Daphne laughs)

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:45.063
- Sorry, you'll have
to forgive Cassandra

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:46.799
for all the crazy talk.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:49.338
Just know that we are
really grateful to you.

00:12:49.438 --> 00:12:50.473
- Here you go.

00:12:50.574 --> 00:12:52.511
This might put me out of
business.

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:57.287
- I wanted to ask you, Daphne,

00:12:57.387 --> 00:13:00.962
how'd Lili fare as a
strategist, anyway?

00:13:01.062 --> 00:13:03.633
- From what I saw, she
has a talent for it.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:07.373
She showed solid and fair
judgment and made quick
decisions.

00:13:07.473 --> 00:13:10.413
And most importantly, she was
striving to fill the role.

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:11.983
- Oh gosh, really?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.121
All I did was frantically try
to keep everybody from dying!

00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:15.891
- Oh hey, it's Master Bell.

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.360
Hey there you guys.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.099
Lady Haruhime and I were
just about to have some tea.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.803
Would you three care to join us?

00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:24.041
- Nah, I think we're good,
Mikato.

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:26.145
Thanks for your help, Bell
Cranel.

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:27.080
Appreciate it.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.150
- We'll hand him over
to you now.

00:13:30.922 --> 00:13:32.156
(cheerful music)

00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:34.227
- Hand him over to you my butt.

00:13:34.327 --> 00:13:35.898
I'm the one who keeps
giving up the time

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:37.735
with Master Bell for
all this crap.

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:39.137
- She got to use her new magic.

00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:42.711
Bell, it was absolutely
incredible.

00:13:42.811 --> 00:13:44.682
- Call forth Tamamo!

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:47.387
The yellow hair King
of Nine Tails!

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:50.661
Oh mystic beast,
may you consume all

00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:52.865
and grant every wish.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.169
Dance and whirl.

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.476
- Lady Haruhime
looked truly majestic

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:00.413
as she cast level boost on us.

00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:02.384
I really wish you could
have seen it yourself,

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:03.754
Master Bell.

00:14:03.854 --> 00:14:05.958
- I don't deserve
so much praise.

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:07.929
- Come on, you gotta
make sure he's aware

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:09.231
of this kind of stuff,

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:10.968
because that's the key
to getting Master Bell

00:14:11.068 --> 00:14:12.838
to fall in love with you.

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:14.675
- [Haruhime] Fall
in love? Oh my!

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.246
- So me getting separated
from the party

00:14:17.346 --> 00:14:19.451
put a lot of stress on you, huh?

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:23.192
Hestia told me about
the Kokonoe spell.

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:26.065
She said it uses a great
deal of magic power,

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.300
and she told me that using it

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.937
would take a major toll on you.

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:31.777
- I appreciate your concern
Master Bell,

00:14:31.877 --> 00:14:33.814
but really, I'm fine.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.218
Just take a look at how
much energy I have now.

00:14:36.318 --> 00:14:38.389
- Oh hey, Master Bell,
if you don't mind,

00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:40.059
I'd love to hear what
happened to you

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:42.163
after you got separated
from the rest of us.

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:45.169
- Oh, please, I'd also
like to hear the story

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:47.541
- Man, that's exactly what

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.477
I was planning to ask him later.

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.150
- And after that I had to fight

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.989
against a really fast
monster called Iguazu.

00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:57.126
Then I met Marie.

00:14:58.029 --> 00:14:59.566
I mean, I rushed all
the way back

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.504
so I could rejoin you
guys as soon as possible.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.576
- You survived dropping

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:05.845
all the way down
the Great Falls.

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:07.147
Incredible.

00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:09.484
- Oh, and tell us about
fighting the Iguazu.

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:12.892
I've heard they're one of the
fastest things in the dungeon.

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:16.331
- Yep, even faster than
the Moss Huge.

00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:19.806
- Oh, it's just like you're
a hero from fairy tales,

00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:21.409
Master Bell.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.446
- (groans) This sucks!

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:25.049
I was going to ask Master
Bell about that first,

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:28.456
and then I could have
been the one praising him!

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:29.926
- Anyway, that was fun.

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:30.761
See ya!

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.998
- Goodbye for now.

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:35.436
- Good, looks like it's
finally my turn.

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:36.740
But I have to be quick.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.042
Don't wanna miss my chance.

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.781
- [Bors] Yo, Bell,
you're just in time, baby!

00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.718
- Not these meatheads!

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:43.687
(all laughing)

00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:45.089
- What are you guys up to?

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:46.793
- These guys won't
stop asking me

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:48.630
about all the crazy stuff
that happened

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:49.766
on the lower floors.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.570
Join us for story time.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.838
- Like right now?

00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:54.843
- Oh, what kind of
question is that, huh?

00:15:54.943 --> 00:15:56.345
The night's just
getting started.

00:15:56.445 --> 00:15:58.884
Come on, you need to
live it up, Bell.

00:15:58.984 --> 00:16:00.186
- [Bell] But, hold on.

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:01.421
I actually have plans tonight.

00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:03.125
- [Crowd] It's okay Bell,
they can wait.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:05.329
Quit your whining and get
moving.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.235
(Lili sighs)

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:09.772
- Geez, the nerves
of some people.

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:13.045
- Step right up, get the latest
straight from the surface.

00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:15.150
It's sure to shock and amaze!

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.420
How about it?
Come find the latest, folks.

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:19.592
It won't be cheap, but I
can tell you the new name

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:22.698
that the Gods gave
the famous Bell Cranel.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.334
- Master Bell?

00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:26.939
(upbeat music)

00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.810
- Oh boy, you really
are something else.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.814
Not only did you fight
that big bastard

00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:32.084
on your first expedition,

00:16:32.184 --> 00:16:34.722
but your entire party made it
back alive.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:35.724
- That's true.

00:16:35.824 --> 00:16:37.060
But it was a group effort.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.799
- Come on kid, you don't
gotta be so modest.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:40.767
(crowd laughs)

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.971
- Gross, uncultured swine.

00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:45.544
Dunno how people put up with
adventurers.

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:47.213
But it doesn't matter.

00:16:47.313 --> 00:16:49.819
Then nobody will be left to
bother us.

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:52.023
I can have a nice chat with
Master Bell,

00:16:52.123 --> 00:16:53.660
and then I'll get to
also share the news

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.196
about his brand new alias.

00:16:55.296 --> 00:16:57.200
- A'ight, I think
it's about time

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.139
I shared a big old juicy
piece of news with ya.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:01.709
- Juicy news?

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.615
- This tidbit just came in
from the surface earlier today.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:08.990
The Gods have decided on a new
second name for the Little
Rookie.

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:09.993
(crowd cheering)

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:12.264
- No, that's my juicy news!

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.432
- Now listen up, my friends,

00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:15.002
from this point on the
little rookie

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.240
will be known as Rabbit's Foot.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.810
Raise your mugs, boys!

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.549
This calls for a
celebratory drink.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.719
(crowd cheering)

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.056
- Rabbit's Foot, huh?

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:27.762
Well, I guess it's
better than tomato head.

00:17:27.862 --> 00:17:30.868
- Why do you adventurers
have to ruin everything?

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:31.936
I was the one who should have

00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:34.040
broken that news to him!

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.982
And I paid a bunch of
money to learn about it!

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:39.317
(Lili groans)

00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:39.986
Dang it.

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:41.021
I have had it.

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.694
So many stupid, stupid heads.

00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:45.063
- [woman] Oh goodness.

00:17:45.163 --> 00:17:47.267
I'm feeling so hot and
bothered right now.

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:48.870
I can't stand it.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.640
Hey, Rabbit Food!

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:53.312
- I think it's Rabbit's Foot.

00:17:53.412 --> 00:17:55.149
- (laughs) Oh, whatever.

00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:58.322
You're gonna return all the
favors I've done for you.

00:17:58.422 --> 00:17:59.491
Tonight, Rabbit Hood.

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:01.529
- [Bell] Like I
keep telling you,

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:02.564
it's Rabbit's Foot!

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:04.401
- [woman] Rabbit Whatever!
(smoke busts)

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:05.971
(crowd coughing)
(indistinct chatters)

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:07.841
- [Crowd Member] What the hell?

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.580
- [Crowd Member] Run from it!

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:15.256
(Lili and Bell panting)

00:18:15.356 --> 00:18:17.426
- Thanks for the save, Lili.

00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:18.362
I'm sorry.

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:20.801
I didn't mean to
keep you waiting.

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:24.207
So what is it that you
wanted to talk about anyway?

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.580
- It's fine, I don't
need to bother you.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.480
- Huh?

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:28.817
- You've already
heard the things

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:30.386
I wanted to ask
and talk about.

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:33.727
Seems like everyone else
beat me to the punch, though.

00:18:33.827 --> 00:18:36.398
Like what happened to you
after we got separated,

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:38.703
and about my job
as a strategist,

00:18:38.803 --> 00:18:41.609
and even the news about
your nickname, too.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.648
But it ended up a good thing.

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:45.817
You know why?

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:46.886
I could tell you're still

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:47.888
the same old Bell.

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.592
- What do you mean by that?

00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:52.364
- To be honest, I've had
my concerns about you

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.869
ever since the incident
with the Xenos happened.

00:18:54.969 --> 00:18:56.304
Oh, I don't know.

00:18:56.404 --> 00:18:58.042
Not sure how to put this,

00:18:58.142 --> 00:18:59.411
it seemed like you
were running off

00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:02.216
into a different world
from the rest of us.

00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:04.420
I couldn't shake that feeling,

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:08.697
but now I know that's wrong.
I just know this.

00:19:08.797 --> 00:19:11.234
It may be true that you've
gotten a whole lot stronger

00:19:11.334 --> 00:19:13.506
than you used to be in the past,

00:19:13.606 --> 00:19:15.878
but you're still the
same Master Bell I know.

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:19.685
A brave man with a kind heart
who never ever gives up.

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:21.789
- [Bell] Lili!

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.901
(soft music)

00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:30.373
- You are still the same
Master Bell

00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:32.712
who called my name and
saved me many times.

00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:36.084
You haven't changed one
bit since we first met.

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:37.587
- Lili.

00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:40.760
Listen, sorry if I worried you.

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:44.868
(peaceful music)

00:19:45.937 --> 00:19:49.678
- (giggles) Actually,
maybe you have changed

00:19:49.778 --> 00:19:50.747
in some ways.

00:19:50.847 --> 00:19:53.620
Like turning into more of a
womanizer.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.926
(Bell exclaims)
(Lili laughing)

00:19:57.026 --> 00:19:58.262
- Oh, by the way,

00:19:58.362 --> 00:19:59.665
I heard from everyone
in the party

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.702
a lot about what happened
the other day.

00:20:01.802 --> 00:20:04.407
What is it you said to them
after we got separated?

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:06.579
You really instilled
hope in the whole team.

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:07.581
- Huh?

00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.352
I'm not leaving any of
you here to die.

00:20:10.452 --> 00:20:13.159
I refuse to give up
and run away.

00:20:13.259 --> 00:20:14.562
You hear me?

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:18.468
That's my duty because
I am his supporter!

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:20.974
That's a secret, Master Bell.

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:21.842
- What?

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:23.345
You can tell me.

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:25.683
- Nuh-uh, it's top secret.

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.656
Hey, Master Bell.

00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:33.332
Congrats on your name,
Mr. Rabbit's Foot.

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:36.004
I think it really suits you
perfectly.

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:39.377
- Well thank you, Lili.

00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:50.868
(knife slashing)
(person screams)

00:20:50.968 --> 00:20:53.105
- No, don't!

00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:55.042
Please, you gotta spare me!

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.080
I'm begging you!

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.616
I don't know anything!

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.419
Don't do it!

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:02.724
Please, no!

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:11.575
- Wow, we kept chatting
for so long

00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:13.212
that the sun came up, huh?

00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:14.114
- Yeah.

00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:15.984
It's been a nice time.

00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:17.053
(runners panting)

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.656
- What's going on?

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:20.125
- I'm not sure.

00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:22.531
- Really? And you're
not bullshitting me?

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:25.069
- You know I would never
lie about this.

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:26.137
- Hey Bors.

00:21:26.237 --> 00:21:28.008
- Oh, little rookie.

00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:30.212
Nevermind, I mean Rabbit's Foot.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.082
- Is there something going on?

00:21:32.183 --> 00:21:33.418
- It's a murder.

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:36.893
A man has been killed on
the outskirts of town.

00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:39.230
- And you're sure it wasn't
a monster that did it?

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:42.002
- Hell no, I saw the
culprit myself.

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.073
The Gale Wind.

00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:48.416
The blacklisted
adventurer did this.

00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:50.553
The Gale Wind murdered him.

00:21:53.694 --> 00:21:55.964
- Come on, there's
no time to waste.

00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:57.467
Let's go, Rabbit's Foot.

00:21:57.568 --> 00:21:58.636
You should come with us.

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:00.139
We have to see what's going on.

00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:05.215
- Oh no. Master Bell, are they
talking about who I think?

00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:07.152
- No way.

00:22:07.252 --> 00:22:09.457
Impossible, that can't be true.

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:13.098
Ryu would never murder someone.

00:22:15.904 --> 00:22:18.843
(Ending Song)
