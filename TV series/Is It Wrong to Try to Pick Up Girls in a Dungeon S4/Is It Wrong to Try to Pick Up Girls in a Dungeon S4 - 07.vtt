00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:07.114
- [Cassandra] A great
disaster cometh.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:11.189
Do not approach it for it
is the embodiment of ruin.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.397
Do not touch it for it
is the oracle of death.

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:19.305
A mother's lament shall
invoke calamity

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:23.548
as the newborn's wails of
despair resound.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:27.121
The fairy who is sworn
to be an usher of doom

00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:31.563
shall drag the surging white
flames into severe plight.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.709
Take heed, it is a
banquet of tragedy.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.815
(Cassandra gasps)

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:45.525
- What was that?

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.061
What did I just see?

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.731
What was that?

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.169
A premonition?

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.108
- Hurry, Cassandra,
you gotta get up.

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:57.649
- What, what's the
matter, Daphne?

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:58.884
- This is urgent.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:00.922
An adventurer was
murdered outside town.

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:01.958
- What?

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:03.861
Someone was murdered.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:08.771
(Opening Song)

00:02:39.853 --> 00:02:43.093
(gentle music)

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:44.663
- Out of the way.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:45.765
Move.

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:51.075
They really did a number on him.

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:53.279
I just talked to Jean
the other day.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:01.062
And look at that, this
had to be murder.

00:03:01.162 --> 00:03:03.033
Monsters don't leave
wounds like this.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.936
- You know, I actually saw
someone wrapped

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.272
in a cloak fleeing the scene.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:09.378
- Yeah, they were headed
for the lower floors.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.383
- Like I said, the
Gale Wind did it.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.621
Trust me, I know what
that elf looks like.

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.025
I remember her from
the Astrea Familia.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.060
She's the one who did it.

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.429
She killed Jean.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.101
- Did you say Gale Wind,
the former adventurer?

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.741
- Yes, it would seem
that's the case.

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:26.412
- Very well, how should
we go about this?

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.252
- Oh, come on. You already
know what we have to do, Bors.

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:31.256
We gotta make her pay.
- Oh yeah.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.059
- We hunt down the
Gale Wind and kill her.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.065
We cannot let her get away
with butchering one of our own.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:37.502
- Just hold your horses.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:39.438
I've never seen the
Gale Wind up close

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.677
and I don't wanna mess
with a level four.

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:43.346
You see, I kind of have
this little thing

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:44.717
about staying alive.

00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:47.187
- The Gale Wind already
has a pretty big bounty

00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:48.323
on her head, right?

00:03:48.423 --> 00:03:49.526
- Yeah, I think it was

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:51.663
around 80 million valis.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.400
- Everyone gather,

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.070
we'll hunt the perp ourselves.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.540
We'll avenge our dead comrade.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.944
We must form an execution squad.

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:00.815
(crowd cheers)

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:02.652
- It's so obvious they're
more interested in the money.

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:05.257
- It's a town full of
adventurers after all.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:06.894
- Doesn't matter if
she's strong,

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:08.429
altogether we outnumber her.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.133
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.670
- Please just wait a minute.
- Huh?

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.074
- We can't be certain
the Gale Wind is guilty.

00:04:14.174 --> 00:04:15.545
Be thoughtful about this.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.849
- [Bors] So what are you
trying to say, rabbit's foot?

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.251
Did you see something?

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.356
- No, I, that's not what I mean.

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:22.892
- Oh, I see how it is.

00:04:22.992 --> 00:04:25.698
Are you calling me a
liar, little bunny rabbit?

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:26.399
- Wait, what?

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.169
No, I didn't say that.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.273
But are you sure you
saw the Gale Wind?

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.011
- I'm beyond positive
it was her.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:33.179
You keep fighting me on this

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.916
and I promise you
you'll regret it.

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.386
- Look calm down, okay?

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:37.789
Now just hear me out.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.160
Everyone remembers
the Black Goliath attack.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.530
We were all there.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.968
- Obviously, I helped
fight the damn thing off.

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:45.203
So what of it, huh?

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:46.272
- While the Gale Wind was-

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.942
- That'll be quite enough.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:50.080
- Miss Aisha.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.415
- Good grief.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.754
You sound like a bunch
of children.

00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:57.328
You morons won't find
anything like this.

00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:58.598
- Oh, okay.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.233
Now, let's get a head count.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.039
Which of you bums wants
to get in on the hunt?

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.045
(crowd cheers)

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:07.549
- They really need to know that

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:09.418
Ryu was a big part
of that battle.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.523
It should be enough to
get them to reconsider.

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:13.360
- Oh, don't be an idiot, Bell.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.030
All that will do is
end up making you

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.098
look like an accomplice.

00:05:16.198 --> 00:05:17.367
- But even so.

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:18.871
- Lady Aisha has a point.

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.375
Let's discuss this somewhere
else for now.

00:05:21.475 --> 00:05:24.448
- That dream I had earlier,
is it somehow related

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:25.751
to the murder?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.392
- So that elf murdered somebody?

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:32.397
- Based on my personal
experience with Lady Ryu,

00:05:32.497 --> 00:05:34.636
I'm finding this rather
difficult to believe.

00:05:34.737 --> 00:05:36.673
- I understand,
but we heard stories

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:39.144
of what happened after
her familia was killed.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:40.948
She apparently went
around murdering

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:42.886
the people responsible for it.

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:45.691
Ultimately it got her
blacklisted, remember.

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:46.493
- Ouka.

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:47.963
- Don't get the wrong idea.

00:05:48.063 --> 00:05:50.200
I'm also holding out hope
that this is all just

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.737
some kind of misunderstanding.

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:54.175
- The circumstantial
evidence gathered does point

00:05:54.275 --> 00:05:55.511
to the Gale Wind.

00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:58.149
However, there are a few
things that I noticed.

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.523
Daphne and I we took some
time to examine the body.

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:02.526
- Okay, wait a sec.

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:03.928
You two did what now?

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:06.967
- I really didn't wanna
get near it, to be honest.

00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:10.006
The victim has numerous cuts
around his arms and legs.

00:06:10.106 --> 00:06:13.145
In my opinion, it's very likely
they're from the Gale Wind.

00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:14.816
- She made sure he
couldn't run away.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:18.323
The tendons were severed
in just the right places.

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:19.993
Must have been
interrogating him.

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:23.667
- Yeah, it's his fatal
wounds that I found strange.

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:25.638
They were inconsistent
with all of the others.

00:06:25.738 --> 00:06:29.111
Stabbing him that many times
was definitely overkill.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:30.480
Somebody else may have done it

00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:32.652
and they could be
setting her up.

00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:34.756
What's that look, Cassandra?

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:35.424
- Huh?

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:36.660
Oh, nothing.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.431
You just sound like a detective.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.435
It's pretty cool.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:44.141
- Just shut up.

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.716
- To be blunt, I'm honestly
convinced that Turk guy

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:50.721
is lying about what he saw.

00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:53.560
Back when we all fought
against the Black Goliath,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.165
Ryu really stood out
on the battlefield.

00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:59.972
If he's genuinely familiar
with what she looks like,

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:02.579
it doesn't make sense. He
wouldn't have noticed her then.

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.214
- That's a good point.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:05.584
It seems fishy.

00:07:05.684 --> 00:07:06.887
- He was obviously trying

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:08.858
to stir everyone up
into a frenzy.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.195
The guy came off as a
bit aggressive to me.

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:14.736
- But more than anything,
I refuse to believe Ryu

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:16.239
would do something so awful.

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:18.777
That being said, it's possible
that she's been dragged

00:07:18.877 --> 00:07:22.384
into something and if
that's really the case,

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.123
I want to save her,
which is why I-

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:26.593
- I have a proposal.

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:28.229
What do you guys say
if we all agree

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.833
to join the hunt for her?

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:30.968
- Huh?

00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:33.339
- But, but why would we?

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:37.314
- Listen, if our goal is to
prove that Lady Ryu is innocent

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:38.817
then we need to keep
this in mind.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.022
We have to get in touch
with her, don't we?

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:43.459
Especially before the
others find her.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.696
- So let me guess then.

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.001
We intentionally agree
to hunt her down

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:50.173
but pull a fast one by
reaching her first.

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:51.109
- Yep.

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:51.977
What do you think?

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:53.012
Sound good?

00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:54.114
- I think we should do it.

00:07:54.214 --> 00:07:55.149
I'm in.

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:56.953
- I shall come along too.

00:07:57.053 --> 00:08:00.427
- Seems like a big pain in
the neck, but I guess I'm in.

00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:01.830
- Yes, same here.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.432
- So we're all in agreement.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:04.769
Let's start getting ready then.

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:08.142
- Oh, I've got a really
bad feeling about how

00:08:08.242 --> 00:08:09.946
this is going to play out.

00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:12.384
- Thank you everyone.

00:08:12.484 --> 00:08:14.121
Let's get out
there and find Ryu.

00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:15.524
- [Group] Let's go.

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:25.276
(gentle music)

00:08:26.445 --> 00:08:29.887
- Ryu, I guess you're
not coming back.

00:08:29.987 --> 00:08:32.692
You were once obsessed
with those evildoers

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.597
but I thought it had
subsided at this point.

00:08:42.344 --> 00:08:43.547
Ryu!

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:47.722
Your past, your connection
to the Astrea Familia

00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:50.627
shall burn in the
flames of vengeance.

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:53.199
Please don't go down
that path again.

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.303
Please.

00:08:57.007 --> 00:08:59.913
(Cassandra sobs)

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:02.752
- I can't get that
dream out of my head.

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:05.457
Unless something changes,
I'm terrified

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:07.695
that it's going to
become reality.

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:12.738
No, I need to calm down
and think rationally.

00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:14.876
Breathe, Cassandra.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.457
Okay, so the fairy who is
sworn to be an usher of doom?

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:24.027
Is it the Gale Wind?

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:25.865
Because if so...

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.571
- Master Welf, how is
everyone's equipment?

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:29.939
Are we all good to go?

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:30.708
- Yeah.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:32.512
Got some magic swords too.

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:33.747
Everything okay on your end?

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:36.018
- I'm ready as well
and lucky for us,

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:38.624
I was able to leave that
letter with some adventurers.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.293
They're about to head
to the surface.

00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:41.930
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.067
- Hey, Cassandra,
where's your stuff?

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:44.936
- Pardon?

00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:47.575
Could you call this thing off?

00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:50.981
- [Group] Huh?
- What?

00:09:51.081 --> 00:09:53.319
- Something awful's
going to happen if we go

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.693
so we should withdraw from the
hunt and stay here instead.

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:58.998
- Okay, but why exactly?

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.469
- Don't tell me this is
because of that dream nonsense

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.106
you're always going on about?

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:07.280
- Well, actually that's exactly
my reason, but this time I-

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.886
- How many times do I have
to tell you to cut it out?

00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.390
It's getting really old.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.629
- I knew they wouldn't
believe me.

00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:19.640
Nobody's ever believed
me, but maybe he will.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.710
Please, Bell, listen.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.146
Will you call it off?

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.247
- Huh?

00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:30.994
I really am sorry, Cassandra
but I must try to save Ryu.

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:34.502
- No, he won't do it either.

00:10:34.603 --> 00:10:36.305
I can't stop it.

00:10:36.405 --> 00:10:37.374
- Do you need help?

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:38.978
- Are you feeling okay?

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:42.317
- Sorry guys, I think it
might be best if she didn't go

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.423
and I hate to do this but I
probably should stay behind

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:46.258
with her, okay?

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:47.327
- No.
- Huh?

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:49.699
- Absolutely not.

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:53.305
That's unacceptable.
I can't.

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:56.078
Doing that would mean
abandoning these people

00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:59.084
to their fate and
I won't do that.

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:01.523
Sorry for trying to
change your minds.

00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:03.158
Everything's fine.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:04.394
I'll go as well.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.606
If I can change how
things were in my dream,

00:11:09.706 --> 00:11:12.778
we may be able to avoid
the worst outcome.

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.549
I have to

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:16.986
find a way to save everyone.

00:11:21.563 --> 00:11:22.799
- [Hestia] Man, this sucks.

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.902
I finally get a dang
day off from work

00:11:25.002 --> 00:11:27.908
but Bell's not even here
to hang with me.

00:11:28.008 --> 00:11:30.246
- The loneliness must
be getting to you.

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:31.549
- Totally.

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.018
What about your children, Miach?

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:35.423
It was Daphne and
Cassandra, right?

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:36.960
I'm sure they're on your mind.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.164
- Of course, I'm always
concerned for them

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:42.538
but I must admit I enjoy
my time alone with Naza.

00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:44.542
We've known each other
for a long time,

00:11:44.643 --> 00:11:46.846
so I feel most
comfortable with her.

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:47.982
Hmm.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.786
- I prepared some tea for you.

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:52.491
- Great, thank you, Naza.

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:55.798
- Look at you two, getting
all lovey dovey over there.

00:11:55.898 --> 00:12:00.975
Oh Bell, I hope you and the
gang are doing all right.

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:02.443
- Keep your eyes open.

00:12:02.544 --> 00:12:04.047
Don't overlook anything or

00:12:04.147 --> 00:12:06.051
anybody who seems suspicious.

00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:07.989
It's the animal's time to shine.

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:10.393
Put those sensitive
noses of yours to work.

00:12:10.493 --> 00:12:11.997
- [Group] Yes, sir.

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.268
- Rumor is the Gale Wind's
first class,

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.671
even among level fours.

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:18.209
Hear that rabbit's foot,
that means your our ace

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:19.444
in the hole.

00:12:19.545 --> 00:12:20.714
- Sure.

00:12:20.814 --> 00:12:23.119
- He's dumping the work
on other people.

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:24.822
- No kidding.

00:12:24.922 --> 00:12:26.893
- Actually works in our
favor, you know.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.997
Bell will be right in
the center of the hunt.

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:31.034
He'll get intel easier.

00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:33.272
- I have to figure it out soon.

00:12:33.372 --> 00:12:36.779
There must be a way to keep
everyone out of harm's way.

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.719
- Hey, while we're on
the topic of Cassandra,

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.656
I noticed something
pretty special about her

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:44.061
even when she was in the
Apollon Familia.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.332
- Indeed, she has foresight.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.739
The ability to see something
that even we God's cannot.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:50.941
Means she'll be burdened with

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:52.712
the great unknowns
of the lower world.

00:12:52.812 --> 00:12:54.882
- That's probably pretty
rough on her, isn't it?

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.620
I guess that sort
of explains why she's

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.988
a little gloomy all the time?

00:12:58.088 --> 00:13:00.460
- Well, it is true that
Cassandra always seems

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:01.763
to be troubled by something.

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.567
However, there are
times I've seen her

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:06.606
with a glowing smile like
whenever she's around Bell.

00:13:06.706 --> 00:13:08.710
- Are you serious? Don't
you dare tell me

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.580
she's another one
of those bimbo's

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.785
trying to lay claim to my Bell.

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:15.791
- I'm fairly certain
that's not the case here.

00:13:15.892 --> 00:13:17.027
(doorbell rings)

00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:17.928
- Hmm.

00:13:18.028 --> 00:13:19.264
- Who's here?

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.776
- An adventurer was
asked to deliver this

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.813
up from the 18th floor.

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:28.382
- It's a letter from

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:30.420
little Miss Supporter,
but that's weird.

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:32.625
I know it takes a hefty
sum to deliver stuff

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:33.994
like this from the dungeon.

00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:35.831
I can't imagine she'd
be willing to cough up

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:37.233
the money for it.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.410
That elf from the tavern
was accused of murder.

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:46.018
Whoa and they've formed
an execution squad.

00:13:46.118 --> 00:13:48.022
- What does this mean exactly?

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:50.460
- I'm just as clueless
as you are.

00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:52.798
But apparently Bell and his
party have joined the hunt

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.969
for her to try and
do something about it.

00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:58.209
And they sent this letter
to ask me for a favor.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:01.683
What could possibly be going
on in the dungeon right now?

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:05.423
- All the way down to the
21st floor and no sign of her.

00:14:05.524 --> 00:14:08.395
- Lets all agree to never
take on quests to find people

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:09.765
in the dungeon ever again.

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:12.204
Because it's definitely
a waste of resources.

00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:15.376
- A mother's lament shall
invoke calamity.

00:14:15.476 --> 00:14:18.750
I'm sure that mother must
be referring to the dungeon

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.486
but what's the calamity?

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:22.190
Wait, could it be...

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.429
Pardon me, Lili, do you
know when the floor boss

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.699
is due to spawn?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.904
- Are you talking about
Amphisbaena?

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:30.339
Who do you think I am, huh?

00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:33.012
I've already double checked
when it's due to appear.

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:36.151
The last time it was defeated
was exactly half a month ago.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.659
We've got two weeks before
the spawning interval is over.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.961
Who's your strategist?

00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:43.968
- Oh, that, that's great.

00:14:44.068 --> 00:14:45.236
- So Amphisbaena, huh?

00:14:45.336 --> 00:14:47.340
As in the Rex of the
lower floors

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.912
shows up on the 27th
as I recall.

00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:51.849
- Lady Aisha, have
you ever fought it

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:53.754
during your time in
the Ishtar Familia?

00:14:53.854 --> 00:14:57.561
- Naturally, after taking its
aquatic nature and the terrain

00:14:57.661 --> 00:15:00.366
into account, the guild
set it at level six.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:03.138
But based on its strength,
it's only level five.

00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:05.309
- Considering the number
of high ranking adventurers

00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:07.715
we have, it shouldn't
be a cause for concern,

00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:08.917
even if it does show up.

00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:10.119
- Like I said-

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:11.690
- If it's not the floor boss,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.927
then what could it be?

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:16.231
Mr. Bell?

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:19.572
- Hey, feel free to let me
know if there's anything

00:15:19.672 --> 00:15:22.010
on your mind, okay?

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.348
Now, we may come from
different familias

00:15:24.448 --> 00:15:27.989
but we're on the same team,
so I just want you to know

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:29.124
that I'm here to help.

00:15:29.224 --> 00:15:30.226
Now have a drink.

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:31.863
I just fetched some water.

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:34.033
It should be nice and
refreshing.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.506
- I really appreciate that.

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:39.778
So about-

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.081
- Bors, there's a herd of
mammoths.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:42.317
They're right behind me.

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:44.822
- A whole herd of
those hairy bastards?

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:46.458
Prepare for battle, everyone.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:48.697
It's go time, kid.

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:49.999
- Right.

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:56.846
- Surging white flames, that
part probably refers to Bell.

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:58.550
He'll eventually meet
with the Gale Wind

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.056
and then get dragged into
whatever she's involved in.

00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:06.700
Unlike the others, my dream
didn't indicate that he died

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.103
but what about
the severe plight?

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:12.043
Pardon me, Mr. Crozzo.

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:14.080
- It's just Welf.

00:16:14.783 --> 00:16:18.222
- Mr. Welf, excuse me.

00:16:18.322 --> 00:16:19.725
I have a favor to ask.

00:16:21.128 --> 00:16:23.967
(mammoth roars)

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.073
(Aisha shouts)

00:16:33.152 --> 00:16:36.091
(Bors groans)

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.606
- And you want me to
be the one to do it?

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.443
- Is that a problem?

00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:48.049
- It can be done, but
it wouldn't sit right

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:49.586
with me, honestly.

00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:52.625
I only wanna equip him
with my handy work.

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.427
It's a personal rule.

00:16:54.528 --> 00:16:57.000
- [Cassandra] I know you might
find this hard to believe

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.471
but I have heightened senses.

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:01.442
I can tell that Bell
will soon find himself

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:04.782
in great danger because
he always goes overboard

00:17:04.882 --> 00:17:06.586
for the sake of other people.

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:08.189
It's just in his nature.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:11.127
Understand, I want to
avoid that fate.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.802
- All right, I'll do it.

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.806
- You will, really?

00:17:16.906 --> 00:17:19.344
- Yeah, I've been
through this before

00:17:19.445 --> 00:17:22.350
but I'm done weighing my pride
against a friend's wellbeing

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.657
and like you said, Bell
is likely to go overboard.

00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:27.293
I agree with you on that.

00:17:27.393 --> 00:17:29.497
I mean, he's done it
plenty of times before.

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:32.537
That's the kind of
guy my partner is.

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:35.376
- Lil Bit, get my
tools out for me.

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:37.213
I'm gonna finish this
up before they take out

00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:38.650
all the monsters.

00:17:39.919 --> 00:17:42.658
(Bell shouts)

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.412
- It's almost been a
whole day at this point.

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:55.684
Our pace seems to be a
little slow to catch up.

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.723
- Maybe so but the 24th
floor is just up ahead.

00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:01.629
If Lady Ryu is somewhere in
this colossal tree labyrinth,

00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:03.933
we should find some
trace of her soon.

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.906
- No, the Gale Wind
isn't up here.

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:11.816
Assuming my dream is right, the
tragedy will befall us at...

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.555
(group gasps)

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:15.724
- What's happening?

00:18:16.392 --> 00:18:17.894
The ground is shaking.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.230
- The hell?

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.266
What's going on?

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:21.468
- It came from below.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.107
- Bors, you know
it's gotta be her.

00:18:29.552 --> 00:18:32.356
(water rushes)

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:44.280
- It's coming from
the 27th floor.

00:18:44.381 --> 00:18:46.820
All right, we're splitting up
the party and heading down.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.159
Anybody staying behind, keep
watch over the passageway.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.463
- [Group] Yeah.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:55.369
- My dream took place
on the 27th floor

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.406
at the base of the Great Falls.

00:18:57.507 --> 00:18:59.178
I cannot let them go down there.

00:18:59.278 --> 00:19:00.547
- Time to get serious.

00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:03.151
We need to find Lady Ryu
before anyone else can.

00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:05.323
- Right, we gotta be fast.

00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:07.326
We all agree to join the
party heading down to the 27.

00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:10.901
- Pardon me, is there really
a need for us to tag along?

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:11.869
- Huh?

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:13.105
- Well, if there are

00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:14.809
too many people in the party

00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:16.979
it would be hard to get
through the narrow tunnels

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:18.415
and stuff.

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:21.454
Oh no, this totally
isn't gonna work.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.695
- I agree with
Cassandra on this.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.801
We just don't have enough
experience

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.070
with these lower floors.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.909
It'll be hard enough
to simply keep up.

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.679
- I understand what
you're saying.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.349
The party that's
going down will need

00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:36.886
to be moving pretty fast.

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:38.723
We should probably split up.

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:43.667
Okay, it should be Master Bell
and Lady Aisha who go down

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:45.203
to the 27th floor.

00:19:45.303 --> 00:19:46.705
Everyone else will...

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.344
- Just a second.

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:52.416
I think Miss Aisha should
stay with everyone else.

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:54.789
- Care to explain.

00:19:54.889 --> 00:19:56.926
- Well, it's, hmm.

00:19:57.026 --> 00:19:58.997
It's for Haruhime's sake.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:02.003
Remember, the other day I
was the one who carried her

00:20:02.103 --> 00:20:04.106
all the way back to
the 18th floor

00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:06.579
and that was a real
struggle for me.

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:07.814
She's heavy.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.522
So just in case something
happens again,

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:14.360
I think it would be better
to have Miss Aisha around

00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:16.932
because Haruhime's
so hard to carry.

00:20:18.537 --> 00:20:22.110
Please forgive me, Haruhime.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.114
- Ah well I mean, she has
filled out a lot

00:20:24.214 --> 00:20:25.416
since we were in the Far East.

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:26.786
In a good way, of course.

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:28.222
- He's not wrong.

00:20:28.322 --> 00:20:29.725
- Can we stop now?

00:20:29.826 --> 00:20:31.261
- Sounds to me that
you need to put

00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:33.131
on some muscle then, girl.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.500
I'm not always gonna
be able to look

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:36.906
after her even if I stay.

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:39.678
- Oh, okay.

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:44.822
- Miss Aisha, I think
she has a good point.

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:47.594
Can you please stay
here on the 25th floor?

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:52.671
- It does make sense.

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:55.309
All right, I get where
you guys are coming from.

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:59.083
However, when you eventually
run into that elf,

00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:02.891
I have my doubts you'll be
able to handle her on your own.

00:21:04.193 --> 00:21:06.632
- I am putting my faith in Ryu.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:12.010
- Right, it's your funeral.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.680
(Cassandra sighs)

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.886
- Here Bell, I've got
something for you.

00:21:16.986 --> 00:21:19.357
- Mm, what's this?

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:22.531
- I cut off part a Lil
Bit's robe to make it.

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:24.500
It's a Goliath scarf.

00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:26.405
- Thanks, Welf,

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:28.943
but are you sure
I can have this?

00:21:29.044 --> 00:21:32.316
- Well, the truth is, I wish
you only used armor I've made

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.755
but Cassandra practically
begged me.

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:41.803
- Thanks, Cassandra.

00:21:41.903 --> 00:21:43.371
Really appreciate it.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.142
- Yeah, sure.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:47.046
Mr. Bell might
actually believe me

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:48.649
if I tell him about my dream.

00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:50.687
But even if that were the case,

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.390
I'm sure it wouldn't stop him.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.895
Mr. Bell, please come
back in one piece.

00:21:54.995 --> 00:21:57.433
Once everyone gets back
to the surface,

00:21:57.534 --> 00:22:00.774
I'd love to talk to you
about all sorts of things.

00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:03.245
- Anybody going down
to the 27th floor?

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:05.082
Get over here now.

00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:07.386
(crowd shouts)

00:22:07.486 --> 00:22:09.958
- All right, best of luck.

00:22:14.935 --> 00:22:17.707
(Ending Song)

00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.756
- [Daphne] Next time, Mirabilis.
