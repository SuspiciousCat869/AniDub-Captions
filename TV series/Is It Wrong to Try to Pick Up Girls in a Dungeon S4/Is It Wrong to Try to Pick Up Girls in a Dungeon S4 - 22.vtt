WEBVTT

00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.041
(dramatic music)

00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.353
(chimera growling)

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:18.671
- [Bell] Fire bolt!

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.542
(explosion crashing)

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.714
(chimera growling)

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.757
(dramatic music continues)

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.446
I'll kill you, I swear.

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:43.419
Then after, I'm going
home with Miss Ryu.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.057
(chimera roars)

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:46.827
Bring it on.

00:00:47.962 --> 00:00:51.435
(Opening Song)

00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:24.689
(water burbling)

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:34.408
(solemn music)

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:40.487
- [Ryu] Alise. It's finally
time to join my friends.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:44.529
They may not be happy
with me about this,

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.071
but in the end I know they'll
welcome me with open arms.

00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:51.577
My dreams are
finally coming true.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.883
I'm finally going to
atone for my sins.

00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:56.554
- No, not yet.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:57.789
- [Ryu] Uh?

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:59.391
- Don't come any closer, Lion.

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:02.231
Absolutely not. It's
out of the question.

00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:03.901
- Yes but, Alise.

00:03:05.203 --> 00:03:08.443
(chimera growling)

00:03:09.112 --> 00:03:10.447
- Don't you see?

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:14.255
If you join us now, you
know you're gonna regret it.

00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:17.094
- I can't do it anymore.

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.533
I'm at my wits' end, Alise.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:24.610
I can't fight anymore, or
undo what happened back then.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.045
I'm afraid.

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:28.283
Afraid of facing that creature.

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:30.487
Afraid of facing the past.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.493
Which is why I must stop.

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:35.598
- It's not true.
- Huh?

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:39.371
- Your justice is screaming.
You cannot lose that boy.

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.210
Your justice is alive and well!

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.317
Our Familia sought peace,
and sought harmony.

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.454
We wanted happiness.

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:50.628
I know you've never once
forgotten that.

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:51.530
(Ryu groans)

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.166
You always stuck to your beliefs

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.536
and did the right thing,

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:56.439
just like I knew you would,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.247
because that's your justice.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.518
Hope for a brighter future.

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.288
- Alise.

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:07.294
(air whooshes)

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:09.833
(solemn music)

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.039
- And Lion, you're going
to finish what we started.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.644
It's your job to make our
efforts count for something.

00:04:15.744 --> 00:04:18.383
- Just think about it, how
many people you've helped.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.155
- And the smiles you
put on their faces.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:22.491
- Thank you, guys.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.563
- Justice doesn't
have a right answer.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:27.168
- But you came up with
an answer of your own.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:29.105
- And that answer was hope.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:30.941
- Yet you managed to
convince yourself

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:32.812
that you'd given up on justice.

00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:34.749
- How very Lion of you.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:38.290
- Get outta here.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.060
You have a monster to slay.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.429
- [Lyla] Good luck, Lion.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.866
- Go kick its ass.
- Hang in there.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.669
- Show it who is boss.
- We'll be rooting for you.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.176
- Everyone, I've always
wanted to apologize.

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:51.215
I've waited years to
tell you how sorry I am.

00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:53.052
I've always wanted
you to resent me,

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:54.923
to hate me for
leaving you to die,

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:56.560
for being powerless to help.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.364
I wanted you to judge me.
To attack me!

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.435
To swear at me!

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:04.876
Oh, that's the problem.
I knew it.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:08.885
None of you guys
would ever blame me.

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.357
So I'm the only one who
couldn't forgive myself.

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:14.195
I only punished myself

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.967
because I thought it might ease
the pain.

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:22.078
- Lion, your justice, the
hope within your heart,

00:05:22.178 --> 00:05:23.580
what's it telling you?

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:28.389
- I want to rescue him.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.164
To go to the tavern, the two of
us.

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:34.267
And see Syr and the others
again.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.706
- That's right.
So meet it head-on.

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:38.911
Don't let it get away!

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:42.118
(Ryu sighs)

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:43.587
Now, take care, Lion.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.494
- I'll see you later,

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.966
my most precious
friends in the world.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.949
(Ryu sighing)

00:05:58.885 --> 00:05:59.786
Bell.

00:05:59.886 --> 00:06:04.630
(metal clanging)
(Bell yelling)

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.465
(Bell grunting)
(dramatic music)

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:09.539
(Ryu grunting)

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.161
(Bell groans)
(chimera screams)

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.904
(dramatic music continues)

00:06:36.092 --> 00:06:38.964
(Bell panting)

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:41.135
(Ryu yelling)

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.337
(chimera screams)

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:44.208
I can't be the elf from
fairytales,

00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:45.678
the one who lived in the lake.

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:48.750
I refuse to depend on a
knight in shining armor.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.188
Bell! It's just you and me

00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:52.959
till the bitter end.

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.664
- Thanks for the help.

00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:57.301
(dramatic music continues)

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:59.404
(both yelling)

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:01.442
(chimera growls)

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:03.547
- I'll destroy you!

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.622
(Ryu grunts)

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:11.162
(chimera screams)

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:12.599
(Bell grunts)

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.003
(chimera growling)

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.439
(Bell gasps)

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.575
(Bell grunts)

00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:18.911
- [Bell] It's slower than
before,

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.548
but I can still brute-force
my way through.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.620
- Now in the skies of the
distant forest,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.691
to the infinite
stars mounted upon

00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:28.229
the eternal firmament of night.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.966
This fool doth entreat just once

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.670
for the divine protection
of the stars' fire!

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.776
I once sentenced a friend
to death with this spell.

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:38.215
But this time is going
to be different.

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:39.653
I'm going to protect the people

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:41.289
who are precious to me!
My fellow drifter!

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.461
- Miss Ryu only has enough
Mind to use her magic once.

00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:47.467
So I've got to crack
that thing's shell first!

00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:48.737
Fire Bolt!

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.212
(Bell yelling)

00:07:53.312 --> 00:07:55.885
(chimera screaming)

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:56.887
(Bell groans)

00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:58.122
(Bell gasping)

00:07:58.223 --> 00:07:59.593
(dramatic music)

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.998
- Cross the skies, speed
through the wastelands!

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:05.504
- Argo vesta!

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.716
(explosion booming)

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.026
(chimer growling)

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.300
(Bell groans)

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.544
(chimera groans)
(Bell gasps)

00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:27.314
- [Ryu] If I had
done this back then

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:29.552
I never would have lost Alise.

00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:32.559
(Bell yelling)

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.963
- Now, fire bolt!

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:38.269
(explosion crashing)

00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:40.741
(chimera growling)

00:08:40.842 --> 00:08:43.379
- Race more swiftly
than any other!

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.421
Let the light of stardust
occupy me and strike my enemy!

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:49.257
Luminous wind, go!

00:08:50.327 --> 00:08:53.265
(dramatic music)

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:04.087
(chimera growling)

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:06.425
- Did it dodge the attack?

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:08.797
- I know about
that speed of yours.

00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:11.703
I know it better
than anyone else!

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:15.878
(dramatic music continues)

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.950
Volcan, Neese, Neun!

00:09:22.024 --> 00:09:23.159
Asta, Ryana!

00:09:25.196 --> 00:09:28.135
Please, guys, just
lend me your strength.

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:30.073
(chimera growls)

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:32.110
Celty, Isuka, Marrue!

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:37.086
(dramatic music continues)

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.727
(Bell gasps)

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:46.338
I know it is simply wishful
thinking.

00:09:46.438 --> 00:09:50.146
Nothing more than sentiment.
A convenient fantasy.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.983
But I don't care!

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.622
(chimera screams)

00:09:54.722 --> 00:09:55.924
Kaguya!

00:10:00.535 --> 00:10:03.574
(chimera growls)

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:04.876
Lyla!

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:11.656
(explosion booming)

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:15.831
Alise.

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:23.813
Goodbye.

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:27.589
(Ryu yells)

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:29.926
Luvia!

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:34.502
(chimera screaming)

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:37.975
(explosion booming)

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:41.783
(Bell panting)

00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:46.291
- Miss Ryu!

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:49.766
Miss Ryu? Please get up.

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:51.268
(Bell grunts)

00:10:51.368 --> 00:10:52.370
Come on.

00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:56.111
(Ryu groans)

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.317
I guess we won.

00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:02.625
- [Ryu] Yeah.

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:06.431
- Hey, now we can
go home, right?

00:11:08.303 --> 00:11:09.304
(Ryu sighs)

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:12.545
(Bell sighing)

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:17.922
- [Ryu] Bell. I just want to.

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.262
(Ryu sighs)

00:11:21.362 --> 00:11:24.100
(dungeon growling)

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:31.415
(footsteps thudding)

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:34.889
(Rido and Gross grunting)

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.828
- [Rido] Dammit! We've looked
all over the place for them!

00:11:37.928 --> 00:11:40.601
- [Gross] It's this floor.
It's enormous.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.574
- [Rido] C'mon, where'd
you go, Bellcchi?

00:11:43.674 --> 00:11:44.810
- [Wiene And Let] Rido!

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.080
- [Rido] Huh? What's wrong?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.084
- I heard voices.
Bell and his friend.

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:52.023
- You did?
- Hurry. This way!

00:11:52.726 --> 00:11:55.797
(Wiene panting)

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.678
- [Gross] Is this the place,
Wiene?

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.517
(Wiene gasps)

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.855
- It's Bell!

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.935
Hey, Bell, get up!

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:18.644
- [Rido] (grunts) Don't
worry, he's still breathing.

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:19.879
(Wiene sighs)

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:21.716
- [Gross] The elf's alive, too.

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:24.487
- [Rido] Let, notify
Lilicchi and the others ASAP.

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:25.791
- [Let] Got it!

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.898
- [Rido] Here, give
him one of these.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.567
I got 'em from Marie.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.070
- [Wiene] Hm.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.909
- [Rido] Gross, give
her the other one.

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:39.484
(suspenseful music)

00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:44.795
(Bell sighs)

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.273
- Wiene? Hey.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:51.442
- Bell!

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:54.414
(solemn music)

00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:58.857
- [Lili] Master Bell?
Master Bell!

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:01.028
- [Anya] Ryu! Where are you?

00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:02.564
- [Chloe] Meow if
you can hear us!

00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:04.401
- [Rido] It's time to go, Wiene.

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:06.706
We'd better let Fels know.

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:08.475
- [Wiene] Mm-hmm.

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:12.818
- [Gross] Quickly. The
surface-dwellers can
handle the rest.

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:14.187
(Wiene gasps)

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:16.726
- [Rido] You'll see
him again soon.

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:18.963
(Wiene sighs)

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:22.170
(dramatic music)

00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:30.320
(group gasps)

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.357
- [Lili] Master Bell!

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:37.233
(Lili gasping)

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.139
(solemn music)

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:12.003
- Ryu?
(Ryu moans)

00:14:12.103 --> 00:14:14.943
Thank the Gods. You're okay now.

00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:16.244
- Hey, Syr.

00:14:17.347 --> 00:14:19.919
- Look! She's up from her little
cat nap.

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:22.090
- We thought we had lost
you for a second there.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.796
- I didn't know it was pawssible
to sleep for three days,

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:26.966
gotta say I'm impressed.

00:14:27.735 --> 00:14:29.037
- Three days, huh?

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:31.208
- [Lunor] Carrying an
unconscious elf to the surface

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:33.980
from the 37th floor wasn't
frickin' easy, you know.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.083
- [Chloe] We brought you here,

00:14:35.183 --> 00:14:37.220
to the infirmary inside of
Babel.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.528
Um, but so, it looks like
you're feline better!

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:42.030
(Ryu gasps)

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.734
- Where is he? Where's Bell?

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.036
- Calm down, Ryu!

00:14:45.136 --> 00:14:47.006
There's no need to
worry about him.

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:48.309
- Yup, that's right.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.413
Mr. White Hair's
purrfectly fine.

00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:52.050
They've got him in
a room down the hall,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.056
so you can relax. (shrieks)

00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:57.561
- Wait a minute! You're
still in your gown!

00:14:57.661 --> 00:15:00.634
Ryu!
(nurse gasps)

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:01.903
- Huh?

00:15:02.872 --> 00:15:05.744
(Ryu panting)

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:06.847
- Bell.

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.650
Bell. Bell.

00:15:09.585 --> 00:15:10.587
Bell. Huh?

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:16.432
(sighs) You're here.

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:19.104
- M-Miss Ryu?
- Oh?

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:21.108
- Uh, hey, Miss Elf?

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:24.683
- Your, uh, outfit is, uh.

00:15:24.783 --> 00:15:25.984
- Huh?

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.735
(dramatic music)

00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:42.685
(Ryu shrieking)

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:44.789
(Ryu groans)

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:45.891
(group groans)

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.059
- Oh no.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.231
- You know his injuries are
severe!

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:52.671
Who the hell slaps a patient
while he's in the hospital?

00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:54.174
- [Hestia And Lili] Sorry.

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:57.982
(birds chirping)

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.419
- [Hestia] Approximately four
days total.

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:03.894
That's how long you and Miss
Elf spent in the Deep Floors.

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:05.630
I heard it from Ouranos.

00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:08.503
- Four days.

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:12.110
- Yeah. With so
few party members,

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.249
the odds were stacked against
them in the Floor Boss fight,

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.454
but they did an incredible job.

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:18.289
You all did.

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:20.561
- I owe it all to Miss Ryu.

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:22.965
Honestly, her knowledge
of how to survive

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.236
in the Deep Floors
came in handy.

00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:27.006
In fact, if she hadn't

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:29.244
been there, well, I.

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:31.683
There's a good chance I
wouldn't have made it home.

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:33.352
- I don't doubt it.

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:35.624
When I heard about
all the details

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:37.527
I think I nearly passed out.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.900
I suppose I ought to be
grateful.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.508
That a champion of justice was
around to take care of you.

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:47.748
- Yeah.

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:50.954
- We can't thank you enough
for rescuing Master Bell.

00:16:51.054 --> 00:16:53.392
You're the only reason
that he's alive.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:55.798
- [Ryu] You've got it backwards.

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:57.099
- Huh?

00:16:57.801 --> 00:16:59.806
- If it weren't for him,

00:16:59.906 --> 00:17:03.947
I would have resigned myself
to death a long time ago.

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:06.619
My friends decided to
sacrifice their lives,

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:09.290
and I couldn't do anything to
stop them.

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.097
But he was different.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.638
He gave me the strength
to keep on moving ahead.

00:17:15.738 --> 00:17:18.644
Besides, I should be the one
thanking you.

00:17:18.744 --> 00:17:20.313
You took a huge risk.

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:23.251
You traveled all the way
down into the Deep Floors.

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:25.591
Because of you, we
made it out alive.

00:17:25.691 --> 00:17:28.964
Otherwise the dungeon
would be our grave.

00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:32.203
Words can't express
how grateful I am.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.948
- Well, we couldn't
have done it on our own.

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:42.290
The Xenos, Tsubaki, your
waitress pals...

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.427
Without all those guys around,

00:17:44.528 --> 00:17:46.565
we'd have been royally screwed.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.302
(Ryu chuckles)

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.239
- Speaking of which.
- Huh?

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.377
- There's a rumor
going around town,

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:55.818
the fugitive Gale Wind
met her demise.

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:56.720
(Ryu sighs)

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.022
- I'm tellin' ya.

00:17:58.122 --> 00:18:00.928
Those assholes caused
every bit of it!

00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:02.263
You gotta believe me!

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.902
A bunch of stragglers
from the Rudra Familia,

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:06.238
they made this mess.

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:08.943
And when Gale Wind
showed up on the scene.

00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:10.981
My Gods! (sobs)

00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:12.684
She protected us all.

00:18:12.784 --> 00:18:15.957
Took 'em on alone like
a bona fide hero.

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:18.262
She died slaughtering
the bastards.

00:18:18.362 --> 00:18:21.468
Her wounds were fatal! Anyway.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:23.640
It's time we discuss some
payment options.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.378
I was thinking half of the
bounty on Gale Wind's head.

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:28.850
Why, I'd even accept
a third of it.

00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:32.323
If you could break the cash
into singles that'd be great.

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:34.696
(groans) This is bullcrap.

00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:37.467
- [Lili] Given that Master
Bors is the head of Rivira,

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:39.772
and given that none of
the other adventurers

00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:41.876
raised any objections, it seems

00:18:41.977 --> 00:18:43.212
as though the Guild has
acknowledged

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:44.682
Gale Wind's death.

00:18:45.884 --> 00:18:48.288
- Someone in Rivira let
it slip that Gale Wind

00:18:48.388 --> 00:18:50.226
was also the mysterious
adventurer

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.396
who helped defeat the Goliath.

00:18:52.496 --> 00:18:56.606
I hear she's bein' hailed
as a defender of justice.

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:59.444
(Ryu giggles)

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.029
(door clicks)

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:09.531
- [Syr] Good morning!

00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:11.937
- [Ryu] Good morning.

00:19:12.037 --> 00:19:13.172
- Feeling any better?

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:15.009
- [Ryu] Much. Thank you.

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.545
- Glad to hear it.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:20.553
- How are Anya and
the others doing?

00:19:20.653 --> 00:19:23.860
I don't think I've seen them
since the day I woke up.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.064
- Well, uh, let's just say

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:27.935
they spent a bit of
time in the dungeon

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:29.337
when they went
searching for you.

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:32.243
Mama Mia had a few
choice words for them.

00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:33.579
It might be a little while

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.784
before they get a
day off from work.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.186
- [Ryu] Choice words?

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.659
- Yeah, she was mad.

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:42.898
Oh, and she asked me
to deliver a message.

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:45.770
- Yeah? What is it?

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.810
- She made too much
risotto back at the tavern

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.947
and there's lots of leftovers.

00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:53.319
They're all yours.

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:57.728
- Huh?
(somber music)

00:19:57.828 --> 00:19:58.963
Thanks, Syr.

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:07.279
(gentle bright music)

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:08.950
- [Bell] Miss Ryu!

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:13.826
- Hey, Bell. (giggles)

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:15.998
(Bell panting)

00:20:16.098 --> 00:20:17.199
- Sorry that I'm late.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.173
- It's fine. I just
got here myself.

00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:21.408
- Lucky us, right?

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:24.047
Discharged from the
hospital, same day.

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.149
Uh.

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:28.657
(gentle bright music)

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:30.225
Your outfit.

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:34.033
- Uh, does, does
it look weird on me?

00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:36.438
- Not at all. It
looks great on you.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.112
- (chuckles) I- I
borrowed it from Syr,

00:20:40.212 --> 00:20:42.885
and she's got
good taste, so, um.

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:44.655
(Bell groans)

00:20:44.755 --> 00:20:47.460
- How nice. The
sunshine feels great.

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:49.030
It's been a while, huh?

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.502
Shall we go for a
little stroll then?

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:57.581
- [Ryu] Bell, is your
left arm going to be okay?

00:20:57.681 --> 00:20:59.618
You suffered some
serious damage,

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.689
and magic can only do so much.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.192
- [Bell] Thanks to my treatment,

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:05.731
I've got my full range
of motion back.

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.535
Apparently, they
didn't fix it so much

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:09.371
as rebuild it from scratch.

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:10.707
- [Ryu] They rebuilt it?

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:12.009
- [Bell] The
tissues were torn up

00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:13.312
and the bones were shattered.

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:14.648
But they said it
was a good thing

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:17.186
I kept all the parts
wrapped up in my scarf.

00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:19.323
- [Ryu] They can do
that kind of thing?

00:21:19.423 --> 00:21:20.927
- [Bell] Yeah, I guess so.

00:21:21.027 --> 00:21:25.202
Although I'm told it was a
very expensive procedure.

00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:28.441
(birds chirping)

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.448
I never knew this
place was here.

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:35.623
- Yeah. Alise and I used
to come here together.

00:21:38.062 --> 00:21:39.899
I should give up on justice.

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:41.568
- [Bell] Huh?

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:43.840
- That's what Lady
Astrea said to me

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.113
when I was obsessed
with getting revenge.

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:48.683
I saw it as rejection.

00:21:48.783 --> 00:21:53.693
I was convinced I'd been
excommunicated by my goddess.

00:21:53.794 --> 00:21:55.897
But I was wrong.

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:57.935
She said that to save me.

00:21:58.035 --> 00:22:01.809
I realize now she chose
her words very carefully.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.480
If she had tried to
stop me herself,

00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:08.054
she knew in her heart I would've
completely fallen apart.

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:12.363
I owe it all to you, Bell.

00:22:12.463 --> 00:22:14.033
- [Bell] Huh?

00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:15.369
- You believed.

00:22:15.469 --> 00:22:18.576
And you told me I still
had justice within me.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.147
It was your words that helped.

00:22:21.247 --> 00:22:24.187
I was inspired to rise
on my feet again.

00:22:24.287 --> 00:22:25.489
- Miss Ryu.

00:22:26.626 --> 00:22:30.634
- I've said it before,
but you are a human

00:22:30.734 --> 00:22:33.138
who's worthy of deep respect.

00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:37.012
I have to say, thank you.

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:39.383
- Oh, wow.
- Huh?

00:22:40.353 --> 00:22:41.354
- I'm so happy you're

00:22:41.454 --> 00:22:43.425
finally smiling from the heart.

00:22:44.026 --> 00:22:45.162
It's nice.

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:47.166
You're more beautiful than ever.

00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:48.970
- [Ryu] Huh?

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.112
(Ending Song)

00:22:53.212 --> 00:22:54.881
- [Bell] Uh. Huh?

00:22:56.484 --> 00:22:57.687
Miss Ryu?

00:22:58.756 --> 00:23:02.998
- I- I can't look
you in the eye.

00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:04.801
- Huh? Why would that be?

00:23:05.604 --> 00:23:07.006
- [Ryu] I don't know.

00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:09.043
I- I've gotta go!

00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:11.515
- (stammering) Miss Ryu, wait!

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:23.572
- [Ryu] I- I don't understand
what's going on with me.

00:23:24.407 --> 00:23:25.811
Oh, Alise.

00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:29.751
What in the world am
I supposed to do?

00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:45.950
- [Alise] Lion. Don't
let him get away.
