WEBVTT

00:00:01.871 --> 00:00:03.307
- Alrighty! So today...

00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:06.112
Let's have a discussion
about justice.

00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:07.649
We're about to hit
a turning point

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:08.985
in our fight against Evilus,

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.922
so getting back to the
basics couldn't hurt.

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:12.191
- Is that really necessary?

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.461
- [Alise] Oh c'mon, humor me!

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.836
First, let's start off with
what the word "justice" means.

00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:18.838
How would you define it?

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.109
- Define it, huh?

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:22.546
I would say maybe
good deeds done

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:25.250
without any expectation
of something in return.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.120
So, a 'balance' more or less.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.693
- Yeah, but, if the good
deeds don't serve a purpose,

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:32.565
it's not any different than
self-righteousness, is it?

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.601
- Not really.

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.505
If there's some sort of
underlying goal,

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:36.472
then it's narcissism,

00:00:36.574 --> 00:00:39.613
which is a far cry
from real justice.

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:40.882
- When we raise the question

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:42.952
of justice being "real"
versus "not real,"

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:44.723
we could argue about it forever.

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:45.792
- Not true.

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:47.061
We pledged to uphold

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.165
the Sword and Wings
of Justice, remember?

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.868
Our cause is more-
- There she is!

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.106
Armchair Philosopher!
(Ryu scoffs)

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.810
- What do you mean,
"armchair philosopher"?!

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.849
- Yeah, well, I just call
'em like I see 'em, y'know.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.853
- In my opinion...
- [Both] Huh?

00:00:59.953 --> 00:01:01.523
- When all is said and done...

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:05.064
Concepts like justice are
but tools of convenience.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:07.569
A weapon used to
substantiate a cause.

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:10.942
Or dare I say, a blank check
written to warrant violence.

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:14.048
- Kaguya! Must you
always be so cynical?

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:16.687
- [Kaguya] Aww, did I say
something wrong?

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:17.923
- [Ryu] Yes, you did!

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:19.425
Now take it back!

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:21.764
- [Lyla] Do you ever
get tired of arguing?

00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:24.669
(mellow music)

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.935
(Alise claps)

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:42.271
- That's enough
discussion today!

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:43.841
We'll call it here!

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.144
Even the gods themselves,

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:47.148
have a tough time
answering that one.

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:49.920
So there's no use losing
any sleep over it!

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.122
- [All] Huh?

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:53.359
- Anyone can wax
poetic about justice.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.132
And they can also abuse it
for their own gain, right?

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:58.136
So instead of trying
to figure it all out,

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.340
let's focus on weeding
out the other stuff,

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.980
the contrived, phony
kind of justice.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.883
- The phony kind of justice?

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:05.951
- That's correct!

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:07.856
And once that nonsense is gone,

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.060
you know what grows
in it's place?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.566
Order, harmony, happiness!

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.701
Our Familia!

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:14.936
The Astrea Familia,

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.509
wants that true
justice the most!

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.013
We don't "bear the
burden" of justice.

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:22.285
If we did, it would destroy us.

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.890
So, clearly, it's not
something we wield.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.731
For too often, it can be
applied with poor intentions.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.770
Justice is something we hide.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.545
(all agreeing)

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:39.619
I see you've been stunned
speechless by my wisdom yet
again!

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.722
(Alise chuckles)

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:42.224
I mean aren't I great?

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:44.027
(all sigh)

00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:46.132
- There she goes
riling everyone up,

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.805
just to pat herself
on the back again.

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:50.140
(Kaguya chuckles)

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.712
- I wish I could smack
the smile off her face.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:56.285
(Alise grins)

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.195
(Opening Song)

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.177
- [Ryu] Noah Heal...

00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:35.483
(magic sparkling)

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.696
- [Bell] Thank goodness.
- Remember...

00:04:41.796 --> 00:04:43.901
The wounds aren't fully healed.

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.240
I still believe using
my magic on you,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.247
would have been the
better option, Mr. Cranel.

00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:52.786
Thinking about it logically,
it's more efficient.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.257
- We've already been
through this, Miss Ryu.

00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:57.360
I need you to be able
to walk on your own.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.732
It should make things a
bit easier on me, too.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.572
- Yes, but-
(Bell dismissing)

00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:04.308
Then we've reached an impasse.

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:06.747
Both of us are way
too stubborn to budge.

00:05:06.847 --> 00:05:09.819
(Bell agrees)

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:10.622
Very well.

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:13.160
Let's review the situation.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.529
Judging by our surroundings,

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.733
we're on the 37th floor.

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:21.042
It seems that we're, without
a doubt, in the White Palace.

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:22.545
However, I can't
quite figure out

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.750
which area of
the Floor we're in.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.390
In fact, it's unclear which
direction we ought to go.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.395
We're lacking in both
equipment and items.

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:32.699
Should we continue our journey

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.970
and chance fighting
Deep Floor monsters?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.274
Our chances will be very slim.

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:38.242
Because, well,

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:39.411
with the fatigue and

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:41.048
the number of injuries
between us...

00:05:41.148 --> 00:05:45.057
We have no potions nor a
means of medical treatment.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:47.027
Frankly, until my mind gives
out,

00:05:47.127 --> 00:05:51.035
we'll have to rely on my
healing magic as best we can.

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:52.605
- So what are you thinking?

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:55.678
Would it be better to wait
for someone to find us?

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:58.416
- I wouldn't get my hopes up.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:01.389
I can tell we're not anywhere
near the normal route.

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:02.792
This isn't the type of place

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:05.330
that a Familia on an
expedition to the Deep Floors

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.467
would just so happen find.

00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:09.773
Now, I hate to have to put it
this way,

00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:12.110
but even if your friends
guessed our whereabouts,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.416
there's no way they can
make it here by themselves.

00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.024
- I guess you're right...

00:06:19.124 --> 00:06:20.294
- And besides,

00:06:20.394 --> 00:06:23.567
until the chaos on the
27th Floor subsides,

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.504
no one will volunteer for
this...

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:28.376
Even if they put
out a search quest.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:29.913
So if we stay here,

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.284
eventually, we'll end
up just like them.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:38.029
(Bell grumbles)
(serious music)

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:39.331
- No matter what happens,

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.268
don't let anything get
close to Master Welf!

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.705
Is everyone clear?!

00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:45.076
(all nod)

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:54.863
(flame roaring)
(Welf grunts)

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:57.969
(blade crumbling)

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:02.945
- Here goes nothin'.

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:10.093
- Forging weapons
in the Dungeon?

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.464
Man's got a screw loose.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:14.569
If those monsters figure out
where we are-

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.074
- It's too late to
chicken out now, Bors!

00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:19.712
- I know! But even if the
blacksmith does manage

00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:21.015
to slap a blade together,

00:07:21.115 --> 00:07:22.250
how's that gonna help us?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.055
- We all need to have faith!
(Bors gasps)

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:26.627
He's risking his life
to forge that sword

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:28.864
so we can use it to
get out of this mess!

00:07:28.964 --> 00:07:30.266
(Bors gasps)

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.170
- It's our only
chance at survival.

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:35.645
Plus, it's our one and only
chance at saving Master Bell!

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.615
- We all gotta die sometime.

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:39.118
If you wanna make it home,

00:07:39.218 --> 00:07:40.186
then I suggest you start

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:41.623
holding on tight to that shield,

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:44.696
mister.
(Bors grumbles)

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.569
- I swear all of Rabbit
Foot's friends are lunatics!

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.841
(mermen growling)

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:54.148
They're here!

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:56.686
(mermen growling)

00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:58.456
(Aisha grunting)
- Hell Kaios!

00:07:58.558 --> 00:08:01.696
(force rumbling)

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.705
- Screw it, make
the stupid sword!

00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:08.376
(Bors grunting)
(Ouka grunting)

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:09.713
(arrow piercing)
(merman disintegrating)

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:10.881
(sword slashing)
(Aisha grunting)

00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:12.885
(lance piercing)
(Daphne grunting)

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:16.425
(fire roaring)
(serous music)

00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:19.599
(Welf grumbles)

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:26.679
(hammer clamoring)

00:08:35.764 --> 00:08:38.604
(sword slashing)
(merman groaning)

00:08:38.704 --> 00:08:40.307
- You don't have to kill 'em!

00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:41.442
Just cut their legs off!

00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.346
(lance piercing)
(Daphne grunting)

00:08:43.446 --> 00:08:45.617
- [Daphne] I don't
even have time to aim!

00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:49.191
(both grunting)

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.565
(hammer clamoring)

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.639
- [Welf] (grumbles) Dammit!

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.877
This is what Adamantite's like?!

00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:00.180
Gimme a break!

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.152
Am I not strong enough
to shape this stuff?!

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:07.896
- [Ryu] In light of
our current situation,

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:10.100
I think we should start
heading for the tunnel.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.541
Eventually, it will lead
us up to the 36th Floor.

00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:15.644
- The 36th Floor, huh?

00:09:15.744 --> 00:09:17.781
So the Lower Floors?
- Correct.

00:09:17.882 --> 00:09:19.519
The Deep Floors' first
safety point,

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:22.157
won't be until we reach
the 39th Floor.

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:24.729
It would be a much more
difficult endeavor

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:26.600
to climb down two floors.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.569
(Bell nods)

00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:28.436
Of course...

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:29.506
Even if we make it,

00:09:29.606 --> 00:09:31.509
that doesn't mean we're safe.

00:09:31.609 --> 00:09:34.381
However, at least the
Lower Floors have water,

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.818
nuts, berries and fruit.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:38.924
That gives us a much
higher chance of survival.

00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:41.963
I guess you might
be able to say,

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:44.669
the Lower Floors will be
a little more kind to us,

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:46.238
compared to the Deep ones.

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:48.209
(Bell smiles)

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:49.411
- I suppose you're right

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:50.848
but what about that
connecting tunnel?

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.420
How exactly are we supposed to
get there?

00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.090
- Okay, unfortunately,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.695
the journey'll probably be
unpleasant.

00:09:57.795 --> 00:09:59.030
From here on out,

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.768
each of our choices
could mean the difference

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.403
between life and death.

00:10:02.505 --> 00:10:04.375
We'll have to use my magic
sparingly.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.215
We'll try to save it for when
death is the only alternative.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.251
- [Bell] Got it.

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.587
- One more thing,

00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:12.792
if we're going to traverse
this current Floor,

00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:16.399
we will need to procure
more items and equipment.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.804
And water, if possible.

00:10:18.904 --> 00:10:21.643
- Okay, but where?

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:22.845
Miss Ryu?

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:24.415
- We have to strip
them of their gear.

00:10:24.516 --> 00:10:27.187
(Bell gasps)

00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:34.335
- Hey, wait, what are you
talking about, Miss Ryu?!

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.707
- We're going to strip
the corpses of their gear

00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:39.612
and take what we need
for our own use.

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:40.815
- Are you serious?!

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:42.217
We would be desecrating
their bodies!

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:45.490
- Our fellow slain
adventurers can benefit us.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.162
We don't have a choice in the
matter.

00:10:48.263 --> 00:10:49.464
(Bell grumbles)

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.503
I'll search the
woman, Mr. Cranel.

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.039
You take the men.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:55.944
(somber music)

00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:01.723
(Bell gasps)

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:14.649
- [Bell] Of course.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:15.951
Miss Ryu...

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:18.222
For a noble Elf like her,

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:20.861
there's no way this
isn't killing her inside.

00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:22.230
She's doing it to survive.

00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:23.934
Doing it for me.

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:27.976
I'm so sorry.

00:11:28.076 --> 00:11:31.014
We just want to make
it home in one piece!

00:11:31.984 --> 00:11:34.689
(skeleton clattering)

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:37.528
(Bell retches)

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:39.566
This is the Dungeon.

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:42.237
This is what it means
to be an adventurer!

00:11:43.472 --> 00:11:44.709
Anything I say now,

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:47.515
is just an attempt to
rationalize my actions.

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:51.255
But please, let me
say it anyway.

00:11:51.355 --> 00:11:54.161
I'm going to live life
enough for all of you.

00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:56.866
I can't ask for your
forgiveness.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.536
But because of you,

00:11:58.637 --> 00:11:59.906
with your help,

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:02.911
I know that we can escape
from the Deep Floors!

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:06.084
I swear,

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:08.523
we will make it back to the
surface.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.504
- [Ryu] I think that's
about everything.

00:12:15.605 --> 00:12:16.540
- [Bell] Yeah...

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.175
- Our most valuable discovery

00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:19.579
might be this.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:22.819
- [Bell] Oh. A map.
- Yes.

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:24.387
It's incomplete though

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:25.824
but it covers a large distance,

00:12:25.925 --> 00:12:29.298
and details of the
surrounding area.

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:32.939
I can't even imagine how
hopeless they must have felt,

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:35.611
but it's going to be
a huge help to us.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.548
If we know which
routes are dead ends,

00:12:37.648 --> 00:12:39.853
we won't have to
take extra risks.

00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.455
- That's a good point.

00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:44.261
I take it this is the
room we're in right now.

00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:45.496
If that's the case,

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:48.737
do we have any idea what
part of the Floor we're on?

00:12:48.837 --> 00:12:49.739
- 'Fraid not.

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:52.578
The 37th Floor is expansive.

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:55.551
Almost as wide as the
entire city above.

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:56.886
And besides,

00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:59.525
I don't recognize the
area on the map, anyway.

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:03.733
Regardless, I've been
to the Deep Floors
countless times before,

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.372
so I remember what the
normal route looks like.

00:13:06.472 --> 00:13:07.575
- Okay?

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:08.777
- Here's the plan.

00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:09.912
If we follow the map,

00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:11.282
and use it to guide
ourselves back

00:13:11.382 --> 00:13:14.120
to the Dungeon's
normal route, then...

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.693
I can easily lead us to
the connecting tunnel.

00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:17.795
(Bell gasps)

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:19.665
It seems we have our heading.

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:20.635
- Uh-huh.

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:21.736
- I don't know exactly

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:23.038
what we're going to need.

00:13:23.138 --> 00:13:24.108
But let's bring as much of

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:26.244
their gear as we can carry.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.891
(Bell gasps)

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:36.899
(Bell sighs)

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:38.369
- Is there something the matter?

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:39.572
- No... It's just that

00:13:39.672 --> 00:13:40.974
they still had food on them...

00:13:41.074 --> 00:13:42.210
So I can't help but wonder

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.716
why they didn't
make it out alive.

00:13:44.816 --> 00:13:47.487
And it's not like they
ran out of potions.

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:50.493
- It may have been a case of
being poisoned by monsters.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:52.397
- (gasps) That's right!

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.002
There aren't any antidotes!

00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:56.539
- Presumably...

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.909
They used this room as a base

00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:00.614
while they were searching
for a safe path home,

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:03.954
but they ended up exhausting
their supply of antidotes.

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:05.991
The poison spread throughout
their bodies.

00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:08.062
And once these two
could no longer move,

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:10.701
they pinned their hopes
on their remaining friend.

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:11.636
- How sad.

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:13.439
Their friend failed too.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.945
He couldn't handle the
darkness of the Deep Floors

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:16.813
on his own.

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:19.786
(Bell sighs)

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:21.288
- Mr. Cranel.

00:14:23.627 --> 00:14:24.796
- Wait, is that...

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:27.568
A Familia emblem?
- [Ryu] Indeed.

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.639
I can't quite make
it out, but...

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:31.308
These guys were desperate.

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:34.949
They probably didn't
have anything else
to draw the map on.

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:42.665
(Bell gasps)

00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:44.468
- There's something
written here!

00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:45.704
"Forgive us...

00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:47.240
My god...

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:47.908
We...

00:14:48.008 --> 00:14:49.311
Sorry...

00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:49.979
Mom...

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.482
Not coming home..."

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:54.187
(Ryu gasps)

00:14:56.024 --> 00:14:57.962
Miss Ryu, please help me.

00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:00.634
Let's bring this banner
back to the surface.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.705
We have to make it
home, for them!

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:05.610
(somber music)

00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:17.968
(both yelling)

00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:20.774
(arrow piercing)
(merman disintegrating)

00:15:20.874 --> 00:15:26.251
(hammer clamoring)
(serious music)

00:15:30.894 --> 00:15:32.832
- [Welf] What the
hell am I doing?

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.635
We don't have time for this!

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:35.770
I'm supposed to be forging

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:38.042
a gods-damned magic
sword over here!

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:43.520
(hammer clamoring)
(serious music)

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:49.430
(hammer clamoring)

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.347
Maybe it was a dumb idea,

00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:00.086
crafting a weapon
in the Dungeon.

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:02.256
Did I overestimate myself?

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:05.296
Did I just want to be the first
person who's ever done it?

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:07.367
Did I promise something
I can't deliver

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.107
and make my closest friends
stake their lives on it?!

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.179
- Lemme ask you again.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.182
Is your fire burning brightly?

00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:16.786
- [Welf] Oh it's
burning, alright.

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:18.857
Hotter than the frickin' Sun!

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:20.159
I'm pouring all of my strength,

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:21.495
all of my skills,

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:24.000
all of my pride as
a blacksmith into it!

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.936
And yet...

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.539
- You sure about that?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.679
Remember what your
family used to say.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:31.281
"Listen to the metal's voice.

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.319
Let its sound ring in your ears.

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:35.991
And then let your soul
move through your hammer."

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:37.059
- [Welf] Shut up!

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:38.696
To hell with the Crozzo family!

00:16:38.797 --> 00:16:42.437
All I care about right now is
finishing this stupid sword!

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:44.441
- Why's that?

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:47.480
Why are you doing this in the
first place?

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:49.184
- To craft a weapon!

00:16:49.284 --> 00:16:51.689
- Okay, then why are
you crafting a weapon?

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:53.025
- To survive!

00:16:53.126 --> 00:16:54.093
- You're wrong.

00:16:54.193 --> 00:16:55.965
And that's not what I asked you.

00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:58.202
You're gonna have to
dig deeper than that.

00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:00.674
And no cop-out answers, either.

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:01.876
So tell me.

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:04.616
Who are you crafting these
weapons for?

00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:06.919
(Welf gasps)

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:08.823
(Aisha grunting)
(Daphne grunting)

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:11.896
- Hold them off until Master
Welf's done forging the blade!

00:17:11.996 --> 00:17:13.666
- Yeah, I get it!

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:20.279
- Thanks, you guys...

00:17:21.281 --> 00:17:22.918
- One last question,

00:17:23.018 --> 00:17:24.888
why are you so bent
on doing this?

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.191
I need to know.

00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:31.101
- It's for my friends...

00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:32.671
That's right...

00:17:32.772 --> 00:17:36.444
How could I have forgotten
something so painfully obvious?

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:39.384
"Why do I craft weapons?"

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:41.856
I do it for Bell,
for my friends!

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:45.229
(hammer clamoring)

00:17:52.277 --> 00:17:55.349
(Welf grunting)

00:17:58.188 --> 00:17:59.959
- Oh wow, it's happening.

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.297
- Yeah, we dunno what's
so different now

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:04.100
but I'm getting a second wind!

00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.305
(Welf grunting)

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:08.977
- [Welf] It doesn't matter
how powerful they are.

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:11.114
An ordinary magic sword
isn't gonna cut it!

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:14.487
A magic sword is
guaranteed to break!

00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:17.393
Eventually, its wielder
has to say goodbye!

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:22.036
So all I have to do is forge
a blade to beats all blades!

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:25.109
An indestructible magic sword!

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:26.144
- I see then.

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:27.347
I assume Tsubaki went down

00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:28.950
into the Dungeon, too?

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:29.852
- Mm-hm.

00:18:29.952 --> 00:18:30.988
Naaza and Miach were

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:32.591
the ones who approached her.

00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:36.398
And honestly, we're grateful
for all the help we can get.

00:18:36.499 --> 00:18:39.037
- Well, it is what
it is, I suppose.

00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:41.876
It was an extremely
urgent situation.

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.379
Even if I'd tried to stop her,

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:45.349
she would have gone anyway.

00:18:45.449 --> 00:18:47.855
Oh, what was the
other thing you wanted?

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:50.593
- Oh, uh, yeah, about that...

00:18:52.096 --> 00:18:53.633
Expeditions are kinda expensive,

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.469
so would you mind if
we skip the payment

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.674
for Bell's knife this
month, pretty please?

00:18:57.775 --> 00:18:58.376
- Not happenin'.

00:18:58.476 --> 00:18:59.611
- Oh come on, don't be

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:00.981
like that, why?!

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.051
- You know why, Hestia.

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:04.187
I have no doubt

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:06.158
that knife has
saved the boy's life

00:19:06.258 --> 00:19:07.928
countless times by now.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.902
I mean don't you care about him?

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:14.274
Is his life worth that little to
you?

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:16.244
- Of course I care about him!

00:19:16.345 --> 00:19:17.280
(Hestia scoffs)

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.816
- Then start coughing up cash.

00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:22.323
Prove that you're willing to
do whatever it takes for Bell.

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:25.429
(Hestia pouts)
(Hephaistos smiles)

00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:33.679
(hammer clamoring)
(Welf grunting)

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:37.353
- [Welf] That's it, I need
a blade with divine power!

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:38.891
Like the one that she...

00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:40.225
That the goddess made.

00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:42.764
A weapon of the highest caliber!

00:19:44.368 --> 00:19:45.504
Hang in there, Bell...

00:19:45.604 --> 00:19:47.975
I'm not gonna turn
my back on you!

00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:50.346
We'll walk side by side!

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.250
In fact...
If you're not careful,

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.857
I might even leave you and
Lady Hephaistos in the dust!

00:19:55.957 --> 00:19:58.596
Get ready, 'cause here I come!

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.971
(mermen growling)

00:20:03.071 --> 00:20:04.174
(Ouka grunts)

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:05.176
(Ouka yells)

00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:06.078
(Bors yells)

00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:08.348
- Holy crap!
- Ouka!

00:20:08.448 --> 00:20:09.351
(Daphne and Lili tremble)

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:11.723
(Cassandra gasps)

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:13.024
(mermen growling)

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.997
(flame roaring)

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:19.470
- All right, 'bout damn time.

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:31.362
(intense music)

00:20:31.462 --> 00:20:33.132
- [Welf] Sorry for the wait.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.968
(mermen growling)

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.138
- Uh-hey!

00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:37.173
So what do we do now?!

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:38.577
- Master Welf?

00:20:38.677 --> 00:20:40.948
- My magic alone
won't be enough.

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:41.949
Can you lend me a hand?

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.920
- Huh? Oh, sure!

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.128
- Now the real test.

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:49.164
Let's go!

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:52.436
(mermen growling)

00:20:53.071 --> 00:20:58.381
Shikou Kazuki!

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.655
(fire roaring)

00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:07.901
(Daphne and Lili gasp)

00:21:25.102 --> 00:21:26.237
(Welf exhales)

00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:28.075
- Master Welf...

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:30.613
- Heya, it's all good to go.

00:21:32.217 --> 00:21:34.688
A shatterproof magic sword.

00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:37.293
The blade and its wielder
work hand in hand,

00:21:37.393 --> 00:21:39.431
standing by each other for life.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:42.971
(inspirational music)

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:48.617
(Cassandra gasps)

00:21:48.717 --> 00:21:51.288
- So that's what the last
part of the prophecy meant.

00:21:51.388 --> 00:21:53.726
"The daystar's golden rays"!

00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:56.599
- This is the beginning.

00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:58.235
The first step of my journey

00:21:58.335 --> 00:22:00.773
to take my skills to new
heights!

00:22:02.645 --> 00:22:05.182
You put your lives
in my hands...

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:06.484
Take 'em back.

00:22:07.453 --> 00:22:09.892
Okay everybody, gear up!

00:22:09.992 --> 00:22:11.394
It's time to go find Bell!

00:22:11.494 --> 00:22:12.598
- [All] Yeah!

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:16.872
(Cassandra and Lili giggling)

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:24.988
(Ending song)

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.823
- [Ryu] Next time. White Palace.
