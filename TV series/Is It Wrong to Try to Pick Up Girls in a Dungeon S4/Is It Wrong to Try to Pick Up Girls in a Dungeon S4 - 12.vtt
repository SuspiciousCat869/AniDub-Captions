WEBVTT

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.175
(soft orchestral music)

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.813
- [Ais] The Deep Floors.

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:09.452
It is a scary place, I suppose.

00:00:09.553 --> 00:00:12.793
Words don't really do
it any justice though.

00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:16.967
However, you feel it
when you're there.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.107
If you ever make it
to the Deep Floors,

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:21.710
you'll know what I mean.

00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:27.421
(Juggernaut bellows)

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.793
- That growling.

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:31.195
The monster...

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.437
It's coming for us.

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:46.760
- [Cassandra] A great
disaster cometh.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.297
Do not approach it,

00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:51.135
for it is the embodiment
of ruin.

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.240
Do not touch it,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.212
for it is the oracle of death.

00:00:56.312 --> 00:01:00.054
A cage of despair shall
become a coffin

00:01:00.154 --> 00:01:02.257
and thou shalt suffer.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.596
Do not forget,

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:08.137
the light thou seekest
is the life-giving sun

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:10.074
for there is no other.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:11.844
Gather the pieces,

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:13.379
offer up the flame,

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.087
and pray for the great
day-star's golden rays.

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:18.691
Take heed,

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:21.195
it is a banquet of tragedy.

00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.370
(Opening song)

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.055
(water splashes)

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:01.228
(intense music)

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.368
- It really is the floor boss.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.310
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.422
(fire crackles)

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:38.036
- Can't breathe!

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:39.271
- Cover your mouth, or else

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.375
the heat will burn your throat.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.716
- It feels like an oven.

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:47.354
That must have been
his blue napalm attack.

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:50.360
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:51.296
Let's fall back!

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:53.133
- Huh? But Master Bell's

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.936
still on the 27th floor!

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:56.640
- What other choice do we have?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.811
Let's regroup and then
worry about him.

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:01.583
Unless you wanna die,
I suggest you hurry.

00:04:03.954 --> 00:04:06.159
- [Cassandra] Is this
part of my premonition?

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.461
Or...

00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:09.866
I can't tell,

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.736
but something feels wrong.

00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:16.011
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.022
(crystals shatter)

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:22.158
- Keep moving!

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.430
Run like your life
depends on it!

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:27.702
(fire crackles)

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:28.537
Split up!

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:30.708
One touch and you're a goner!

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:31.577
(Haruhime gasps)

00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:32.745
- Haruhime!

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:36.620
(fire crackles)

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.221
(Ouka groans)

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.290
- Master Ouka!

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.759
- Get going!

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:42.899
- Damn. It melted that
shield like it was nothing.

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.773
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:17.836
- [Fels] What are you
talking about, Ouranos?

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:21.309
Amphisbaena shouldn't spawn
for another two weeks!

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.379
- Yet it already has.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.685
The dungeon ignored
the interval.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:26.653
It chose this.

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:30.194
That is why it sent
a Monster Rex.

00:05:30.294 --> 00:05:32.064
(Fels sighs)

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:34.870
- [Fels] The Juggernaut's
appearance was irregular

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.506
in and of itself.

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:38.210
What the hell is going on?

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.212
Are they...

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:41.851
Is the Hestia Familia alive?

00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:43.019
- Hmm.

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:46.092
That's not the only
irregular thing about it.

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.196
Remember, the Juggernaut,

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.733
it has moved.

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:50.901
- Impossible.

00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:52.471
It might be bloodthirsty,

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:54.909
but given the implications
of its birth,

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.647
it's unlikely to migrate.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:58.751
- [Ouranos] The White Palace.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.022
(Fels gasps)

00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:02.391
I have a suspicion.

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:05.732
The Juggernaut is headed
for the Deep Floors.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.602
- [Fels] I don't understand.

00:06:08.938 --> 00:06:09.939
- Hmm.

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:11.977
- [Fels] At any rate, if

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:14.516
we want to get a handle
on this situation,

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.887
we should send reinforcements

00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:20.260
and going through the proper
channels will take too long.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.130
- We'll do everything we can.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.442
Even if it is all for naught.

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.518
(Juggernaut shrieks)

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.422
- [Bell] That sound...

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.225
That's gotta be...

00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:38.831
It's going to be
here any minute.

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.635
(Bell gasps)

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:43.907
No. Is it still
following his orders?

00:06:45.644 --> 00:06:48.784
(Juggernaut shrieks)

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:50.220
My arm,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.991
it hurts just to breathe.

00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:54.461
The Goliath Scarf seems
to have kept it intact,

00:06:54.562 --> 00:06:57.367
but my bones are
a shattered mess.

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.572
Miss Ryu's hurt
pretty badly too.

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:02.044
We don't stand a
chance this time.

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:03.313
If it attacked us now

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:05.083
it'll kill us in an instant.

00:07:06.987 --> 00:07:08.389
(Bell gasps)

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:11.296
I've got to get us out of here.

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:12.865
But I have no idea what
kind of creatures

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:15.771
might be waiting for us
just beyond that door.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:20.848
So then, should I
stay here and fight?

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:24.723
Take on that monster while
I'm broken and bleeding?

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:27.561
If it corners us in a narrow
passageway...

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:29.699
It's no use!

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.104
I can't think straight!

00:07:32.204 --> 00:07:34.075
(Bell pants)

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:36.045
The darkness is suffocating.

00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:38.784
Is that what the Deep
Floors do to people?

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.491
- [Aisha] You're kidding me.

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.428
- This isn't good.

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:45.931
Our escape route.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:49.204
(dark music)

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.843
- The eastern passage too.

00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:59.258
- [Lili] It locked us in.

00:07:59.358 --> 00:08:02.698
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.547
- [Cassandra] I was a fool.

00:08:10.647 --> 00:08:13.754
I should have known there
was no escaping my dreams.

00:08:13.854 --> 00:08:15.991
No escaping the disaster.

00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:17.995
This is it.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.970
This is the cage of despair.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.310
- So that's a floor boss that
never should have spawned.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.680
And a prison cell.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.982
If I didn't know better,

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:30.153
I would take that to
mean the dungeon itself

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:31.489
is trying to kill us.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.658
- Hard to say.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:35.497
Scary to imagine
it's even possible.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.568
(girls sigh)

00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:39.404
- [Aisha] Prepare for the worst.

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:41.075
Running isn't an option anymore.

00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.745
We have to keep fighting.

00:08:44.582 --> 00:08:46.085
Guess that didn't work.

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.389
But I can't blame them.

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:49.526
When you're looking
into the eyes

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:51.462
of almost certain destruction,

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:53.834
it's not easy to think positive.

00:08:54.735 --> 00:09:00.079
(fire crackles)
(Aisha grunts)

00:09:04.723 --> 00:09:06.258
Are you guys doing okay?

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:11.770
We don't have the strength
or the morale to survive.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.509
It doesn't matter how
much the party's improved.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:15.878
Under circumstances like these,

00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:19.251
of course they're gonna
lose the will to fight.

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.288
If only Bell Cranel were here.

00:09:23.292 --> 00:09:24.361
(Aisha gasps)

00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:27.133
Get your shit together,
Aisha Belka!

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.238
When did you turn into
a weak little girl

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:31.009
who relies on men?

00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:33.312
Still, these guys do
look up to Bell Cranel

00:09:33.412 --> 00:09:34.715
like he's the hero.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:37.689
- Huh?

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:39.457
- [Welf] It's your first
time, ain't it, Lil Bit?

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.963
Going on an adventure
without Bell.

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.702
You're thinking that we can't
fight without our tough guy,

00:09:44.802 --> 00:09:47.240
or that we're helpless
without our hero.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.342
Bullshit!

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:49.812
That's not the kind of people

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:51.149
we adventurers are.

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:52.317
People think we can't

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.687
do anything without Bell.

00:09:53.787 --> 00:09:56.158
Well, we can't have a
reputation like that!

00:09:56.258 --> 00:09:57.460
We're better than that!

00:09:57.562 --> 00:09:58.663
Am I wrong here?

00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:01.135
You know I'm right, right?

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.941
So let's make Bell proud
of us for a change.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:05.811
We'll tell him all
about how we took down

00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.048
the floor boss on our own!

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:10.120
- Obviously.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.692
From now on, I intend
to stand at his side,

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:15.196
as a partner in our future
adventures.

00:10:15.296 --> 00:10:16.065
An equal!

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:17.100
- Same for me.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.404
We're not second fiddle
to Bell Cranel.

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:20.541
Right, Chigusa?

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:21.408
- Yeah!

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:22.612
- Me neither.

00:10:22.712 --> 00:10:24.348
If I don't find the
strength to fight,

00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:26.252
I'll be too ashamed
to face Bell.

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:27.722
- Um, agreed.

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:30.193
I don't want to depend on
someone else for everything.

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:33.132
I won't go back to a
life of waiting around.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.201
- Geez, you guys,

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:36.238
you all sound so dramatic.

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:38.342
But I guess you're right.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:39.980
'Cause we're adventurers!

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.652
Box us in and we'll
slash our way out.

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:43.720
- Daphne...

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.158
- Not too shabby there, Crozzo.

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:49.097
I've fought this lizard
once or twice myself.

00:10:49.197 --> 00:10:50.868
We might not be strong
enough to kill it,

00:10:50.968 --> 00:10:54.007
but let's go kick some ass!

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:56.411
- [All] Hell yeah!

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.760
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:09.004
(Welf yells)

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:12.243
(dramatic music)

00:11:12.343 --> 00:11:13.379
(all gasp)

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:15.116
- There you go, it's
frozen solid.

00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:18.289
You guys are up!

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.625
(Aisha grunts)

00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.596
- Nice one, big guy!

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:23.499
(Aisha gasps)

00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:26.739
(water splashes)

00:11:27.776 --> 00:11:30.847
(fire crackles)

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:38.764
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:40.567
The most common way
to defeat Amphisbaena

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:44.474
is by attacking it in an area
with accessible footholds.

00:11:44.575 --> 00:11:46.646
It's my turn!

00:11:46.746 --> 00:11:49.852
Come forth, champion of valor!

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:51.188
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.960
(Aisha grunts)

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:57.166
Ravenous blade, thy name's
Hippolyta!

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:02.010
Hell Kaios!

00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:07.755
- Do you see that?

00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:09.224
- Is it neutralized?

00:12:10.326 --> 00:12:11.461
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:13.199
(fire crackles)
(Aisha gasps)

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.838
- That was Amphisbaena's
crimson mist attack!

00:12:15.938 --> 00:12:17.207
You saw for yourself,

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:18.042
it scatters any magic

00:12:18.142 --> 00:12:20.012
it comes into contact with.

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:24.054
Which means if we're
gonna kill this thing,

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:26.893
we gotta hit it from up close!

00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:28.229
- We might be able
to pierce the fog

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:30.132
if we keep blasting it
with our magic,

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:32.271
but it's not worth the trouble!

00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:35.945
I mean, there's not much
we can do to it anyway.

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:38.783
- I guess these are
mostly useless too, huh?

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:41.556
- [Cassandra] It won't be long

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:43.727
until the cage of despair

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:45.163
becomes a coffin.

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:48.168
And there's nothing we
can do to stop it.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.379
- Uchide no Kozuchi!

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.082
Begin the dance!

00:12:56.385 --> 00:12:57.788
- [Lili] We need to
raise our stats

00:12:57.888 --> 00:12:59.491
so it won't kill us in one blow.

00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:01.530
Cast Level Boost on Master Welf,

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.166
Master Ouka,

00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:04.234
Lady Mikoto,

00:13:04.335 --> 00:13:06.472
and Lady Daphne!

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:09.979
(Ouka and Welf yell)

00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.485
(Haruhime pants)

00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:15.891
Are you all right,
Lady Haruhime?

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.628
- Don't worry, Lili.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:19.164
I'll be okay.

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.034
I should be able to
avoid Mind Down,

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.306
if I only used four tails.

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:24.108
- Mm.

00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:26.345
My apologies, Lady Chigusa.

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:29.518
For now, you'll have to play
support for the vanguard.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:35.329
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:37.935
- [Haruhime] Sorry, Chigusa.

00:13:38.036 --> 00:13:39.204
- I understand.

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:41.274
I don't mind waiting my turn.

00:13:44.883 --> 00:13:46.753
- Heed the rays in
the sky above.

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:49.893
Bloom, my finest
armor of laurel.

00:13:49.993 --> 00:13:53.232
So that all may retreat!

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.334
Raumure!

00:13:56.304 --> 00:13:57.474
- Raumure?

00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:58.844
I know that spell.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:00.781
- It reminds me of
Master Apollon.

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.518
That's why I never
like to use it.

00:14:02.618 --> 00:14:05.791
But now's not the time
to be picky, now is it?

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.028
You handle the healing,
Cassandra.

00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:10.099
- But Daphne!

00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:13.873
It's hopeless.

00:14:14.676 --> 00:14:16.244
No one can escape.

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:19.184
No one can survive.

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:24.395
- [Lunor] Ryu's a suspect
in a murder investigation?

00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:26.967
- This was delivered to
me from the 18th floor.

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:29.037
It's a letter from our
supporter.

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:31.141
It sounds like the elf
fled into the dungeon

00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:32.578
and they've joined the manhunt.

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.049
They're reserving judgment
until they hear her side.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:36.586
- It's a big meow-stake!

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:37.822
Ryu wouldn't hurt a fly,

00:14:37.922 --> 00:14:39.357
much less try to kill someone!

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:42.497
- Anya's not wrong! Ryu would
never commit hom-meow-cide,

00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:43.834
not even on a day off.

00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:46.305
- Agreed. I didn't
think she would.

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.013
It's just I've got a
bad feeling about this.

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:53.385
In fact, I've been asked to
have reinforcements ready

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:54.622
just in case.

00:14:56.192 --> 00:14:59.064
Maybe I'm paranoid, but
I'd rather play it safe.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:02.505
So I was hoping you'd
help Bell and the others.

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:03.940
- Hmm?
- Huh?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.445
(Anya growls)

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:07.313
- [Bell] I was right.

00:15:07.414 --> 00:15:08.983
We have to move!

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:10.687
We've gotta go,

00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:14.094
as far away as we possibly can.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:17.400
There'll be more monsters
past this tunnel.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.939
But if we don't get
out of here now...

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.980
(footsteps boom)

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.318
(Juggernaut growls)

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:29.090
(Bell pants)

00:15:29.726 --> 00:15:32.396
(Ouka yells)

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:35.871
(dramatic music)

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:38.977
(Mikoto yells)

00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:42.117
(Aisha yells)

00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:43.520
- Aisha, look out!

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:45.624
(Aisha grunts)

00:15:45.725 --> 00:15:46.893
(fire crackles)

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:47.895
- Dammit!

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:48.997
We're losing our footholds.

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:50.700
- This floor boss, I knew it'd

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.538
be powerful, but not like this.

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.940
- No weak spot.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.109
- If it doesn't have one,

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:56.712
then we'll make one!

00:15:58.182 --> 00:16:00.419
(Aisha grunts)

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.222
(Amphisbaena groans)

00:16:01.322 --> 00:16:02.691
Dammit, that's too shallow.

00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:03.760
- It's a start!

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.664
- Let's get in there!
- Right!

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:10.707
(water splashes)

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.684
- [Welf] Be ready,
it dove under.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:17.053
- [Mikoto] Dammit.

00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:20.760
(dramatic music)

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:26.672
- Brace yourselves.

00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:32.149
(Amphisbaena roars)
(all yell)

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.324
(all cough)

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.901
- [Lili] Blue Napalm and Mist.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.206
Two heads and no blind spots.

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:46.111
And it can swim underwater.

00:16:46.212 --> 00:16:48.983
My friends are fighting their
absolute hardest to survive

00:16:49.083 --> 00:16:52.156
and I can't do anything to help.

00:16:52.256 --> 00:16:55.630
What kind of commander let's
her team face danger alone?

00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.933
What good am I?

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:58.369
- [Daphne] Liliruca!
(Lili gasps)

00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.304
Stay focused.

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:00.674
If you wanna be a great leader,

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:03.378
don't fall apart over
things you can't control.

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.182
Great leaders assess
the issue calmly

00:17:05.282 --> 00:17:07.721
and then decide how to
maneuver the situation.

00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:08.890
I'm heading to the front line!

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.694
The rest is up to you,
commander!

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:12.664
- [Lili] Maneuver the situation.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.375
(Lili gasps)
(dramatic music)

00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:21.048
Lady Mikoto!
Switch positions!

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:23.620
Fall back to the middle
guard and start chanting!

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.256
Lady Daphne, push forward!

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:26.960
- God of Ultimate Strength,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.229
Bringer of Destruction,

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.165
I humbly beseech you.

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.572
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:35.644
- [Aisha] I'm your opponent,
you son of a bitch!

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:39.585
(water splashes)

00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:42.390
It dove under again.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.760
- Mikoto, use your skill!

00:17:45.096 --> 00:17:46.464
- Yata no Kurogarasu!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:49.404
(energy bursts)

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:52.845
Oh!

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:54.882
Aisha, beneath you!

00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:56.920
(water splashes)
(Aisha grunts)

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.189
Conquest of the gods!

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.961
- Everyone in the vanguard,
fall back now!

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:03.032
Get ready for the next attack!

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.771
Lady Mikoto, stretch it
out as wide as you can!

00:18:05.871 --> 00:18:07.607
- Futsu no Mitama!

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.955
(Mikoto groans)

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:18.462
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.168
- Here it comes!

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.036
- More mist?

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.205
Thing's got no quit.

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:24.909
- Heavier, Lady Mikoto!

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:26.144
And higher!

00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:29.217
(Mikoto yells)

00:18:41.877 --> 00:18:44.815
(debris crashes)

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.686
- You did it!

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.222
Good job!
- Yeah!

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.560
- Well, dang, nicely
done, you two.

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:53.800
(Welf yells)

00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:57.641
- Let's waste this ugly bastard!

00:18:57.742 --> 00:19:01.114
(exciting music)

00:19:01.214 --> 00:19:03.553
Come on, let's do this!

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:05.624
(Welf yells)

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:07.828
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:10.634
(girls yell)

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:13.606
(Amphisbaena growls)

00:19:13.706 --> 00:19:15.678
- I don't think so!

00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:17.981
(Ouka yells)

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:19.450
(Amphisbaena roars)

00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:21.221
- Something's coming, you guys!

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:22.524
Fall back!

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.267
(Amphisbaena screams)

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.304
- Dang. It's called
up a few buddies.

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:31.207
- We just have to keep
on pushing through.

00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:33.646
- Don't let them get
the best of you.

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:36.284
(all yell)

00:19:42.363 --> 00:19:43.298
- I'm lost.

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.704
How can they continue to fight

00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:47.741
amidst such anguish?

00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:50.814
The cage of despair has
become a coffin.

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:53.587
This is where we'll
meet our end.

00:19:53.687 --> 00:19:55.857
We may wish it
weren't true, but-

00:19:55.957 --> 00:19:58.094
Hey! Ow!

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:00.066
- [Daphne] What the hell,
Cassandra?

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:00.867
(Cassandra groans)

00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:01.970
Get off your ass

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.372
and do your damn job!

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:04.742
- Daphne, please.

00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:05.945
- We're out there battling

00:20:06.045 --> 00:20:07.013
a frickin' floor boss

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:08.149
and where's our healer?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.685
Busy cowering in the corner.

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:11.723
I've got way more important
things to do

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:13.125
than babysit you.

00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:14.394
- How do you do it?

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:17.167
How do you resist giving
in to the despair?

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:18.302
- Huh?

00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:20.072
- No matter how
much we struggle,

00:20:20.173 --> 00:20:22.009
the despair will take us
inevitably,

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:23.780
so what's the point?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.482
I'm terrified.

00:20:25.583 --> 00:20:27.855
Too scared to fight back.

00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:29.190
- Ugh!

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.028
Despair, despair, despair!

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:33.398
Think I'm not scared too?
- Huh?

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.637
- [Daphne] I'm scared as hell,
but what choice do we have?

00:20:35.738 --> 00:20:37.974
Liliruca and the others
took a stand

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:40.046
and I wasn't ready
to call it quits.

00:20:40.146 --> 00:20:42.316
That's why I chose to fight!

00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:44.387
- But Daphne...

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:49.030
- Honestly,

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.401
they've grown on you too, right?

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:54.006
With all their sappy,
naive glory.

00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:59.986
So make yourself useful
and help them!

00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:00.988
Heal their wounds,

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:02.558
protect them from harm,

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:05.763
don't surrender to empty
words like despair!

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.470
(inspiring music)

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:13.411
Look to the future, mean it!

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:16.284
'Cause you and me, we're
adventurers!

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:21.494
- [Cassandra] Glow of
heaven, once rejected,

00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:25.102
merciful arms that save
this wretched self of mine,

00:21:25.202 --> 00:21:26.940
my words stop just short,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.245
go in their place to save
my pitiful companions.

00:21:30.346 --> 00:21:31.849
Oh, solar rays,

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:34.755
I beseech you to ward off
affliction.

00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:37.827
Soul Light, go!

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:44.373
- [Daphne] She's such
a pain in the ass.

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:48.382
- I'm starting to heal.

00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:50.152
- Well, look who joined us.

00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:51.689
- I'm sorry for the delay.

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:53.860
I'm here and I'm ready to fight.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.128
- Lady Cassandra!

00:21:55.228 --> 00:21:57.066
- Well, it took you long enough!

00:21:57.166 --> 00:21:58.335
We didn't stand a chance.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:21:59.905
We need our two healers.

00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:02.978
I expect to see blood,
sweat, and tears.

00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:04.447
- Roger.

00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:06.451
(Haruhime chuckles)

00:22:06.553 --> 00:22:09.658
(exciting music)

00:22:15.503 --> 00:22:20.412
(Ending song)

00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:48.656
- [Cassandra] Next time:
"Morgue."
