WEBVTT

00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:02.672
(gentle music)

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:04.777
- Ideals versus reality?

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:05.945
Really now?

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.816
Did Alise and
Kaguya try to start

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:09.285
another debate or somethin'?

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:12.091
What I recommend,
put on a serious face

00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:14.295
and just nod along to
whatever they have to say.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:15.364
- Come on.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm asking a genuine question
here, Lyla.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.374
If I gather a
variety of opinions,

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:22.011
I can figure out
the right answer-

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.313
- Yeah, whatever.

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.254
You Elves really get
on my nerves sometimes.

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:28.658
Right is subjective.

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:31.096
It's different depending
on who you ask, you know.

00:00:31.196 --> 00:00:32.298
(Ryu grunts)

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.670
And honestly, whether
something's true

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.542
is ultimately up to
each of us to decide.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:39.679
At the end of the day,
you have to make a truth

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:41.617
that's acceptable to you.

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.960
- I wish you were this
thoughtful all the time, Lyla.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.330
- Excuse me, missy!

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.737
I am the pinnacle of
thoughtfulness and humility.

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:54.677
- I'd like you to remember
something important, okay?

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:56.445
Everything you've taught me,

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.216
the art of negotiation

00:00:58.316 --> 00:00:59.452
via blackmail,
(Lyla grunts)

00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:01.356
a plethora of intimidation
techniques,

00:01:01.456 --> 00:01:03.160
(Lyla grunting)
surefire ways to win a bet,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.295
plus how to cheat at,

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:06.132
(Lyla whistling)
well, everything.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.301
(Lyla grunts)

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.871
- If you wanna
take out the trash,

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:12.144
sometimes you're gonna have to
get your hands a little dirty.

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:14.182
- [Ryu] And while there
may be some merit to that,

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:16.086
I know more about these
underhanded tactics

00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:17.522
than I ever wanted to.

00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:20.394
- Keep in mind, you're
a young and inexperienced Elf.

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:22.431
I'm only looking out for you.

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:24.970
- [Ryu] I won't deny the
fact that I'm inexperienced,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.339
but I don't know.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.144
I'm just not sure
what you're teaching me.

00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:30.347
- Okay. Listen.

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:31.984
Knowledge is your weapon.

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:33.687
Information is your friend.

00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:36.560
Everything I've taught you
may save your ass someday.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.564
Whether it's a random
piece of trivia

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:41.737
or an unorthodox method
of some sort.

00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:44.241
It's tough to wrap your
head around. I get it.

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:46.245
But it's better
than being clueless.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.716
There's no rush.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:52.024
So try and turn your knowledge
into wisdom. Understand?

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.428
- Turn knowledge to wisdom?

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.136
- Hm, if you can do that,

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.040
then you might save
someone else's ass.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.743
You just need to be ready.

00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:04.282
And everyone will think
you're cool, you know?

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:07.822
And you could be the
coolest Elf ever. (chuckles)

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.728
(gentle music)

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.805
(Opening Song)

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:49.592
(footsteps tapping)

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.111
(Bell gasps)

00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:02.284
(ominous music)

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.773
(footstep thuds)
(monster grunting)

00:04:12.873 --> 00:04:16.345
(footsteps crunching)

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:19.986
- [Ryu] The Colosseum.

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:21.523
- The Colosseum?

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:23.627
- It's quite the fitting name.

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:26.499
Monsters spawn infinitely,
no matter how many die.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.303
That defines this place.

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.073
- [Bell] Infinitely?

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.577
- When one monster disappears,

00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:34.783
another one immediately
spawns in its place.

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:37.221
So, well, there's
a perpetual supply.

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.790
(Bell gasps)

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.665
A miniature, condensed
version of the Dungeon itself.

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.470
Not even the Loki
Familia goes near it.

00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.546
It is perhaps the most dangerous
area on the 37th Floor.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:53.019
- Miss Ais and the others won't
even set foot in this place?

00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:59.231
- [Ryu] We have no choice but
to cut across the Colosseum.

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.501
- Miss Ryu, that's not-

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.004
- If we reach the other side,

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.406
we'll be back on track.

00:05:03.507 --> 00:05:04.843
Once we're there,

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:07.615
getting to the 36th
Floor should be easier.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:08.449
- Hang on!

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.653
- Let me put it this way.

00:05:09.753 --> 00:05:11.455
If we don't cut
across the Colosseum,

00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:13.660
we can't get to
the normal route.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.234
That's gonna make escaping
this floor extremely difficult.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:19.071
This is our moment of truth.

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:20.273
No, wait.

00:05:20.373 --> 00:05:22.411
It's a situation that
we cannot avoid.

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:23.847
One we must face.

00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:26.653
(Bell grunts)

00:05:27.387 --> 00:05:29.693
(Ryu chuckles)

00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:32.464
Now that we've been able
to identify the Colosseum,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:35.505
I have a pretty good
idea where we are.

00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:38.477
There are four different
exits in this room.

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:42.117
Of those, the one that
leads to the normal route

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.621
is positioned directly opposite

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:45.624
the passageway
we're standing in.

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:48.765
- So it's the side
farthest from us.

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.637
How are we supposed to
cross the Colosseum?

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:53.607
There's an endless
supply of monsters.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:55.176
We won't make any ground.

00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:59.117
- Which is why we want to
avoid battling them entirely.

00:05:59.217 --> 00:06:00.487
We're going to blend in so that

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:02.592
we don't attract
their attention.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.100
- [Bell] A Skull Sheep hide?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.369
- That's right.
(tense music)

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.941
We'll be camouflaged
if we wear this.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.350
(Bell retching)

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.989
We'll also disguise our scent.

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:19.491
- Was that an item drop?

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:21.228
- A Barbarian Heart.

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:24.569
We'll grind it up and cover
ourselves from head to toe.

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.809
With that and if we're
careful not to make any noise,

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:31.048
we should be able to
trick the monsters.

00:06:31.148 --> 00:06:34.990
- Wow, Miss Ryu, I'd be
lost without you here.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.359
- Mr. Cranel?

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:39.632
- You're always so calm
even at times like this,

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.937
always making the right choices.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:45.443
Only thing I'm good at
is getting in trouble.

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:46.880
I honestly don't
think I could escape

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.519
from the Deep Floors
without your help.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:57.101
- Please Mr. Cranel, try to
turn your knowledge into wisdom.

00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.136
- My knowledge...

00:06:58.236 --> 00:06:59.471
Wait, what?

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:02.143
- I'll explain.

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.349
Let knowledge inform your
actions.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.555
You'll get better at helping
others,

00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:11.630
if you can apply it under
the appropriate circumstances.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.969
And then you'll become even
stronger.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.138
- Got it.

00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:18.678
(Ryu chuckles)

00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.449
- Do you remember the
shape of the normal route

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.988
and the mapping technique
I showed you?

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:25.457
- Ah? Yeah.

00:07:25.558 --> 00:07:28.029
It's basically a really
expansive corridor.

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.367
If we're able to avoid
all the side paths,

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:32.706
we should reach
the adjoining tunnel.

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:35.476
As far as size goes,
the map is drawn on a scale

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:37.247
where 10 steps equals 20.

00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:38.550
- Excellent.

00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.523
We've got three Blazerocks left.

00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:44.061
I want you to take
one of them with you.

00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:46.199
- Huh? You sure?

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.367
- Please just take it.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.539
We have no idea what'll happen.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.841
We ought to divvy up the items

00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:53.313
so that we can both
defend ourselves

00:07:53.413 --> 00:07:55.249
regardless of the situation.

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:57.955
- [Bell] Okay.

00:08:01.596 --> 00:08:02.665
- [Ryu] Let's move.

00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:06.105
(footsteps tapping)

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:10.614
(ominous music)

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:21.035
- [Bell] If they sense the
presence of an intruder,

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.074
every single monster will
come rushing towards us.

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:25.745
Don't panic.

00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:28.215
We'll sneak right by
without them noticing.

00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:30.153
(both grunting)

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:35.831
(ominous music continues)
(footsteps tapping)

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.312
(Peluda growls)

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:49.559
(footsteps thudding)

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:56.271
(footsteps tapping)

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.087
Stay calm.

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:06.693
You're fine.

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:10.768
(footsteps tapping)

00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:17.114
(ground crashing)

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:20.587
(Peluda growling)

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:24.629
(ominous music continues)

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:31.810
(Bell sighs)

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.885
(footsteps tapping)

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:38.056
Keep going.

00:09:38.156 --> 00:09:40.026
You're doing good.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.719
There it is.

00:09:52.819 --> 00:09:54.254
- [Ryu] Let's go.

00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:55.256
- [Bell] Roger.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.697
(footsteps tapping)

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:04.375
(monsters growling)
(tense suspenseful music)

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:05.711
(Loup Garou growling)

00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:06.580
(Peluda growling)

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.415
(weapons clanking)

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:11.656
(Peluda roaring)

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:16.766
(monsters roaring)

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.837
- I've been told that these
monsters remain locked

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:21.175
in a never-ending
battle with each other

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:24.815
except for when an intruder
encroaches upon their territory.

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:30.026
(footsteps thudding)

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.973
(Spartoi chittering)

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.079
(Spartoi thudding)

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:41.048
(Bell grunts)

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:43.687
That's the bridge we
want over there.

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:45.256
It's the long way around,

00:10:45.356 --> 00:10:47.528
but staying on this
level is the safest way

00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:48.998
to the other side.

00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:51.603
- Miss Ryu, would that
bridge over there take us

00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:53.373
to the normal route?

00:10:53.473 --> 00:10:55.778
- Unfortunately for us, no.

00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:59.519
And while the right-hand side
is connected to the maze,

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.389
there's only one viable option.

00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:04.361
It's the bridge located
directly in front of us.

00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:05.865
- Understood.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:11.308
(tense suspenseful music)
(monsters roaring)

00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:18.256
We're walking right above them.

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:22.096
Can we really make it all the
way across without being seen?

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:23.900
(Loup Garou growling)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.938
(Bell gasps)
(foot thuds)

00:11:26.038 --> 00:11:31.381
(tense suspenseful music)
(Loup Garou growling)

00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:35.791
Go away.

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:37.761
Go away, go away!

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:41.869
(Loup Garou growling)

00:11:44.943 --> 00:11:47.447
(Loup Garou roars)

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:49.151
Thank goodness.

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:50.855
(Barbarian roaring)

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:52.892
(Barbarian thuds)

00:11:52.992 --> 00:11:54.662
(Lizardman growling)

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:57.769
(Lizardman roaring)

00:11:57.869 --> 00:11:58.971
- Let's move carefully

00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:01.375
and keep our eyes
peeled at all times.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.645
- Sure thing.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:06.118
(monsters roaring)

00:12:06.218 --> 00:12:10.059
Why does a place like this
even exist in the Dungeon?

00:12:11.194 --> 00:12:14.301
- There's a lot we don't
know about the Deep Floors.

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:16.405
I've heard of where monsters

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:17.942
pour endlessly from the walls,

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:19.746
at least in one area.

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:22.618
- Endlessly? Is that possible?

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:23.887
- They aren't around anymore,

00:12:23.987 --> 00:12:25.357
but I'm told that adventurers

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:28.864
from the Zeus and Hera
Familias once reported as much.

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:30.466
They specifically said

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:34.608
it was almost as though the
Dungeon was testing something.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.747
- It's testing?

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:37.981
Testing what?
(monsters roaring)

00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:41.088
Adventurers? Or maybe the
monsters?

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:43.258
(Peluda growls)
(Bell gasps)

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:45.798
(Peluda roaring)

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:47.233
(ground crashing)

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:51.442
(Bell yells)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:12:51.543 --> 00:12:53.580
(Ryu gasps)

00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:56.552
(Bell grunting)

00:12:57.888 --> 00:12:59.692
(Bell thuds and grunts)

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:03.132
(monsters growling)

00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:04.836
(both grunting)

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:08.142
(monsters roaring)

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:09.846
(dramatic suspenseful music
continues)

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:11.214
- Let's go!

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:22.103
(both panting)
(tense suspenseful music)

00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:24.141
(monsters growling and howling)

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:27.481
(Bell panting)

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:30.854
(monsters howling)

00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.227
(Bell panting)

00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.636
(Bell yells)

00:13:38.737 --> 00:13:39.505
(weapon clanks)

00:13:39.606 --> 00:13:40.942
(Bell grunting)

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:42.177
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:43.279
(Bell grunts)

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.984
(Spartoi chittering)
(Bell grunts)

00:13:46.084 --> 00:13:47.788
- We shouldn't try
to face them head on!

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.192
Focus on securing
a path forward!

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.236
(Ryu groans and thuds)

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:56.405
- Miss Ryu!

00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:00.815
(Bell grunts)

00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:02.483
(Barbarian roars)

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:03.586
Fire bolt!

00:14:10.634 --> 00:14:12.739
(monsters howling)

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.276
(Ryu grunts)

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:16.244
(Bell grunts)

00:14:16.344 --> 00:14:17.346
Fire bolt!

00:14:18.617 --> 00:14:20.086
(explosion booming)

00:14:20.186 --> 00:14:25.229
(dramatic suspenseful
music continues)

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.102
(Bell and Ryu grunting)

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:30.974
(monsters growling)

00:14:31.074 --> 00:14:33.279
(monsters thudding)

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.184
(Bell panting)

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:40.393
It's no use.

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:42.230
(Bell grunts)

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.835
No matter how many we kill,
they just keep coming!

00:14:44.935 --> 00:14:46.906
(Ryu yelling and grunting)

00:14:47.006 --> 00:14:48.409
(monster shattering)

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.448
If we don't do something,
they're going to overwhelm us!

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.388
We might be able to cross the
bridge and get to the exit.

00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:57.393
But what happens if they
end up following us?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.866
(Bell groans)

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:01.636
No, not yet.

00:15:01.736 --> 00:15:03.640
(footsteps tapping)

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.409
Not yet. Not yet.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.292
(Bell grunting)

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:17.433
(dagger clanking)

00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:19.939
(Bell yells)

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:21.308
(tense suspenseful music)

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:24.214
(Bell panting)

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:25.884
Almost there.

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:29.993
(monsters growling)

00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:31.963
It's coming from
outside the Colosseum?

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:34.467
Ugh, seriously?

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:38.510
- [Ryu] Mr. Cranel,
head for the bridge.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.712
- Huh?

00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:41.983
- Finish off the
enemies up ahead.

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:45.156
I'll use my magic and take
care of anything behind us.

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:47.160
- But don't you think I
should be the one who-

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.266
- Now in the skies of
the distant forest

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:54.675
to the infinite stars mounted on
the eternal firmament of night.

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:56.045
(Bell grunts)

00:15:56.145 --> 00:15:57.648
- I'll be right back, okay?

00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:59.384
(dramatic music)

00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:02.323
(Bell grunting)

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.634
(Bell yelling)

00:16:09.605 --> 00:16:10.774
- This fool doth entreat,

00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:14.280
just once for the divine
protection of the stars' fire.

00:16:14.381 --> 00:16:17.888
Grant thy benevolent light to
the one who abandoned thee.

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:22.030
(dramatic music continues)

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.502
(explosion booming)

00:16:24.602 --> 00:16:28.008
(monsters roaring)

00:16:28.108 --> 00:16:30.179
- Miss Ryu is incredible.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:31.716
So long as I'm with her,
(Loup Garou growling)

00:16:31.816 --> 00:16:33.553
I know we can survive anything.

00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:36.491
(Bell grunting)

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.295
(Bell groans)

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:42.103
(monsters howling)
Huh?

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:48.348
What are you doing?

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:52.490
What is that?

00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:54.895
- Let the light of stardust
occupy me.

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:56.700
Strike my enemy.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.604
- Miss Ryu!

00:16:58.704 --> 00:17:02.443
- I call you Luminous Wind.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:07.420
(Bell grunting)

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:14.334
(Bell yelling)

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:19.612
(ground crashing)

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.119
(Bell thuds and groans)

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:25.791
(Bell groaning)
(rocks thudding)

00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:27.159
- Miss Ryu!

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:32.537
(Bell gasps)

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:35.543
But I don't understand.

00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:39.084
Why are you doing this?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:42.057
(pensive music)
- This is for the best.

00:17:42.157 --> 00:17:44.695
- Is she trying to save me?

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.199
No. No.

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.672
Miss Ryu! Miss Ryu!

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:52.945
- Now go on.

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:56.519
- Miss Ryu! You can't do this!

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.896
(Bell grunting)
(melancholic music)

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:04.868
(Bell shouting)

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:09.645
- Good.

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:13.586
I've armed him with as much
knowledge as I possibly can.

00:18:14.955 --> 00:18:17.293
So even without me, he...

00:18:17.393 --> 00:18:20.734
No, once I'm no longer a burden
to him,

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:23.773
he should be able to
escape the Deep Floors.

00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:29.217
You will mourn my
decision, no doubt.

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:32.056
Be that as it may,

00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:35.630
you deserve to live, more so
than I.

00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:42.811
(swords clanking)

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.049
(Ryu thuds)

00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:47.486
After all the things I've done,

00:18:47.587 --> 00:18:50.593
there's no point in
defending myself anymore.

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:55.504
(Ryu grunts)

00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:58.375
But I refuse to go
down without a fight.

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:01.248
Besides, I'd be too ashamed

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:03.151
to face Alise and the others

00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:06.358
if I didn't struggle
until my very last breath.

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:09.865
(footsteps thudding)

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:13.874
(Ryu grunting)

00:19:13.974 --> 00:19:15.877
(sword shattering)

00:19:15.977 --> 00:19:21.287
So this is to be my grave.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:23.727
(Ryu grunts)
(sword clanks)

00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:25.029
(coat fluttering)

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:26.031
(Ryu thuds)

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:28.268
(Ryu groans)

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:30.940
I'm going to die a
plaything for beasts,

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.913
with neither a corpse nor
a shred of my Elven pride

00:19:34.014 --> 00:19:35.215
to show for it.

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:38.723
(Ryu groaning)

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:42.864
But you know what?

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.505
That's fine with me

00:19:46.605 --> 00:19:49.712
because I was able to save him.

00:19:49.812 --> 00:19:53.318
(Ryu thuds and groans)

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:59.297
Forgive me, Syr. Sorry, guys.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:03.405
I'm squandering the
life you gave me.

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:06.812
Alise, please...

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:17.868
Pass your judgment upon me.

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:22.077
(explosion booming)

00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:22.945
(Ryu grunts)

00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:26.384
(explosion booming)

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:31.328
What was that?

00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:35.570
- Get ready!
(dramatic music)

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.743
(Bell grunts)

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:39.812
(Bell thuds and grunts)

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:40.848
- But how?

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:41.750
How did he?

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.986
Huh? He couldn't have!

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:47.928
And while the right-hand side
is connected to the maze...

00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:49.765
He went all the way around

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:51.669
to come and rescue me?
(Bell thuds and grunts)

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:52.605
(Bell yells)

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:55.276
You idiot! Why
would you do that?

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.881
We both cannot escape
from this place!

00:20:57.981 --> 00:20:59.350
There's still time left!

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.854
Turn around and run!

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:01.956
(Bell panting)

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:02.991
(Bell grunts)

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:04.996
Save yourself! Just leave me!

00:21:05.096 --> 00:21:07.233
Don't do this!
It's not worth it!

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:08.402
(Bell grunts)

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:11.474
(Bell yelling)

00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:16.017
All I ever wanted was

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:18.455
for you to make it
out of here alive.

00:21:18.556 --> 00:21:22.063
Why'd you come back?

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:24.768
(Ryu gasps)

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.672
Is that...

00:21:28.475 --> 00:21:31.248
(Bell panting)

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.387
(Bell yelling)

00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:38.361
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:21:38.462 --> 00:21:39.998
- Miss Ryu, go!

00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:47.379
- All right, but what if someone
makes their ideals reality?

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.687
- Oh, you know that already.

00:21:50.787 --> 00:21:52.824
There's a special name for them.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.697
We call people who do that

00:21:56.666 --> 00:21:57.233
heroes.

00:21:57.334 --> 00:22:00.641
(both grunting)

00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:01.876
- Fire bolt!

00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:11.528
(explosion booming)

00:22:15.402 --> 00:22:18.041
(Ending Song)

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:49.223
- [Ryu] Next time:
"Astrea Familia."
