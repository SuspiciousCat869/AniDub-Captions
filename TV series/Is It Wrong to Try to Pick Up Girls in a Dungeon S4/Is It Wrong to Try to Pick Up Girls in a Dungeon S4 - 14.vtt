00:00:01.202 --> 00:00:03.674
(serene music)

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:05.812
- Hey, I didn't catch your name.

00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:07.180
What was it again?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.730
- Hmm?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.065
Ryu.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:17.569
Ryu Lion.

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:18.470
- Ryu?

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:20.775
That's kind of hard to
pronounce.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:23.581
- Hmm.

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:28.725
Okay then, from now on,
I think I'll call you Lion.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:30.327
Okie dokey?

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.403
(giggling)

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:39.445
(Opening Song)

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.222
- [Ryu Voiceover] Just
hold out for five minutes.

00:02:24.322 --> 00:02:26.727
If I don't give Mr. Cranel
a break now,

00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:28.697
he's going to fall apart.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:33.775
The walls are just beginning
to repair themselves,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.180
which means monsters
shouldn't spawn for a while.

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:43.326
Futaba is my only weapon, and
given the state of my leg,

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:45.698
I'm not sure how
well I can fight.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:54.950
As long as we manage to
escape the Deep Floors,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.656
he's got a decent
chance of survival.

00:02:57.756 --> 00:03:01.395
So until we reach the
tunnel to the 36th floor,

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:06.238
I must keep him alive,
no matter the cost.

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:10.380
(mysterious rattling)

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:13.987
(ominous music)

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.803
Can't move fast enough.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.479
(blade swishing)

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.265
(creature chomping)

00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:42.344
(blood spattering)

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.769
(grunting)

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.648
(blade swishing)

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:08.865
- That's it.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:10.467
That was five minutes.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.607
- Please forgive me.

00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:15.911
I guess I was a lousy lookout.

00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.149
- It's okay.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.586
Don't you worry.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.770
It's your turn to get
some sleep, Miss Ryu.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:33.213
- Thank you, Mr. Cranel.

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:36.318
I think that
I've reached my limit.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:40.895
- Lion, are you listening to me?

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.070
Your captain is giving
you important information,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.474
and you're staring
off into space.

00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:51.048
You've got some
nerve there, missy.

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:57.762
- Apologies, Alise, I shouldn't
have gotten distracted.

00:04:57.862 --> 00:04:58.897
I'm sorry.

00:05:01.136 --> 00:05:02.638
- I can let it slide.

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:05.845
- Oh, I see.

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.414
I'm dreaming.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.721
My memories of five years ago,

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:15.932
of the Astrea Familia.

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.505
(pensive flute music)

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:24.983
(intense orchestral music)

00:05:25.084 --> 00:05:27.254
- But I thought,

00:05:27.354 --> 00:05:29.893
because we held out for so long,

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:32.532
we could escape being
consumed by despair.

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.804
(monster roaring)

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:40.113
- [Lili] Cassandra, look out!

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:49.566
- [Cassandra Voiceover]
Haruhime!

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:56.813
- Haruhime!

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:05.831
- This can't really be the end.

00:06:11.843 --> 00:06:13.145
- Mikoto!

00:06:13.747 --> 00:06:15.618
Haruhime!

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:24.067
If it's the last thing I
ever do, you're gonna pay.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:26.840
- I am gonna rip your head off,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.877
you piece of shit!

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:34.054
(both shouting)

00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:35.891
- Hold on, wait!

00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:39.932
I said wait, damn it!

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:42.104
- We have to help them.

00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:43.840
- Shit.

00:06:44.643 --> 00:06:47.782
(flames roaring)

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.453

- [Daphne] Need some ground.

00:07:04.148 --> 00:07:05.450
- I got it.

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.757

(water bubbling)

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:53.045

(shouting)

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:03.567
- Big Guy, no!

(ice shattering)

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:11.115
Get up!

00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:15.858
(monster roaring)

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:29.752

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:35.698
Hang on!

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:37.133
- Come on, blacksmith,

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:38.971
let's go!

It'll be fine.

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:44.281
Just shoot!

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.657
- Shut up, you're not my boss.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:51.696
I'm trusting you on this one.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.267
Hiya!

- [Mikoto Voiceover] God of
strength.

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:21.089
Bringer of destruction.

00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:23.159
I humbly beseech thee.

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:27.601
Grant me guidance
from the heavens.

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:30.306
Fill my meager body

and sacred power.

blade of righteousness.

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:47.975
Swing true, O vanquishing sword.

miraculous, steely punishment.

00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:55.757
Here and now,

Mikoto!

00:10:02.337 --> 00:10:06.378
- Descend from the heavens,
and take hold of the earth.

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:09.351
Conquest of the gods!

00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:12.357

- My whole body feels
like it's on fire.

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:30.714
I don't care.
Let it burn away.

00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:34.087
As long as my song reaches
their ears from the ashes.

00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:39.097
Bless the vessel
with thine power.

A tower of riches
for a tower of wishes!

We beat a floor boss
all on our own.

- Nice work everyone,

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:14.909
but we're not out of
the woods just yet.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.581

- Look at this.

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:24.461
Amphisbaena dropped an item,

a super rare dragon liver.

Those dumbasses.

00:15:14.328 --> 00:15:16.465
- This isn't what
we agreed on, Jura.

Why didn't you mention
any of this shit, huh?

We're still in the
middle of my premonition.

The cage of despair
shall become a coffin,

00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:53.239
The life-giving sun?

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:55.844
What am I supposed
to do with that?

00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:58.449
I don't know. I don't know...

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.919
- Lady Aisha!

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:01.856
Master Bell's still down there.

00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:02.992
- Don't you get it yet?

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:03.894
Take a look around.

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:04.895
We gotta go.

00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:07.200
- [Lili] I know, but look.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.370
It's the tunnel
to the 26th floor.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.376
All those tremors must have
unblocked the entrance.

00:16:12.476 --> 00:16:13.312
- Hold on.

00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:15.116
You really want us to go in
there?

00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:18.355
- What happens if more
falls down and traps us?

00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:19.992
- I agree with Li'l Bit here.

00:16:20.093 --> 00:16:22.063
We can't leave until
we rescue Bell.

00:16:22.163 --> 00:16:23.866
- [Aisha] Have you
lost your damn mind?

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:26.672
Haruhime and Mikoto
can't even walk.

00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:28.776
- Miss Aisha.

00:16:29.913 --> 00:16:31.616
Don't worry about me.

00:16:31.717 --> 00:16:33.285
Please find him.

00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:35.123
- Not you too.

00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:37.695
- We don't have time to
argue the pros and cons.

00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:38.930
We'll figure it out.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.801
But after we've had
a chance to regroup.

00:16:40.901 --> 00:16:42.905
We have got to get up there
right now.

00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:46.545
- No, we need to move east.

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:47.380
- [Daphne] What?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.984
- [Cassandra] We need to head

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:50.086
down to 26, quickly.

00:16:50.186 --> 00:16:51.254
- [Daphne] Cassandra, what

00:16:51.354 --> 00:16:52.758
the hell are you talking about?

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:54.528
- Trust me this time, Daphne.

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:56.264
I see it now.

00:16:56.364 --> 00:16:57.200
I've been getting it wrong

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.171
this whole time.
- Huh?

00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:01.207
- The life-giving sun.

00:17:01.307 --> 00:17:04.648
When the sun vanishes, it
reappears as the sunrise.

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:07.921
So the life-giving sun was
referring to a direction.

00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:10.561
It was never a person
or a time of day.

00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:12.163
In order to avoid death,

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.769
we have to follow the
life-giving sun,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:15.638
to the east.

00:17:15.738 --> 00:17:16.540
I'm not sure what the

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.173
rest of the prophecy's

00:17:17.273 --> 00:17:18.409
supposed to mean.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.248
Well, not yet anyway, but I do
know this.

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:22.918
We have to go east.

00:17:23.018 --> 00:17:24.321
Now come on, let's head to the

00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:26.559
26th floor.
- Stop it!

00:17:27.928 --> 00:17:29.230
Enough is enough.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.499
We're in the middle of a crisis

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.072
and you're still talking
nonsense.

00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:35.878
- But in my vision,
- To hell with your vision.

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:38.616
Our lives are at stake here, you
know.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:39.985
I say we go up.

00:17:40.085 --> 00:17:43.058
We should climb our way
up to the 24th floor.

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:44.562
Considering all of the risks,

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:47.333
it's the only logical option
we've got.

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.471
- Get ready to move.

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:52.511
- [Chigusa] Here,
let me help you.

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:56.084
- How many times have I
felt weak and powerless?

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:58.957
Daphne's always doubted
my premonitions.

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:01.028
She's never once believed me.

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:04.267
But I must do something.

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.806
- Listen to me, Daphne.

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.812
I was constantly running away.

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.916
I was being controlled by fear.

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:13.152
I was in pain.

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:14.956
It was like torture.

00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:16.726
Nobody ever believed me.

00:18:16.826 --> 00:18:17.995
No one ever seemed to care,

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:20.266
and I didn't want
to get hurt anymore,

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.403
but I, I can't stand here

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:24.842
and watch my friends die.

00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:26.377
If I run away now,

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:30.086
Daphne, I will lose any reason
I ever had to go on living.

00:18:30.186 --> 00:18:33.527
(ground rumbling)

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:35.029
- Above us, look!

00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:38.135
(ice breaking)

00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:41.174
- [Daphne] Cassandra!

00:18:41.274 --> 00:18:44.280
(ice crashing)

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:54.702
(suspenseful music)

00:18:57.373 --> 00:19:00.914
- If ever there was a time
to listen to me, it's now.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:02.951
So please,

00:19:03.052 --> 00:19:04.154
please, Daphne.

00:19:04.254 --> 00:19:06.358
Just trust me this once.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.932
- Cassandra,

00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:12.738
no one believes any of your
nonsense.

00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:17.013
Change of plans.

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:18.215
We go east.

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:20.820
Head for the tunnel
to the 26th floor.

00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:29.839
- Come on.

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:31.175
What the hell are you doing?

00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:32.845
- You said it was dangerous.

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:33.946
What happened?

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:35.650
- I don't trust your

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.719
ridiculous visions,

00:19:36.819 --> 00:19:38.155
or whatever you call them,

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:40.226
but there's one thing I do
trust,

00:19:40.326 --> 00:19:42.798
and that is you, Cassandra
Ilion.

00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:47.874
(both panting)

00:19:48.543 --> 00:19:50.479
- We should get going too.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.148
- Roger.

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:52.016
Hey, wait up.

00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:53.152
No, hold on.

00:19:53.252 --> 00:19:55.289
- [Mikoto] We should
go with them.

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:58.563
I would also like to
help Master Bell.

00:19:58.663 --> 00:19:59.665
- Mikoto?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:03.740
All right then, let's move.

00:20:04.809 --> 00:20:05.844
- Oh, shit.

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:08.348
Fine, but this is on you.

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:21.007
(rocks crashing)

00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:26.317
(Turk and allies yelling)

00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:32.764
Forget about them.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:33.600
Let's go.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.408
(emotional orchestral music)

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.707
(Ouka shouting)

00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:54.875
Go, go, go!

00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:01.321
(branch crashing)

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:11.742
(branches creaking)

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.021
(branch crashing)

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:25.202
- If we had tried to go
back up to the 24th floor,

00:21:25.302 --> 00:21:26.906
then we would've been trapped.

00:21:27.006 --> 00:21:27.774
Or worse.

00:21:27.874 --> 00:21:29.678
- Close call, guys.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:31.281
- I'd rather not think about it.

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:32.551
- Thanks Cassandra.

00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:34.688
You saved all our lives.

00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:36.324
- Oh, Daphne!

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:38.997
I cannot thank you enough
for believing in me.

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.433
- Knock it off, already.
- You're my best friend ever.

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.538
- You're squishing me.
- Just the best!

00:21:42.638 --> 00:21:44.374
- Okay, then,
we've come this far.

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:48.215
There's no turning back
until we track down Bell.

00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:49.718
- [All] Yeah!

00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:24.020
(Ending Song)

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:47.921
- [Cassandra] Next time,
"Ignis."
