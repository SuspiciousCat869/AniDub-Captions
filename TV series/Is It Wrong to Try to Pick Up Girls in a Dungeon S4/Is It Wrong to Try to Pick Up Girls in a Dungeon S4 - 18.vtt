WEBVTT

00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:03.473
(footsteps thudding)
(soft music)

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:06.112
(Alise chuckles)

00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:07.782
- Well, well, looks like you two

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.453
were really going
at it yet again.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.160
So?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.165
Was it Kaguya who got
under your skin this time?

00:00:17.034 --> 00:00:19.238
- I just cannot accept it.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.446
Even if we were to assume that
what Kaguya says is correct,

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:27.087
acting like sacrifices are a
foregone conclusion is wrong.

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:28.925
(Alise chuckles)

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:30.294
(Alise laughs)

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:31.395
- Huh?

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:32.999
Ah.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.136
- Don't let it get to you, okay?

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:42.051
(Ryu sighs)

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.590
- All right, Alise,
what's your take on it?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.328
- I am partial to your
way of thinking, Lion.

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:49.198
Making sure everyone survives.

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:51.637
What could be a happier ending
than that?

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:52.739
- Huh?

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.647
- However, not sure it's a
possibility.

00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:57.849
- [Ryu] Huh?

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.318
- I mean, not everything
will work out

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:01.590
just because you're
chasing after an ideal.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.028
Even I agree with that.

00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:06.332
Honestly, there's no right
answer.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.969
What matters is how much effort

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.577
you've put into
achieving your dreams.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:14.949
And then, after you ultimately
fall short of your ideals,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.254
what you've managed
to leave behind.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.293
(Alise chuckles)

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:24.202
Even a person as
forthright, virtuous, wise,

00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:27.307
and perfect as I am can't
argue with that fact.

00:01:27.876 --> 00:01:28.878
You get it now?

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:30.614
That's just how things are.

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.086
- Ah?

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.523
- Even with that being said,

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:37.027
ideals are important
to have and uphold,

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:38.798
because if we didn't
strive for them,

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.171
we would end up obtaining less
from the compromises we make.

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:44.075
So that can at least be your
reasoning.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:45.477
A purpose, anyway.

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:47.215
- All right, but what if someone

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.619
makes their ideals reality?

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.026
- Oh, you know that already.

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.497
There's a special name for them.

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.302
We call people who
do that heroes.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:02.210
(Opening Song)

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:35.330
(dark ominous music)

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.635
(Haruhime grunts)
(Voltimeria growls)

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:40.273
(Rido grunts)

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:45.250
(monsters growling)
(bones cracking)

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.656
(Troll growls)
(Rido grunts)

00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:49.993
- I don't understand
what's happening.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:52.799
- [Wiene] Haruhime.
- Ah!

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.103
- We came to rescue you!

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:57.274
- Lady Wiene, is that you?

00:03:57.374 --> 00:03:59.077
- [Wiene] Yep!

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:02.250
(Haruhime sobs)

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.257
I've missed you, Haruhime.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:06.225
- [Haruhime] Same here!

00:04:06.325 --> 00:04:07.796
Of course!

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:08.697
- Guess what?

00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:09.566
I didn't cry at all.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.135
I held it in this whole time

00:04:11.235 --> 00:04:13.272
because I didn't want
you guys to worry.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.878
(Haruhime sobs)

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:20.354
But now I can't
even help myself.

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:22.057
(Voltimeria growling)

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:23.193
(Laura yells)

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:24.763
(Let yells)

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.265
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:27.735
(Helga growls)

00:04:27.836 --> 00:04:29.438
(fire crackling)

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.110
(sword swooshing)

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.181
(Welf panting)

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:35.250
- You guys...

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.520
(footsteps thudding)

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.622
- Heh.

00:04:39.024 --> 00:04:42.330
(monsters growling)

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.669
- I remember that beast.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:47.576
It was the one we saw on
Daedalus Street.

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:49.311
- Can someone explain this?

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:50.915
- Well, I'm just guessing,

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:53.588
but I can only assume there
are irregulars down here.

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:57.929
Aberations. Beasts that
have mutated over time.

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.831
- Uh...

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.734
(footsteps thudding)

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:01.770
- What the meow?

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.274
This is all throwing
me fur a loop guys!

00:05:04.374 --> 00:05:05.911
(sword clanking)
(monster part thudding)

00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.247
- It's Lady Tsubaki!

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:08.383
You know what that means?

00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:10.821
Goddess Hestia
sent us some help!

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.394
- At least we managed to
find Bell Cranel's friends.

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:17.267
- I'm so purrplexed why
these monsters are fighting.

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.537
(Lili panting)

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:19.973
- We need help
defeating the monsters

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.075
that aren't armed.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:21.944
Please and thanks.

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:23.346
- Huh?

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:25.551
Guess it's no
time to be confused.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:28.456
Tell us what to do and
we'll give you some support.

00:05:28.557 --> 00:05:29.392
(all grunting)

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:30.861
(Voltimeria roars)

00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.197
(Anya shouts)

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:33.199
(Chloe grunts)

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.302
(Lunor yells)

00:05:34.402 --> 00:05:36.205
(ground crashing)

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:37.374
- Oh man.

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:40.147
(Welf laughs)

00:05:40.247 --> 00:05:43.220
(Voltimeria screeching)
(Welf shrieks)

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.523
- There you go, Welfy.

00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:47.394
- Hey, Tsubaki! What
are you doing down here?

00:05:47.494 --> 00:05:49.900
- Ah, a magic sword.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.140
(tense dramatic music)

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.776
Ah...

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:57.915
(Tsubaki laughing)

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:02.591
Well, I'll be damned, you
cocky little green horn.

00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:05.430
I can tell you were going for
something special with that

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.367
which is funny because
you have no idea

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:10.474
how sublime blades forged
by true masters can be.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.311
It's honestly offensive.

00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.417
But I gotta admit.
I kinda love it.

00:06:15.518 --> 00:06:19.258
So congratulations,
Mister Welf Crozzo.

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:21.128
And welcome to hell.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.601
- Hey, glad to be here.

00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:25.337
- I'm in a good mood.

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:28.109
I'll take care of the
rest of them for ya.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.311
- Wait, Tsubaki!

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:30.179
Those monsters are-

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.348
- Yeah, I know!

00:06:31.448 --> 00:06:32.786
They're about to be dead!

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:37.962
(sword clanking)
(Rido grunting)

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:39.331
- [Marie] Rido!

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:41.503
- Hm?
- [Marie] Rido!

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:43.841
- Marie!

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.210
(footsteps thudding)

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.412
What are you doing out here?

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.216
- It's Bell! He needs us!

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:49.084
- Huh?

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:50.053
- He fell!

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:52.024
And went down even lower!

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:53.226
- My man Bell?

00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:54.195
Wait a second, Marie.

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:55.931
You actually saw Bell?

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:57.769
- Mm-hmm!

00:06:57.869 --> 00:07:00.073
(Rido roaring)

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:01.042
- Huh?

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:03.947
(monsters roaring)

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.920
(monsters shouting)
(swords clinking)

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.089
- Ah.
- Ah.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.957
(footsteps thudding)

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:12.197
(monsters shouting)

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.070
(Marie grunts)

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.038
(water splashing)

00:07:16.138 --> 00:07:17.642
- What's their purroblem?

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:20.113
There are still monsters
left to take out!

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:21.348
(Chloe grunts)

00:07:21.448 --> 00:07:22.985
- Oh fur crying out loud!

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:25.423
I can't make heads
or tails of anything.

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:26.893
- What'd Master Rido say?

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:29.632
- Mr. Bell and an Elf
companion were being attacked.

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:31.102
It was by a monster.

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.473
And then both of them were
taken somewhere down below.

00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:34.341
(Lili gasps)

00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:35.377
And it gets worse.

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:36.713
They were also being chased

00:07:36.813 --> 00:07:38.383
by an even larger beast.

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:41.222
- Do you know what
floor Master Bell's on?

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.457
- Afraid not.

00:07:42.558 --> 00:07:44.829
However, they might have gone

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:46.866
as far down as the Deep Floors.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.672
At least Master
Uranus suspects so.

00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:51.910
- The Deep Floors...

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.945
- One last thing.

00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:54.215
Rido has a message.

00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:56.085
"Lily, join us if you want.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.023
We'll carve you a path."

00:07:58.123 --> 00:08:00.427
- Ah!

00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:02.264
(Anya yells)

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:03.433
(Anya sighs)

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:05.003
- All those monsters
are hisstory.

00:08:05.103 --> 00:08:05.671
- [Lili] Anya!

00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:07.140
- Can I help mew?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.877
- What level are you right now?

00:08:08.977 --> 00:08:12.117
- Uh, why is that of any
importance, huh?

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:13.319
Where is Ryu?

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:14.823
- Look, listen up.
(Anya grunts)

00:08:14.923 --> 00:08:16.693
Just answer the damn question!

00:08:16.793 --> 00:08:18.496
- [Anya] Oh fur the love of...

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.035
I'm level four, meokay?

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.974
- What about Lady Chloe
and Lady Lunor?

00:08:24.075 --> 00:08:24.976
- Oh, whatever!

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.649
We're all the exact same level,
jeez!

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.451
- All level four, huh?

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.922
Everybody!

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:33.860
We're leaving the Water
Capital and forging on ahead!

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.666
It's highly likely that both
Master Bell and Lady Ryu

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.671
were dragged down
to a lower floor.

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.610
So we're going to re-form
our party with everyone here

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.047
and then head for
the safety point below.

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:46.753
Then we'll set out to rescue
Master Bell from there!

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:48.256
- Now hold on a minute!

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:51.228
There's no proof Rabbit
Foot was dragged anywhere!

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:53.099
Or even that he's still alive!

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.370
- No objections will
be heard, period!

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.639
- Huh?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.977
You pulled that plan
out of your ass!

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:00.881
There's no way
it's going to work.

00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:03.119
- Odds of success don't matter!

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.823
We must do this.

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:05.924
- Ah...

00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:09.966
- This is kitten pretty
confusing, but...

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:12.404
If you're so sure that
Ryu is on a lower floor,

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:14.341
then we're obviously
gonna go with mew!

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:17.147
- Hold on, I heard the dungeon
is supposed to get harder

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:18.650
the deeper we go, right?

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.588
I'm tired enough as it is.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:21.957
- It's not worth coopurrating

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:24.361
if we don't get some
kind of bonus out of it.

00:09:24.461 --> 00:09:26.900
(Tsubaki laughing)
- Ah, why not?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.937
We're all in the same boat!
(Bors grunts)

00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:31.375
- There's no way in hell
I'm tagging along with you.

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:32.578
(Bors groans)
- Just where do you think

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:34.649
you're going, you coward?

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:35.851
We're gonna work your ass off

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.588
until you're too
exhausted to move.

00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:40.427
- Ugh! Gimme a friggin' break!

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.632
- Those monsters with weapons,

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:45.370
I get the feeling they
were here to save us.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.708
- I have no clue
what's going on.

00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:50.581
You better have a good
explanation, blacksmith.

00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:51.716
- Might be tough.

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:53.353
Not sure I know how to explain

00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:54.589
this very well myself.

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:55.891
- Ugh.

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:57.394
- Hm.

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:59.464
Come on, Daphne. Let's go.

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:00.601
(Daphne grunts)

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.972
- Oh, whatever.
Dammit I'm going!

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:06.245
It wouldn't make sense to
give up at this point anyway.

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:12.223
- Come on, Haruhime. We gotta
save Bell.

00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:14.361
- As you say, Lady Wiene!

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:17.400
(dramatic music)

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:26.720
- Let's move!

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.293
(Loup Garou growling)

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.370
(Bell grunts)

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.240
(Loup Garou growling)

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.310
(Bell grunting)

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.981
(Loup Garou growling)

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:43.219
(Bell shouting)
(tense music)

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.221
(Loup Garou thudding)

00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.725
(Bell grunts)

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:47.428
- [Ryu] After everything
we've been through,

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:49.064
he still keeps going.

00:10:49.164 --> 00:10:51.201
He's improving little by little.

00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.471
(monster part squelching)

00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:53.840
No...

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.309
By leaps and bounds.

00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:59.952
- [Bell] Miss Ryu gave
me a lot of good advice.

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:02.390
Use the surroundings
to my advantage.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.827
Keep my right arm steady.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:05.798
Pay attention to the
enemy's movements

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.401
(Loup Garou growling)
and predict them.

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:11.108
(Bell grunting)
(sword clinking)

00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:14.080
(Bell grunting)

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:18.156
Miss Ais once told me,

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:20.861
"Landing the final blow
is just a step away

00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:22.831
from one's own demise."

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:24.669
(Loup Garou roaring)

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.841
(Bell grunting)

00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:32.050
(Bell yelling)

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.921
- [Ryu] He can see
right through them.

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:35.824
- [Bell] While I'm weak,
I bait the monsters

00:11:35.925 --> 00:11:39.198
into trying to land their final
strike, then take 'em out.

00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:41.402
The advice I got from
Miss Ryu and Miss Ais

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:42.706
are directly connected.

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:44.140
(Loup Garou growling)

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.146
- He knows that death awaits
unless he gets stronger.

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:49.586
Is it the extreme pressure

00:11:49.686 --> 00:11:51.088
of being in the Deep Floors

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:53.794
that's actually pushing
him to new heights?

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:55.163
(Lizardmen growling)

00:11:55.263 --> 00:11:55.831
Ah!

00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:01.275
(Lizardmen growling)

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:05.350
- You doing okay?

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.822
- Stay focused on the
enemy in front of you.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:10.460
Getting distracted will
cost you your life.

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:11.863
- Right!

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:16.338
(Lizardmen hissing and growling)

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:22.284
(light music)

00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:25.457
- I cannot afford to
be a hindrance to him.

00:12:25.558 --> 00:12:27.761
I'll also have to fight.

00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:31.503
(Bell yelling)
(Loup Garou growling)

00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:33.406
(uplifting music)

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:37.280
(Lizardmen growling)

00:12:37.381 --> 00:12:40.287
(sword clinking)

00:12:40.387 --> 00:12:41.923
(Ryu grunts)

00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:46.198
Kaguya, I'm borrowing one of
your moves.

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:49.204
(sword clinking)

00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:53.948
I'm sure that Kaguya would
laugh if she saw me now.

00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:56.352
But I'll do whatever it
takes to buy more time.

00:12:56.452 --> 00:12:59.892
Just long enough for Mr.
Cranel to finish up his fight!

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.529
(Ryu grunts)

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.867
(wall crashing)
(Barbarian growling)

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.202
A Barbarian!

00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:07.608
(Barbarian roaring)
(spirited pulsating music)

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:10.814
(ground crashing)

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:12.818
(Ryu groaning)

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:13.987
(wall crashing)

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:15.256
Ah.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.469
(Barbarian growling)

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.172
(Ryu thudding and groaning)

00:13:23.272 --> 00:13:24.474
(sword clinks)

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:27.447
(footsteps thudding)

00:13:27.548 --> 00:13:29.819
(Ryu grunting)

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.457
(Barbarian growling)

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.895
(Bell yells)

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:36.566
(Bell grunting)

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:37.701
(Ryu gasps)

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:39.772
(Bell yelling)
(Lizardmen growling)

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:40.874
(Bell grunts)

00:13:40.974 --> 00:13:44.013
(Barbarian roaring)

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:48.890
(Bell grunting)
(Barbarian growling)

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.628
(Bell grunts)
(Bell panting)

00:13:50.728 --> 00:13:52.665
(sword whooshes)
(Barbarians groaning)

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:54.736
(Lizardmen screeching)

00:13:54.836 --> 00:14:00.146
(monsters thudding)
(tense dramatic music)

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:03.620
Above you!

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.060
(Lizardman roaring)

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:12.103
(sword clanking)

00:14:12.203 --> 00:14:14.709
I think we should rest for now.

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.447
(Bell sighs)

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:20.119
- [Bell] Juggernaut?

00:14:20.219 --> 00:14:22.792
So that's the name
of that monster?

00:14:22.892 --> 00:14:25.564
- Yes. That's what
I heard anyway.

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.771
Although I didn't learn that
until everything was over.

00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:32.276
It was shortly after
Syr had saved my life.

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:33.746
All of a sudden,

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:36.653
this mysterious
figure spoke to me.

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:39.024
I believe it was a mage.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:41.394
- [Bell] I'm guessing
that was Mr. Fels.

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.499
(rain pattering)

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.404
(somber music)

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:54.154
- Gale Wind.
- Huh?

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.001
- [Fels] All information
related to the Juggernaut

00:15:01.102 --> 00:15:03.673
must be kept strictly
confidential.

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:07.915
Follow these terms and we are
willing to leave you alone.

00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:10.186
Out of respect for your
praiseworthy service

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:12.992
as a member of the
Astraea Familia,

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:15.196
you shall not be held
accountable.

00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:18.703
(rain pattering)

00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:29.158
- Assuming that mage was part
of the Guild's private army,

00:15:29.258 --> 00:15:31.262
it means that the Guild
was at least aware

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:33.166
of that monster's existence.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.470
That's safe to assume.

00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:37.273
- The Juggernaut, huh?

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:47.294
Okay, so, uh, can you
tell me what happened?

00:15:47.394 --> 00:15:49.297
With you and the Juggernaut?

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:58.148
- Mr. Cranel.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.854
We have company.
(Bell grunts)

00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:06.331
(Skull Sheep growling)
(slow tense music)

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.941
(Bell sighs)

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:12.845
(ground crashing)
(sinister dramatic music)

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:16.351
(footsteps thudding)

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:42.070
(Juggernaut roaring)
(ground crashing)

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.177
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.668
- Ah!

00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:58.536
(Spartoi clanking)

00:16:58.636 --> 00:16:59.739
You hear that?

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:04.715
Over there.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.087
- [Ryu] Behind us, too.

00:17:07.187 --> 00:17:08.790
(Spartoi growling)

00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:09.692
(both grunting)

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:15.069
(Spartoi growling)

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.521
(Bell grunting)

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.064
(sword clinking)

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:30.466
(Ryu grunting)

00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:34.408
- We can't even aim
for their magic stones

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:36.746
when they're totally on
the defensive like this!

00:17:36.846 --> 00:17:39.919
(monsters growling)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:41.155
- We need to find a way

00:17:41.255 --> 00:17:43.192
to break through these guys and
escape

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:45.129
or we'll be overwhelmed.

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:48.169
A Peluda!

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:50.607
(Peluda growling)

00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:51.676
Look out!

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.780
Its spikes are poisonous!

00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:54.982
(both grunting)

00:17:55.082 --> 00:17:59.558
(dramatic suspenseful music
continues)

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:08.208
(monsters growling)

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.448
(fire crackling)

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.592
(explosion booming)

00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:19.832
(monsters groaning)

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.548
- Is that the last of them?

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.587
- Took out the ones
closest to us, at least.

00:18:30.687 --> 00:18:33.125
(Bell groans)

00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:34.494
Huh... Huh?

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:39.137
(Peluda growling)

00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:41.609
(Peluda thudding)

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.678
(Bell groaning)

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:43.780
Mr. Cranel!

00:18:44.348 --> 00:18:47.420
(Bell groaning)

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:54.234
(Bell breathing heavily
and groaning)

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:57.239
(Bell grunts)

00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:00.880
(Bell panting)

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:03.385
(Bell groans)

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:04.054
Huh?

00:19:04.154 --> 00:19:06.291
(Bell yelling)

00:19:06.391 --> 00:19:10.265
(Bell breathing heavily)

00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:14.608
(Bell groaning)

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:18.081
No way.

00:19:18.182 --> 00:19:22.958
(Bell groaning and
breathing heavily)

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:30.540
(Bell panting)

00:19:32.545 --> 00:19:34.848
Is that what I think it is?

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:39.257
- Yeah, it's a Unicorn Horn.

00:19:39.357 --> 00:19:41.161
- That item's the single most
effective

00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:43.198
at counteracting poison.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.169
I can't believe that someone

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:46.806
made a weapon from it.

00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:50.847
- [Bell] Welf's knife
just saved me.

00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:51.683
- [Ryu] Mr. Cranel.

00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:52.518
- Ah?

00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:54.454
- Let's get you patched up.

00:19:58.028 --> 00:20:00.834
(gentle music)

00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:05.309
There goes the last
potion we had on hand.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.650
We need to find the normal
route and get out of here fast.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.854
The only option we have
left is this one path

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:13.726
that those adventurers
partially mapped out.

00:20:13.826 --> 00:20:17.400
The problem is, we don't know
what made them turn back.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.372
Was it because they got a
dose of the Peluda's poison?

00:20:20.473 --> 00:20:23.513
(ominous music)

00:20:25.316 --> 00:20:27.153
But they would've been
fighting against the clock

00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:28.657
in that case.

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:31.563
I find it hard to
believe they'd backtrack.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:34.768
In that situation,
I would press on ahead.

00:20:34.868 --> 00:20:38.175
Which means maybe there was
something on the path ahead

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:40.446
that gave them no choice but to
give up.

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:42.852
- What's our next move, Miss
Ryu?

00:20:42.952 --> 00:20:46.157
- We're going to follow the
route written on this map.

00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:49.598
(footsteps tapping)

00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:55.977
(gentle somber music)

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.492
- The path's starting to
become a more uphill climb.

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.830
Is your leg holding up?
Should we rest?

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.634
- Don't worry, it's fine.

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:11.174
This terrain. I recognize it.

00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:14.581
(footsteps tapping)

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:19.658
I don't believe it.

00:21:19.758 --> 00:21:21.862
- What is it? Do
you see something?

00:21:21.962 --> 00:21:25.770
- Actually, I just figured
out exactly where we are.

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:33.252
Let's climb up these stairs.

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:35.455
If we get past the area ahead,

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.360
then we will find
the normal route.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.228
- Are you serious?

00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:39.665
Then let's go.

00:21:40.232 --> 00:21:43.539
(footsteps tapping)

00:21:51.823 --> 00:21:54.261
(Bell gasps)

00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:58.502
(dramatic suspenseful music)

00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:08.689
(monster growling)

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.568
- [Ryu] The Colosseum.

00:22:15.537 --> 00:22:18.509
(Ending Song)

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.956
- [Ryu] Next time, "Colosseum".
