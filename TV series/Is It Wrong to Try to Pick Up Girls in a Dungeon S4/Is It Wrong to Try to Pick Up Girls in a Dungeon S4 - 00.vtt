WEBVTT

00:00:00.835 --> 00:00:03.607
(upbeat music)

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:13.226
- [Bell] This is it!
It's finally time for

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:16.366
Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up
Girls In A Dungeon, Season Four,

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.167
right Goddess?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.571
- [Hestia] Yeah, Woo-Hoo!

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.608
And it's happening thanks
to you viewers in front

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:24.214
of the TV, as well as our
fans from all over the world.

00:00:24.314 --> 00:00:27.254
- [Bell] That's right.
Thank you so much, everybody.

00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:29.258
- [Hestia] Well, there's
one thing that custom

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.298
dictates we do before setting
off on our new adventures.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.134
Do you remember what that is?

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:36.206
- [Bell] Well, yeah,
of course I do.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.377
We have to review
our journey so far,

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:40.782
for all the people out there
who may not have seen it.

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:42.853
And there's a lot,
right Goddess?

00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:45.257
- [Hestia] Yep, exactly, Bell.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:47.294
They need to know about
how we fell deeply

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:50.568
in love with each other!
And hear all about our long,

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:54.409
long tale that would make anyone
cry sweet and sorrowful tears.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.416
- [Bell] Hold on, Goddess,
what are you talking about?

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.354
I don't remember anything
like that happening.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.425
- [Hestia] What? Are you sure?

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:05.899
Okay, fine. Then let's take
a stroll down memory lane,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.769
and show everyone what
kind of journey

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.238
we've been on, shall we?

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:10.842
- [Bell] Just leave it to me!

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:12.211
I came prepared for today,

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.048
by reviewing all the
records of our adventure.

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:15.618
- [Hestia] I'm thrilled
that you've grown

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:17.054
to be so dependable.

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:19.592
Brings a tear to my eye.
Oh, yeah!

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:22.431
And we'll give you a preview
of the new story that's coming

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:25.538
once we reach the end of
this recap. So stay tuned!

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.879
Alright, without further ado,
let's play back our story.

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:34.989
- [Bell] Okay, here we go.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.529
We live in the
Labyrinth city Orario.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:39.766
In addition to
housing the dungeon,

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.606
the city is home to countless
gods and adventurers.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:45.043
It's the most famous
city in the world.

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:46.580
- [Hestia] We gods
and goddesses can give

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.483
our children living
in the lower world a

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:51.924
special type of power.
It's called a blessing.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.961
- [Bell] That's what it's
called when you etch a status

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.800
onto someone's back.
Once they have that,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.838
they can become an adventurer
and fight monsters.

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.877
- [Hestia] Yep. And then the
God who gave the blessing,

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:05.951
and the adventurer who received
it, form a Familia just

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:07.956
like me and my love, Bell, here.

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.528
- [Bell] And what adventurers
strive to explore, is the

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.966
giant maze located
beneath the city,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.369
where monsters are born.

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.707
That's known as the
dungeon. It's in the title.

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:19.345
- [Hestia] Sure, it's
incredibly dangerous down there,

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:22.251
but it's practically
crawling with opportunities

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.589
for people to make money
and get famous.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.393
- [Bell] That's why people
from all around the world,

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:28.396
who wanna become adventurers,
flock to the city.

00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:31.169
- [Hestia] And you were one
of them too, weren't you Bell?

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.939
- [Bell] I've always
admired heroes like the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.943
ones you read about
in story books.

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:38.483
Also, my dear grandpa said
something that stuck with me.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:41.423
- [Grandpa] Bell, a
promising young adventurer

00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:45.064
like you needs to
find love in a dungeon.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.067
- [Bell] At first,
I wasn't sure something

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.140
like that could
really happen, but...

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.579
(roaring)

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.547
(blade slice)

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:55.818
(gasping)

00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:58.456
(dying groan)

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:03.901
- You there?

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:06.940
Are you all right?

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:13.019
- [Bell] A girl
saved me back then.

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.490
Her name is Miss Ais
Wallenstein.

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:18.229
She's a level five who's
part of the largest Familia

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.333
in the city, the Loki Familia.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.739
She's also nicknamed
the Sword Princess.

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.576
She's strong, and cool,

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.847
and I'm going to catch
up to her one day.

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:27.982
- [Eina] What in the world makes

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:29.218
you think you're
ready for seven?!

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:31.356
How insane could
you possibly be?

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:33.961
- I wanted to go exploring
further down in the dungeon,

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.300
but I got yelled at by my
guild advisor, Miss Eina.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.974
She said I had to form
a party, otherwise I was

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.275
stuck on the surface.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.446
But then that's when I
happened to meet Lili.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:46.686
- A very good day to you, sir.
Sorry to bother you,

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:49.559
but would you happen to be in
the market for a supporter?

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.666
- [Bell] Liliruca Ard, a
member of the Soma Familia,

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.605
and a level one. Lili
had been pushed around

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:57.341
and taken advantage
of by adventurers

00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:00.480
for so long that she
came to despise them.

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.417
In order to guarantee
her freedom,

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:04.690
She needed all the money
she could scrounge up.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.825
She was desperate.

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:09.600
- [Hestia] Aw, poor
Lili. She's had it rough.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.837
Luckily, you went and
saved her from that

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.541
lifestyle, Bell.

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:15.678
- I want to know why!
Why did you come back

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:17.348
and save me when
you know good and well

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.553
you should have left
me to die, Master Bell!

00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:23.292
- Actually, it's because
it was you, Lili.

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:27.167
That's why I wanted to do it.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.637
- [Bell] It's wild.

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:32.177
Even now, I can't imagine
not having Lili in our party.

00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:33.914
She's so important to me.

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:35.585
(groaning)

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:38.489
After reforming my party
with Lili, we headed back

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:41.997
into the dungeon, where I
suddenly encountered a monster.

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.503
The Minotaur. It was terrifying.

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:46.907
I never expected a creature
that powerful to show

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:48.142
up on the ninth floor.

00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:49.813
- [Hestia] Even
looking back on it now,

00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:51.416
it's totally insane.

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:53.955
You were only a level one.
If you think about it,

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:56.125
there's no way you should
have been able to win

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.160
against that thing.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.129
- Are you all right?

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.998
(gasping)

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.167
You did very well,

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.603
but I'll save you now.

00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:04.642
- [Hestia] And yet you
still managed to pull it off.

00:05:05.277 --> 00:05:07.783
- I won't do it.

00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:11.991
I will not let Ais
Wallenstein rescue me anymore!

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:13.493
Never again!

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:15.130
- [Hestia] Amongst
adventurers, there are many

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.571
different levels, but changes
in their status have no effect

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.775
on those levels.
And the only way for them

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.079
to bring their level up
is through adventures.

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:24.148
- [Bell] Exactly.

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:26.754
(yelling)

00:05:26.854 --> 00:05:27.755
- Bell, no!

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:28.624
- He'll be fine.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.061
(fighting)

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.413
(screaming)

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.919
- Fire bolt!

00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:50.366
(explosion)

00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:59.352
- [Hestia] That adventure
definitely made

00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:03.994
you a lot stronger. You
make me so proud, Bell.

00:06:04.094 --> 00:06:07.535
- [Bell] Thank you,
Goddess. That means a lot.

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.005
- [Hestia] And that's how you
managed to

00:06:09.105 --> 00:06:13.012
rank up so quickly. You
became a level two adventurer.

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:15.083
The little rookie Bell Cranel.

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:18.423
The higher your level, the
further down into the dungeon

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.226
you can venture.
But, to do that,

00:06:20.326 --> 00:06:23.567
you've got to have a few more
friends you can count on.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:24.936
- [Bell] Right around
the time I was thinking

00:06:25.036 --> 00:06:27.776
about expanding our
party, I met Welf Crozzo.

00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:32.150
- [Welf] Shop till you drop,
kid. Armor by Welf Crozzo.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.121
(chuckles)

00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.593
- [Hestia] A blacksmith
of the Hephaistos Familia,

00:06:36.693 --> 00:06:39.532
and a level one. You
had admired his work for

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:40.835
quite a while, hadn't you?

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:43.707
- [Bell] Yes, totally.
So I was really happy

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:46.145
that he agreed to make some
special arrangements for me,

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:49.418
and not only that, he
ended up joining our party.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.491
- [Hestia] Good thing
you met him, huh?

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:53.728
- [Bell] With Welf joining us,

00:06:53.828 --> 00:06:55.865
that brought our party
to three people.

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:58.904
We decided to forge on ahead,
into the middle floors.

00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:00.808
- [Hestia] The
monsters were sure to be

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:03.245
different and a lot
stronger than anything you'd

00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:05.183
encountered on the upper floors.

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:07.655
It must have been super scary.

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:09.859
- [Bell] It didn't matter
how much we tried to prepare,

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.598
or how many people we
had in our party,

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:16.472
none of it made a difference
and the dungeon didn't care.

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:18.844
- [Hestia] After you
finally reached the safe zone

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:21.516
on the 18th floor,
known as Under Resort,

00:07:21.616 --> 00:07:25.156
a black Goliath floor
boss came crashing down.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.175
- [Bell] Many adventurers
tried to take it on,

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:37.648
but not a single one of them
could lay a scratch on it.

00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:42.758
- [Bell's Grandpa] Let your
feelings burn like fire,

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:45.898
cry out with all your desire!

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.102
- [Hestia] The skill
that manifested itself in

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:50.006
you is called Argonaut.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.910
Even though it's a
measly little skill,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.983
it really holds its own.
Especially when used

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.089
against an overwhelmingly
powerful enemy.

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:04.503
In other words, a hero shot!

00:08:04.603 --> 00:08:07.173
(screaming)

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:13.820
Bell and the other
adventurers fought side

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:18.496
by side, and eventually took
down the enormous floor boss.

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:21.870
Bell, I must say you were
particularly amazing.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:27.782
- [All] Cheers!

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.553
- [Bell] One day we were
celebrating Welf's rank up

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:31.489
to level two at the tavern.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.858
We started getting
harassed by adventurers

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.765
from the Apollon Familia,
and we sort of wound

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.938
up in a big bar fight.
Not proud of it.

00:08:39.038 --> 00:08:41.577
- [Man] Is he from
the Apollon Familia?

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:44.683
- Little Rookie, don't tell
me that's all you've got.

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.687
- [Hestia] Nobody can blame
you guys for getting into

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:48.857
a fight, because who
could have known this

00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:51.462
was Apollon's carefully
planned trap to get

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:53.634
his hands on my precious
little Bell?!

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:56.205
That jerky-jerk face!
He must pay!

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:03.185
- May I please have this
dance with you? Please?

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:06.159
- I'd love to.

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:08.496
- [Bell] After being invited
to a banquet of the Gods,

00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:10.868
hosted by Master
Apollon, we were met

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:13.707
with a challenge of a war
game between our Familias,

00:09:13.807 --> 00:09:17.080
where the loser must surrender
everything to the winner.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.219
Our Goddess rejected the
idea right then and there.

00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:21.957
However...

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:24.495
(explosion)

00:09:24.596 --> 00:09:25.965
A-are you all right, Goddess?

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.539
- Yeah. That smarmy
bastard! He's totally trying

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.175
to force our hand.

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:33.747
Stop it, you jerks! How
dare you destroy our sweet

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:35.718
little love nest!
- Huh?

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:37.187
- [Hestia] They gave
us such a hard time

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:40.360
that I was ready to blow
my top! So, we made our way

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.632
to the home of
the Apollon Familia.

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:44.435
In preparation for the fight,

00:09:44.536 --> 00:09:46.806
Bell underwent some
special training.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:49.646
Meanwhile, I went to help
little miss supporter get

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:52.483
out of trouble after she
returned to the Soma Familia.

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:55.658
- [Bell] Ultimately Lili, Welf,
and Mikoto all transferred

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.762
to join our Familia.

00:09:57.862 --> 00:10:00.066
Then, with Miss Ryu
acting as our support,

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:03.172
we went into a siege battle
as the attacking side.

00:10:04.543 --> 00:10:06.980
- Ha!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.521
- Conquest of the Gods!

00:10:10.622 --> 00:10:12.892
Futsu no Mitama!

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:17.133
- Thanks for all
your hard work, Lili.

00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:20.007
- Please, you go on ahead.

00:10:20.107 --> 00:10:23.714
I'm going to stir up
a little more trouble.

00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:27.020
- Now I don't care what
Master Apollon wants anymore.

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:28.823
Die you bastard!

00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:32.331
- Landing the final
blow is a step away

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.667
from one's own demise.

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.571
- My best chance
to catch him, the moment

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.273
he thinks he's bested me.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.747
(fighting)

00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:52.370
- Ahh!

00:10:54.942 --> 00:10:56.747
- [Hestia] Thanks to
our genius strategy

00:10:56.847 --> 00:11:00.186
and helpful allies, we
managed to claim victory.

00:11:00.286 --> 00:11:02.992
And with that, Bell
reach level three.

00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:05.363
To top it off, we
scored a new home,

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.771
and a significant amount
of monetary compensation.

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:12.343
And starting today, this
is our Familia's emblem.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.024
(giggle)

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:27.407
- [Welf] No freaking way, here?!

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:30.146
- [Bell] One night we noticed
Mikoto acting strange,

00:11:30.246 --> 00:11:32.652
and decided to follow
her and Chigusa.

00:11:32.752 --> 00:11:35.222
We soon found ourselves
in the pleasure corner.

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.060
- You are new around here,
aren't ya?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.437
Ooh, you seem a little
wound up. (giggles)

00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:44.876
You can call me Aisha.
And you are?

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.980
- [Bell] Things went
sideways and I got

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.950
found by a level three
of the Ishtar familia,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.923
named Aisha, who chased
me all over the place!

00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:55.030
I eventually ran into
a lady named Haruhime,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.635
the childhood friend
who Mikoto and Chigusa

00:11:57.735 --> 00:11:58.503
were searching for.

00:11:58.603 --> 00:11:59.772
- What...

00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:01.776
- Uh!

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:05.951
- What a lovely... collarbone!

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:11.261
- Ah, um... hello?

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.533
- [Hestia] Bell and the others
went down into the dungeon

00:12:13.634 --> 00:12:15.203
to get enough money
to save Haruhime

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:17.574
from the brothel,
but they quickly

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:20.213
got attacked by
the Ishtar Familia.

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:22.652
I know firsthand just
how adorable Bell is,

00:12:22.752 --> 00:12:25.758
but I never thought that Ishtar
would set her sights on him.

00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:28.329
- If you're angry,
you'll have to take it up

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:30.233
with an erratic Goddess!

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.871
(fighting)

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.110
- [Bell] Aisha's group
came after us with

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.515
overwhelming power, and
they ended up capturing

00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:39.418
both me and Mikoto.

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.857
Afterwards, I found
myself getting assaulted

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:44.495
by Phryne, until Haruhime
arrived to save

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:45.865
me in the nick of time.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.169
But that's when I
learned she was fated to

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:51.408
become a sacrifice as
part of a ritual.

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:54.749
She's a part of your Familia!

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:58.423
She's your family! How
are you okay with that?

00:12:58.524 --> 00:13:00.961
- Such a passionate speech.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.334
Are you going to take
her from me?

00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:09.513
I suppose it's war, then.
We'll take out your

00:13:09.613 --> 00:13:12.250
Familia, too.
(gasp)

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.123
- [Hestia] They were looking
to defeat the Freya Familia.

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:16.793
Ishtar planned to use Haruhime

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:19.799
as the sacrifice to
create a powerful item.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.303
Bell wanted to save
Haruhime, but he knew

00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:25.577
that taking action would
drag his friends into a war.

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:27.881
And so as captain
of the Familia,

00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.852
he struggled to make a decision.

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.190
- Miss Mikoto, I'm sorry.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.797
I'm going to save Miss Haruhime.

00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:39.070
- Oh, thank you very much.

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:42.511
It's truly a privilege
to share a

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.983
Familia with you. (crying)

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:47.287
- [Bell] Miss Mikoto and I went
together to try and rescue.

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:48.857
Miss Haruhime.

00:13:49.793 --> 00:13:52.364
- (gasp) What are you doing?

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.537
- Expectations, a ninja's
greatest skill,

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:57.107
the surprise attack.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:58.677
- Don't just stand
there, somebody

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:00.346
get her off of me!

00:14:01.214 --> 00:14:05.256
- Defend me, oh purifying light!

00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:06.760
(explosion)

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.295
- No! Mikoto!

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:11.001
- Hell Kaios!

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:20.386
(shattering)

00:14:23.292 --> 00:14:25.630
(fighting)

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.039
- Fire Bolt!

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:36.919
(explosion)

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.745
- Thanks, in part to
Freya's intervention,

00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:51.516
Ishtar got sent back to heaven,

00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:53.452
and her Familia was dissolved,

00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:56.526
and Haruhime, after being
freed from her fate,

00:14:56.626 --> 00:14:59.197
officially joined our Familia.

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:01.669
- I'm here. I've
come to save you.

00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:06.077
- You are my hero.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:10.186
- Lady Haruhime.

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:13.292
We really did it. I can
hardly believe it.

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:21.242
- [Bell] While adventuring
through the 19th floor

00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:24.181
one day I got separated
from my party.

00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:26.886
Then I came across
a monster girl.

00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:30.226
Her name was Wiene.
Wiene was all alone,

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:32.396
and huddled in fear
after being chased by

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:34.669
both monsters and
adventurers alike.

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:37.340
I quickly found myself
unable to leave her behind

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.578
and ended up taking
her back with me.

00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:42.183
(gasping)

00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:50.232
- The hell is that, Bell?

00:15:52.804 --> 00:15:56.846
- Uh, B-Bell? Your name is Bell?

00:15:56.946 --> 00:16:00.186
- Tell me you heard that. It
just spoke.

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:03.058
- I was honestly shocked!
I had never heard

00:16:03.158 --> 00:16:05.564
of a monster that could
talk until we met her.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.402
Generally, monsters are
considered an absolute

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.742
evil that is waged war
against humanity forever.

00:16:11.842 --> 00:16:13.278
Even for a goddess like myself,

00:16:13.378 --> 00:16:15.784
it's impossible to offer
them salvation.

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:18.990
But Weine seemed so afraid.
I decided we

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.096
would look after her while
we gathered information.

00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:25.904
- So, I take it off! Mmm!

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:27.808
- No, please! You mustn't!

00:16:27.908 --> 00:16:30.379
(chewing)

00:16:31.147 --> 00:16:32.483
(giggling)

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:34.454
- Bell is very warm.

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:36.826
- Heh.

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:38.062
- But Wiene caused
a scene in the

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.868
middle of town and not
long after that,

00:16:40.968 --> 00:16:44.140
somehow word got out
about us keeping her.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.180
That didn't make the guild
very happy and they ordered us

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.351
on a mission to take
the dragon girl down

00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:51.522
to the 20th floor
of the dungeon.

00:16:52.557 --> 00:16:55.029
(yelling)

00:16:57.601 --> 00:17:02.210
- (laughing) Upsy-daisy.
That was great!

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.482
I've never met adventurers
like you guys before.

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:10.260
- [Hestia] That's where you
met other monsters like Wiene,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.398
who were intelligent
and capable of speech.

00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:15.202
They were known as the Xenos and

00:17:15.302 --> 00:17:17.207
Mr. Rido was their leader.

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:19.377
- [Bell] That's right. The
welcome party they threw

00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:21.048
for us at their hidden
village was so

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:23.587
human-like that it really
surprised me.

00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:25.658
They started living like
that after meeting with

00:17:25.758 --> 00:17:28.295
Mr. Fels over 15 years ago.

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.099
They dreamed of one day
reaching an understanding

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:32.337
with humans, so they
could go up to

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:34.241
the surface and live
a normal life.

00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:36.244
- So you see? That's why
we were so stoked

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:39.351
to meet you folks today.
And it's not 'cause we

00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:41.589
expect you to help us
or anything like that.

00:17:41.689 --> 00:17:43.359
Just knowing that there
are surface dwellers

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:45.664
who are willing to
accept us for who we are.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:48.603
Hmm. I'm so glad we met
you and your friends.

00:17:48.703 --> 00:17:49.638
(chuckles)

00:17:49.738 --> 00:17:51.175
- [Hestia] Sadly,
we're still a long way

00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:52.945
from reaching the
point where monsters

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.648
can coexist with humans.

00:17:54.748 --> 00:17:56.886
That's why Bell's party
left Wiene in the care

00:17:56.986 --> 00:17:58.990
of the Xenos, and
made their way back

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.560
home, until...

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.098
- [Eina] Armed monsters
have destroyed the heroes

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:05.369
located on the 18th floor.

00:18:06.372 --> 00:18:08.843
- Mr. Rido, and Wiene.

00:18:10.312 --> 00:18:12.150
The Ganesha Familia
was given a mission

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.920
by the Guild to
subdue the threat,

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.257
and I accompanied them
into the dungeon.

00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:17.628
That's where I
learned from Mr. Rido

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:19.966
that some humans had killed
their friends,

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.636
and they were fighting
to take back Wiene,

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:24.174
and other Xenos who
had been captured.

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:29.618
- No! (sobbing) No! No!

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:33.291
- Aw. Just settle down,
little lady.

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:37.233
You're gonna get your
turn soon enough.

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:42.377
(evil laughter)

00:18:42.477 --> 00:18:45.249
- [Hestia] A level five
named Dix Perdix, the captain

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.588
of the Ikelos Familia,
and his allies

00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:49.658
were behind it all.
They had been

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.063
capturing the Xenos.
They were using

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:54.467
an ancient dungeon
created by Knossos,

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.505
an ancestor of Dix Perdix, as a

00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:58.442
secret route to ferry the Xenos

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:00.346
up to the surface to sell them.

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:02.116
- That's when I figured it out.

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:04.555
Humiliating and
tormenting these beasts,

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:06.391
striving them to the
brink of despair,

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.329
treating them like
the garbage they are.

00:19:08.429 --> 00:19:10.667
It's the one thing that
satisfies me.

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:14.875
The one thing that can
assuage this wretched blood.

00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:16.679
- So the Xenos,
and Wiene, that's

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:20.520
why you did all this?
Mr. Rido and the other

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.289
Xenos were bewitched
by a powerful

00:19:22.389 --> 00:19:24.161
curse that made them go berserk.

00:19:24.261 --> 00:19:27.467
Even Wiene was transformed
into a giant monster,

00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:30.640
after having the crystal in
her forehead forcibly torn out.

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:34.147
So I had to fight
to save them all.

00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:36.852
Being a human or a
monster has nothing

00:19:36.952 --> 00:19:38.422
to do with saving someone.

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:41.829
If they ask for my help, then
that's good enough for me.

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.637
- You are just a hypocrite.

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:47.306
(yelling)

00:19:47.406 --> 00:19:50.346
- [Hestia] We managed to
fend off the baddies, but Wiene

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.017
was unleashed upon the surface

00:19:52.117 --> 00:19:53.854
while still under the curse.

00:19:53.954 --> 00:19:57.260
Bell chased after her, but
was put in a tough situation

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.430
after things took a
turn for the worse.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.303
- [Hermes] The moment of
truth. If he screws this up,

00:20:02.403 --> 00:20:05.777
Bell Cranel becomes
public enemy number one.

00:20:06.712 --> 00:20:08.415
- This Vouivre right
here is mine,

00:20:08.516 --> 00:20:10.286
so keep your hands off.

00:20:10.386 --> 00:20:11.956
- [Hestia] Eventually
things came to a kind

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:14.862
of vague conclusion, when
a black Minotaur appeared

00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:19.438
out of nowhere. The town placed
the blame largely on Bell.

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.776
Not to mention a number
of the Xenos were still

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:25.449
stuck above ground with many
adventurers hunting them.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.220
- [Bell] It was a bad situation.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.092
So we enacted a plan
to save the Xenos,

00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:31.428
by helping them avoid the notice

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:33.198
of other adventurers and escape.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.135
I served as a distraction,

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:37.941
while everyone else found an
unguarded entrance to Knossos

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.845
for the Xenos to sneak through.

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:42.250
- [Hestia] However,
something happened beyond

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.824
even divine will. The
dreaded black Minotaur

00:20:45.924 --> 00:20:47.259
showed up once again.

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:51.234
- [Bell] Asterios. That's
the name he gave before we

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.405
engaged in an all out battle.

00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:55.643
I want...

00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.716
I want to be a hero!

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:05.295
(screaming)

00:21:18.489 --> 00:21:21.629
(sword shatters)

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:31.147
(screaming)

00:21:31.247 --> 00:21:33.786
(fighting)

00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:38.529
Gah!

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:42.904
Ah!

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:54.026
- This makes us even.

00:21:54.126 --> 00:21:55.731
(gasping)

00:21:55.831 --> 00:21:58.603
Bell, our next match
shall be the last.

00:21:58.703 --> 00:22:01.408
- [Hestia] You ended up losing
that fight, but the Xenos

00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:03.714
managed to return to
the dungeon safely,

00:22:03.814 --> 00:22:06.953
and your handsome
reputation was restored.

00:22:07.053 --> 00:22:08.389
- I need you.

00:22:08.489 --> 00:22:09.758
To help me.

00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:13.131
I want to get stronger.

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:23.520
- [Hestia] Woo! Looking
back, we've had nothing but

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.958
absolutely crazy
adventures, huh?

00:22:26.058 --> 00:22:28.530
I feel like my heart was
pounding nonstop,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.370
and now we're about to start
an entirely new adventure.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.976
- [Bell] Right! I'm
excited to find out what

00:22:35.076 --> 00:22:37.681
kind of fun is in store
for us this time.

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:42.524
- [Hestia] After being given
another mission by the Guild,

00:22:42.624 --> 00:22:45.564
Bell's party goes on an
expedition to the lower levels

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:48.134
of the Dungeon, where
they find the Great Falls.

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:51.107
But even with Bell at level
four, and a party formed

00:22:51.207 --> 00:22:54.381
with the skilled members
of other Familia, it turns

00:22:54.481 --> 00:22:56.151
out those floors are
a lot harder

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:57.888
to deal with than expected.

00:22:57.988 --> 00:23:00.626
After they run into an
enhanced species of monster

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.764
for the first time,
numerous allies

00:23:02.864 --> 00:23:06.038
and adventurers are defeated
by its overwhelming assault.

00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:08.977
Everyone in Bell's party
takes desperate action to try

00:23:09.077 --> 00:23:11.782
and save them and
overcome the intense trial

00:23:11.882 --> 00:23:14.020
that the dungeon
throws their way.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.036
Oof! Your next adventure
sounds like another rough one.

00:23:22.136 --> 00:23:24.775
- [Bell] (chuckles) No matter
what dangers lie ahead,

00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:28.181
we're all going to get
stronger and return safely.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.618
Not only for our own sake

00:23:29.718 --> 00:23:31.889
but also for the sake
of Wiene and the Xenos.

00:23:31.989 --> 00:23:33.994
- [Hestia] (giggles)
That's the spirit!

00:23:34.094 --> 00:23:36.966
Things will be okay if
everybody works together,

00:23:37.066 --> 00:23:39.572
and I'm sure the fans
watching from all

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.476
over the world will be
there to cheer you on.

00:23:42.577 --> 00:23:45.617
Go out there and rise
to the challenge, Bell.

00:23:45.717 --> 00:23:47.988
- [Bell] Okay, Goddess,
let's do this!
