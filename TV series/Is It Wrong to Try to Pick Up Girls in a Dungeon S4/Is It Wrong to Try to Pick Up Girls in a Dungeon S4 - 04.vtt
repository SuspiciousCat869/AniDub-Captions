00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:01.804
(Bell grunting)

00:00:01.904 --> 00:00:03.808
(whooshing)

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:06.647
(Bell grunts)

00:00:07.983 --> 00:00:10.721
(Bell shouts)

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.661
(water flows)

00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.567
(Bell panting)

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:26.486
(sword schwing)

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:29.325
(water flows)

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.335
(Marie clapping)

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.053
(soft piano music)

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:44.823
- A real mermaid?

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.369
(Bell grunts)

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:55.845
(Marie laughing)

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:57.683
(zoom thumps)

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:01.022
(Bell gasps)
(Marie gasps)

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:02.324
S-sorry!

00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:06.265
(peaceful music)

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.456
(Marie laughs)

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:22.599
(Bell grunts)
(Marie gasps)

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:26.372
(opening song)

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.824
She's not trying to attack me.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.895
Could it be?

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:02.965
Is this mermaid actually...

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.168
- Are you okay?

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:05.237
- [Bell] She can talk.

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:06.540
- You're hurt.

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.746
- Uh, oh.

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:11.315
Would you happen to be...

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.819
Are you a Xenos?

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:13.754
- Ah.

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:16.793
(water splashes)

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.735
(water splashes)

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.074
(whooshing)

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:27.314
(Marie laughing)

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.525
- [Marie] You smell
like, like Rei.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:34.996
- [Bell] Huh? You know Ms. Rei?

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:37.702
- [Marie] Yeah. She's pretty.

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:42.210
And Rido is a real cutie.
And Gross is kinda shy.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.680
- A cutie?

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:45.885
And kinda shy?

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.522
(bell ring)

00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:50.829
Um, anyway, so my name is Bell.

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:51.864
- Hm?

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:55.638
- Uh, Bell Cranel.

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.642
I am Bell.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:03:59.278
- [Marie] Bell?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.516
(Marie gasps)

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.384
I'm Marie!

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:04.656
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Marie.

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:06.192
(Marie grunts)

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:08.196
- Ah.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.398
- Uh-

00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:11.368
- [Marie] Open your mouth.

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.872
- Huh? (gurgles)

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:14.542
- Now take a drink.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:17.782
Keep going. More, more.

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.824
Don't stop, keep it up.

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:23.760
You need more.

00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.899
(Bell grunting)

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.134
- [Bell] Oh, man!

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.336
This would look really bad

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:30.908
if someone walked in
on us right now.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.182
(Bell grunting)

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:37.054
Huh? My wounds are healing.

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:38.223
Wait a minute.

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:39.993
The lifeblood of a mermaid,

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:43.199
I heard it's supposed to
be a rare healing item.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.704
Thank you very much. I
appreciate it.

00:04:45.805 --> 00:04:46.740
(Marie giggles)

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.082
- You're all better now.
Good job.

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:51.983
(Bell grunts)
(Marie grunts)

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:53.085
Oh!

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.593
It kind of stings.

00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:58.597
- [Bell] Ah! I'm sorry.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:02.070
(Bell panting)

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.108
(creature roaring in distance)

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:07.014
- Huh?

00:05:07.114 --> 00:05:08.951
I don't like this place.

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:10.087
Let's go over there.

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:10.955
- Huh?

00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:12.124
(water splashes)

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:13.661
Over where, exactly?

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.167
(creature continues roaring)

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.071
(bell grunts)

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:20.741
(Welf yelling)

00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:21.408
(valorous music)

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.649
(thunder raging)

00:05:26.286 --> 00:05:27.922
- [Aisha] Ha! Not half bad.

00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:30.961
(monsters thuds)

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:37.642
(monsters explodes)

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:39.747
- Sh-she's a power house.

00:05:39.847 --> 00:05:42.451
- We know Bell Cranel's
especially strong,

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:46.593
but Lady Aisha is also quite
a force to be reckoned with.

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:48.764
- [Luvis] You sure
you're okay, Dormul?

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:52.405
I mean, you guys got hit
by that parasite plant too.

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:54.542
- Don't sweat it. We're
built tougher than

00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:56.814
weak-ass elves like
you, after all.

00:05:56.914 --> 00:05:58.784
But as much as I really
hate to admit it,

00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:01.422
at the moment, we can't do
a whole lot of fighting.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:02.926
So I guess, at the very least,

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.230
I'll have to be
a stand-in supporter.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.100
- It is greatly appreciated.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.171
- Yeah. Can't thank you enough.

00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:10.708
(Dormul exclaims)

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.045
- Well, golly, it
ain't nothing, milady.

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:16.553
When you need some muscle,
you can count on a dwarf.

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:18.590
- [Mikoto] Um, Excuse me,
Dormul.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.393
We heard that your party came
down here

00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:22.932
as part of the quest to
find a missing adventurer.

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.137
I take it you haven't
found them yet.

00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:26.840
- [Dormul] No, we did.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.177
They were at the safety point
on the 28th floor

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.983
with their body
wrapped up in vines.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:34.856
They had all been killed.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.025
(Mikoto gasps)

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.929
- [Haruhime] Wait a minute.
At the safety point?

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.699
- [Dormul] Yeah. I'm
betting that bastard

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.770
was waiting there to ambush 'em.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.541
And what's more, the
corpses have been hidden

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.009
under a bunch of rocks.

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:46.279
- Wait, it would do that?

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.983
- Must have known it would be
discovered,

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:50.988
as though it knew adventurers
would be more vigilant.

00:06:51.088 --> 00:06:53.794
- Sounds like that damn
monster is way too clever.

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:55.698
- [Lili] Is there any other
information you've gathered

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:57.668
about the monster you
can share with us?

00:06:57.768 --> 00:07:00.842
- Afraid not. It got the jump
on us soon after we turned back

00:07:00.942 --> 00:07:02.712
to start heading
for the surface.

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:04.616
We tried everything
we had on it.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:06.352
Not even the magic
lightning sword

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.256
I keep for emergencies worked.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:10.528
We got overwhelmed
by those seeds.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.264
It took all our
effort to escape.

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:16.406
- If that's the case, we can
trust one thing to be true.

00:07:16.507 --> 00:07:18.811
Only Bell Cranel's magic can
damage it.

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.882
- Then fire must be
its weakness.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:25.290
- Then we should arm ourselves
with magic fire swords.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.927
- [Aisha] Guess you're
our ace in the hole.

00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:29.766
I know those magic swords of
yours are incredibly strong.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.536
They're sure to do some damage.

00:07:31.636 --> 00:07:33.173
Every little cut is progress.

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:34.943
- Yeah-huh. Count on me.

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:37.414
Though we've been getting
swarmed down here.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:39.653
Just hope we don't run
outta swords before then.

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:41.289
- Well, worst-case scenario,

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.325
we'll use Haruhime's
level boost.

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:44.663
Although I'd really
hate to waste it

00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:47.000
on fighting against a
bunch of small fries.

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:47.868
- Yes, I agree.

00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:50.708
Let's do our best to avoid that.

00:07:50.808 --> 00:07:52.277
It's going to be
impossible to predict

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:54.315
what that thing might
try to pull next.

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:58.222
(heavy foot steps thuds)

00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:00.628
(valiant music)

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:04.569
(heavy foot steps thuds)

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.742
(valiant music)

00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:25.911
(monsters crippling)

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:30.888
(water flowing)

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:31.990
- Where did-

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.392
where did she go?

00:08:33.493 --> 00:08:35.531
(Marie singing)

00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.666
That voice?

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.436
(Marie singing continues)

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:42.077
(fast footsteps thuds)

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:50.093
(Bell panting)

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:53.934
(Marie singing continues)

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.323
- Oh!

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:09.098
Hey, Bell.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.836
- Oh hey, there you are.

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:13.674
(Marie giggles)

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.978
(zoom thumps)

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:20.386
(Bell stutters)
(happy piano music)

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:21.388
- What's the matter?

00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:24.629
- It's ah, nothing.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.000
- Huh?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.206
(Marie gasps)

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:33.079
Wait right here.

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:34.849
- Where are you going?

00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:38.624
(water splashes)

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.326
- How's this?

00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:41.495
(Bell stutters)

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:42.665
- Oh, god.

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:45.637
- I got clothes just
like you humans.

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.848
- So Miss Marie, do
you know the Xenos?

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.386
Like Rido and all the others?

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:54.689
- My name's just Marie.

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:55.858
- Oh, sorry.

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.861
I was just trying to be polite.

00:09:57.962 --> 00:09:59.832
It's kind of a part of
human culture.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:03.439
- Oh, just call me Marie.

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:05.376
(Bell stutters)

00:10:05.476 --> 00:10:06.780
- Ma-rie.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.719
- Yeah. Marie, I am Marie.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.788
(Marie giggles)

00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:12.659
- You didn't answer my question.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.629
Are you friends with Rido
and the other...

00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:16.398
- Rido?

00:10:18.135 --> 00:10:18.971
- Right.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:21.175
Yeah. So Rido and
the other Xenos

00:10:22.277 --> 00:10:24.682
are all of them living
down here with you?

00:10:24.782 --> 00:10:25.718
- They're not here.

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:27.655
Rido went further up.

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:29.825
- Um. Okay, I see.

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:33.667
- Rei and the others
always stick together,

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.871
but I can't fly like she does

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.611
and I can't walk
like Rido either.

00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:41.883
So, I'm always left
waiting here for them.

00:10:41.983 --> 00:10:45.022
- Oh, that sounds pretty lonely.

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.494
- Let's talk about
other stuff Bell.

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.766
- So listen, Marie,

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:53.239
it's very important that I
find a way back to my friends.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.044
I'd love to talk more
with you of course, but-

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:59.619
But could you please take me
to where the other humans are?

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.356
- This is a safe place.

00:11:01.456 --> 00:11:03.159
Leaving is a bad idea.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:06.031
Believe me, this is
where I sing and play.

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:07.134
- Marie.

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:10.439
- If you try to leave,
there's a scary thing.

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:12.043
I saw it myself.

00:11:12.143 --> 00:11:13.046
It was awful.

00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:15.249
It attacked some humans,
your friends.

00:11:15.349 --> 00:11:17.789
- Are you talking about
the enhanced species?

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:19.224
That big green monster?

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:20.326
- Um huh.

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:26.071
Marie, I want to put
a stop to that thing

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:28.042
but I don't know where it is.

00:11:28.142 --> 00:11:31.816
- You can't, stay here Bell.

00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:37.093
Otherwise, you and I will
die and everyone else too.

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.267
Please stay.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.972
(Bell gasps)

00:11:45.778 --> 00:11:46.880
- What is it?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.382
- Something's off.

00:11:49.552 --> 00:11:51.455
Too much tension in the air.

00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:57.836
- Lady Aisha, what do you mean?

00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.739
- Quiet, monsters incoming.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.978
(trumpet sounds)

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:06.886
(monsters marching)

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:08.456
- There's too many of them.

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:09.759
Use the magic swords.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.130
- [Mikoto] More coming
from the rear.

00:12:15.036 --> 00:12:17.040
- They're everywhere.
- [Lili] Damn.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.211
- [Mikoto] There's even
more on the right

00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:22.418
- [Lili] And they're also
coming from this way.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:23.419
- Are you kidding me?

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.490
- Doesn't look good, folks.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.427
- I hate these guys.

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:30.433
(Aisha gasps)

00:12:30.535 --> 00:12:33.405
(monster roars)

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:43.960
Ain't this some shit.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.335
That ugly bastard put us in
the middle of a pass parade.

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:53.346
(suspense music)

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:54.982
- It scares me, Bell.

00:13:01.696 --> 00:13:03.266
- Trust me, Marie

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:06.138
I will defeat that Moss
Huge no matter what

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.177
but I really need your help.

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:10.915
Please guide me
through the dungeon.

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:13.653
- No, it's too dangerous,
you'll die.

00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:16.125
- No, I won't.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.998
I mean it. I'll wipe that
monster out.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.134
Can you help me Marie?

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:24.341
I don't want you to be
scared any longer.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:26.913
Please, I need your help.

00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:29.586
- So then you'll be okay?

00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:30.921
You won't get killed?

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:32.859
- Yeah, I promise.

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.595
- And- and the monster?

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:36.633
you can make it go away forever?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.503
- I'll put it down for good.

00:13:38.604 --> 00:13:40.439
(Marie stutters)

00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.943
Cross my heart.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:47.286
(Marie gasps)

00:13:47.387 --> 00:13:50.326
(water splashes)

00:13:52.463 --> 00:13:53.733
- Okay, I'll do it.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.369
I'll be your guide, Bell.

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:58.009
(Marie gasps air)

00:13:58.109 --> 00:14:02.383
(Marie singing note intensely)

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.563
(Marie singing fades)

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.007
(monster echoes)

00:14:14.108 --> 00:14:15.076
- What was that?

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.280
- I found it.
It's that way.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.750
There's another
friendly creature

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.587
like me who agreed to help out.

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:22.525
(water splashes)

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:25.062
- A mermaid song.

00:14:25.162 --> 00:14:28.937
No way. Can it actually
mesmerize the beasts?

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:32.243
- Come on, Bell. Let's go.

00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:33.145
- Okay, coming.

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:37.120
(upbeat adventure music)

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:39.892
- This is impossible.

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:42.030
A monster can't cause a pass
parade.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.504
- That bastard. We're getting
overwhelmed.

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:47.976
- Don't fall behind or
you'll get swarmed.

00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:50.847
Just keep on running.

00:14:50.947 --> 00:14:52.952
- Ughh. My legs feel like jelly.

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:56.560
- Holy crap Dormul. Is
this as fast as you can go?

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.366
- Maybe I should just
leave your dumb ass here.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.738
- Haruhime has a spell that
could get us out of this

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:05.009
but it's too soon,
that Moss Huge is

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:06.779
somewhere out there watching us.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:09.318
(monsters screaming)

00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:11.087
- Out of the way.

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.637
(sword shatters)

00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:21.943
(monsters raging)

00:15:27.053 --> 00:15:29.258
- Blacksmith, get ready.

00:15:29.358 --> 00:15:32.497
- Gladly. You know I
could do this all day

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:36.806
- This way Bell, your
friends are running

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:39.177
from a whole bunch
of monsters right now.

00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:40.647
They may be in trouble.

00:15:40.747 --> 00:15:42.417
- Is that Moss Huge one of them?

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:43.987
- Yeah, it is.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:48.028
(water splashes)

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:55.042
(water splashes)

00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.052
(monster grunts)

00:16:02.491 --> 00:16:03.793
Bell, this way.

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:05.496
- Huh? Oh, okay.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.638
(heavy footsteps thuds)

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:12.678
(monster growls)

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:19.792
(monsters raging)

00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:21.461
(Metal clung)

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:22.731
(Welf grunts)

00:16:22.832 --> 00:16:25.737
(suspense music)

00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:31.950
- Hell Kaios.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.789
(laser beams)

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:37.226
There's so many of them.

00:16:38.028 --> 00:16:40.767
(Welf shouts)

00:16:47.748 --> 00:16:51.088
- Don't wimp out on me
now blacksmith. Come on.

00:16:51.188 --> 00:16:52.592
- What did you say?

00:16:52.692 --> 00:16:54.327
You got a mouth on ya.

00:16:54.427 --> 00:16:56.832
But out of respect for
how you handle that ax,

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.536
I'll let you off the
hook this time.

00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:00.874
- Thanks. Now we've
got work to do.

00:17:00.975 --> 00:17:04.113
(swords cutting)

00:17:05.584 --> 00:17:08.156
(Daphne grunts)

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:10.760
- The vanguard is really giving
them hell.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.531
This is our chance to press on.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:13.533
- Great.

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.071
- [Daphne] Let's get
as far as we can.

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.043
(monster tumbles)

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:22.517
- Whoa. What the
hell is this thing?

00:17:24.388 --> 00:17:26.491
- It's a Crystaroth Urchin.

00:17:26.592 --> 00:17:27.594
Don't get hit.

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:29.297
It'll shred you to pieces.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.276
- Yo, big guy! What are you
doing? Get outta there.

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:38.182
No chance, Chigusa and the
others won't make it out.

00:17:38.282 --> 00:17:41.121
If it gets through, someone's
gonna get messed up.

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:43.158
- But Master Ouka!

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.532
(Ouka grunts)

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:49.872
- Mikoto it's too risky.

00:17:49.972 --> 00:17:51.074
- No, don't do it.

00:17:51.174 --> 00:17:52.277
- I've trained for this.

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:54.214
I have a quality weapon.

00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:57.654
All I need to do is
be like Master Bell.

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:02.564
- It's a superb technique but,

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:05.604
I might rethink that
name if I were you.

00:18:05.704 --> 00:18:06.305
- I'm okay with it.

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:07.908
It's the name I want.

00:18:08.008 --> 00:18:09.410
I got an alias from the Gods.

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:11.381
It's meant to honor that.

00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:14.154
Zekka.
(sword schwing)

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:17.493
(sharp static sound)

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:19.130
- Whoa! Mikoto.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.301
- She... she got it.

00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:22.872
- Split that thing in two.

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:25.109
- That was amazing, Mikoto.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.181
- Now let's get moving everyone

00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.553
- [Cassandra] With the light
of heaven once refused,

00:18:30.653 --> 00:18:35.263
arms of mercy bring salvation
to my heinous figure.

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:37.467
Make up for my words that cannot
reach

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:40.205
and save my poor companions.

00:18:40.306 --> 00:18:42.143
Oh, solar rays.

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:46.217
I beseech you to ward off
affliction, Soullight.

00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:50.994
(triumphant music)

00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:52.631
- All good.
- Thanks a lot.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:55.169
- You're cutting it kind close
with all these heals a Lil Bit.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.906
- We have to stick
to the timeframe.

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:58.543
We can't just use
it willy nilly.

00:18:58.643 --> 00:19:02.183
- Why are you fighting with each
other after I just healed you?

00:19:02.283 --> 00:19:04.822
- Up ahead, we have enemies
coming from the water.

00:19:04.922 --> 00:19:06.592
(monsters marching)

00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:08.897
- Four seconds till
I use the sword.

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:10.199
- Right!

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:14.040
(monsters marching)

00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:15.777
(trumpet sounds)

00:19:15.877 --> 00:19:19.217
(lightning crushes)

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.392
- [Aisha] I'm impressed.

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:26.264
I thought this party was
doomed without Bell Cranel

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:28.469
but apparently I misjudged them.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.372
No need for more faint praise.

00:19:30.472 --> 00:19:31.976
They've earned my respect.

00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:35.517
This is more than a party
just relying on my protection.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.927
- We were supposed
to go together,

00:19:41.027 --> 00:19:46.004
you promised me Bell, but
I can't go any further.

00:19:46.104 --> 00:19:49.110
(monster rushing)

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.947
It's that Aqua
Serpent from before.

00:19:51.048 --> 00:19:53.185
(monster thuds)

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:54.588
It's coming at us.

00:19:54.689 --> 00:19:57.561
(Bell stutters)

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:06.779
Sorry about this Marie.

00:20:12.157 --> 00:20:13.660
- You're so fast Bell.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.900
- At least get the
monster off our tail.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.770
- This is so cool.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.439
- Don't cling to me.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.590
- We'll make our
stand right here.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.927
There isn't any water for
them to attack us from,

00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:32.229
plus we have a clear view.

00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:34.167
Draw them in and scorch
them all at once

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.269
with your magic sword.

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:37.306
(monsters grunting)

00:20:37.406 --> 00:20:39.177
- Will his sword
last long enough?

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.281
- Running away will
just make things worse.

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:43.218
We have got to do something
to reduce the number

00:20:43.318 --> 00:20:45.891
of monsters or nothing
will change.

00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:47.694
- Gotcha, sounds good to me.

00:20:48.896 --> 00:20:49.965
Now, Koga!

00:20:54.642 --> 00:20:57.313
- That's some intense heat.

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:59.283
No, dear Gods

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:00.419
- What's happening?

00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:03.225
(rocks tumbles)

00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:06.732
(monsters crippling)

00:21:11.374 --> 00:21:13.445
- Are you seeing what
I'm seeing?

00:21:13.546 --> 00:21:16.953
- All single species
all moving together.

00:21:17.053 --> 00:21:19.090
This is a monster party.

00:21:19.191 --> 00:21:21.161
- Crap. We're not
equipped for this.

00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:23.298
They're spawning from
all over the place.

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:24.801
There's no way out.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.776
- Lady Aisha.

00:21:28.876 --> 00:21:31.749
- Honestly, I'm still
concerned about the Moss Huge,

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:34.922
but if you're going to use
it, then now is the time.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.596
Listen up boys.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.834
You must swear on your life

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:41.702
that you'll never speak

00:21:41.802 --> 00:21:43.238
of what you're about to witness.

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:44.340
- [Luvis] What are you
talking about?

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.209
We don't have time for...

00:21:45.309 --> 00:21:46.546
- Yes or no?

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:48.650
- [Dormul] Sure.
You have my word.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.891
- [Luvis] I swear to you on the
name of our holy elf queen.

00:21:54.194 --> 00:21:55.664
- Do it, Haruhime.

00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:58.937
- Everyone gather around
her. Form a circle.

00:21:59.037 --> 00:22:00.507
- This is it.

00:22:00.607 --> 00:22:03.779
(monsters raging)

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:08.355
(heavy suspense music)

00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:12.797
- Here I go.

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.668
Kokonoe.

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:18.509
(Ending song)

00:23:46.018 --> 00:23:48.723
- [Haruhime] Next time,
Argo Vesta.
