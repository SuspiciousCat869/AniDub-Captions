WEBVTT

00:00:02.672 --> 00:00:08.216
(blood drop dripping)
(magic whooshing)

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.628
- We've really been
through a lot, haven't we?

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:16.098
So many, many things.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.142
You had your fair share of
pathetic moments at the start;

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:24.683
often being the butt
of peoples' jokes.

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:27.855
Even after you grew a little
stronger, someone tougher

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.360
was always standing in your way.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.501
It was a constant ordeal.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.506
Hardly a day went by
when you weren't injured.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.011
There were some rough times.

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:41.617
Moments I thought
you might break down.

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:46.058
Even moments I feared you
would be swallowed by despair.

00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:49.399
Moments that looked like
you were down for the count,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.506
but you never stopped
wishing for it.

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:53.908
Ever.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.779
Wishing to be a hero.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.216
Wishing to be stronger.

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:01.924
You kept saying it
over and over.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:04.195
Striving to reach your goal.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:05.965
To keep on fighting.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.236
To uphold your promises.

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.647
You surmounted countless
adversities,

00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:16.620
and now just look at
how far you've come.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.393
(triumphant music)

00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:31.382
(magic whirring)

00:01:35.123 --> 00:01:37.896
Congrats, Bell. Good job.

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:39.566
You've ranked up again.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.540
(soft music)

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:51.824
Tell me, the black
Minotaur that you fought,

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:53.393
was it really strong?

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.300
- Very.

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:00.274
- Bell fought through
the Battle of Knossos

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:03.213
and protected the Xenos.

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:05.719
Generally speaking that feat
alone could have made him

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.254
worthy enough for a rank up.

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:09.626
But to be honest,

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.299
it was his defeat that
was the most meaningful.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.140
The frustration that he felt
is actually what pushed Bell's

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.811
status to the next stage.

00:02:20.882 --> 00:02:23.821
(Hestia sipping)

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:27.629
Oh, Vesta...
- Huh?

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.933
(Hestia giggles)
- Oh, don't worry about it.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.939
Seeing you in this moment just
made me feel like saying that.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.210
It's just a symbol of all

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.780
the things that I preside over,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.621
and a title too, and
another name that I go by.

00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:44.228
- Your name's Vesta?

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.935
- Mhm. It has the meaning
of perpetual flame.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:01.196
- I take it your injuries
have all healed cleanly,

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:02.431
Bell Cranel.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:05.404
- They have. Thanks, again.

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.776
- I hear that you have
reached level four,

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:10.615
and I see the expression
on your face has changed

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:11.550
a great deal.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.954
- You think so?
- Indeed.

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:17.529
Although that is coming from
someone who has no eyes.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.431
Tell me, have you decided what

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.637
your next course
of action will be?

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:25.711
- Yes. I'm going to start
exploring the dungeon again.

00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:29.485
To get stronger.

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.957
- It sounds as though
you are committed.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:36.132
However, I detect a slight
hesitation under the surface.

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:37.568
(Bell gasps)

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:40.741
Until the deepest level of
the dungeon is conquered,

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.650
coexistence between humanity
and the Xenos is impossible.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.889
It matters not how much
Ouranos and I strive to help.

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.393
The future we wish for
will never come as long

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:52.832
as that feat remains
unaccomplished.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:57.341
If you want to act with the
Xenos' best interest at heart,

00:03:57.441 --> 00:03:59.445
then please push forward, Bell
Cranel.

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:02.017
- Tell me honestly,

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.155
what's at the bottom
of the dungeon?

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.827
- A covenant forged long ago,

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:10.735
as well as a conclusion.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:14.876
- Dear Miss Eina, I, Luvis,
shall now gallantly venture

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:18.216
down to the lower floors of the
dungeon and resolve a quest.

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:19.686
- Oh, shut up!
You're interrupting

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:23.561
our precious personal time
before I go save the day!

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:25.532
Eina, my dearest, I'll
bring you a nice gift

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.170
from the lower floors
after I complete my quest.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.839
- Oh, don't even try it,
you smelly dwarf!

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.744
You won't even get past
the front gates!

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:33.781
- Stop it in your pointy
ear, you stupid elf!

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.352
You'll get whatever's left
over when I'm all finished up.

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:39.091
- Pardon me, Mr. Luvis,
and Mr. Dormul,

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.963
quests on the lower floors
can be especially dangerous

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:43.299
for adventurers.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.170
So I wish you a safe journey.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.441
- Oh, thank you so much, Eina,
my love!

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.912
- Come on, she was clearly
talking to me, you trash heap.

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:52.018
- [Dormul] Say that again and
I'll break your pointy nose!

00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:52.919
- [Luvis] Just try it!

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.556
- Well, hello, Bell.

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:57.995
- Wait, is that who
I think it is?

00:04:58.095 --> 00:04:59.700
- It's the little rookie.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.102
- Oh, sorry.

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:03.540
I'm happy to wait if you're
in the middle of something.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.478
- It's fine, I'm the one
who asked you to come.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:08.884
- Ah!

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.590
Right. Here you go.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.663
- What the?
Is that what I think it is?

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:17.502
- Wait, what? She giving
him a love letter?

00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:19.572
- Miss Eina, isn't this a-

00:05:19.672 --> 00:05:21.977
- It is. It's an
official one this time.

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:25.049
A directive for the Hestia
Familia straight from the guild.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.523
(both grumbling)

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.162
- Geez, another mission already?

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:33.934
I swear, we just got done
handling all that Xeno stuff

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.740
and here they come dumping
another compulsory mission

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.408
on our heads.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.577
The nerve of them.

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:40.413
- I mean, what do you
really expect?

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:42.384
That was all done
under the table.

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:43.553
I suppose we could always look

00:05:43.654 --> 00:05:45.123
on the bright side
of things though.

00:05:45.224 --> 00:05:47.862
Our familia is strong enough
to be considered for missions.

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:50.067
Although, it's mainly
thanks to Master Bell.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:53.707
- Ah phooey! I wouldn't have
registered us for an exploration

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:55.878
if I knew they'd
give us this crap.

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:58.283
I figured it was the best
choice since the application

00:05:58.383 --> 00:05:59.652
process was easy
and people said

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:01.723
we'd get all sorts of
preferential treatment.

00:06:01.823 --> 00:06:04.361
- So that was the
reason you picked it?

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.165
- Oh, don't give me a hard time!

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.535
Nobody could have ever imagined

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.572
that we would get as strong
as we are so fast!

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:12.545
- Well, this does kind of work
out perfectly, right, Bell?

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.650
- Yeah! This'll work out nicely.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.786
I wanted to go back to
the dungeon anyway.

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:18.590
- And wouldn't you know
it, I've already whipped up

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.528
new equipment for
the whole team.

00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:22.431
The guild didn't even
have to bother.

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:23.867
We are good to go.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.472
- The mission itself is
about what you would expect.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:28.877
We have to go down and break
our previous floor record,

00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:30.915
and then return with
the number of items

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.150
that they requested.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.021
Seems like a standard
expedition.

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:37.529
But, that does leave us with
some options.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.467
Either we simply accomplish
the goals they've given us

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:41.836
or do more.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.811
- Personally, I want to press
further on.

00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.383
I want to do it for
Wiene and the Xenos.

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:49.653
And for our own benefit.

00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:51.856
I want us all to get stronger.

00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.928
- That settles that.

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:55.998
- Great!

00:06:56.098 --> 00:06:58.537
Then we should reach out Take
and Miach to provide

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:01.609
some backup. We will
form a united front.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.215
- A united front, huh?
If you say so.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:07.120
- This isn't just a mission,
it's an expedition to gain

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.759
some strength, so the
more allies, the better.

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:12.598
We're all going to press
on together, right?

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.468
Then let's make it happen.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:15.738
Sound good?

00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:18.644
- [Welf] Oh yeah!
- [Liliruca] Okay!

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:21.917
- [Takemikazuchi] I
see. An expedition, eh?

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:25.658
- Yes. And as a member
of the Hestia Familia,

00:07:25.758 --> 00:07:28.363
I am here to humbly
request your support.

00:07:28.463 --> 00:07:30.300
- Despite the clear
risk that are involved,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.908
I have no objections to offering
Hestia assistance in this case.

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:36.011
What do the two of
you think about it?

00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:37.381
- I feel exactly the same.

00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:40.855
Plus we owe them a debt that
we haven't fully paid back yet.

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:41.957
- Same for me.

00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:44.662
I would very much like
to accompany you both.

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:48.637
- In which case, it's
best to be fully prepared.

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.242
Care for a round or two?

00:07:51.342 --> 00:07:53.714
Been a while since we last
sparred.

00:07:53.814 --> 00:07:54.782
- Sure.

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:56.920
- All right, which members of

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.326
the Miach Familia can join us
on the expedition?

00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:03.266
- Cassandra and myself, and
our captain said she's going

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.940
to provide logistical support,
like securing items and such.

00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:10.714
- Sounds good. So how should
we fit you into the formation?

00:08:12.217 --> 00:08:14.522
- Well, back when I was
in the Apollon Familia,

00:08:14.623 --> 00:08:16.292
I did odd jobs in
the middle guard.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.029
Cassandra should go
to the rear guard,

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:20.000
since she's a healer
she'll be best there,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.106
and you can bet she's going to
be way more useful than I am.

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:25.811
- Oh my gosh, that's mighty
kind of you to say, Daphne.

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:28.282
- Now don't get
all blushy about it.

00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:30.219
Is that a list of everyone

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.389
who's going to be in the party?

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:32.658
- That's right. In addition

00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:34.462
to our usual members,
we have Ouka

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:38.603
and Chigusa, given to us
by Master Takemikazuchi.

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:40.373
And Lady Aisha too.

00:08:40.473 --> 00:08:42.611
- Not that Aisha!

00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:46.185
As in Aisha Belka, former
member of Ishtar Familia?

00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:47.588
- Antianeira?

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:48.824
- Uh huh.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:50.327
I don't know how she found out,

00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:51.462
but she suddenly came

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:53.400
marching up to
our door recently.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.240
- So I hear you're going
on an expedition.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.211
You guys should
take me with you.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.685
- We had no reason to refuse,

00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:05.223
so we wound up adding
her to the roster.

00:09:05.324 --> 00:09:08.029
But with a battle formation
that includes two level fours

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:10.535
the discussion shifted to
how easily we could pass

00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.839
the middle floors and go
deeper into the dungeon.

00:09:12.939 --> 00:09:14.676
- I figured it
would be like that.

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:16.445
It would be a waste
to form a huge party

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:18.182
for something simple.
- That's right.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:20.587
And the plan was always
to adventure as far as we

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:22.892
possibly could, of course.

00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:26.265
- That makes things
difficult for you.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.704
A level one supporter will
be the first one to die

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:30.440
once we hit the lower levels.

00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.212
(Liliruca gasps)
- Hey! Don't say that!

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:34.549
- Whatever, why not?

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:35.951
I'm just telling the truth.

00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:38.791
But if she insists on
coming along no matter what

00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:41.729
then we'll just have to
find a compromise somehow.

00:09:42.497 --> 00:09:44.068
Well, you're not going to fight.

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.203
Instead, issue orders.

00:09:45.303 --> 00:09:47.274
You'll help guide the
battle while being safe

00:09:47.374 --> 00:09:48.343
in the rear guard.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:50.681
Basically a strategist.

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:53.152
I'm not fond of the role
because I was forced into it

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:56.225
a few times, but having someone
in the back who keeps track

00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:59.064
of the bigger picture is really
important.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:03.306
- And that's a thing
that I can do?

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:07.280
- Yep. Exactly what Finn
of the Loki Familia does.

00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:12.692
Except everybody knows that
he's also ridiculously strong.

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:15.998
During the war games, I got
frustrated when you totally

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:17.167
outwitted us.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:19.471
I think you've got the talent
for it.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:22.411
And if you're willing to try,
I'll teach you all the basics

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:23.914
that you need to know.

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:26.753
- [Liliruca] Yes, please!

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:36.071
(Mikoto yelling)

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:37.173
- Foolish.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.113
(Mikoto thuds)

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:41.215
- Mikoto!

00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:46.225
- Some say the majority of
adventurers are too preoccupied

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:47.795
with their status.

00:10:47.896 --> 00:10:49.265
I tend to agree.

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:51.836
Even someone with a normal
physique like me can compete

00:10:51.937 --> 00:10:55.678
with you on an equal level
just by mastering martial arts.

00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:58.917
It comes down to
techniques and tactics.

00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:02.190
Status doesn't improve
things in a single day.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.158
However.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:06.265
- Techniques and
tactics do, correct?

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.969
- Yep.

00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:09.639
That being said, don't expect

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:11.342
to master techniques with ease.

00:11:11.442 --> 00:11:15.216
You will need energy and effort
and conviction to see things

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:16.418
through to the end.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.291
Only then do you stand
a chance of pulling it off.

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.095
- I see.

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:22.297
Makes sense.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:28.342
What I desire is technique
that can oppose the powerful,

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:32.885
and immense strength to
help us survive adventures.

00:11:32.985 --> 00:11:36.960
- Well then, Mikoto, Chigusa,
you should learn exactly that.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.164
By unleashing your
techniques with proper timing

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:42.672
and proper breath control,
you can hurl even the heaviest

00:11:42.772 --> 00:11:46.044
of giants and slice through
the hardest of bodies.

00:11:46.947 --> 00:11:48.482
You have both grown beyond who

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.186
you were back in the far East.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:54.394
Get ready, I shall give you a
lesson on what I could never

00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:55.831
teach you back then.

00:11:57.802 --> 00:11:59.305
Come!

00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:00.541
(both grunt)

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.179
(both yelling)

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:08.857
(hammer clanging)
(Ouka clearing throat)

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.496
- Well, hey there, big fella.

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:13.767
What can I do for you?

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:16.071
- Mikoto told us
about your expedition.

00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:19.077
Chigusa and I will
be joining you.

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:21.583
- You came just to tell me that?

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:23.386
- No.

00:12:23.486 --> 00:12:24.756
I wanted to talk to you.

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:27.227
This is new territory for us
too.

00:12:27.327 --> 00:12:29.799
I would like to
prepare however I can.

00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.472
- So what, you want me to
coach you or something?

00:12:33.573 --> 00:12:34.942
Won't do much good.

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:37.013
- Yes. I know that.

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:40.453
- I'm a blacksmith, and right
now I'm helping my friends

00:12:40.554 --> 00:12:41.790
by making sure they're armed

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.727
with the highest
quality equipment.

00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:46.165
I'm already doing
everything I can,

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.602
so I don't have time to waste-

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:48.670
- I need a weapon.

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:50.975
(hammer clangs)

00:12:51.075 --> 00:12:53.580
And I would like for
you to make it for me.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.882
Please.

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:57.855
And I want the real deal.

00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:01.361
A weapon I can use to keep
Chigusa and Haruhime safe.

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:08.442
- Well, I'm good,
but I'm very expensive.

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:11.382
- How about a discount?

00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:13.485
(Welf grunts)
- Son of a!

00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:18.162
(curtain fluttering)

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.632
- Pardon.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:20.868
Miss Aisha?

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.972
(sitar music)

00:13:23.072 --> 00:13:27.313
May I please ask you
what we are doing?

00:13:27.413 --> 00:13:30.888
I mean, why did you close
everything up?

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:33.927
- That should be
quite obvious, Haruhime.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.841
I am putting you through
a special drill.

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:43.045
- What is she talking about?

00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:45.449
Um, special how?

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:46.653
- You heard me.

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:48.055
You are the biggest pushover

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:50.426
out of everyone who's going
on the expedition.

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.497
You know that, don't you?

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:53.600
- Oh.

00:13:55.838 --> 00:13:58.710
- If you can only provide one
level boost you're honestly

00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:01.382
going to be a burden.
- Maybe true.

00:14:01.482 --> 00:14:03.753
However, I don't have the
ability to fight

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:05.289
like Mikoto and all the others.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.630
- Nobody is expecting a sorcerer
to start throwing punches.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.232
Casting magic is your talent.

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:13.272
- Okay, so should
I refine my magic?

00:14:13.372 --> 00:14:17.480
- Not quite. You are going to
learn a new magic instead.

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:19.752
- But how?

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:21.590
Learning new magic
is a complicated

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.825
and time consuming process.

00:14:22.925 --> 00:14:24.461
(book thuds)

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.231
- Well, we're going to take

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.670
the easy route and force it out.

00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:29.939
- What is that?

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:32.343
- It's a grimoire.

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:38.189
- The Great Falls.

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:40.894
It's a gigantic waterfall
that's located on the first

00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:43.567
of the lower floors, the 25th.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:45.971
It continues down through
multiple levels and ends

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:47.508
on the 27th.

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:50.012
- Is that so?

00:14:50.112 --> 00:14:52.117
You're amazing, Bell.
- Huh?

00:14:52.217 --> 00:14:54.354
- Most people I know prepare
to explore new floors

00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:57.226
by brushing up on their
battle strategies, but

00:14:57.326 --> 00:15:00.066
here you are spending time
gathering up information,

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:03.172
like it's not even
a big deal for you.

00:15:03.272 --> 00:15:06.211
It's just like you're a
first class adventurer.

00:15:08.717 --> 00:15:10.119
- I realized something.

00:15:10.219 --> 00:15:13.760
The true meaning behind all
the lessons you've given me.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.531
This knowledge is vital.

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:18.837
It could be exactly what keeps
our party safe on a new floor.

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:20.941
And so, I'm trying
to do everything

00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:22.945
I can to prepare myself.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:24.715
- Oh, Bell.

00:15:26.252 --> 00:15:29.558
Only a few months have past
since we first met each other,

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.665
but he's really grown up.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.069
His admiration for
Lady Wallenstein

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.441
has gradually led
him to new heights.

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.779
Now he can even fight
against powerful monsters

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.214
like that Minotaur.

00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:45.958
I don't have it in me to
ask any of the details,

00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:49.497
but it's crazy how much
people like him change,

00:15:49.598 --> 00:15:51.368
and in such a short time.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.005
- [Bell] Miss Eina.

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:54.675
- Huh? Yes, what is it?

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:56.713
- [Bell] I'm curious about
the monsters that appear

00:15:56.813 --> 00:15:59.017
in this area near
the Great Falls.

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:02.224
- The most dangerous
one is this;

00:16:02.324 --> 00:16:04.529
a flying monster
known as Iguazu?

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:06.398
It's recommended that
you flee at all costs,

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:08.704
even if that means
ditching your belongings.

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:09.905
This is bad.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:12.945
That thing's extremely deadly,
Bell.

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:15.784
I think I may be falling head
over heels.

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:18.523
- Hear me out.

00:16:18.624 --> 00:16:21.461
Dunno how to describe it, but
I get this feeling some sort

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:24.602
of bittersweet aura is
encroaching on Bell right now.

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:26.906
Or maybe it's the hooch.

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:28.175
- It's definitely that.

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:31.281
- Indeed. Forget it
and drink up.

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.018
- Again, I'm really
grateful you agreed

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.689
to work with us
on the expedition.

00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:35.924
Thanks, Take.

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:38.195
You too, Miach, and Hephaistos.

00:16:38.295 --> 00:16:40.834
- Don't mention it, Hestia.
I'm glad to.

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.372
Anything to help out a good
friend like you, of course.

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:46.412
- I agree. Besides, we'll
be asking you for help

00:16:46.513 --> 00:16:50.486
in return eventually.
It's give and take.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:53.292
- As you requested, I'll
send some blacksmiths over

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.129
to watch your home for you.

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:57.367
All I did was mention they
could see Welf's workshop,

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:00.139
you know, then I was up
to my neck in volunteers.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:02.410
It was funny.
- I appreciate it.

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.113
Otherwise I'd be stuck at home

00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:06.085
and wouldn't be
able to go to work.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:07.387
- No kidding. But asking me

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:09.826
to provide house sitters
so you can repay

00:17:09.926 --> 00:17:11.763
your debt doesn't
really balance out.

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.098
(Hestia stammering)

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.802
(both chuckling)

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.338
- But I must say, I'm honestly

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:18.576
a little bit
embarrassed being here.

00:17:18.677 --> 00:17:21.616
We're drinking at a bar, leaving
the prep to our children.

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:22.918
That's not very fair, is it?

00:17:23.019 --> 00:17:25.022
- But what else am
I supposed to do?

00:17:25.123 --> 00:17:27.227
They're always on
top of everything.

00:17:27.327 --> 00:17:29.131
I'm literally the only one
left with nothing to do.

00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:32.103
- Oh, Hestia, I can relate.

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:34.842
Why today, I just learned
those of my Familia

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.211
have really grown.

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:38.349
They gave me some
bruises to prove it.

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:40.754
- [Miach] Naza has also made
great strides in improving

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.457
her pharmaceutical
mixing skills.

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.962
She seemed very keen on
developing a new potion

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:46.766
before the expedition
for Bell's sake.

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:49.739
- Guess all kids grow up,
and they need less and less

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:50.974
of my help.

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:53.445
That's a bittersweet reality,
isn't it?

00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:55.249
- [Takemikazuchi] Why
the long face, Hestia?

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.554
Let me guess, you're
feeling lonely.

00:17:57.655 --> 00:17:58.724
- Oh, of course!

00:17:58.824 --> 00:18:01.696
I can't go into the dungeon
with them after all!

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:04.200
Who wouldn't be lonely?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.642
- Sure, but you must be equally
as proud of them, right?

00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:11.115
- Yeah! You're totally
right on that, Hephaistos!

00:18:11.215 --> 00:18:12.450
I don't know if it's called
happiness,

00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:14.187
or maybe it's called pride,

00:18:14.287 --> 00:18:16.759
but it makes my heart
feel all warm and fuzzy.

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:19.532
Bell used to be such a cry
baby and now he's turned into

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:21.870
a super cool and
super brave hero.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.473
A real dignified young man.

00:18:23.574 --> 00:18:26.011
Gosh, I'm falling for
him all over again!

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:27.948
My heart's all aflutter!

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:28.983
(table thumps)

00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:30.453
(Hestia laughs)

00:18:30.554 --> 00:18:34.260
Bell is mine and I refuse
to let anyone else have him!

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:39.137
(Hestia laughing)
I love you, Bell!

00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:44.782
To be honest, I'm not
without my concerns

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.819
about the expedition.

00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.288
After all, Bell and the others

00:18:48.388 --> 00:18:50.459
are doing it to
bolster their strength.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.032
This is hard to say after
we invited your children

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:56.171
to join us, but it's
going to be risky.

00:18:57.842 --> 00:18:59.778
Even so, I have faith.

00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:01.081
Bell can do it.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.854
I know my familia has
what it takes to rise

00:19:03.954 --> 00:19:05.089
to the challenge.

00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:06.057
- Indeed.

00:19:06.157 --> 00:19:07.728
They're a talented bunch.

00:19:07.828 --> 00:19:08.997
- Yes.

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:10.900
I am certain that they will.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.738
- They're going to be just fine.

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:15.376
- Alrighty.

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:18.182
Here's to a successful
adventure for our children.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:20.252
(mugs thumping)
- [All] Cheers!

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:26.799
(soft music)

00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.898
(Haruhime panting)

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:46.739
- Pardon me, Master Welf is
asking if we can wait longer.

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:50.346
- Seriously? I told him
to be here on the dot.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.618
What about Lady Daphne
and Lady Cassandra?

00:19:52.718 --> 00:19:54.722
- They're coming.
They were busy arguing

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:57.595
about something this morning,
so we left before them.

00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:00.299
- They should be here
just about any moment now.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.936
- Hope you're right.

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:03.305
- What a complete mess.

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:06.178
We're having trouble before
the expedition begins.

00:20:06.278 --> 00:20:08.482
And here I thought I would
be the last one here.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.620
Rushed all this way for nothing.

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:11.923
- My apologies.

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:13.659
- [Daphne] Sorry we're late!

00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:16.398
- I'm so sorry!

00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:17.535
- Are you two all right?

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:19.103
- You're not going
to believe it;

00:20:19.204 --> 00:20:22.209
the big day finally comes and
Cassandra suddenly tells me

00:20:22.309 --> 00:20:23.646
she doesn't want to go anymore.

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:26.652
- Well, there's a reason,
I had another dream.

00:20:26.752 --> 00:20:29.892
This disgusting green moss
was trying to swallow up

00:20:29.993 --> 00:20:31.730
a ton of people.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.267
So please consider it.

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:38.008
Can we cancel or perhaps
postpone the expedition?

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.517
- No can do.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:43.720
I'm sorry.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.824
- I figured as much.

00:20:45.924 --> 00:20:48.362
(Daphne groaning)
(Cassandra whimpering)

00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:50.901
- Please, we know we're
bound to run into trouble.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.236
It's expected.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.975
But isn't that what an
adventurer is all about?

00:20:55.543 --> 00:20:56.512
- [Cassandra] Yeah.

00:20:56.612 --> 00:20:59.350
- Sorry, guys, everybody ready?

00:21:00.854 --> 00:21:03.593
(light music)

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:08.870
- Is this it?
The weapon I asked for?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.044
- Yeah. Better earn enough on
this expedition to pay it off.

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:16.185
- Oh!

00:21:16.285 --> 00:21:18.055
This is a real masterpiece.

00:21:18.155 --> 00:21:20.459
- Yeah. Damn straight it is.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.731
Bell, this one's for you.

00:21:22.831 --> 00:21:26.205
It's a new weapon that I
made from unicorn horn.

00:21:26.305 --> 00:21:27.874
I call it the Hakugen.

00:21:28.843 --> 00:21:29.778
- Hakugen?

00:21:29.878 --> 00:21:31.782
(blade rings)

00:21:31.882 --> 00:21:33.285
So light!

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:35.122
- I was working down
to the last minute,

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:37.226
but definitely one of my best.

00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:38.796
Put it to good use.

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:41.434
- Thank you so much, Welf.

00:21:42.202 --> 00:21:44.709
Okay everyone, it's time to go!

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:48.081
- We'll handle things here.
Give 'em hell.

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:49.819
- [Hephaistos] Be
careful out there.

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:52.389
- [Miach] And don't
do anything crazy.

00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:01.642
- Remember, always keep
your guard up, okay?

00:22:01.742 --> 00:22:02.744
- Will do.

00:22:04.247 --> 00:22:05.650
- Give it all you got.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.752
- Right!

00:22:08.189 --> 00:22:09.057
Goodbye for now.

00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:11.061
(rock music begins)

00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:14.568
(insects screeching)

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:17.006
(sword slicing)

00:22:17.106 --> 00:22:18.175
- Watch out!

00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:21.549
(magic thundering)

00:22:22.684 --> 00:22:26.926
More enemies in coming
from two o'clock!

00:22:27.026 --> 00:22:28.161
(shield clanging)

00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:29.699
- Hey, big guy!

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:32.170
(ax thundering)
(Ouka grunting)

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.475
(arrows thumping)

00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:41.054
(sword slicing)

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.194
- Damn! They just keep coming.

00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:45.630
- Here I go!

00:22:47.433 --> 00:22:51.074
(dagger slicing)
(Bell grunting)

00:22:51.174 --> 00:22:52.945
- Master Bell, over there!

00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:54.781
Take out the nest!

00:22:57.521 --> 00:22:59.257
(Bell yelling)

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:03.465
(rock music continues)

00:23:03.566 --> 00:23:06.404
- Fire bolt!

00:23:06.506 --> 00:23:09.711
(fire exploding)

00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:18.896
- Holy crap.

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:21.669
- Oh, wow.

00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:23.940
So this is level four.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:33.526
(creature stomping)

00:23:46.018 --> 00:23:49.023
- [Bell] Next time:
the Great Falls.
