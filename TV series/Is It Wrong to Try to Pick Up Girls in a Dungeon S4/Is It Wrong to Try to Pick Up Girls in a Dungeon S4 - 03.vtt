WEBVTT

00:00:01.738 --> 00:00:04.643
(dramatic music)

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:05.912
- No you don't.

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:07.114
(Bell yells)

00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:22.177
It's reading all my moves.

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:29.158
This thing is different than

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:31.196
any monster we've
ever fought before.

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:34.068
Wait a sec. Is it enhanced?

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:35.739
(Bell grunting)

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.044
(swords striking)

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:44.556
(Bell grunting)

00:00:47.294 --> 00:00:49.165
- [Aisha] Don't go in too deep.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.735
- Backup's on the way.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.306
- No, please don't.

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:55.511
You need to run.

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.715
(monster squelches)

00:00:57.816 --> 00:00:59.485
Don't attack it!

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:00.755
Don't get hit.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:04.729
(Bell grunting)

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.769
(metal clanging)

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.876
(suspenseful music)

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:14.516
(rocks striking metal)

00:01:18.858 --> 00:01:19.859
- Lady Chigusa!

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.433
(Chigusa grunts)

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.483
- [Welf] Wait, it ran away?

00:01:31.584 --> 00:01:34.155
- [Ouka] Chigusa.
Hang in there, Chigusa.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:35.991
(Chigusa groaning)

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:39.164
(wistful music)

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.876
- It's the moss from my dream.

00:01:44.976 --> 00:01:47.447
It's going to overtake
everything.

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:51.757
(water rushing)

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.440
(suspenseful music)

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:04.381
(weapon striking)

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.828
(monster groaning)

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.867
(teeth grinding)

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:21.550
(monster groaning)

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:27.494
(heavy footsteps)

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.004
(shards of glass breaking)

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:35.377
(elves whimpering)

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:40.755
(ragged breathing)

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.493
- Please, don't!

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:45.497
No.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.704
(screaming)

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:52.745
(opening song)

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:24.629
- Oh, Solar Rays.

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.637
I beseech you to ward off
affliction of Soul light.

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:35.383
- What the hell?

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:40.461
It's not working.

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:43.600
- The seed penetrated
them and took root.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.105
It's growing all over their
bodies now.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:51.015
It's been sapping their
strength to use as nourishment.

00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:54.088
- That means healing magic and
potions aren't going to help.

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:55.525
It'll just make it
worse by causing

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:57.595
the vines to grow even more.

00:04:58.262 --> 00:04:59.464
- Chigusa.

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:06.145
- So it's basically a parasite.

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:08.784
The monster is using
them like a leech.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:19.204
- I've never seen
anything like this.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:22.044
I don't think I have what it
takes to be able to save them.

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.346
Sorry.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.655
- What we need
right now are ideas.

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:31.028
Cassandra, please share your
thoughts about this with us.

00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:33.668
Is there anything we can
possibly do to save them?

00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:34.803
- Ugh.

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:37.942
- Nobody is dead yet and
we have a full party.

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.348
I know we can save them if
we put our heads together.

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:44.956
(mournful music)

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:48.162
- Um. In order to save them,

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:49.699
we should go back
up to the surface.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.337
We need a more seasoned healer.

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.341
If we hurry, maybe the Dea Saint

00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:57.615
from the Dian Cecht
Familia could save them.

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.953
Or we try destroying the source

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:01.623
that implanted the seeds.

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.727
That might wipe the plant out.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:07.869
- Okay, what about
the rest of you?

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.106
I wanna hear
everything you've got.

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.177
The only thing that

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.681
I'm good for is combat,

00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.952
which makes me
worthless right now.

00:06:16.052 --> 00:06:19.826
So please think. I need you
to lend me your expertise.

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:22.497
- Yes, Master Bell. Of course.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.069
- Yeah. Bell is totally right.

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.674
So let's put our heads together,

00:06:26.774 --> 00:06:29.879
and maybe we can come up
with some sort of plan.

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.282
- Mmm-hmm.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.685
- Right.

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:35.123
- Personally I think
we've heard our options.

00:06:35.223 --> 00:06:38.329
The very ones, Lady Cassandra
has already mentioned.

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.501
- So either we go back to the
surface,

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:44.007
or we go farther in and hunt
that thing down. Correct?

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:47.347
- Uh-huh. I'm in favor of
leaving the dungeon immediately.

00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:48.684
It's an enhanced species,

00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.623
and it's assimilated a
large number of stones.

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:53.628
We all saw it fight Master Bell.

00:06:53.728 --> 00:06:56.232
Trying to eliminate it would be
dangerous.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.702
- That's for sure.

00:06:57.802 --> 00:06:59.606
But now that begs the question.

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.877
What kind of species are we up
against?

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.716
- If I had to guess,
maybe a Moss Huge?

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.920
Though there
shouldn't be any here.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.993
Those things usually only
spawn on the middle floors.

00:07:10.093 --> 00:07:12.031
- It must have been
consuming magic stones

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.802
and then made its way
down to the lower floors.

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:17.875
- Even if we want to kill it,
this floor is so expansive.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.982
We might have some real
trouble finding it again.

00:07:21.082 --> 00:07:23.821
We also need to consider the
condition of the injured,

00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.394
which is why I think returning
to the surface is best.

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:31.268
- [Luvis] No. That thing
that attacked us

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.406
is bound to show up again.

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:35.778
- Luvis.

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:40.521
- Yeah. Never pictured a world
where I'd be saved by you,

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:42.023
Little Rookie.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.598
My party is still out there.

00:07:45.698 --> 00:07:48.504
They were left behind, and
they're still on this floor.

00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:51.576
You have to take out that
son of a bitch for me.

00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:54.381
Please, save my comrades!

00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:55.951
- You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:58.624
Does that mean you ditched
your party and ran away?

00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:00.661
- Hell no! Never.

00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:03.366
I was the one acting as a decoy.

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:04.769
- What do you mean by that?

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:06.305
And just what makes
you so certain

00:08:06.406 --> 00:08:09.278
the monster will show
up here again?

00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:12.117
- It was after these.

00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:15.323
- Magic stones?

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:18.964
- Seriously? It was hunting
you down for magic stones?

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:22.237
I've never heard of something
like that happening before.

00:08:22.337 --> 00:08:24.942
- Well, it's the truth.

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:28.684
That Moss Huge took us
completely by surprise

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:31.089
and stole our stones.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:34.729
Then it ate them all
right in front of us.

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:37.735
And soon after, it
started to attack us

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:40.106
with overwhelming force.

00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:41.976
(monster growls)

00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:47.822
We ended up with these vines
implanted in our bodies,

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:50.528
which left us with no
choice but to flee.

00:08:50.628 --> 00:08:52.130
But it kept coming!

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.567
It kept chasing after us.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:56.004
- You took the stones to
act as a decoy in order to

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:59.077
divert attention from the
others in your party, I assume.

00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:01.015
- Mmm-hmm.

00:09:01.115 --> 00:09:04.789
The four of us were all
experienced level threes.

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:06.926
We're used to exploring
the lower floors

00:09:07.027 --> 00:09:09.899
and knew not to
underestimate them.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:13.674
But that bastard was far
beyond anything we imagined.

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:16.311
I beg you. Help us,
Little Rookie.

00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:17.915
I know my companions
still have to be

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:20.320
trapped on this floor somewhere.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.657
Oh, and one more thing.

00:09:21.757 --> 00:09:24.094
Dormul's party's also here.

00:09:24.194 --> 00:09:25.864
They need to be warned.

00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:28.504
- Dormul's down here too?

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:30.473
- Well now, isn't that
fantastic?

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:31.943
This thing thinks
adventurers are

00:09:32.043 --> 00:09:33.747
a walking magic stone buffet.

00:09:33.847 --> 00:09:36.285
- Well, damn. We picked
a hell of a time

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:39.626
to go on an expedition. I'm
going to tell you right now

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:41.763
that we can't let
it go unchecked.

00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:43.801
Either we take out
that monster now,

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.809
or a guild exterminator
squad will later.

00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:51.281
- I'm of the mind that we should
kill it right here and now.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.754
The longer that it takes,

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:55.991
the worst the
situation will get.

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:59.599
And I refuse to just leave Luvis
and his companions behind.

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:01.034
- You said it.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.840
And if that thing is on
the lookout for these,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.811
then it should come right to us.

00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.182
- Agreed. Besides
it's too risky.

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.922
They might not last long
enough to reach the surface.

00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:12.692
And there's no guarantee
that Dea Saint

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:14.830
could cure a parasitic
infection like this.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.100
- That may be true,
but we also can't say

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:20.039
for sure that defeating the
monster will cure them either.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.480
- Actually, I think the odds
of it working are pretty high.

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.751
Moss Huge typically
splits its moss apart

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:27.354
and then creates
copies of itself.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:31.563
But those always disappear
if you defeat the main body.

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:34.067
What? Come on now.
Don't give me that look.

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:35.571
I want to avoid
fighting that thing

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.373
as much as you do, you know.

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:39.011
But from what we've seen so far,

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:42.350
I really doubt it's possible
for us to escape peacefully.

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:46.192
- [Liliruca] We've all
had the chance to say

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:49.331
our piece at this point. Master
Bell will need to be the one

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.068
who makes the final call.

00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:58.182
- We are going to
defeat that thing. Come on.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.789
We'll head down to where Luvis's
party was first attacked.

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:05.129
(footsteps)

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.537
- I'm so sorry.

00:11:08.637 --> 00:11:10.173
- It's okay don't be.

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:13.078
And remember, I'm also
just a level two.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.787
I should be apologizing to you.

00:11:16.887 --> 00:11:20.060
If only I had more
healer abilities to use,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.600
then perhaps I could have
saved you right away.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.871
- I have faith, so no worries.

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:31.415
No matter what happens,
everyone will be just fine.

00:11:31.516 --> 00:11:33.186
- You get some rest.

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:35.189
- I'm kind of wondering.
Why have there been

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.532
no eyewitness reports of that
Moss Huge this entire time?

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.135
It's strange.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.507
- That thing probably
avoided being seen

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:46.980
by never taking on anyone
that could possibly defeat it.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.485
If it only attacked
adventurers it could defeat,

00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:51.422
no one could tell the tale.

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:56.165
That's what we're dealing with.
Something very crafty.

00:11:56.265 --> 00:12:00.741
You have to be careful.
That monster is different.

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.445
(footsteps)

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:09.925
- Look at that.

00:12:10.928 --> 00:12:12.531
- A trail of blood.

00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:15.202
- Let's follow it.

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:18.175
(ominous music)

00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:23.319
(water cascading)

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.406
(ragged breathing)

00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:34.942
- They're in bad shape.

00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:36.445
- Oh.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:38.415
Chariot, Lana.

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:39.552
- Is that them?

00:12:39.652 --> 00:12:40.687
- Yes it is.

00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:42.891
But I don't see Aleck anywhere.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:45.964
- This is not going to be easy.

00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:48.036
If we make any move to save
those elves,

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:50.239
not only will that
enhanced monster attack,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.345
but so will a whole slew of
others.

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:56.485
- So are you saying it
knew we would come here?

00:12:56.586 --> 00:12:57.989
- That's hard to believe.

00:12:58.089 --> 00:13:00.259
A monster can set up a trap?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.063
- If we want to win,
we will need to

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:05.070
take them all out with
a wide range of magic.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.209
Of course the elves would
get caught in the crossfire.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:11.015
- Master Bell, Lady Aisha,
you two will

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.718
take out the Moss Huge.

00:13:12.818 --> 00:13:15.257
Master Welf, Lady Mikoto,
Master Ouka,

00:13:15.357 --> 00:13:17.460
you three need to defeat
the other monsters

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:18.930
and save the elves, okay?

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.333
In the meantime, the rest of us

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.871
will watch from here so
we don't get in the way.

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:24.509
Does that work?

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:25.877
- I like it.

00:13:25.977 --> 00:13:28.850
One thing, you are not
going to be here though.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.288
Head for the large room
and wait there.

00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:35.764
(monster crashing through rock)

00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:38.136
(Great Podao Zaga slicing)

00:13:38.236 --> 00:13:41.408
It's going to be a messy
fight you do not want to see.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:42.511
- Roger that.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:47.286
- Let's go.

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:52.631
- Please, no. Stay back.

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.572
- It's not here. This is just-

00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:59.612
(crumbling dirt)

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.421
(Bell gasps)

00:14:09.732 --> 00:14:12.403
(Bell yells)

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:17.882
(blade slicing)

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.654
(Bell yells)

00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:24.528
- Bell!

00:14:29.606 --> 00:14:30.908
- It will be okay.

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:34.347
(suspenseful music)

00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:42.163
- Master Bell!

00:14:44.603 --> 00:14:47.809
(monster growls)

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.477
- Fire bolt!

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:57.393
- Is it trying to keep
me from using magic?

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.468
Get back here.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.340
(Bell yells)

00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:05.043
(monster grunts)

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:07.581
(water splashing)

00:15:07.681 --> 00:15:09.417
- Master Bell!

00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:14.895
- Oh, crap. This is bad.

00:15:14.996 --> 00:15:18.068
(water rushing)

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:33.265
(water cascading)

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:36.506
(Bell yells)

00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:43.887
(water rushing)

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:46.258
- No! Master Bell!

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:47.995
We've got to hurry and save
Bell.

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:49.865
- Liliruca, stop!

00:15:49.965 --> 00:15:51.234
You can't.

00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:54.441
Have you lost your mind?

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.212
We already went
over how dangerous

00:15:56.312 --> 00:15:58.348
the rapids are around here.

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:02.123
- I know, but it's Bell.
He needs us.

00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:04.061
- We took care of
the smaller ones.

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.434
Now help us get the injured
people out of there.

00:16:07.535 --> 00:16:08.636
- Dear Gods.

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.716
Lana, Chariot,

00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:16.017
Aleck.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:21.563
- Lady Aisha, Bell is gone.

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:22.865
- I'm well aware.

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.167
I saw it.

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:29.410
- Unfortunately, I can't sense

00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:31.014
Master Bell anywhere near here.

00:16:31.114 --> 00:16:32.618
- You have to.

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.321
- Let me make this clear!

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:36.793
No one is leaving to
save Bell Cranel.

00:16:36.893 --> 00:16:39.264
- Hey. Wait a minute,
Lady Aisha.

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:41.636
There's no way we can
just leave him.

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:44.074
- You must keep your head
on straight, strategist.

00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:46.044
It's obvious we can't
catch up to him.

00:16:46.145 --> 00:16:49.451
Especially not with
injured in tow.

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:50.286
- Sorry.

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:51.856
- Besides, this is Bell.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:53.827
He's more than capable of making
his way

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:55.062
out of these floors alone.

00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:56.131
- That we're all still alive.

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:57.233
- I can attest that

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:58.670
his status is far from the norm.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.709
He's already better than
most mid-grade level fours.

00:17:01.809 --> 00:17:05.617
In terms of agility alone,
he's certainly among the best.

00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:07.120
I do hate to admit this,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.226
but Bell Cranel's stronger
than I am at this point.

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:13.666
I'm confident he's survived
whatever happened in that water

00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:15.837
- Lady Aisha.

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:17.140
- If I'm being honest with you,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.512
we should be more
concerned about ourselves.

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:20.647
You know that.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.226
- The safety of the party
takes top priority right now.

00:17:27.326 --> 00:17:28.630
If anything happens to us,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.468
then we'll only be a
bigger hindrance to him.

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:32.304
- Fine then.

00:17:32.404 --> 00:17:34.474
But are you okay with that?

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.549
- I have faith Master Bell is
alive.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.885
You should too.

00:17:39.985 --> 00:17:41.421
The situation has changed.

00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:44.829
In that event, we should retreat
from this floor right now.

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:45.864
- Huh?

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.266
- But not for long.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.471
We won't be returning to the
surface yet.

00:17:49.572 --> 00:17:51.141
We're going back to
the cliff that was near

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:54.281
the entrance when we first
arrived on this floor.

00:17:54.381 --> 00:17:57.655
I believe that spot will be
free of aquatic monsters.

00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:00.193
Plus the Moss Huge can't ambush
us there.

00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.533
We'll set up a base, a place
where we can all regroup.

00:18:03.634 --> 00:18:06.204
Lady Aisha, you head back to
Riviera

00:18:06.304 --> 00:18:08.108
and put in a request for help.

00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:09.912
In the meantime,
the rest of us will

00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:12.083
make use of Haruhime's magic.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:15.289
We need to protect the
injured until help arrives.

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:19.130
- Okay. But what if that
enhanced monster attacks again?

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.870
Without Bell or
Antianeira around,

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.372
we won't stand a chance.

00:18:23.472 --> 00:18:26.478
- That's exactly
what I'm planning.

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:29.217
We'll be waiting on a
straight road with no escape.

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.154
By luring it up to us,
we can have

00:18:31.254 --> 00:18:33.259
Mikoto use her gravity spell.

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:34.762
You'll destroy the passageway

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:37.835
and send it plummeting all
the way down to the bottom.

00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:39.137
Crush it flat!

00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:44.147
One problem. The injured will
need to hold out for a bit.

00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:45.449
But don't worry,
we'll make it back

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.688
to that location in one piece.

00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:49.424
What do you think, Aisha?

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:52.163
- I think it's brilliant.

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:55.169
Now get ready to move
out on the double.

00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:56.639
(footsteps)

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.611
(water rushing)

00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:05.189
- Master Bell, I hope
you'll forgive me.

00:19:06.692 --> 00:19:09.464
(soft sobbing)

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:14.207
(cascading water)

00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:16.779
(coughing)

00:19:21.255 --> 00:19:22.591
(uncorking bottle)

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:25.630
(drinking)

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.836
(labored breathing)

00:19:34.782 --> 00:19:37.420
- I fell from all
the way up there?

00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:40.693
I gotta hurry and get
back to the others.

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.471
(intense music)

00:19:48.776 --> 00:19:50.313
Oh no! Iguazu.

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:52.317
- The most dangerous
one is this.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:54.822
A flying monster
known as Iguazu.

00:19:54.922 --> 00:19:57.995
- The fastest monster
on the lower floors.

00:19:58.095 --> 00:20:00.499
(crashing into rock)

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.940
They look like a blur,
and there are so many.

00:20:06.044 --> 00:20:07.213
No way!

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:08.282
What do I do?

00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:09.819
Come on, think fast.

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:12.290
There's not enough time
for me to run for a cave.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.695
And there are other
monsters in the water.

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:16.331
Is this the reality
of the dungeon?

00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:18.402
Of the lower floors?

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:19.938
I'm not gonna make it.

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:24.715
Everybody else is
definitely fighting

00:20:24.815 --> 00:20:27.587
their own fight right now.
And I made them a promise

00:20:27.688 --> 00:20:30.025
that we'd all get
stronger together.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:38.676
- If Miss Ais were here,
I know what she'd do.

00:20:38.777 --> 00:20:39.778
Come and get me!

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:45.422
(Bell yells)

00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:47.828
Move faster. Fight harder!

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:50.934
(triumphant music)

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:52.403
- Lili, is something wrong?

00:20:52.504 --> 00:20:54.508
- No, it's nothing.

00:20:58.817 --> 00:20:59.818
- Wait.

00:21:01.087 --> 00:21:02.557
Something's coming.

00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:11.074
- That's Dormul.

00:21:11.175 --> 00:21:12.344
- Are you Luvis?

00:21:12.444 --> 00:21:14.447
I can't believe you
guys are still alive.

00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:16.552
- Hello. I take it
you're the other party

00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:18.757
that Luvis was telling
us about before.

00:21:18.857 --> 00:21:21.327
It's a relief to see
that you're okay.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.300
- I guess it would seem

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:26.605
we've bit off more
than we can chew.

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:30.479
(Bell grunting)

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:40.232
(water rushing)

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:43.973
(Bell breathing heavily)

00:21:57.568 --> 00:22:00.707
(hands clapping)

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:11.528
- A real mermaid?

00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:17.641
(Ending song)

00:23:46.284 --> 00:23:48.221
- [Bell] Next time: Mermaid.
