WEBVTT

00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:02.972
- (somber violins play)

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:05.410
- A great disaster cometh,

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:08.316
do not approach it,

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:11.623
for it is the
embodiment of ruin.

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:13.226
Do not touch it.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:15.397
For it is the oracle of death.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.107
The squirrels shall bloom
flowers of gore.

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:23.012
The hammer shall
shatter to pieces.

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:26.052
The foreign warriors
shall be broken down

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:28.256
to mere play things.

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.629
Though the blood soaked
harlot absconds

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:35.070
with a keepsake of the fox,
a hoard of ravaging teeth

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.478
and claws shall send her
the way of all flesh.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.286
The companion shall
bequeath sorrow.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:48.296
Take heed, it is a
banquet of tragedy.

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:50.267
(somber violins)

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.275
(winds and water rushing)

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.243
- I don't want anyone to
die, but it should be okay.

00:01:11.343 --> 00:01:14.315
None of the horrors that
I saw will come to pass,

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:18.123
as long as we avoid going
down to the 27th floor,

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.329
into severe plight.

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.803
I just wish I knew what
fate had in store for him.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.345
(Opening Song)

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.962
(epic fanfare)

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:04.368
(Demonic screeching)

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:05.971
- We've got Mermen!

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:16.860
- Mr. Bors!

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.962
- Right!

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:21.637
- [Bors] Take out their leader.

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:23.975
It's the one darker
than the rest.

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.647
- Okay

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:27.749
Hya!

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:33.594
- More trouble incoming!

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:36.533
(laser fires)

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.637
- They've got some light quartz.

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:41.442
- Get ready to rush 'em

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.447
when they run out of
lasers and recharge.

00:03:43.548 --> 00:03:46.018
Rabbits Foot, what the
hell are you doing?

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:00.515
- (Exhales)

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.284
This scarf's incredible.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.087
Not only is it good protection,

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:06.159
but it can also be
used as a weapon.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.361
It's super sturdy,

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:08.798
which means I might be able

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:09.933
to do even more with it.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:11.870
- Hey kid is this really your

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.908
first time on the 27th floor?

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:15.210
- Oh, yeah.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.247
- Well, you're doing
some major ass kicking

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:18.851
with strength like that

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:20.120
I'm thinking about maybe

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.023
letting you head up
the vanguard.

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:24.061
- Oh, well thanks.
That means a lot.

00:04:24.162 --> 00:04:26.901
- Of course, you'll be in
charge of all the annoying stuff

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.107
but we're still gonna split
all the rare drops evenly,

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:31.308
alright?

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:32.345
- Oh boy.

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:33.480
I get the feeling he's

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:35.150
using me like an assistant.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.218
- [Man] You've turned into

00:04:36.318 --> 00:04:37.589
a real powerhouse, Bell Cranel.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.925
- Huh?

00:04:39.025 --> 00:04:40.393
- Do you remember us, Bell?

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:42.465
We've met. We were
part of the group

00:04:42.566 --> 00:04:44.401
who helped you take
out the giant Goliath.

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:46.272
- You mean we all
fought together?

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:48.711
- We're banking on you
to carry the party.

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:49.712
You got this one.

00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:53.253
- I'll do my best! Thanks a lot.

00:04:53.353 --> 00:04:56.091
(tense music)

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.604
- The Gale Wind is proving
pretty damned hard to find.

00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.208
- Sure is. I can't wait
to take her down.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:06.780
- Oh, please. As if you'd
stand a chance.

00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:09.318
We're talking about a freak
of nature who managed to wipe

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:11.657
out an entire familia
on her own.

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:14.829
- Sure. But she had a good
reason for doing that, right?

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.898
- More or less.

00:05:15.998 --> 00:05:18.537
She was taking revenge
in her own hands,

00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:20.808
against the killers of
her old familia.

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:23.346
- And the familia she wiped
out were part of Evilus.

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:25.316
So you can't really blame her,
you know?

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.854
Those bunch of twisted bastards.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:29.225
- She literally eradicated
that familia

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:31.930
by taking out everyone
associated with them.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.671
Even if those connections
were iffy, who would do that?

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:38.878
- [Man 1] Ah, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:41.282
- [Man 2] Even if she's
superhuman, as they say

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.786
we've got enough
manpower down here

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:45.090
on the 27th floor to
beat her for sure.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.192
Don't forget that.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.329
- You're a level four,
aren't ya?

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.434
You gotta be more
confident than us.

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.639
- [Bors] It's time to get
moving ya bums.

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:54.710
We're gonna be splitting
up the party again.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.113
Hey, Rabbit's Foot, you're
coming with me.

00:05:57.213 --> 00:05:57.983
Come here.

00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.652
- Uh, right!

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:01.455
- Find the Gale Wind and

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:03.026
drive her into the cavern.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:04.061
Now let's move out.

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.130
- [All] Roger!

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.533
(Epic music)

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:10.040
- I have to find Ryu
before anyone else does.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.812
(Epic music)

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:21.763
I think my best
option is to wait

00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:23.400
for a chance to ditch the party.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.640
- [Group Member] Bors,
check this out.

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:37.596
- What the flying hell?

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.432
Pretty sure I've never
seen this huge hole

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:41.101
on this floor before.

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.009
- Yeah, it's almost
like something

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:46.312
dug its way through here.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:47.515
It looks like the dungeon

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.084
hasn't started repairing it yet.

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:52.224
- Wait then, does that
mean whatever caused it

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:53.828
is still somewhere nearby?

00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:55.864
- It couldn't be the
Gale Wind, right?

00:06:55.964 --> 00:06:58.169
- I don't think using magic
would've been enough to

00:06:58.269 --> 00:06:59.706
cause something like this.

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:02.612
- So what's our next move, Bors?

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:05.752
- Normally I'd say that we
should hightail it outta here,

00:07:05.852 --> 00:07:08.557
but I can't pass up
a shot at 80 million.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.530
(Ethereal singing)

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.900
- Hey, do you hear that?

00:07:17.108 --> 00:07:18.443
- That singing?

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:20.681
- Okay, I'm gonna
go check it out.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:22.818
- W-Wait!

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:33.841
- He'll catch on eventually

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:36.178
if you keep staring
at him like that.

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:37.716
Alright.

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:39.151
I did a little asking around

00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:42.023
about this Turk guy,
showed up three years ago.

00:07:42.123 --> 00:07:45.130
That's when people started
seeing him around Riviera.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.432
- What's his rank?

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.036
- [Lili] Level two.

00:07:48.136 --> 00:07:50.808
He's apparently come down
to this floor multiple times

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.513
by tagging along the
second class adventurers.

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:55.483
- So that's how he
gained their trust

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.690
by mingling around
with the local folks.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.861
But considering what Bell said.

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:03.399
- I think she has a good point.

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.138
Can you please stay
here on the 25th floor?

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:08.143
There's actually something
I'd like you to do.

00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:09.344
- Ah?

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:10.380
- Keep a close watch

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.584
on that werewolf guy.

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:13.419
You follow me, Aisha?

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.755
Cause well, just in case

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:18.764
he starts doing anything
suspicious.

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:21.837
- A guy hasn't tried to pull
anything weird yet, though.

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:25.577
- It is good to be cautious
and he does seem up to no good.

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:27.381
- Well, let's just kick his ass.

00:08:27.481 --> 00:08:28.449
(All gasps)

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.387
- Have you lost your dang mind?

00:08:30.487 --> 00:08:32.491
- We're wasting time
here people.

00:08:32.592 --> 00:08:34.428
Violence will get us answers.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:36.566
It's quite quick and effective.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:39.305
- Wow. That's some
Amazon mentality.

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:40.440
- Doing that would instantly

00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.377
make everyone hostile
towards us.

00:08:42.477 --> 00:08:44.281
I'm not sure it's
the wisest move.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:46.418
- [Aisha] Then we'll
be more covert.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.091
Alright, you guys go
act lookouts.

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:52.097
- Wait, what exactly
are you planning to do?

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:53.601
- Do I need to say it?

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:55.838
I'm gonna drag him into a
cave and shag it out of him.

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:58.276
- Whoa! Whoa whoa
whoa whoa, whoa!

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:00.179
Please don't say
things like that.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.650
- (Aisha scoffs)

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.854
- Come on, let's get moving.

00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:06.893
Can't just let Bors and the
others handle everything.

00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.566
Nobody is even sure that
the Gale Wind is actually

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.135
on the 27th floor.

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:13.507
So why don't we start
searching this floor?

00:09:13.607 --> 00:09:14.742
- Bors made it clear that

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.746
our job is to stay here
and keep watch.

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.619
I want to get revenge for Jean
by killing that little bitch

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:21.690
with my own two
hands. All right?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.225
- [Companion] We would
only be getting ourselves

00:09:23.325 --> 00:09:24.796
into a fight that we can't win.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:26.634
- [Turk] Some
adventurers you are.

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.436
Don't you wanna make
a name for yourselves

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.508
by taking down a big bounty?

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:32.377
- Come on. Turk knows
what he is talking about.

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:34.615
You gotta be a moron to think
that just sitting around

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:35.784
is a good idea.

00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:36.887
- [Companion] The last
thing we want

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:38.624
is to get chewed out by Bors.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:40.193
So you can go do
whatever you want.

00:09:40.293 --> 00:09:43.600
- [Turk] Fine. Wait here
like a damn baby.

00:09:44.234 --> 00:09:45.236
- Come on.

00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.081
- You're spacing out.
What's wrong?

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:52.350
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:56.693
(Ethereal singing)

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:01.001
(Bell panting)

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.077
(Splashing)

00:10:05.177 --> 00:10:06.045
- Huh?

00:10:06.145 --> 00:10:07.314
- Hey, Marie!

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:08.617
- Bell!

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:14.596
- [Bell] What are you thinking?

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:15.831
You know what's
dangerous to sing

00:10:15.932 --> 00:10:18.135
when there's other
people down here.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:20.072
Marie,

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:22.879
just try to calm down, okay?

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.381
Tell me what happened.

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:30.661
- There's something down
here that shouldn't be.

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:32.397
- What do you mean by that?

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.102
What shouldn't be here?

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:37.775
- I'm not sure.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.714
I don't know when it got
here or where it went.

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:42.952
I have no idea.

00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:44.990
It's something unknown to me.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.058
- Hmm

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.538
So whatever made that hole

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.744
must be hiding somewhere
on this floor.

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:58.684
Marie, have you seen
an elf woman around?

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.186
- Elf Woman?

00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:01.756
- Oh right, uh..

00:11:01.856 --> 00:11:03.961
Someone with ears much
longer than mine.

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:07.668
She's carrying a wooden sword
and she wears a green hood

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.104
and also-

00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:10.273
(gasps)

00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:11.810
does that sound familiar?

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.945
Where did you see her?

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:15.250
Please! You gotta tell me.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.720
- Well,

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.457
- I have to find her
no matter what, Marie.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:24.301
- Over here.

00:11:27.273 --> 00:11:30.012
(Eerie music)

00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:38.763
(Loud hissing)

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:47.380
(Water running)

00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:00.807
(Startled gasps)

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:13.032
- Miss Ryu...

00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:18.142
- Ugh, why are you here?

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:26.859
What reason could you
have for being here?

00:12:27.662 --> 00:12:29.131
- Uh,

00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:29.765
I...

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:32.237
(Sword swishing)

00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:36.345
- Bell Cranel, you need
to leave this floor

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:37.882
right now.

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:39.484
- What? What's going on?

00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:42.123
- Just be quiet and
do what I say!

00:12:43.627 --> 00:12:45.764
You're better off not knowing.

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:47.801
So stay out of this.

00:12:48.837 --> 00:12:49.872
- Out of what?

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:51.809
Tell me what you're doing, Ryu.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.379
Who is that man?

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.028
- Filth like him.

00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:03.499
Deserve to become monster food.

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.853
- Why? What's going on?

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:18.062
(Shuffling footsteps)

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:28.048
- Just gonna keep
following us forever?

00:13:28.148 --> 00:13:29.986
- It makes more sense
to move as a group

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:32.124
if we're going to try
to hunt the Gale Wind.

00:13:32.224 --> 00:13:34.094
Think about it.
Fighting a level four

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:36.566
with a bounty on her
head won't be easy.

00:13:38.335 --> 00:13:41.142
- Our presence here clearly
has them on their toes.

00:13:41.242 --> 00:13:43.479
- He seems really frustrated
about it.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.483
Kind of makes you wonder why.

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:50.226
- I'm starting to think I
should have told Mr. Bell

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:53.399
about the details of my dream.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.908
But, the fairy who is sworn
to be an usher of doom,

00:13:58.008 --> 00:13:59.612
that makes it sound
like Gale Wind

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.816
is responsible for everything.

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:03.987
If the murder of that
man in Riviera

00:14:04.087 --> 00:14:05.356
and the impending disaster

00:14:05.456 --> 00:14:08.095
are really something
caused by her hands,

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.331
then...

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.672
- I am going to put
my faith in Ms. Ryu.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:14.108
- That means one thing:

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:17.213
he will be betrayed
by someone he trusts.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:22.223
(Water splashing)

00:14:22.323 --> 00:14:23.325
- Bell?

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:25.630
Bell!

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.941
- Did she really do this?

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:32.544
No, it couldn't be.

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:46.806
- The victim has numerous
cuts around his arms and legs.

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:51.248
In my opinion, it's very likely
they're from the Gale Wind.

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:52.350
- But why?

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:56.592
(Distant explosion)

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.932
- Bell!

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.037
- Please wait!

00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:04.040
- Don't follow me!

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.648
- Don't go!

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:09.786
- Sorry.

00:15:09.886 --> 00:15:11.087
- Bell!!

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:20.072
(Tense somber music)

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.711
- Whoa. What happened here?

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.851
- Somebody trashed the absolute
crap out of this place.

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:27.988
What the hell does
this kind of damage?

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:29.792
- Hey, these guys weren't
part of the group

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:31.362
that came down with us.

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:33.432
- [Woman] Found another
one over here.

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:34.502
- [Man] Me too!

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:39.612
- [Bell] Was this also Ryu?

00:15:40.581 --> 00:15:41.583
- Hmm?

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:42.785
- Hey, Rabbit's Foot.

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.689
Where the hell have you been?

00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.158
- Yeah, sorry about that.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:47.995
I went off on my own.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.134
- [Bors] Damn it, I've got
no idea what's going on.

00:15:51.234 --> 00:15:52.771
But one thing we know
for sure is

00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:54.909
that a monster didn't
cause this.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:58.950
Hmm? So what's the story
with the dwarf?

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.521
- Oh, um yeah, he was--

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:04.093
- Let me guess, another
victim of the Gale Wind.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.972
Shit. Aren't there any survivors

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:11.242
who can tell us what happened?

00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:14.414
- Bors! I found one
still alive over here!

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:21.328
(Pained whimpering)

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.539
- Hey, can you talk to us?

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.108
What happened here?

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.050
- The Ga-Ga-Gale Wind.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.786
It was that bitch Ryu Lion.

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:37.093
- You say the Gale Wind?

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:38.496
- She fired off this magic,

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:40.366
and something that
could shine bright.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:43.439
Then my vision went
totally white.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.510
- Well, come on and
tell us where she went.

00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:47.013
- Hold on Bors.

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:48.482
Let me treat him first.

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:50.119
- Don't touch me!

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.723
Don't touch me.

00:16:51.823 --> 00:16:53.425
Please don't touch me.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.433
- All right. Just relax.

00:16:57.534 --> 00:16:59.037
I won't then.

00:16:59.137 --> 00:17:00.006
- Look at the poor guy.

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.375
He's traumatized.

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:04.414
Damn that Gale Wind.
She's so messed up.

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:07.354
- Are we really sure
it was her though?

00:17:07.454 --> 00:17:08.256
- Hmm?

00:17:08.356 --> 00:17:10.627
Wait, I recognize you.

00:17:10.727 --> 00:17:12.130
You're Jura Halmer.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.935
- S-so you know
this guy? Really?

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.206
- I sure do. Jura's
a wanted man.

00:17:17.306 --> 00:17:20.748
He's from the Rudra Familia,
which is part of Evilus.

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:23.921
Same faction that wiped
out the Astrea Familia,

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:25.958
which Gale Wind belonged to.

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:28.495
- The Gale wind wants
revenge on him, huh?

00:17:28.596 --> 00:17:30.601
- [Bors] I thought all
of them were long dead,

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:33.940
but somehow this
bastard's still breathing.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.978
- That's right. So what?

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.615
I was the only survivor.

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:39.351
(melancholic violin music)
- But look,

00:17:39.451 --> 00:17:41.856
I've been on the straight
and narrow since back then.

00:17:41.957 --> 00:17:43.594
I've been in hiding
the whole time.

00:17:43.694 --> 00:17:48.469
But, but then she still
found me somehow.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.641
- That explains why
Jean was killed then.

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:53.546
I assume he must have some
connection to this guy.

00:17:53.646 --> 00:17:56.018
- Yeah, seems pretty
likely to me.

00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.186
- Please help me.

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:58.189
She'll kill me!

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.326
I'm a good guy nowadays.

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:03.198
You guys have gotta
protect me from her.

00:18:05.303 --> 00:18:07.608
- W-What do you think Bors?

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:10.479
- Hmm. Now let's not forget
what we came here for:

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:16.225
we are here to collect the
bounty on that elf's head.

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:19.765
This changes
absolutely nothing, okay?

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.002
Actually, we got something
to look forward to.

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:25.877
We'll get even more money by
handing his ass to the guild.

00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:27.681
- Yeah, I like that.

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:32.423
(melancholic violin music)

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:39.772
- What is this?

00:18:43.647 --> 00:18:44.247
- [Man] It's her!

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:46.385
The Gale Wind!

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:49.024
- Hmm?

00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:51.862
(Tense music)

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.038
- She's here, let's get to work.

00:18:56.138 --> 00:18:57.473
- AAAAAAAAH!

00:18:58.242 --> 00:18:59.578
- Step away!

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.352
- AAAAAAAAH!

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:06.559
- JURA!

00:19:08.462 --> 00:19:09.932
(Jura runs screaming)

00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:12.203
- Aim for the legs.
Kill her momentum

00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:15.209
so we can all attack
together and take her down.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:22.490
(Pained yells)

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:24.728
- Don't get cocky
you little shit!

00:19:26.164 --> 00:19:30.305
Huh?

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:35.884
- Wait, hold on a minute.

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:37.286
Were you there too?

00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:43.733
(Loud thud and metal crashing)

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:48.209
- Think it through, okay?

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:49.879
Please just wait.

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:51.849
- You're in my way.

00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:56.391
(Air whooshing)

00:19:58.195 --> 00:19:59.230
- Ah, son of a--

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.900
After her Rabbit's Foot!

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:05.309
(Footsteps thudding)

00:20:06.478 --> 00:20:08.348
- Miss Ryu is the murderer?

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:10.587
I really don't want
to believe that.

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.591
But if that Jura guy really did

00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:16.164
help kill her old
familia. Then--

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:19.270
- I killed every last
one of their members.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.010
Sneak attacks, traps, ambushes;

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.980
nothing was beneath me.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.384
I was driven purely by rage.

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:33.298
(Explosion, music stops)

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:36.404
- Was that Ryu's magic?

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.988
(Bell panting)

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:52.170
- Bell, Bell Cranel?

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.207
- It's you.

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:56.278
- Please. You gotta save me.

00:20:56.378 --> 00:20:58.415
She's gonna kill me.
She'll do it!

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:00.653
(Crying) Please!

00:21:01.822 --> 00:21:04.962
(Distant footsteps)

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:09.403
- Ryu, wait.

00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:15.415
(Eerie and tense music)

00:21:16.485 --> 00:21:19.323
- Why are you always
getting involved?

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:26.271
Go somewhere else.
You're in the way.

00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:29.344
I can't slay that bastard
with you standing there.

00:21:29.444 --> 00:21:33.118
(Jura cries)

00:21:33.218 --> 00:21:35.958
I have only ever made
one real mistake:

00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:39.531
and that was not making sure
that you were dead, Jura.

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:42.136
My arrogance got
the better of me.

00:21:42.236 --> 00:21:43.271
I thought I'd killed you

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:46.044
and it fills me with
so much regret.

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:54.161
I should have completely
snuffed out your life

00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:56.030
when I had the chance.

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:56.932
- Wait, but Ryu,

00:21:57.033 --> 00:21:59.972
(Sword whooshes)

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.123
- I won't hesitate to cut you
down if you try and stop me.

00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:18.543
(Ending song)

00:23:45.449 --> 00:23:48.121
- [Cassandra] Next time:
Lambton.
