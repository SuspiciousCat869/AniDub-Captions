[narrator]
Jean didn't remember anything

00:01:27.722 --> 00:01:30.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
about the night he ate
the hallucinogenic mushrooms,

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.695 position:19% line:89% align:start
including Nadia's kiss.

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:37.765 position:7% line:83% align:start
Her kindness to him ever since
was a great mystery to him.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course, things returned to
normal

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.268 position:24% line:83% align:start
when she grew angry
with him

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:44.304 position:24% line:83% align:start
for not remembering
that romantic night.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.406 position:35% line:83% align:start
Jean missed
an opportunity for romance

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.710 position:33% line:83% align:start
and the shaky
love affair didn't sit well

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.411 position:21% line:83% align:start
with certain members
of the island's population.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.216 position:7% line:83% align:start
With Jean dreaming of invention
and Nadia as irritable as ever,

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.151 position:13% line:89% align:start
all has returned to normal,

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.254 position:16% line:5% align:start
but will they ever leave
their island home?

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:14.468 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.870 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Hey, Jean!

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.337 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:18.906 position:7% line:89% align:start
What are we going to eat today?

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:21.208 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's a secret.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.275 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.747 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] But that's--

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:27.314 position:44% line:89% align:start
Shh.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.818 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't let Nadia hear you.

00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:36.456 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you forget? Nadia
will never eat that, right?

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:39.159 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't you worry,
I thought up a clever plan.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is sure to work.

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:42.697 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hmm. But if it doesn't work,

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.933 position:30% line:83% align:start
she'll just get
angrier, won't she?

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:47.769 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sure it will work.

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.871 position:35% line:83% align:start
You'll get
yourself into trouble again,

00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.372 position:33% line:83% align:start
and just when
we're getting along so well.

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.441 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nadia can always tell
when she's eating meat

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:56.276 position:16% line:89% align:start
by its taste and texture.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.712 position:16% line:89% align:start
Do you follow me so far?

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:01.281 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think. She doesn't do it
for the animals,

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.183 position:16% line:89% align:start
but we think differently.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.686 position:30% line:83% align:start
And it's really
just likes and dislikes.

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:07.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
But do you remember what
her favorite

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.790 position:27% line:83% align:start
from the rations
tasted like?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.726 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, like meat.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right. So we can assume
that it's not the taste

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
she notices but the texture.

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:18.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
So you're going to mix it up
really well

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
so that she doesn't
know it's there?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.769 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.638 position:10% line:83% align:start
But I really haven't mixed in
very much meat yet.

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:25.973 position:33% line:83% align:start
Huh. But what
exactly are you making?

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.910 position:41% line:83% align:start
-This.
-What are those?

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.211 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] It's a mixture covered
in a coating of nuts.

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.982 position:5% line:83% align:start
-You cook them by steaming them.
-Oh.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.684 position:19% line:83% align:start
They call them Chinese
dumplings,

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:38.686 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I've never really
eaten one before.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.922 position:30% line:89% align:start
Are they good?

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.256 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll know as
soon I've eaten one.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.459 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.830 position:7% line:89% align:start
Jean, you would be a good wife

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.497 position:21% line:83% align:start
-if someone made you.
-Only if I were a female.

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:52.600 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
You are much too good for Nadia.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Only if this succeeds.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:55.603 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gong]

00:03:57.772 --> 00:03:58.806 position:38% line:89% align:start
[cracks]

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.241 position:27% line:89% align:start
They're strange.

00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:03.578 position:19% line:89% align:start
They got a little cold.

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:05.980 position:30% line:89% align:start
You like them?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.915 position:35% line:89% align:start
[munching]

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:08.983 position:24% line:89% align:start
They're delicious.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.317 position:33% line:89% align:start
You think so?

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.385 position:10% line:89% align:start
Of course. They're wonderful.

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:13.955 position:30% line:83% align:start
You should have
made these before.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:15.255 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're right.
-You're right.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.624 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.328 position:16% line:83% align:start
You better not have mixed
any meat into these.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.597 position:30% line:89% align:start
Did you, Jean?

00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:24.899 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why would I do
something like that?

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.535 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Marie humming]

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:28.603 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jean sighs]

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
What's the matter, huh?

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
I don't know. I just feel like
I cheated Nadia somehow.

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:38.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, you shouldn't
worry about that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.748 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you haven't
done something wrong

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.415 position:33% line:83% align:start
until someone
catches you doing it.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.287 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I still feel
pretty guilty about it.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.924 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's always the nice guys

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:53.795 position:30% line:83% align:start
who are worried
they've done something wrong.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, what a strange way to
see things. Who taught you that?

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.299 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ms. Grandis did.

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:04.404 position:16% line:83% align:start
Say, do you think you're
ever going to marry Nadia?

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:06.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] I don't know.

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.309 position:38% line:83% align:start
Marriage,
it sounds like a good idea.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.479 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think I'd like to get married
one day. That would be nice.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.016 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Marie] You know, it's
every girls' dream come true.

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:17.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I'd like to be
married before I'm 29.

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Marie] I'm going to
get married before I'm 26.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.489 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
I suppose in this day and age,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.826 position:27% line:83% align:start
things should be
taken care of earlier.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:27.394 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, that girl in Lombard
already got married.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:28.830 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Marie sighs]

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.665 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] But how
could we ever do that here?

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.633 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's no church or minister,

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:34.602 position:19% line:83% align:start
or even a courthouse on
the island.

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:37.370 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Marie] No. But
you could at least get engaged.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.574 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Engaged? What a great idea.

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.776 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I don't have
an engagement ring.

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:43.978 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Marie] Speaking of not having
something,

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.646 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm worried about
tonight's dinner.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.683 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
You are right, Marie.

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
We should probably worry more
about dinner

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
and less about
engagement rings.

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.822 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
You can be so simple sometimes.

00:05:54.922 --> 00:05:56.958 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
I know. I am pretty simple.

00:05:57.058 --> 00:05:58.860 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
I want to go somewhere else.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.427 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Me, too.

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:03.664 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someplace with
a church or a courthouse,

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:08.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
someplace nice,
with plenty of good food,

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:11.404 position:5% line:89% align:start
and shelter, a big laboratory...

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.373 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
I want a fish dinner tonight.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Oh, me, too.

00:06:14.876 --> 00:06:17.144 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm tired of
octopus and kite eggs.

00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:19.547 position:19% line:89% align:start
Octopus and kite eggs.

00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:21.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kite!

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go.

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:26.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What is that?
-What is that?

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:27.922 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a kite.

00:06:28.923 --> 00:06:30.157 position:41% line:89% align:start
A kite?

00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:32.627 position:13% line:89% align:start
This guy will fly very high

00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:34.795 position:38% line:83% align:start
and then
we can get off the island.

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:37.397 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Don't you think it looks
a bit too small

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.966 position:16% line:89% align:start
to carry the four of us?

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're only using this
for a little reconnaissance.

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.004 position:38% line:83% align:start
You see,
only one of us will go up,

00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:44.972 position:13% line:83% align:start
then we'll get a good look
at the island.

00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:48.709 position:13% line:89% align:start
But who's going to do that?

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.679 position:21% line:89% align:start
-Hmm, good question.

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:52.580 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:53.915 --> 00:06:55.650 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.984 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:01.122 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.191 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Hi, King!

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:06.093 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[giggles]
-That should take care of it.

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.995 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, what's
supposed to happen now?

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:11.032 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:29.169 position:30% line:89% align:start
[King growling]

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:32.540 position:24% line:89% align:start
King tells me that

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.108 position:10% line:83% align:start
there's something interesting
over there.

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:38.011 position:19% line:89% align:start
He does? But how did...

00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:40.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
You can understand
what King says, too?

00:14:40.414 --> 00:14:42.550 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, because we love each other.

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:44.351 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.220 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Let's go take a look.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.623 position:35% line:83% align:start
We haven't
explored this island enough.

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:50.658 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Be careful.
-[Marie] Never mind that.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:54.094 position:16% line:89% align:start
We'll be back later. Bye.

00:14:54.596 --> 00:14:56.897 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Marie!
-[Jean sighs]

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:58.666 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? What's the matter?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.035 position:16% line:83% align:start
Did you happen to notice
that King

00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:03.538 position:10% line:89% align:start
was running on his hind legs?

00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:04.672 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, you're right.

00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:09.611 position:16% line:83% align:start
-This is a bizarre place.
-[Jean] Naturally.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:13.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
It appeared out of nowhere
in the middle of the night.

00:15:13.782 --> 00:15:15.550 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is quite bizarre.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.351 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not in that way, Jean.

00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.553 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look at those trees.

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:21.455 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now notice that the trees

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:23.991 position:7% line:83% align:start
over there are of a completely
different type.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:26.927 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:29.664 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those are coniferous trees.
They grow in colder climates.

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:32.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I see something just beyond
those trees

00:15:32.332 --> 00:15:33.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
that reminds me of
the desert.

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.437 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jean] It certainly looks like
those are sand dunes.

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:37.404 position:38% line:89% align:start
Strange.

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:41.609 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think there's a lot
about this island we don't know.

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:43.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm surprised that you think so.

00:15:43.678 --> 00:15:45.580 position:30% line:83% align:start
This isn't like
you at all, Nadia.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.347 position:10% line:89% align:start
You usually deny everything.

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:51.985 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't know what it is,
but I'm feeling uneasy.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:56.558 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't want to know the secret
this island is hiding.

00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.561 position:24% line:83% align:start
We should get away
from here as soon as possible.

00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:01.596 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes. I think that's a good idea.

00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:03.297 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll go get Marie and King.

00:16:03.397 --> 00:16:05.032 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] Hey.
-[both] Huh?

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:06.033 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Marie.

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:08.636 position:27% line:89% align:start
We're going back.

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:11.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
We don't think this island
is a very good place.

00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:14.408 position:10% line:83% align:start
Come and look at the headman
King and I found on the beach.

00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:15.643 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Headman?
-Headman?

00:16:15.743 --> 00:16:18.513 position:16% line:89% align:start
[whimsical music playing]

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:23.585 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:16:23.685 --> 00:16:26.453 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-He looks dirty.

00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:27.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
How horrible.

00:16:28.623 --> 00:16:30.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Someone's on
this island.

00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:31.626 position:33% line:89% align:start
Other humans?

00:16:32.627 --> 00:16:34.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
There was a 16th
century explorer named Magellan.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:37.197 position:30% line:83% align:start
His expeditions
sailed around the world.

00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:40.167 position:30% line:83% align:start
He was attacked
by island natives.

00:16:40.267 --> 00:16:42.402 position:5% line:89% align:start
But does that happen these days?

00:16:43.237 --> 00:16:44.338 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's hard to say.

00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:45.540 position:24% line:89% align:start
If it does happen,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll probably end up like
that poor man.

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.142 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Nadia.
-Yes.

00:16:49.243 --> 00:16:50.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is too dangerous.

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Let's get out of here.
-Right.

00:16:53.848 --> 00:16:56.016 position:7% line:89% align:start
But the headman is still alive.

00:16:56.116 --> 00:16:57.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What did you say?
-What did you say?

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:01.523 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Kick!
-[grunts]

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:03.758 position:27% line:89% align:start
Somebody help me.

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.593 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:09.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll do anything, anything
at all, just please help me.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.533 position:24% line:89% align:start
The head's talking.

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:14.301 position:33% line:83% align:start
He was buried
alive and left for dead.

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:17.104 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton]
I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:18.205 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:20.040 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't worry. You'll be just fine

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
as soon as I get you out
of there.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:22.510 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Ayerton] Th--th--thank you.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.444 position:35% line:89% align:start
Pardon me.

00:17:24.546 --> 00:17:26.681 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hate to be a bother,
but would you happen to have

00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:29.216 position:7% line:83% align:start
-any water with you, young man?
-[gasps]

00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:31.184 position:33% line:89% align:start
I need water.

00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:33.086 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:35.255 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Ayerton.
-[Ayerton] Hmm?

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:36.390 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Is that you?

00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:42.229 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mr. Ayerton, you sure
have drunk a lot of water.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.363 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:17:44.398 --> 00:17:46.199 position:13% line:89% align:start
What a nice natural taste.

00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:49.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
But you're acting like a sponge.

00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:52.640 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes, I know.
I did without for so long.

00:17:53.407 --> 00:17:55.810 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even the spring
water will do for me.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
Although you should be
more careful, children,

00:17:58.445 --> 00:18:01.415 position:16% line:83% align:start
the plankton and microbes
in this water will kill you

00:18:01.516 --> 00:18:03.618 position:30% line:83% align:start
if you continue
to drink it untreated.

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:06.054 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, don't tell us that.

00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:08.823 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh, but it's the absolute truth.

00:18:08.923 --> 00:18:10.725 position:13% line:89% align:start
I know all about microbes.

00:18:10.825 --> 00:18:12.627 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm an expert, you see?

00:18:12.727 --> 00:18:15.630 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right. But can you tell us
how you arrived on this island?

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.197 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you how.

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:21.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll tell you all,
but it's an epic story.

00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:27.107 position:13% line:83% align:start
I, Count Ayerton Grenavan,
was asked by the American Navy

00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:29.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
to sweep the seas
clean of sea monsters

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:32.212 position:27% line:83% align:start
and all went well
until one night when--

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.648 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you said you were
a scientist

00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:35.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
when we first met
you on the ship.

00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:38.118 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
that is my cover story.

00:18:38.218 --> 00:18:40.253 position:33% line:83% align:start
Even the navy
doesn't know the truth.

00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:42.322 position:33% line:83% align:start
Now allow me
to continue my tale.

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:45.893 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was a pitiless night when
we finally spotted the creature,

00:18:45.994 --> 00:18:47.829 position:35% line:83% align:start
but we set
our sights upon it as it--

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:49.797 position:19% line:89% align:start
We know all about that.

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:52.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
We were both on the battleship
with you when it happened.

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.234 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.804 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't you remember
either of us, Professor?

00:18:56.904 --> 00:19:00.908 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, I do. I was just
testing your memory, you see?

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:03.778 position:24% line:89% align:start
Your name is, uh...

00:19:03.878 --> 00:19:05.680 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, it's Jean.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
Right. Oh, of course,
I remember John and Rosebud.

00:19:10.384 --> 00:19:12.352 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Nadia.
-And I'm Marie.

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:15.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right. My good friends,
John, Nadia, and little Marie.

00:19:16.024 --> 00:19:18.425 position:30% line:83% align:start
But you're not
so little anymore.

00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:20.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were this big
last time I saw you.

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:23.296 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all] Hmm.

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:25.533 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, you've
never seen me before.

00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:29.804 position:16% line:83% align:start
No. Let me tell you about
how we attacked the monster.

00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:32.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
The monster attacked you
because you fired on it first,

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:34.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
that's why we fell
into the ocean.

00:19:34.274 --> 00:19:35.877 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:39.279 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes, of course, but you
don't know what happened next.

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:42.215 position:7% line:83% align:start
We soon discovered that the sea
monster was in fact--

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:44.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
[both] The world's first
submarine

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:45.787 position:16% line:89% align:start
of practical use, right?

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:48.221 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know? But how could you?

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:50.692 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's top
secret naval intelligence.

00:19:50.792 --> 00:19:52.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe so. But since
the last time we saw you,

00:19:52.994 --> 00:19:55.730 position:19% line:83% align:start
we've witnessed things
far greater than even that.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
So please only tell
us the truth, Mr. Ayerton.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:20:00.333 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right. I'll tell
you about everything.

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.637 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't suppose
it will matter at this point.

00:20:02.737 --> 00:20:05.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
We encountered
the submarine one last time.

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:07.374 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's where my story begins.

00:20:07.474 --> 00:20:08.876 position:30% line:89% align:start
[cannon fires]

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:12.379 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] We hit the monstrosity
with a full attack.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:16.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
The force of our barrage caused
our ship to shake tremendously,

00:20:16.684 --> 00:20:18.820 position:33% line:83% align:start
which caused
me to fall overboard.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.822 position:21% line:89% align:start
Luckily, I survived.

00:20:20.922 --> 00:20:23.390 position:33% line:83% align:start
But the fleet
had left me behind.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.693 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fortunately, I clung to a barrel

00:20:25.793 --> 00:20:27.895 position:10% line:83% align:start
that was filled with luscious
red apples.

00:20:28.963 --> 00:20:31.566 position:24% line:89% align:start
And I drifted day,

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:33.568 position:35% line:89% align:start
after day,

00:20:33.668 --> 00:20:35.870 position:35% line:89% align:start
after day.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.406 position:10% line:83% align:start
Until at last I found myself
on this island.

00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:41.776 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that all?

00:20:41.876 --> 00:20:44.746 position:33% line:83% align:start
That is only
the beginning of it, little man.

00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:46.914 position:30% line:83% align:start
Terrible trials
were still in store for me.

00:20:47.014 --> 00:20:49.249 position:30% line:83% align:start
Great mysteries
too wondrous to tell.

00:20:49.349 --> 00:20:51.719 position:13% line:89% align:start
The sun rose from the west.

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:54.689 position:30% line:83% align:start
The night once
lasted for 24 hours.

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:58.291 position:33% line:83% align:start
Snow fell on
tropical vegetation.

00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.428 position:33% line:83% align:start
And one day,
after a stretch of dry weather,

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:05.265 position:33% line:83% align:start
the sea froze
into an enormous block of ice.

00:21:06.366 --> 00:21:08.603 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Is that so?
-It is the truth!

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:12.272 position:33% line:83% align:start
You doubt me?
I have no reason to lie.

00:21:12.372 --> 00:21:13.808 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:16.878 position:24% line:83% align:start
The laws of gravity
do not apply to this island.

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:21.314 position:16% line:83% align:start
I found that I could run
much faster than ever before.

00:21:21.414 --> 00:21:23.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
I could jump higher
than anyone on Earth.

00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:26.319 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not only that,

00:21:26.419 --> 00:21:28.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
dark shapes hid among the rocks.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.893 position:16% line:83% align:start
And I could hear weeping
coming from one of the caves.

00:21:31.993 --> 00:21:33.594 position:13% line:89% align:start
The sea glowed every night

00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:36.296 position:19% line:83% align:start
and my food disappeared
without a trace.

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:38.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
There is most definitely
a deep mystery

00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:40.300 position:10% line:89% align:start
at the heart of this island.

00:21:40.935 --> 00:21:42.302 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:46.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
There must be a secret,
but let's not find it out.

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.075 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Hmm.
-[Marie groans]

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:51.012 position:21% line:89% align:start
Marie is very hungry.

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:54.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let's go back to Lincoln Island.

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:55.482 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.552 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait a minute!

00:21:57.652 --> 00:21:59.720 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, you must know
the worst part of my story.

00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:01.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
The part that will
keep you awake forever!

00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:02.957 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:22:04.025 --> 00:22:07.762 position:7% line:83% align:start
I thought I had seen everything
on this island.

00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:09.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
One month ago,
the Kings of Terror arrived.

00:22:09.964 --> 00:22:11.799 position:13% line:89% align:start
[all] The Kings of Terror?

00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:14.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, yes, and let me assure you

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:17.038 position:16% line:83% align:start
that their name described
their behavior perfectly.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.741 position:13% line:89% align:start
Their leader is the worst,

00:22:20.842 --> 00:22:23.010 position:7% line:83% align:start
a witch with a shrieking voice
and blood-colored hair.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.078 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all] A witch?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.850 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes, and the second
is a tall and slender demon

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.118 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the strength
of a thousand men.

00:22:31.219 --> 00:22:33.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
[all] A tall slender demon?

00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:38.092 position:5% line:83% align:start
The last of them is an ingenious
but enormously fat fiend!

00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:39.894 position:24% line:89% align:start
[all] A fat fiend?

00:22:41.028 --> 00:22:43.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
These devils had a servant
that carried them about

00:22:43.931 --> 00:22:46.000 position:19% line:89% align:start
on its four huge legs.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.768 position:19% line:89% align:start
[all] A devil servant?

00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:48.970 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Oh.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.005 position:10% line:89% align:start
When I was captured by them,

00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:53.140 position:7% line:89% align:start
every day was a season in Hell.

00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:56.077 position:16% line:83% align:start
They would screech at me
like wailing banshees

00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:58.646 position:7% line:89% align:start
all through the day and night,

00:22:58.746 --> 00:23:01.816 position:13% line:83% align:start
and force me to choke down
the boiling lava

00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:04.518 position:7% line:89% align:start
they so enjoyed feasting upon.

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:06.520 position:38% line:89% align:start
Terrible.

00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:08.455 position:7% line:89% align:start
It really does sound like hell.

00:23:08.556 --> 00:23:10.658 position:19% line:89% align:start
I tried to escape them,

00:23:10.758 --> 00:23:14.095 position:16% line:83% align:start
but they fell upon me and
left me as you found me today.

00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:16.898 position:7% line:89% align:start
I--I am very lucky to be alive.

00:23:16.998 --> 00:23:20.601 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. But the thing
that worries me is what happens

00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.937 position:30% line:83% align:start
if the Kings of
Terror come back again?

00:23:23.037 --> 00:23:25.405 position:24% line:83% align:start
We better get back
to our island right away.

00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:27.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, let's do that!

00:23:28.576 --> 00:23:30.111 position:27% line:83% align:start
Would you please
take me with you?

00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:33.648 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, of course we will. But
we'll need you to row the boat.

00:23:33.748 --> 00:23:36.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll do anything for you.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[footsteps rumbling]
-What?

00:23:40.588 --> 00:23:44.091 position:21% line:89% align:start
[tense music playing]

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.027 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:23:46.127 --> 00:23:47.995 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all scream]

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:49.897 position:27% line:89% align:start
[all] The Devil!

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:54.168 position:33% line:83% align:start
The Kings of
Terror have come for us!

00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:56.938 position:21% line:89% align:start
[singing in Japanese]
