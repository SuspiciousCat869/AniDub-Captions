[narrator]
Marie was stricken

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.323 position:13% line:89% align:start
with a rare tropical fever.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.260 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nadia begged Captain Nemo
to save Marie, but he refused.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon, Nadia herself was
overcome by the illness.

00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:38.733 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nemo changed his mind

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
and led a rescue mission
to procure an antidote.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.806 position:10% line:83% align:start
Our story continues as Nadia
tries to understand

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:46.440 position:19% line:89% align:start
the mysterious captain.

[engine whirring]

00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:10.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
It looks like we're
ready to go now.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.733 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's see what it can do,
Hanson!

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
Here goes nothing.

00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:21.909 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whoa! The superalloy
from the engine room

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:23.477 position:13% line:89% align:start
can really handle the heat.

00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.812 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no sign of melting.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:26.413 position:33% line:83% align:start
To think that
we invented

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.281 position:30% line:83% align:start
that incredible
mechanical blade

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.651 position:24% line:89% align:start
in only three days,

00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:31.719 position:16% line:83% align:start
you know what that means,
don't you, Jean?

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:34.956 position:27% line:83% align:start
-We're geniuses!
-[Jean] We're geniuses!

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right. Thanks to
this ship's technology.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey there, Jean. How'd it go?

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.598 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh? Hi there,
Monsieur Fait.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:45.332 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you get it to work?

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.435 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes. It was great.
Thank you.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:51.271 position:10% line:83% align:start
The alloy really worked well.
Thanks a lot.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.640 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
That's good to hear.

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:55.576 position:19% line:83% align:start
Glad you could put some
of our spare parts to use.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.879 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, it seems even
the spare parts

00:02:57.912 --> 00:02:59.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
of this ship are amazing.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.217 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:05.318 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.222 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:12.894 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
Hurry, Jean!

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:14.629 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's gonna burn
right through the hull!

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:15.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jean grunts]

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.367 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just made it.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.602 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:24.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah! My glasses!

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.708 position:21% line:89% align:start
Where are my glasses?

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:29.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, no. Oh, please.
I can't see a thing.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.345 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
on the floor?

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[glass cracks, Nadia gasps]
-[Jean] What was that?

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:35.683 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.253 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.424 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear. I am really sorry.

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:49.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
My father brought me these
before he went out to sea

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
so they're the only thing
I have left that he gave me.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
And he was so rarely
ever at home.

00:03:56.804 --> 00:03:58.438 position:27% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean to.

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:00.407 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.847 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, well, don't get
too upset about it, Nadia,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.582 position:19% line:89% align:start
it was bound to happen.

00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:09.984 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's God's way of telling me
not to get too attached

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.351 position:24% line:89% align:start
to earthly objects.

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.423 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, what's wrong?

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:19.459 position:10% line:83% align:start
There's nothing in the world
that can't be repaired

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:20.862 position:19% line:89% align:start
except for human life.

00:04:20.895 --> 00:04:23.998 position:16% line:83% align:start
If something gets broken,
then you just have to fix it.

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:25.867 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you know what I mean, Jean?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.334 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Give them here.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.036 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll make them as good as new.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.506 position:10% line:89% align:start
What? You can fix these here?

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.040 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:35.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
We have all kinds of facilities
on the Nautilus

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.045 position:10% line:83% align:start
so that we don't have to rely
on modern civilization.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:40.715 position:13% line:89% align:start
Wow! This ship is amazing.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:42.349 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yep, that's the truth.

00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:44.952 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
I can't agree with that.

00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:52.560 position:16% line:89% align:start
[sonar] Unidentified ship

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:54.529 position:16% line:89% align:start
detected at two o'clock.

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:57.765 position:5% line:83% align:start
[helmsman] It's moving at a slow
speed leaving a shallow wake.

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.366 position:19% line:89% align:start
Could just be a whale.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.902 position:35% line:83% align:start
[navigator]
It could be a whale.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.770 position:10% line:89% align:start
It could also be the Garfish.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Electra] We are too far away
to tell what it is.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
Move in closer but quietly.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:08.843 position:35% line:83% align:start
[helmsman]
Aye, aye.

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.013 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're fixed already?

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.917 position:7% line:89% align:start
As good as new. You were right.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.085 position:7% line:89% align:start
Wow! Thanks so much, monsieur.

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:20.822 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's just science
properly applied.

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:22.623 position:30% line:89% align:start
It was nothing.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:23.558 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen, Jean.

00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.826 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:25.893 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
Nadia seems kind of tense.

00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:27.494 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.831 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why don't you
give her a present?

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:32.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
The road to a girl's heart
is paved with flowers.

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:35.570 position:21% line:83% align:start
Thank you. Where did
you get these?

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:36.971 position:10% line:89% align:start
We make them in the nursery.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.141 position:24% line:89% align:start
Glad you like them.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.009 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, gotta get
back to work now.

00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:43.845 position:38% line:83% align:start
-So long.
-See you soon.

00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:46.346 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Always treat her right, Jean.
-Of course.

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:51.586 position:16% line:83% align:start
Incredible! This ship is
full of wonders.

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:52.887 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't you agree, Nadia?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
I guess so.

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:57.490 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's the matter?

00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:59.426 position:24% line:89% align:start
Technology is great

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.763 position:10% line:83% align:start
even if it just makes people
lazier and less self-reliant.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:05.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
It does a lot more than that.
It can bring happiness.

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:07.835 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.
-Huh?

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:09.737 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
These are for you.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
such beautiful flowers.

00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:14.175 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where did you get them?

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.443 position:24% line:83% align:start
They cultivate them
right here on the Nautilus.

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
They only use things like
that to distract you

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.053 position:21% line:83% align:start
from their scientific
atrocities, Jean. Hmm!

00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:30.024 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, uh, wait.

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.828 position:30% line:83% align:start
Come on, Nadia.
Please don't act this way.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.463 position:27% line:83% align:start
Flowers and trees
are given to us by nature,

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
so there's no reason
for them to be manmade.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:39.867 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
This is no different

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.702 position:10% line:89% align:start
from what Gargoyle was doing.

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:43.004 position:27% line:89% align:start
But, yes, it is.

00:06:43.037 --> 00:06:44.138 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
Hmm.

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:51.178 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.615 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's a plaque.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.852 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?
-See, Jean?

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:02.523 position:33% line:83% align:start
The Nautilus.
Launched June 21, 1888.

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:05.226 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible!

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the craftsman's
nameplate for the Nautilus,

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:09.797 position:13% line:83% align:start
but what are those strange
letters down there?

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.967 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Eritrium, launched into
the stars,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.537 position:24% line:89% align:start
sidereal year 7962.

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:20.574 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You read that?
-I...

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:22.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't believe you could
decipher that!

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have talents
I did not know about.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.815 position:7% line:89% align:start
I didn't know I could read it.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.217 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
If that's what it says,

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:31.786 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wonder what it means.

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:34.689 position:27% line:83% align:start
What? The plaque
in the engine hall?

00:07:34.722 --> 00:07:37.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's right. The ones
that has the launch date

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.960 position:7% line:89% align:start
of the Nautilus engraved on it.

00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.196 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Oh, so you saw that, did you?
-Yes.

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:44.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
There is another
plaque beneath

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:46.600 position:27% line:83% align:start
that is not made
from metal or stone.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:49.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Um, it says some stuff
about Eritrium,

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.572 position:27% line:83% align:start

Yeah, kill it!

00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:08.710 position:27% line:83% align:start
That one was for
Jean and Nadia!

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:09.577 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:17.552 position:30% line:89% align:start
[men clamoring]

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:19.186 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
Auxiliary engine damaged.

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.021 position:16% line:83% align:start
[engineer] Direct hit to
the diving fins, sir.

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:23.323 position:7% line:83% align:start
Purge all of the resource here
from ballast tanks one

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:24.692 position:7% line:89% align:start
through thirty-two immediately!

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:27.327 position:24% line:83% align:start
But wait, Captain,
that will throw us off balance.

00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:30.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know that. Open all
of the emergency ports.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:30.698 position:24% line:89% align:start
Aye, aye, Captain.

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:35.570 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groans]
Don't let it get away!

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.943 position:33% line:89% align:start
A direct hit!

00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.286 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's hit. We got it.

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:53.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's about time.

00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:59.661 position:35% line:83% align:start
[helmsman]
Depth is 150 meters.

00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.728 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
The water's leaking

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.262 position:16% line:89% align:start
along the starboard side.

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Man the starboard
pumps on the double!

00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:16.544 position:27% line:83% align:start
[helmsman] We've
struck bottom, Captain.

00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:18.245 position:21% line:89% align:start
Depth is 200 meters.

00:16:18.278 --> 00:16:19.547 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nemo]
Release oil reserves

00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:20.748 position:16% line:89% align:start
and purge the aft hangar.

00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:22.216 position:19% line:83% align:start
We must make them think
we are scuttled.

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:23.083 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
Aye, aye.

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:31.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oil and debris had been purged
as ordered, Captain.

00:16:31.158 --> 00:16:32.426 position:30% line:83% align:start
All hands begin
emergency repairs.

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:33.728 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:35.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
The drive system only
has enough power

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:38.332 position:10% line:83% align:start
to make it to the surface one
last time, Captain.

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:41.235 position:10% line:83% align:start
The best we can hope for now
is that the American Fleet

00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:42.670 position:19% line:83% align:start
will believe we're sunk
and sail away.

00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:49.677 position:16% line:83% align:start
It wasn't nearly as tough
as we expected it to be, sir.

00:16:50.612 --> 00:16:52.412 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't make assumptions.

00:16:52.446 --> 00:16:54.582 position:7% line:89% align:start
We'll wait until we have proof.

00:16:54.616 --> 00:16:56.416 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wanna be sure that it's dead.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.086 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Holland]
That was a fighting submarine.

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:00.555 position:16% line:89% align:start
At least 150 meters long.

00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:03.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
What country do you supposed
it could have belonged to?

00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:05.225 position:13% line:83% align:start
I couldn't care less whose
ship that was.

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.160 position:24% line:83% align:start
I only need to know
that it has murdered

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:08.696 position:7% line:89% align:start
thousands of worthy men at sea.

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.164 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let it rot down there.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:16.236 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:19.172 position:7% line:89% align:start
This isn't gonna hold for long.

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:20.642 position:13% line:89% align:start
[screams and alarm blaring]

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:22.175 position:16% line:89% align:start
We have a lethal gas leak

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:23.711 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the second auxiliary
engine room.

00:17:25.847 --> 00:17:27.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
[men screaming]

00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:33.320 position:24% line:83% align:start
We must contain it.
Seal that room off now.

00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:36.356 position:7% line:83% align:start
But Ensign Fait and two others
are still in there, Captain.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:37.257 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:41.161 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Seal it off!
-The men, Captain!

00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:43.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then I will go down there
and get him out!

00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:45.332 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Jean!

00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.535 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean panting]

00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:49.403 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm coming, Monsieur Fait!

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.844 position:10% line:89% align:start
Too strong! Won't budge! Huh?

00:18:00.548 --> 00:18:02.482 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.394 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
They don't have any more
service hatches!

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
But, hey!

00:18:22.537 --> 00:18:23.905 position:30% line:89% align:start
Chief Engineer,

00:18:23.938 --> 00:18:25.372 position:21% line:83% align:start
you must please open
the engine bulkhead

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:26.841 position:38% line:89% align:start
right now

00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:29.209 position:27% line:83% align:start
or Monsieur Fait
will die in there.

00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:31.278 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
He can't do it, Jean.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:34.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'll be exposed to poison
gas if he lets you in there.

00:18:34.682 --> 00:18:36.851 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Oh, no!

00:18:36.884 --> 00:18:39.887 position:19% line:83% align:start
But the ship is full of
advanced technology!

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:42.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
There has to be something
you can do for them!

00:18:42.624 --> 00:18:44.859 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must save Monsieur Fait!

00:18:44.892 --> 00:18:46.159 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
The ship is guarded

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:47.562 position:27% line:89% align:start
by super science,

00:18:47.595 --> 00:18:50.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
but it cannot work miracles.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.866 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is nothing we can do.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:54.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can't do this!

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:57.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
You just can't let him die
like that!

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.272 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have to do something!

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:00.541 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
If we surface,

00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:01.809 position:33% line:83% align:start
we can purge
the poison gas

00:19:01.843 --> 00:19:03.711 position:16% line:89% align:start
and that would save them,

00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:05.847 position:33% line:83% align:start
but we cannot
surface right now.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.881 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:09.316 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
He's right, Jean.

00:19:10.551 --> 00:19:13.721 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we surface, that warship
would destroy the entire ship.

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:15.723 position:30% line:89% align:start
Monsieur Fait!

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:17.892 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
Jean, can you hear me?

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:19.326 position:13% line:89% align:start
We'll get you out of there.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.962 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
Don't bother, Jean.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:22.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
Opening the head would
only endanger

00:19:22.797 --> 00:19:24.331 position:33% line:83% align:start
everyone else
on board.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:27.935 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I-I don't-don't care!

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:30.303 position:27% line:83% align:start
The captain made
the right decision.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.939 position:10% line:89% align:start
If he hadn't closed this off,

00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:34.575 position:19% line:83% align:start
the entire engine room
would be contaminated.

00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:37.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's better for a few to die
than for that to happen.

00:19:37.979 --> 00:19:40.247 position:27% line:83% align:start
It is the risk of
being a sailor.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.481 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're wrong!

00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:42.617 position:41% line:89% align:start
Beasts!

00:19:44.652 --> 00:19:47.955 position:19% line:83% align:start
Captain, listen to me,
you must surface immediately

00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:50.457 position:24% line:83% align:start
and save the lives
of your men.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.627 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why must you protect the ship?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.494 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's so important
about its secrets?

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:55.763 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please, sir.

00:19:55.797 --> 00:19:57.297 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you raise the white flag,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.299 position:19% line:89% align:start
they won't fire on us.

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:02.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
You could save everyone.
You don't have to kill.

00:20:04.806 --> 00:20:08.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
You! You're not human! No!

00:20:08.408 --> 00:20:09.342 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:20:11.679 --> 00:20:14.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
You keep your mouth shut
until you understand

00:20:14.716 --> 00:20:16.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
how much the captain
is suffering!

00:20:27.427 --> 00:20:28.796 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Fait]
Nadia,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.565 position:33% line:83% align:start
the knowledge
aboard this ship

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:33.034 position:24% line:83% align:start
would be dangerous
in enemy hands.

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:35.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
It can't be surrendered
like that.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.305 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you're--he can't...

00:20:38.338 --> 00:20:40.575 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Fait] You have to understand
this, Nadia.

00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:42.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't allow yourself
to think badly

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.478 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the captain for it.

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:48.315 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's the only reason
any of us are on this ship.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:51.485 position:7% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo, please carry out
the ship's mission.

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:54.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't stop until the
Neo-Atlanteans are defeated.

00:20:54.822 --> 00:20:56.557 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please, sir.

00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:59.727 position:33% line:83% align:start
That would be
an honorable memorial for us.

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:02.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jean, please take
care of yourself

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
and keep a good watch over
Nadia, too.

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.801 position:27% line:83% align:start
Give her flowers
and touch her heart.
