00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:02.690 position:21% line:83% align:start
six Garfish submarine

from ten o'clock to
two o'clock.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:05.793 position:19% line:89% align:start
Six of them versus us?

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:07.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is gonna be a tough one.

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.364 position:13% line:83% align:start
What's worse is that we can
be sure that there are more

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.399 position:27% line:83% align:start
on our flank and
beyond our sonar.

a tight pinch, sir.

Twenty-four closing

00:02:39.894 --> 00:02:42.329 position:41% line:83% align:start
They're
creating a Torpedo storm.

00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sixty seconds until impact, sir.

They've broken

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:05.452 position:13% line:89% align:start
Bring all engines to full.

Scrape our belly

That was a good plan, Captain.

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we were any higher, we'd
be sleeping with the fishes.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.701 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Damage report?
-Engines are secure.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:56.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
There's a small
leak in the stern.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.639 position:41% line:83% align:start
What is
the status of the Garfish?

[alarm beeps]

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:01.308 position:35% line:83% align:start
We have six
approaching from the bow

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.810 position:38% line:83% align:start
and four
approaching at two o'clock.

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:05.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
Relative velocity
is approximately eight knots.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.515 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:09.349 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's go, First Officer.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:13.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
Give every tube a full load
of missiles and depth charges

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.856 position:10% line:89% align:start
and begin flooding the tubes.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.357 position:33% line:83% align:start
Torpedo tubes
are now flooding, sir.

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:23.865 position:21% line:83% align:start
Deploy depth charges
to starboard side

00:04:23.898 --> 00:04:25.032 position:21% line:89% align:start
then take a 10-count

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
and fire missiles at
secondary target.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:27.869 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Aye, aye.

00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:31.438 position:24% line:89% align:start
[missiles chugging]

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.541 position:33% line:83% align:start

for initial firing.

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:37.545 position:13% line:83% align:start
Targeting error correction

00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:39.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fire.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.915 position:24% line:89% align:start
[missiles hissing]

00:04:48.923 --> 00:04:50.758 position:19% line:83% align:start

[explosion]

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:06.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
I confirm multiple explosions,
total of six.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.575 position:19% line:89% align:start
That leaves four more.

[explosions]

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:11.979 position:30% line:83% align:start
Four explosions
confirmed, Captain.

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:13.881 position:21% line:89% align:start
No further readings.

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:16.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Electra] All identified Garfish
have been thoroughly destroyed.

00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:24.659 position:5% line:89% align:start
They sent 10 after us this time.

00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:26.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Neo-Atlanteans
are certainly getting bolder.

00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.563 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] First Officer,

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:30.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
how much of our offensive
weaponry is still intact?

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.066 position:30% line:89% align:start
We are at 30%.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.068 position:38% line:83% align:start
Remaining
munition's loading now.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.639 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Sonar,
where are the others?

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:41.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm detecting five more
but it's extremely odd.

00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.544 position:10% line:89% align:start
They're all leaving the area.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.379 position:16% line:83% align:start
They must be falling back
to attack positions.

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:47.849 position:35% line:89% align:start
I doubt it.

00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:50.483 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're all moving out
of their firing range, ma'am.

00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:53.988 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Are they leaving us behind?
-Not very likely.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.957 position:16% line:83% align:start
Stay alert for an attack
from the surface.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.558 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Aye.

00:05:57.592 --> 00:06:00.061 position:24% line:83% align:start

Good Lord. What is that?

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:08.963 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sir, the nautilus has been
surrounded by a magnetic field.

He's got a hold of us now.

We'll be in

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.088 position:33% line:89% align:start
I know that.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's our only chance for escape.

00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:42.897 position:19% line:83% align:start

The engines
can't defeat the field.

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:30.778 position:21% line:83% align:start
Bring all engines to

The ship's out of the water.

00:09:05.713 --> 00:09:08.049 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's some sort of ship
directly overhead.

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:14.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
-What in the world is that?
-Amazing.

00:09:14.388 --> 00:09:16.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
Gargoyle's built
a flying battleship.

00:09:22.096 --> 00:09:24.632 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someone tell us
what's happening now!

00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.967 position:27% line:83% align:start
Civilians are not
allowed on the bridge!

00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.604 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't care about your silly
rules right now, blondie.

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:33.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have a right to know
what we're involved in.

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:35.810 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Well, would you
look at that.

00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:36.710 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] We're
flying in the sky.

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] That big magnet
has a hold of us.

00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:40.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
How can that ship fly
without forward movement?

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:44.685 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] What are those?

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:49.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
[operator 2] Atomic vibration

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
and supersonic wave guns
are in position.

00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:53.894 position:24% line:83% align:start
Final preparations
have been made.

00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:56.197 position:16% line:83% align:start
[follower 1] We are ready
to test the weapon.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.798 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is the technology

00:09:57.832 --> 00:10:00.167 position:27% line:83% align:start
that brought down
the walls of Jericho.

00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:01.402 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.404 position:44% line:89% align:start

Please accept my invitation

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.007 position:35% line:83% align:start

your pathetic crew.

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.310 position:10% line:83% align:start
[female operator] Our target
will be the space titanium alloy

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:10.678 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the Nautilus hull.

00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.012 position:24% line:83% align:start
[operator 3] Proper
pitch is attained.

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:14.281 position:13% line:83% align:start
[operator 1] Maximum energy

00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:16.350 position:10% line:83% align:start
[female operator] All systems
are at optimal performance.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:17.885 position:21% line:89% align:start
[follower 1] Firing.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.664 position:13% line:89% align:start
My word, what's that sound?

00:10:30.698 --> 00:10:33.100 position:13% line:83% align:start
The ship is being bombarded
with electrical waves.

00:10:33.134 --> 00:10:35.202 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wonder what those are for.

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:37.304 position:13% line:89% align:start
[electrical waves buzzing]

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cracking]

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:48.949 position:30% line:89% align:start
[alarm ringing]

00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:50.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
[engineer] The armored plating
on the bow is cracking apart.

00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:52.186 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:10:52.219 --> 00:10:54.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
More cracks are appearing
on our stern and lower hull.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:01.228 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, an atomic vibration device.

00:11:01.262 --> 00:11:03.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have been very busy,
haven't you, Gargoyle?

00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:05.399 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:07.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm amazed that you have
withstood it

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:08.369 position:21% line:89% align:start
this long, Nautilus.

00:11:20.147 --> 00:11:21.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
[engineer] The bow's outer
layer of armor

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:23.050 position:7% line:89% align:start
has been peeled away, Captain.

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:25.019 position:13% line:83% align:start
[sonar] Primary power lines
are shut down.

00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:28.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Captain, what are we to do?
-Hit them with a volley.

00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:29.123 position:27% line:89% align:start
We'll fight back.

He's well-defended.

00:11:38.633 --> 00:11:40.367 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our anti-aircraft weapons will
be useless against his barrier.

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:48.309 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:50.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
[engineer] Our reserve plane
has been destroyed!

00:11:51.946 --> 00:11:53.147 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.115 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're destroying us
one inch at a time.

00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:57.785 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:11:58.385 --> 00:11:59.987 position:7% line:89% align:start
[engineer] Third block damaged.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
Powder magazines have detonated.

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.458 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ah. The fire control system
is being destroyed.

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
The engine is straining
under this load, sir.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:13.500 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:12:13.535 --> 00:12:15.269 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. What now?

00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:18.372 position:7% line:83% align:start
[engineer] Main electric power
systems are offline.

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.274 position:16% line:89% align:start
This can't be happening.

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.742 position:7% line:89% align:start
Looks like the end of the line.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
[operator] The Nautilus
has fallen silent.

00:12:28.882 --> 00:12:29.950 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:31.051 position:27% line:89% align:start
Halt the attack.

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:32.520 position:5% line:89% align:start
Put me in contact with the ship.

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:34.922 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wish to speak
with the Captain.

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:35.789 position:35% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:41.128 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.231 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're receiving a wireless

00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Patch it through.
-Aye, sir.

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:49.203 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] It's been
a long time, Nemo.

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:51.305 position:35% line:89% align:start
Foul demon.

00:12:51.338 --> 00:12:53.340 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Is that you?
-Hmph.

00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:56.176 position:5% line:89% align:start
You haven't changed in 13 years.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.212 position:19% line:89% align:start
Still so terribly rude.

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:00.281 position:10% line:89% align:start
That is none of your concern.

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:01.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Correct.

00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:03.350 position:27% line:89% align:start
Act as you wish.

00:13:03.384 --> 00:13:04.918 position:21% line:89% align:start
You'll soon be dead.

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:08.122 position:13% line:83% align:start
We never did get to finish
our chess match.

00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:11.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
How unfortunate,
unless you'd like to do so now.

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:13.160 position:35% line:83% align:start
There's no
reason for that, Gargoyle.

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.095 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've already won.

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:18.566 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] As stubborn as ever,
old friend.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.834 position:7% line:89% align:start
I regret not seeing you again,

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:24.938 position:7% line:83% align:start
but you are to blame for never
trying to see things my way.

00:13:24.972 --> 00:13:26.940 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, good night, Nemo.

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:29.376 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sleep peacefully forever.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rest in your gilded

[gasps]

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.197 position:16% line:89% align:start

00:14:00.007 --> 00:14:01.543 position:21% line:83% align:start
That is not merely a

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:04.011 position:21% line:89% align:start
but Gargoyle as well.

00:14:04.044 --> 00:14:06.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are we going to pass up
this golden opportunity

to achieve our purpose?

If we self-destruct the particle

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.252 position:7% line:89% align:start
everything will be obliterated.

What is wrong with you, Captain?

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.364 position:19% line:89% align:start
Make up your mind now.

Sir...

00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.907 position:30% line:83% align:start
do you know why
this has happened to us?

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.309 position:33% line:83% align:start
Shall I tell
you the reason, sir?

00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:38.278 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's Nadia, isn't it?
-Mm?

You couldn't stand to harm

Hold your tongue!

Kill yourself if that's what
you really want.

Oh, you don't?

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:57.699 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, our sworn mission

the Neo-Atlanteans at all costs.

I'd hate to ask
you a stupid question.

00:15:43.578 --> 00:15:47.014 position:5% line:83% align:start
But the Gratan isn't going to be
drawn to the magnet, is it?

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:49.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Look at this.

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:52.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
This gun is made of iron but it
isn't being drawn to it, is it?

00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:56.056 position:10% line:83% align:start
They clearly built that huge
magnet to attract only the alloy

00:15:56.089 --> 00:15:57.559 position:33% line:83% align:start
that makes up
the ship's plating.

00:15:57.592 --> 00:15:59.561 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why didn't I think of that?

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.261 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you really
going to escape from here?

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:02.764 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, no.

00:16:02.797 --> 00:16:05.399 position:7% line:83% align:start
I only said that to look bully
in front of Nemo.

We're gonna cut this ship loose.

There's no way in heaven
or Earth

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to let
that ignorant girl

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.407 position:35% line:83% align:start
die with my
beloved Captain Nemo.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.676 position:30% line:89% align:start
Absolutely not.

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:16.210 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's right.

00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:18.145 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should never give up
without a fight.

00:16:19.547 --> 00:16:20.648 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course not.

00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:22.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
We won't kill ourselves.

00:16:22.483 --> 00:16:26.286 position:13% line:83% align:start
We have to devise some way
to survive until the very end.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.523 position:7% line:89% align:start
How do you propose we do that?

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:30.424 position:33% line:83% align:start
We only have
one missile on board.

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:33.628 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not only that, but the launching
tube has been disabled,

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:36.063 position:27% line:83% align:start
so please tell me
how we can counterattack!

00:16:36.096 --> 00:16:38.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
How do we get out
from under this rotter

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
without getting our knickers
dirty in the process?

00:16:40.835 --> 00:16:42.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Leave that to us!
-Leave that to us!

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:43.505 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:45.472 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] There is a way.

00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:48.175 position:10% line:83% align:start
They will most likely utilize
their large missile bay

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.077 position:35% line:83% align:start
in order to
deliver their final blow.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.345 position:21% line:89% align:start
In order to do that,

00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:53.280 position:19% line:83% align:start
they will have to lower
the barrier, right?

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:54.782 position:7% line:89% align:start
Right. Then we'll fire right up

00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:56.483 position:21% line:83% align:start
its launching tube at
that very moment.

00:16:56.518 --> 00:16:58.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
And after that,
it blows up, right?

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.320 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup.

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:02.757 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thereby using Gargoyle's attack
to launch our counterattack.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.424 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be absurd.

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:06.828 position:16% line:83% align:start
We don't even know where
that opening is going to be.

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:10.330 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'm sure we'll find it.
-So all we have to do is look.

00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.667 position:24% line:83% align:start
I say we must have
complete faith

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.368 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the probability
of our success.

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:17.104 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you sure, sir, manually?

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:18.773 position:35% line:89% align:start
Precisely.

00:17:18.806 --> 00:17:21.174 position:27% line:83% align:start
Our missile tube
must be opened by hand.

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.476 position:21% line:89% align:start
See to it right away.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.478 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aye, aye.

00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:26.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
But who will be able
to aim it

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:27.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
at the battleship's
missile tube?

00:17:27.247 --> 00:17:28.716 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] That you can
leave to us, Captain.

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:36.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
Feel free to use this chance
to make a counterattack, sir.

00:17:39.794 --> 00:17:41.829 position:10% line:89% align:start
Arrivederci, my Captain Nemo.
