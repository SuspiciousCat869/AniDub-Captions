our heroes and their newfound
friends

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:31.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
were allowed to board
the Nautilus

until the Gratan
could be repaired.

Although Jean and Hanson were
thrilled

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.666 position:33% line:83% align:start
to be aboard
the technological marvel,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
not everyone was pleased
with this development.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.605 position:19% line:83% align:start
Grandis quickly changes
her opinion

of the elusive Captain Nemo,

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:48.509 position:7% line:89% align:start
but Nadia is still suspicious.

When Nemo finally meets Nadia,

00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:52.747 position:24% line:83% align:start
he's shocked to see
the Blue Water.

-Yes.
-I see.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.839 position:10% line:83% align:start
I also know that this matter
is none of my affair, Captain.

What's wrong, Nadia?

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing's wrong, dear.

Oh, what's going on?

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
Would you two mind
keeping it down a bit?

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.671 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ugh.
-Don't be so rude, Jean.

Thanks so much.
That is a great help.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:16.798 position:13% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Captain Nemo.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:18.900 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, good morning.

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:20.735 position:21% line:89% align:start

-First Officer.
-Yes?

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:28.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must speak to
you about our passengers.

What, sir?

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:32.245 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.313 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.248 position:19% line:89% align:start
Captain's orders, Jean.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.784 position:41% line:83% align:start
There's
nothing I can do about it.

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.486 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, Captain's orders?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.990 position:7% line:83% align:start
You will be able to visit Nadia
anytime you like, though.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:45.660 position:7% line:89% align:start

Tell us why this must be!

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
All right. It's because
both of you are almost grown.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.939 position:10% line:83% align:start
It wouldn't be proper to have

it's strange

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.975 position:33% line:83% align:start
that they've
suddenly decided

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:36.043 position:10% line:89% align:start
to put that boy in our cabin?

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.444 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:38.946 position:35% line:83% align:start

supposed to keep an eye on us.

suppose Jean would let himself

-No.
-It's just another reason why

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:47.989 position:13% line:83% align:start
the quicker we get off this
dreary submarine

Well, there you have it,

Yes! I'm coming along also.

We've got to do
a good job on this.

We can't afford

we are.

Must see just how...

And you want to get in good

Enough!

This is the only way.

-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:35.395 position:30% line:83% align:start
This mission is
much too dangerous.

If anyone's going to be

it should be the two of us.

00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:41.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right. We need to
do an exemplary job

we forgot to bring her with us.

I see. That's good.

there's no time for that.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:46.379 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's within grasp.

00:20:46.748 --> 00:20:48.883 position:27% line:89% align:start
Extend the arms.

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:51.318 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not that way! Stop, stop!

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.321 position:19% line:83% align:start
Move a bit to the left.
Now right.

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:57.759 position:7% line:89% align:start
Extend the arms a little more.

00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:00.494 position:19% line:89% align:start
Good. Get ready for it.

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:01.629 position:35% line:89% align:start
Get ready.

00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:03.698 position:27% line:89% align:start
Grab it! Grab it!

00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:07.034 position:21% line:83% align:start
-We've lost pressure!
-Shut off the red valve!

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:08.335 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:21:08.836 --> 00:21:10.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Watch it!
-Now!

00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:12.405 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] You got it!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
You've got the last one.
Don't let go.

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:16.443 position:27% line:89% align:start
[all] We got it.

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:18.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] Keep her straight
and move quickly.

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:19.614 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all] Right.

00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:20.715 position:7% line:89% align:start
[man] We're almost out of time.

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:22.583 position:24% line:89% align:start
Slow speed astern.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.387 position:24% line:83% align:start
[helmsman] Another
30 meters and she's clear.

[screaming]

00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:35.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're cracking open.

00:21:36.363 --> 00:21:37.865 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Sanson! Hanson!

00:21:37.899 --> 00:21:39.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
Be careful you'll
hit us with the mine.

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:42.103 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:44.739 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm doing
everything we possibly can!

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:47.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
It looks like engine two
and three are dead, Hanson!

The Katherine is coming
right toward us, Captain!

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.685 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't let it sink. Hurry up
and let go of that mine, Hanson!

hands, brace for impact!

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:04.525 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sanson! Hanson!

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.828 position:7% line:89% align:start
Jean! Please answer me! Please!

00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:09.496 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here!
-[Sanson] All together!

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.599 position:19% line:89% align:start
[all] One, two, three!

00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:18.506 position:35% line:83% align:start
[helmsman]
Katherine has landed on us.

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:20.608 position:21% line:83% align:start
Engine to full speed!
Vertical ascension!

-Good.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.622 position:41% line:89% align:start
Steady.

00:23:08.623 --> 00:23:10.958 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[crew] Set it down...
-It sure is hot today.

00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:13.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we can feel that,
then I guess we're alive.

00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:16.463 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I think we survived.

[crew over mic]
Prepare crew to the top deck!

00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:19.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Prepare crew to the top deck!
-Ms. Grandis even forgave us.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.803 position:19% line:83% align:start
And did you notice that
she only slapped us once?

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:25.139 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes. One slap
and she breaks down crying.

00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:27.942 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Nadia was crying a lot, too.

00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:30.978 position:27% line:83% align:start
So tell me, Jean,
what did you learn from this?

00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:33.781 position:16% line:89% align:start
That I really hate mines!

00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:37.718 position:35% line:89% align:start
