[narrator] The idyllic
island life Nadia had envisioned

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.793 position:30% line:83% align:start
was long since
shown to be a fantasy.

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:35.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
Typhoon winds tore apart
our heroes' simple home

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.497 position:13% line:89% align:start
and were even strong enough

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:40.501 position:7% line:83% align:start
to deliver a neighboring island
to their shore,

00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
truly a marvel of Mother Nature.

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:45.205 position:24% line:89% align:start
On the new island,

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.474 position:10% line:83% align:start
they discovered their former
friend, Ayerton,

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:51.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
who warned them that the Kings
of Terror would soon arrive.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.752 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:01.188 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's them, the Kings of Terror!

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
A creature of that enormity must
be from the prehistoric era.

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:06.360 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Wow!
-I don't care where it's from,

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:08.696 position:21% line:83% align:start
-just what it'll do.
-In July of 1899,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.431 position:13% line:83% align:start
the world will be destroyed
by the Kings of Terror.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.568 position:35% line:83% align:start
All living
things will be its prey.

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:14.669 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's an ancient prophecy.

00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:19.741 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well, that means we still
have ten years left to go.

00:02:19.774 --> 00:02:22.710 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, but perhaps they want to
get an early start

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:24.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
and destroy things gradually.

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:27.749 position:30% line:83% align:start
-So you mean...
-We're their first victims.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:28.816 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Gangway!
-Huh?

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.251 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.823 position:30% line:89% align:start

-[Marie] Wait!
-Look, Nadia.

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.268 position:7% line:89% align:start
We can run really, really fast.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.937 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:52.640 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:54.374 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not only can you run faster,
you can jump farther.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:55.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
Watch!

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:02.550 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Marie giggling]

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:10.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
What a mysterious
fantastic island.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.225 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

Huh?

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:38.986 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:41.455 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.991 position:19% line:89% align:start
How do we stop it now?

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.661 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll take care of everything!

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.597 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Witch] Well, did you find
yourself some servants?

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:53.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] Oh, shut up and kill
me if that's what you want.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:57.471 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Witch] If you're so smart,
how come you ran away from me

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.874 position:16% line:83% align:start
and came all the way back
around from behind?

00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:03.678 position:5% line:83% align:start
My private fleet will anchor off
of these shores any day now.

00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:05.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
When it does, you're
going to be sorry you met me.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:08.415 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Witch] I'm so
tired of your arrogance.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:10.051 position:30% line:89% align:start
Bow before me!

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:11.719 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

00:04:11.753 --> 00:04:13.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
I understand you see.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
Surely we can
work out a deal, can't we?

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.592 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Witch] No more deals!

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:18.993 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.394 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please, please.
Hey, listen to me.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.497 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have an offering for you.

00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.599 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you want it?

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.003 position:21% line:89% align:start

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:43.483 position:16% line:89% align:start
At least that stopped us.

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:44.351 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.624 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Witch] Regardless
of your petty little problems...

[Grandis Gang] The Grandis Gang
is back in action.

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.363 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:57.464 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Who's there?

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.901 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Huh? Oh.
-Is that really you, Nadia?

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.770 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Jean!
-Marie and King.

[slow music playing]

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:14.949 position:33% line:83% align:start
I heard you.
The Nautilus was sunk, was it?

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.552 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes, and it was Captain Nemo

00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.054 position:5% line:83% align:start
who helped us all four escape in
the nick of time.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.924 position:21% line:83% align:start
I cannot believe that
powerful ship was bested.

00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:24.391 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really hate to admit it

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
but Gargoyle's giant flying
battleship

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.795 position:5% line:89% align:start
was the strongest one after all.

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.797 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] So my dear Nemo was...

00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:31.899 position:27% line:89% align:start
And Ms. Electra.

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:34.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tragic. All those
brave seamen are dead.

[King purrs]

Hmm.

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:43.343 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Sweet, Captain.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.818 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Marie] What a giant boat.

00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:52.053 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can say that again.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:53.453 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sure can.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.755 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have no idea

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.991 position:7% line:83% align:start
that a submersible of this size
even existed.

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.659 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's beyond modern science.

[sneezes]

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.429 position:33% line:83% align:start
No one taught
them their manners.

Welcome aboard our ship.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:05.967 position:16% line:89% align:start
Make yourselves at home.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.035 position:13% line:83% align:start
You do not have to identify
yourself

to someone wearing a mask.

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:13.507 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right. I am 1st Officer
and lecturer at your service.

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:14.675 position:19% line:89% align:start
Pardon us, good woman.

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:15.943 position:38% line:89% align:start
I might.

00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:17.645 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Who are you?
-Huh?

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:19.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am the captain of
this mighty submarine.

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:21.949 position:16% line:89% align:start
And you may call me Nemo.

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:23.985 position:35% line:83% align:start
One moment,
tell me your name again.

Nemo.

-Good day.
-Nemo, Captain Nemo.

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:30.124 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.129 position:30% line:83% align:start
[sighs] I shall
never see him again.

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.831 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Don't worry.
-Huh?

00:06:36.864 --> 00:06:39.033 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't jump
to such conclusions.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.068 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure they're all alive
and well somewhere.

00:06:41.102 --> 00:06:43.170 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, Jean, you certainly have
grown up

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:44.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
to be a strong young man.

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:46.707 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right? Right?

00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.142 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:50.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, you don't have an eye
for men yet, young lady.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.080 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm sure glad
three of you are safe.

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:55.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
We owe it all to
my brave Gratan.

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
So how did you all
end up on this island?

00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.687 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you for asking.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.023 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's an epic tale fraught with
danger, suspense,

00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:03.691 position:16% line:89% align:start
and redheaded derring-do.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:06.160 position:10% line:83% align:start
We set out from the Nautilus
to launch our counterattack

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
against the flying battleship,
but we got caught.

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:10.531 position:13% line:89% align:start
The crossfire was horrible.

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:11.666 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.836 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I remember that, you
fled before the battle was over.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.138 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] Not true.

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:18.471 position:21% line:89% align:start
We had a brief chance

00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:20.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
to actually put our plan
into effect.

00:07:20.608 --> 00:07:22.710 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] In the end,
it was up to me to deliver

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:24.645 position:13% line:89% align:start
that flying behemoth a blow

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:26.847 position:19% line:83% align:start
it would jolly well not
soon forget.

00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.750 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:32.253 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] Everything
was fine up to that point.

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.821 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Then the enemy
submarines

00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.156 position:30% line:83% align:start
blew a hole in
our balloon,

not knowing where we would land.

00:07:38.225 --> 00:07:39.927 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] After several days,

00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:43.030 position:10% line:83% align:start
we drifted ashore and landed
on this charming little island.

00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:45.032 position:7% line:89% align:start
But our troubles weren't over.

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:48.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
We found that this dummy of
a count was already living here.

00:07:48.202 --> 00:07:49.236 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.905 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you just call me a dummy?

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:53.107 position:10% line:83% align:start
You better never ever call me
that again,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.875 position:30% line:83% align:start
you scoundrel,
do you understand?

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.244 position:5% line:83% align:start
Listen, dummy, if I want to call
you a dummy

00:07:57.278 --> 00:07:58.946 position:27% line:83% align:start
then you will be
called a dummy!

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.247 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you understand that,
you dummy!

00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:01.949 position:27% line:89% align:start
Of all the cheek!

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:04.618 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just told you not to call
me that, you hear me, do you?

00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:07.121 position:30% line:83% align:start
Somehow I just
can't seem to stop myself.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.657 position:13% line:83% align:start
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy,
dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.490 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] Stop that.
Stop that right now.

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:11.726 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:12.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you say something, dummy?

00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:14.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What was that, dummy?
-[Ayerton] Nothing.

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:15.997 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Nothing, eh? Dummy.
-[chuckles]

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.865 position:10% line:83% align:start
So you are the dreaded witch
all along, right, Ms. Grandis?

00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.867 position:27% line:89% align:start
What? What witch?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.802 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's what
the man with the beard said.

00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:23.637 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[King purrs]
-He's a liar.

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:25.239 position:10% line:89% align:start
Never believe a word he says

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:27.274 position:19% line:83% align:start
and be sure not to turn
your back on him.

00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:29.076 position:38% line:83% align:start
-A liar.
-[King purrs]

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.747 position:21% line:83% align:start
He lorded over us and
then stole our food and liquor

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
and left us nothing
of our own to live on.

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:37.551 position:19% line:89% align:start
We put a stop to that.

00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:39.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] So that's why
he was buried in the sand.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.655 position:13% line:83% align:start
I knew there was something
suspicious about him.

00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:43.257 position:21% line:89% align:start
I never trusted him.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.659 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, Hanson, the Gratan has been
grounded

00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:47.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
because the balloon has
been hauled?

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:50.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, we'd have been off
this island a long time ago.

00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:53.267 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why don't you simply repair
the canvas then?

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excellent point.

00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:56.937 position:19% line:83% align:start
We finally have enough
people to do it now.

00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:00.641 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's been far too long since
I've had a project to work on.

00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:03.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well now, you sound sentimental.

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:06.047 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's nothing to do
on a deserted island.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.149 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Well,
this island is also deserted.

00:09:08.182 --> 00:09:09.917 position:35% line:89% align:start
Then again,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
science is the art of making
something out of nothing.

00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.020 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] That's right.

00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:16.991 position:24% line:83% align:start
Um, but this is no
ordinary desert island.

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:19.960 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[both] Huh?
-[Grandis] Hanson's correct.

00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:21.962 position:33% line:83% align:start
There are no
other living creatures,

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:24.865 position:13% line:83% align:start
but we sense that something
is very much alive here.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mr. Ayerton told us
that this is a peculiar island.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:30.037 position:13% line:83% align:start
So I guess that means he's
not a complete liar.

00:09:30.071 --> 00:09:32.940 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.975 position:7% line:89% align:start
I am not a liar, or a butcher,

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:37.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
or what you savagely call
a dummy.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:40.147 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, then what exactly are you?

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:44.151 position:10% line:83% align:start
I, my ignorant friend and the
one and only true Count Ayerton,

00:09:44.185 --> 00:09:46.087 position:7% line:89% align:start
and now, I shall make my leave.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:49.156 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Grandis]
What was that all about?

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.592 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Ayerton] Goodbye, rubble!

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.061 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's in a hurry.

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.697 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what the devil is here
for him to hurry off to?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.898 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:57.932 --> 00:09:59.667 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think he's
going to steal my boat.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.268 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's that you're saying?

00:10:01.302 --> 00:10:04.772 position:10% line:83% align:start
He's going to strand us here
and take our island for himself.

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:07.141 position:13% line:83% align:start
Are you telling me there's
another island

00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:08.142 position:24% line:89% align:start
in this area, Jean?

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:19.019 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

00:10:19.053 --> 00:10:20.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
The other island
is getting smaller.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.756 position:38% line:89% align:start
Smaller?

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.625 position:30% line:89% align:start
[wind blowing]

00:10:26.127 --> 00:10:27.695 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's another one.

00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:29.930 position:10% line:89% align:start
How did we miss seeing that?

00:10:29.964 --> 00:10:31.432 position:27% line:83% align:start
Did you all come
from over there, Marie?

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:32.733 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:10:32.766 --> 00:10:34.268 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] That's strange.

00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:37.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
That island was not
there before, I swear it.

00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:38.706 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jean] You're right, Hanson.

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.841 position:10% line:83% align:start
You see, this island appeared
suddenly

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:42.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
after last night's storm.

00:10:42.243 --> 00:10:43.377 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.214 position:5% line:83% align:start
So this island suddenly appeared
to you after last night's

00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:49.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
storm and now that island
is getting smaller.

-[laughs]
-This one's moving.

00:10:51.452 --> 00:10:53.821 position:10% line:89% align:start
Jean, you should know better

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:56.390 position:10% line:83% align:start
than to say ridiculous things
like that.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.859 position:7% line:89% align:start
But it's the only explanation.

00:10:58.893 --> 00:11:02.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
There is no possible way
that could happen, Jean.

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:03.964 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hanson?
-Hmm?

00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:06.400 position:21% line:83% align:start
What's a scientist's
most important tool?

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:08.068 position:5% line:89% align:start
What kind of a question is that?

00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:10.070 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It's his sixth sense.
-What?

00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:12.973 position:21% line:83% align:start
You cannot see it but
there are many things on Earth

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:14.909 position:5% line:89% align:start
that mankind doesn't understand.

00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:17.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
So it's the intrinsic duty
of the scientist

00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:18.812 position:5% line:89% align:start
to make them intelligible to us.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.814 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:24.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
The sun will rise
as always tomorrow.

00:11:24.318 --> 00:11:27.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will prove my theory
scientifically then.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:30.457 position:10% line:83% align:start
But we must first get to the
other island in order to do so.

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:32.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:35.996 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because I did not remember to
bring my encyclopedias with me.

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:47.107 position:13% line:89% align:start
Maybe it really is moving.

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:50.077 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jean] It will move up
even farther tomorrow.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
We're going to move the Sanson's

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.250 position:21% line:83% align:start
if we move away from
Lincoln Island?

Marie likes it because
everyone else is there now.

00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:00.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true.

And it's much
safer to live like that

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:22.102 position:5% line:83% align:start
the same thing we've been eating
every day.

00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:23.437 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.907 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's [indistinct]
plenty of pepper!

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.543 position:13% line:89% align:start
If it's not to your liking,

00:13:28.576 --> 00:13:31.045 position:13% line:83% align:start
then you don't have to eat
it right, Nadia?

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:32.980 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:35.883 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Why are you wearing
a mask, Nadia?

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:38.620 position:35% line:83% align:start
She doesn't
like the smell of fish.

00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:41.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] What a pity
that you can't join us

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:42.423 position:19% line:89% align:start
in this scaly delight.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.259 position:13% line:89% align:start
[all] Thanks for the food!

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.928 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm going to
need your help, Jean.

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:50.064 position:30% line:83% align:start
The hut we have
now is far too small.

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:52.466 position:24% line:83% align:start
And so you'll help
me build a larger one.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:53.967 position:13% line:89% align:start
Young Master Jean is coming

00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:54.636 position:27% line:83% align:start
-with me, Hanson.
-Wait, Sanson, I think that's--

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.936 position:33% line:89% align:start
Not so fast!

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:57.605 position:38% line:83% align:start
Jean said
he was going to help me

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.440 position:13% line:83% align:start
fix the Gratan's operating
systems today.

00:13:59.473 --> 00:14:01.175 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hanson?

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:03.310 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know it's your turn
to do dishes this time.

00:14:03.344 --> 00:14:06.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
-So your work will have to wait.
-Oh.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:07.981 position:7% line:89% align:start
I beg your pardon, Ms. Grandis.

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.483 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:14:09.517 --> 00:14:11.952 position:27% line:83% align:start
May I cook lunch
for everyone today?

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:13.487 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Lunch?
-I really wanna try it.

00:14:13.521 --> 00:14:16.156 position:27% line:83% align:start
But are you sure
you can accomplish it?

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.257 position:35% line:89% align:start
I can try.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.129 position:5% line:83% align:start
I suppose there's always a first
time for everything

00:14:22.162 --> 00:14:23.464 position:35% line:83% align:start
when you're
a youngster.

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:26.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
Besides, I could really use
a little time to myself.

00:14:28.536 --> 00:14:31.338 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] So, Jean?
-[Jean] Yes.

00:14:31.372 --> 00:14:33.608 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are things well
with Nadia and yourself?

00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.676 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:37.344 position:30% line:83% align:start
-We get along.
-That's good.

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:38.580 position:21% line:89% align:start
Have you done it yet?

00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:40.347 position:21% line:89% align:start
Have we done it yet?

00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:42.015 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Done what?
-What?

00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:44.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
You know-- never mind.

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.153 position:19% line:89% align:start
Of course, we haven't.

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.988 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't know why.

00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:50.525 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you love someone, it's the
most natural thing in the world

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:52.326 position:19% line:89% align:start
to express it somehow.

00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:55.963 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then I think we express our love
through regular quarreling.

00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:58.666 position:33% line:83% align:start
Jean, let me
give you a little advice.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
Listen up, a woman
can't resist the male body.

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:04.338 position:16% line:83% align:start
The sight of our muscles
make them weak on their knees.

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's what makes them
want us so badly. [laughs]

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.545 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure Nadia isn't a bit
different in that regard.

00:15:10.578 --> 00:15:12.379 position:27% line:89% align:start
I understand now.

00:15:12.413 --> 00:15:15.048 position:27% line:83% align:start
I should take up
a sport or something.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.684 position:7% line:83% align:start
This device will save your life
the way it saved

00:15:16.718 --> 00:15:18.986 position:19% line:83% align:start
that of a skinny little
man child

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.321 position:24% line:83% align:start
whom all the girls
referred to as 'beanpole.'

00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:24.324 position:16% line:83% align:start
Day and night, he worked
desperately to build himself up

00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.994 position:35% line:83% align:start
and no one
despised me-- I mean, him--

00:15:27.027 --> 00:15:29.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
once he became a strapping,
muscular,

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:31.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
too-handsome-for-words man.

00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:34.234 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you see, Jean,
brains don't win a girl's heart.

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:37.070 position:33% line:83% align:start
Smart men are
intrinsically very lonely.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.573 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Ayerton] How was that?

00:15:38.606 --> 00:15:41.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, your hands are
working magic on me.

00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:43.110 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] Is lunch ready yet?
-And there.

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.046 position:21% line:89% align:start
Not quite yet, dear.

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:48.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nadia will be preparing
a special luncheon for us today

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:49.551 position:24% line:89% align:start
as a special treat.

00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:52.587 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, Nadia's cooking today?

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.088 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're going to have to put in
more spice

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:57.291 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you want it to
taste good, Nadia.

00:15:57.324 --> 00:15:59.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can taste it,
so it's best that I don't.

00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:01.596 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all groans]

00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.066 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:10.505 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:15.108 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm building out my muscle so I
can be a strapping muscular man.

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:17.579 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're trying to attract
Nadia's attention, right?

00:16:17.612 --> 00:16:19.046 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:20.380 position:38% line:89% align:start
We know.

00:16:21.516 --> 00:16:23.217 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know what I'm doing?

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.752 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it, Jean.

00:16:24.786 --> 00:16:26.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
She already likes you.

00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:29.657 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just now she's cooking a yummy
meal, just for you, right?

00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:30.725 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:32.727 position:30% line:89% align:start
A meal for me?

00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:38.465 position:27% line:89% align:start
What is all this?

00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:39.734 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It's food.

00:16:40.568 --> 00:16:42.737 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I'm sure it will
taste just wonderful.

00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:45.640 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's her first try.

00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:48.175 position:7% line:83% align:start
What do you say we stop talking
about it and give it a taste.

00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.111 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yum.

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:53.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
But the plates
seem kind of dirty, ma'am.

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.550 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, that's because
you couldn't be bothered

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.251 position:13% line:89% align:start
to wash them like I asked.

00:16:57.284 --> 00:17:00.087 position:21% line:83% align:start
I told you that I had
to work on the Gratan.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nadia, your cooking
is so delicious.

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:03.625 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Nadia] You like it?
-It really makes up

00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:05.092 position:35% line:83% align:start
for the way
it looks at first sight.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.761 position:38% line:89% align:start
[choking]

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:09.831 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
What's the matter, Jean?

00:17:09.864 --> 00:17:12.032 position:38% line:89% align:start
[choking]

00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.135 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean!

00:17:19.373 --> 00:17:20.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
That looks painful.

00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:22.142 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry, Jean.

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:24.044 position:38% line:83% align:start
Don't let
it trouble you so much.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.582 position:13% line:83% align:start
Come now, men don't give up
on love

00:17:27.615 --> 00:17:29.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
over trivial matters
like fish bones.

00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:33.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think you'll ever
be able to forgive me?

00:17:33.655 --> 00:17:36.256 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
It's going to be okay.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't worry because everything's
going to be okay.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.498 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't think
I should forgive her?

00:17:44.532 --> 00:17:46.834 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't need to do anything
at this point, Jean.

00:17:46.868 --> 00:17:48.636 position:44% line:83% align:start
-See?
-You mean just do nothing?

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.540 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't even talk to her until she
comes to you with an apology.

00:17:52.574 --> 00:17:54.474 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't just ignore her now.

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:55.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen, Jean.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:58.478 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's all very scientific so
you must remember

00:17:58.513 --> 00:18:00.380 position:7% line:89% align:start
that if you give in to a girl,

00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:03.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
she's sure to take advantage of
your kindness.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:04.719 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you sure about that?

00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:09.323 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was always polite and kind to
Grandis and just look at me now.

00:18:09.356 --> 00:18:10.725 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm still not so sure.

00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:13.327 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, girls love
a guy who's very smart.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.329 position:24% line:83% align:start
So if you show off
your intelligence a bit,

00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:18.198 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nadia will fall for you
over and over again.

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:20.868 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's still just
a regular girl like the rest.

00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:22.436 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:25.405 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying I should study
and invent some more.

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:28.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
But Sanson told me I should
develop my muscles

00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:29.343 position:27% line:89% align:start
to win her over.

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:31.478 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, that's
some interesting advice.

00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:33.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
But let me ask you
an important question, Jean.

00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:35.883 position:7% line:89% align:start
See any girls in love with him?

00:18:35.917 --> 00:18:37.619 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jean] I better start studying.

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:39.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will capture Nadia's heart

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:42.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
by applying myself to achieve
higher knowledge.

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.191 position:30% line:83% align:start
To start with,
I'll prove my theory

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.193 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the sun is moving
slowly now

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:48.195 position:33% line:83% align:start
because this
island is heading west.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:49.597 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Jean!

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:51.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Studying again?
-No, I'm not studying right now.

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:53.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm calculating this island's
location.

00:18:53.768 --> 00:18:55.235 position:16% line:89% align:start
Calculating and whatnot?

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:56.904 position:30% line:83% align:start
That certainly
sounds like studying to me.

00:18:56.938 --> 00:18:58.539 position:19% line:89% align:start
Never mind all of that.

00:18:58.573 --> 00:19:00.775 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you stop exercising
and keep calculating,

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:02.877 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll turn into an ugly
purse bag like Hanson.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.946 position:7% line:89% align:start
But Hanson told me to do this.

00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:07.715 position:30% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, I'll
become a stupid muscle head.

00:19:07.749 --> 00:19:09.316 position:21% line:89% align:start
Is that what he said?

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:12.486 position:41% line:89% align:start
Wrong!

00:19:13.655 --> 00:19:15.723 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't listen to him.

00:19:15.757 --> 00:19:16.924 position:33% line:89% align:start
Listen here.

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.726 position:10% line:89% align:start
When a woman looks for a man,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.327 position:16% line:89% align:start
she is trying to acquire

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.897 position:7% line:83% align:start
that which she does not possess
herself.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.866 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, do you know the one thing
men have

00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:26.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
that women are
looking for?

00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:27.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
A mustache?

00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:28.603 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:30.470 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Power.
-Ah!

00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:31.572 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:33.741 position:35% line:83% align:start
Men protect
their power with muscles.

00:19:33.775 --> 00:19:34.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, the women...

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.276 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, yes.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.344 position:35% line:89% align:start
They cook!

00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:38.813 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean!

00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:40.748 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why do I get
the sneaking suspicion

00:19:40.782 --> 00:19:43.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
that we're drawing closer
to death with each forkful.

00:19:43.618 --> 00:19:44.952 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is madness.

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:47.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
You cannot go on letting Nadia
cook our food like this.

00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:50.490 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's not something I decided.

00:19:50.525 --> 00:19:52.760 position:30% line:83% align:start
She asked me if
she could try it again.

00:19:52.794 --> 00:19:54.662 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I said that she could do it.

00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:58.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes, but don't you remember
what happened last time?

00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.535 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's only the second time.

00:20:00.568 --> 00:20:03.236 position:5% line:83% align:start
If she doesn't get any practice,
she will never improve.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
But if she keeps
practicing like this,

00:20:05.707 --> 00:20:09.242 position:16% line:83% align:start
certain young men may go
to heaven before she improves.

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:10.545 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, it's not as though

00:20:10.578 --> 00:20:12.980 position:10% line:83% align:start
her cooking is any different
than Ms. Granva's.

00:20:13.014 --> 00:20:15.348 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd like you to name one time

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.852 position:21% line:83% align:start
my cooking has killed
anyone, Sanson.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:20.822 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, now, Nadia didn't intend to
do anything wrong,

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.557 position:19% line:89% align:start
so we should be kinder.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.527 position:13% line:83% align:start
So if we die and she meant
no harm, that's fine with you?

00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:29.530 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now don't read too much
into what I said, Sanson.

00:20:29.564 --> 00:20:31.699 position:19% line:83% align:start
Look, spicy food tastes
much better

00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:33.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
than the bland fair
you enjoy.

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:36.704 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah! Would someone deliver me
from this terrible island

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:39.006 position:33% line:83% align:start
so that I can
eat some real food?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.775 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] Hanson, why haven't
you gotten the Gratan fixed yet?

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:42.309 position:16% line:89% align:start
What are you waiting for?

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:43.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because you're always
taking Jean

00:20:43.511 --> 00:20:44.846 position:7% line:89% align:start
away to work on your projects.

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:45.880 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] That's enough!

00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:49.650 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can't you see it's silly

00:20:49.684 --> 00:20:51.519 position:10% line:83% align:start
to fight about such trifling
matters?

00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:53.453 position:24% line:89% align:start
Leave Nadia alone.

00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:54.622 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:55.923 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
You must maintain
the health of the group.

00:20:58.092 --> 00:21:00.762 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is a sure way
to ensure happiness for all.

00:21:00.795 --> 00:21:03.497 position:35% line:83% align:start
These petty
arguments tear the very fabric

00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:05.600 position:21% line:83% align:start
that keep this little
community together.

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:09.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, you speak like
a real-life count, Mr. Ayerton.

00:21:09.103 --> 00:21:11.773 position:33% line:83% align:start
Perhaps I had
you all wrong before now.

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:16.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes. How I miss my
salad days in majestic England.

00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:19.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
My pockets were always filled
with gold

00:21:19.046 --> 00:21:21.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I never wanted for
anything.

00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:25.019 position:16% line:83% align:start
I invited so many ladies
to my birthday parties,

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:28.055 position:10% line:89% align:start
which lasted for days on end.

00:21:28.089 --> 00:21:31.759 position:7% line:83% align:start
We served liqueurs and spirits
from every corner of the world

00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:34.929 position:10% line:83% align:start
and our tables groaned under
the most extravagant meals

00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:36.363 position:19% line:89% align:start
you could ever imagine.

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:38.566 position:19% line:89% align:start
We feasted like kings.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.967 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.036 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hello?

00:21:51.813 --> 00:21:53.446 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's a good boy.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.715 position:41% line:89% align:start
Who is?

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:57.018 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not many men would be
as forgiving as he is.

00:21:57.051 --> 00:21:59.386 position:16% line:89% align:start
That is so rare anymore.

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:00.955 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am. But...

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:02.455 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't have to tell me.

00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.692 position:30% line:83% align:start
You think he'll
lose interest in you?

00:22:06.426 --> 00:22:08.461 position:7% line:89% align:start
It can't be helped I'm afraid.

00:22:08.495 --> 00:22:10.631 position:38% line:83% align:start
Women are
always living with that fear.

00:22:10.665 --> 00:22:11.999 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Really?

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:15.603 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] Jealousy,
longing, attachment, anxiety.

00:22:15.636 --> 00:22:17.572 position:13% line:89% align:start
These complicated feelings

00:22:17.605 --> 00:22:20.107 position:13% line:83% align:start
are always raging around in
our heads.

00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:21.676 position:16% line:89% align:start
It reaches such a fervor

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:24.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
that nothing else in our life
has meaning for us.

00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:27.114 position:38% line:83% align:start
We exert
everything for their sake.

00:22:27.148 --> 00:22:28.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:28.583 --> 00:22:30.852 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's how love is, see?

00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:34.589 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've never been in love
with someone before.

00:22:34.622 --> 00:22:37.158 position:30% line:83% align:start
I never really
wanted to be in love ever.

00:22:37.191 --> 00:22:39.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still, I didn't think
it would hurt this much.

00:22:39.961 --> 00:22:42.830 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now that I know how it feels,
I think I was right.

00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:44.131 position:19% line:89% align:start
The pain is unbearable.

00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:46.534 position:27% line:89% align:start
You do love him.

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:49.770 position:7% line:83% align:start
It seems like many of the nice
things in life

00:22:49.804 --> 00:22:51.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
have traps hidden
inside them.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.140 position:38% line:89% align:start
So true.

00:22:53.174 --> 00:22:55.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't even count
how many times

00:22:55.442 --> 00:22:57.678 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've cried over being in
love before.

00:22:57.712 --> 00:22:59.080 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:22:59.113 --> 00:23:00.480 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Yes.

00:23:00.514 --> 00:23:02.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
However, I can
remember each one clearly.

00:23:03.017 --> 00:23:05.987 position:13% line:89% align:start
All of those broken hearts.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
Tell me, Nadia.

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:08.556 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Yes?

00:23:08.589 --> 00:23:10.992 position:27% line:83% align:start
Was Captain Nemo
your father after all?

00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:17.397 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry,
that was impolite of me.

00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:21.569 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's all right. And yes, he was.

00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:24.672 position:33% line:83% align:start
We have both
suffered a loss then.

00:23:24.705 --> 00:23:27.440 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, at least you still
have Hanson and Sanson.

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:29.176 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, of course.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.979 position:5% line:89% align:start
But those two are like the moon.

00:23:32.013 --> 00:23:34.582 position:21% line:83% align:start
They circle around me
constantly,

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:36.751 position:24% line:83% align:start
but they will never
get any closer.

00:23:40.855 --> 00:23:42.890 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Ah, yes!
-What is it?

00:23:42.924 --> 00:23:45.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you like,
you may call me Mama.

00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:47.561 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Mama?

00:23:47.595 --> 00:23:51.799 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] If Nemo was here,
it may have come to pass.

00:23:51.832 --> 00:23:52.733 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Mama.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
