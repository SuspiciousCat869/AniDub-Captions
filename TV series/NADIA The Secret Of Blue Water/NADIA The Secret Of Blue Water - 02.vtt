[narrator] The year was 1889.

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:30.758 position:30% line:83% align:start
It was the year
of the Paris World Exposition,

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
a showcase of the world's
scientific marvels.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jean, a young inventor,
came to Paris

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.700 position:21% line:83% align:start
to present his brand
new aircraft

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.869 position:16% line:83% align:start
He was soon charmed by a
mysterious circus performer,

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:45.439 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nadia, and her pet lion, King.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the lovely girl
had a secret.

the wonderful jewel
Nadia wore around her neck.

00:01:56.784 --> 00:01:58.653 position:10% line:89% align:start
The evil trio kidnapped Nadia

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:01.789 position:21% line:83% align:start
and spirited her away
on their massive airship.

00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:04.826 position:19% line:83% align:start
Fortunately, Jean came
to her rescue.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.427 position:13% line:83% align:start
Will he discover the secret
of Blue Water?

Let's finish this
as quickly as possible.

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just leave it to us.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.369 position:7% line:89% align:start
Few things are more humiliating

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.304 position:21% line:83% align:start

I would want to go

And, so, which country
would that be?

-I don't know.

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:55.837 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Oh, no.

Yes, King.

He thinks that I was born
in Africa.

he could be right.

The foils lift the ship up
