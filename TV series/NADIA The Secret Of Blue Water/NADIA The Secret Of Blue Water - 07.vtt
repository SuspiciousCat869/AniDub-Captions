[narrator] The evil soldiers
have captured Marie and King.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.261 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia sneaked into
the secret base to rescue them,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.397 position:7% line:83% align:start
only to find that their mission
was fraught with danger.

Meanwhile, the cunning Gargoyle
plots his wicked destiny.

Trapped by soldiers,

Nadia turned herself in
to save Jean's life.

[Gargoyle] It's
been so long, Nadia.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.690 position:30% line:83% align:start
I never thought
we would meet again.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.527 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
you before in my life.

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.328 position:19% line:89% align:start
You wouldn't remember.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
You were still a baby then.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:13.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's understandable.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:17.170 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't you like to know
when we first met?

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.876 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, thank you. I don't
want to know any murderers.

You're just like your father,

hardheaded to the end.

00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:29.751 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now then,
where is the Blue Water?

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.453 position:13% line:89% align:start
I threw it into the ocean.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.589 position:47% line:89% align:start

[Gargoyle] Don't
you care what happens to them?

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.436 position:13% line:89% align:start
I told you I threw it away.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.204 position:33% line:83% align:start
Your threats
can't bring it back.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:52.540 position:16% line:89% align:start
They have nothing to do--

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.644 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] I'll ask again.
Where is the Blue Water?

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:58.646 position:27% line:89% align:start
In the Atlantic.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:00.480 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

Marie, please, don't look.

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:18.733 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
Don't allow your stubborn nature

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.635 position:19% line:89% align:start
to cause another death.

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.236 position:24% line:89% align:start
You beast! Stop it!

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.372 position:19% line:89% align:start
You murder so casually!

God will never forgive you
for what you have done!

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:28.576 position:10% line:89% align:start
I won't tell you where it is,

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.578 position:16% line:83% align:start
no matter how many times
you ask me!

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
Set Marie and King free now
and release the people--Oh.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Your angry
words have betrayed you.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:40.454 position:33% line:83% align:start
Tell me where
the Blue Water really is.

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.926 position:30% line:83% align:start
She is a lovely
child, isn't she?

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:49.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you want
to be responsible for her death?

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:53.668 position:21% line:89% align:start
You call me a beast,

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
yet you're willing to trade
her innocent life

00:03:56.738 --> 00:03:58.840 position:19% line:89% align:start
for a piece of jewelry.

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:01.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is the Blue Water
really worth that much?

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:06.547 position:10% line:89% align:start
You will regret this forever.

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:09.884 position:24% line:89% align:start
[whimpers, grunts]

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:17.759 position:33% line:89% align:start
Please wait.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.862 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you.

Jean...

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:30.738 position:19% line:83% align:start
the boy who brought me
to this place, is holding it.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:37.879 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Nadia.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.921 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Jean.

[sirens wailing]

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
Find that boy.
Search every shaft and cavern.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.867 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't even let a mouse

[sirens wailing]

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.909 position:30% line:83% align:start
They must have
Nadia inside the castle.

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:13.346 position:5% line:89% align:start
But there are too many soldiers.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.554 position:30% line:89% align:start

You've got to--

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.628 position:21% line:89% align:start
Listen to our hearts.

00:05:27.662 --> 00:05:29.063 position:30% line:89% align:start
And let us go.

[all] Ohh.

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:34.135 position:13% line:83% align:start

Well, now, what's the plan?

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.032 position:21% line:83% align:start
First, it's important
that we get

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:07.134 position:24% line:83% align:start
some well-deserved
rest and relaxation.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:08.736 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea.

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
All that awful
manual labor wore me out.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.476 position:19% line:83% align:start
And it almost mussed up

Why do you call me that?

I was instructed to address
you as Princess

are treated accordingly.

There is no need to address me
in such a manner.

Regardless of that,

We are living

Oh, but of course.

on doing something as clichéd

[Gargoyle] My dear colleagues,

00:17:49.403 --> 00:17:54.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
the day we have worked toward
for so long has finally arrived.

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:57.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tonight the power
of Atlantis will rise again.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.724 position:13% line:83% align:start
After 12 long years and an
enormous expenditure of funds,

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:12.527 position:21% line:83% align:start
our plan has finally
come to realization.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is my unparalleled honor
to share the fruits of our labor

00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:18.866 position:19% line:89% align:start
with you here tonight.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.235 position:13% line:83% align:start
Without your unconditional
cooperation,

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:25.238 position:10% line:83% align:start
this fulfillment of our hopes
would never have been achieved.

00:18:25.272 --> 00:18:27.474 position:19% line:83% align:start
Therefore, you will be
the first to witness

00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:30.277 position:33% line:83% align:start
the advent of
light from the gods.

throughout the world.

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:36.718 position:7% line:83% align:start

We will supplant the old gods.

00:18:39.386 --> 00:18:42.557 position:7% line:83% align:start
Neo Atlantis will lead mankind
away from their deviant ways

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.258 position:7% line:89% align:start
and back to the one true path.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:48.763 position:10% line:83% align:start
We will reclaim the paradise
ruined by unworthy hands

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
and rule a united planet.

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:54.468 position:30% line:83% align:start
