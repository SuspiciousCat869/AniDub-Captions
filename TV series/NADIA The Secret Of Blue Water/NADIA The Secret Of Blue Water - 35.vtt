[narrator] She grew
up not knowing where

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.123 position:21% line:89% align:start
or when she was born.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
A girl without a past

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.829 position:33% line:83% align:start
who possessed
the stone of destiny,

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.498 position:7% line:83% align:start
then she met Jean and together
they have set off for adventure

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
around the world, until now,

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:43.838 position:33% line:83% align:start
for they have
arrived at her homeland,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
and the secret of her birth
will soon be known.

[Jean] What an enormous lake.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.969 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] And yet no
one seems to live near it.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.243 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nadia, is this it?

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:27.381 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Nadia, what's wrong?

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.616 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:34.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't drive this
without permission!

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:36.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sorry, we have to follow her.

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:41.495 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia!

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.296 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia!

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.332 position:38% line:83% align:start
Where do
you think you're going, Nadia?

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.200 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hey.
-Nadia, snap out of it, Nadia.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:48.468 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia.

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:01.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're going to
sail right into her, Jean!

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna let Nadia
go in there by herself!

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.419 position:7% line:89% align:start
Grandis, get the balloon ready.

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:06.821 position:35% line:89% align:start
You got it.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.890 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jean, we've already detached it!

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:09.957 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Huh?

[magical music playing]

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:19.967 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can anyone tell me
what's happened to that girl?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.494 position:21% line:89% align:start
Who can explain this?

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.398 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's very uncanny, isn't it?

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.301 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I thought she was strange
from the very beginning.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.269 position:35% line:83% align:start
Once again,
I was right all along.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:57.572 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ow!

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is she being drawn
by the powers of Atlantis?

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:04.712 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, she looks like
a puppet on a string out there.

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:06.013 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't care.

00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:07.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We have to believe her.
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:15.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:25.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Nadia, you have
to hang in there, Nadia.

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:26.868 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Nadia!

00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jean, I must have been dreaming.

00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:33.040 position:38% line:89% align:start
Dreaming?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.745 position:33% line:89% align:start
So terrible.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:41.516 position:16% line:83% align:start
The rain, the black rain
wouldn't stop coming down.

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.851 position:24% line:89% align:start
There was a flood.

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.954 position:7% line:89% align:start
My body felt like it was empty.

00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:50.057 position:30% line:83% align:start
Water filled up
every empty place.

00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:51.759 position:19% line:89% align:start
The rain kept falling,

00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:55.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
everything was washed away.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.698 position:24% line:89% align:start
Everybody drowned.

00:04:57.732 --> 00:05:00.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
I kept crying and
hoping it would stop,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.469 position:16% line:83% align:start
but my tears only caused
the flood to grow.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.875 position:24% line:83% align:start
You, Grandis, Marie
and the others were all drowned.

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.077 position:21% line:89% align:start
And you became fish.

00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:12.914 position:19% line:83% align:start
You flowed into my body
along with the water.

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:14.982 position:41% line:89% align:start
[moans]

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:19.887 position:30% line:89% align:start
I heard a bell.

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.389 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, my head hurts so much.

00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:26.761 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Jean?
-[Jean] Yes.

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:28.996 position:27% line:89% align:start
Jean, I'm scared.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.599 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm too scared
to know everything.

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:34.802 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm terrified
that it will all come true.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:35.770 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Don't worry.

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:38.973 position:16% line:89% align:start
I promised you, didn't I?

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.942 position:35% line:83% align:start
I promised
that I would come here with you.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.644 position:10% line:89% align:start
I will be right by your side.

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:45.613 position:33% line:89% align:start
We all will.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:47.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
So you see.

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.650 position:5% line:89% align:start
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.418 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whoa, it's hot.

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.720 position:30% line:89% align:start
Man, is it hot!

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.857 position:35% line:89% align:start
[crashing]

00:05:57.725 --> 00:05:59.794 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, come on now, what's this?

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.062 position:24% line:89% align:start
An invisible wall?

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:02.897 position:24% line:89% align:start
[tires screeching]

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.565 position:27% line:89% align:start
What will we do?

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:05.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] I think we should
head back.

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:07.434 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, really?

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.003 position:30% line:83% align:start
I guess you're
going to run away now.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:12.439 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton] No, all I'm saying is
that we should find another way.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:14.508 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] We'll go forward.
-Huh?

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:19.513 position:19% line:89% align:start
[magical music playing]

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:24.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
The barrier has been
removed now. Let's go.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:30.691 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow. Let me try that, please.

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:33.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, please, Nadia,
let me try that, too, Nadia.

00:06:33.794 --> 00:06:35.029 position:38% line:89% align:start
Stop it.

00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.766 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Marie.

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:43.671 position:7% line:83% align:start
But the power of the Blue Water
is very dangerous.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
Only those in the royal
bloodline

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:47.742 position:35% line:83% align:start
can handle
its abilities.

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:48.876 position:38% line:89% align:start
The what?

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:58.786 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Oh, my Lord.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.453 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't believe this

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:03.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
-if I wasn't seeing it.
-Me neither.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:05.960 position:27% line:83% align:start
She can really do
anything, can't she?

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.561 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's incredible.

00:07:07.595 --> 00:07:10.064 position:7% line:89% align:start
She's not a normal human being.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jean] This reminds me
of the island that sank.

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:16.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
-[Nadia] They're the same thing.
-[Jean] They are?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.439 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] They're the legacy of
the ancient people of Atlantis.

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:23.844 position:38% line:89% align:start
A dragon.

00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:25.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
It looks like it's
already dead, though.

00:07:27.515 --> 00:07:28.983 position:10% line:89% align:start
Some kind of ancient animal.

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:32.119 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] There
are so many of them.

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.891 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] How can creatures
like this be locked in cages?

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:39.226 position:5% line:89% align:start
What in the world is this place?

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] This is the ark
that the Old Testament spoke of.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
The earth men referred
to it as Noah's Ark.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.503 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Earth men?

00:07:49.537 --> 00:07:50.871 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is the ark?

00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:52.940 position:7% line:89% align:start
How can this thing be the ark?

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] The earth men did
what was right in their own eyes

00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:01.916 position:30% line:83% align:start
without regard
to what God wanted of them.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:06.220 position:5% line:83% align:start
So he decided to destroy mankind
with water and start again

00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.723 position:33% line:83% align:start
with the most
righteous among them.

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
Noah and his family
were faithful to God.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.227 position:27% line:83% align:start
So they gathered
the animals on the ark

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.863 position:30% line:83% align:start
and were spared
the ravages of the great flood.

00:08:17.565 --> 00:08:18.899 position:27% line:89% align:start
A long time ago,

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:22.770 position:10% line:83% align:start
the people of Atlantis fought
among themselves.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:24.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
They hated each other
with such a passion.

00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:27.274 position:30% line:83% align:start
They killed as
many as they could.

00:08:27.308 --> 00:08:30.077 position:7% line:89% align:start
No conscience would stop them.

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.213 position:10% line:89% align:start
Humanity was in great danger.

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:37.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
One ark was burned
and it sank into the sea.

00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:39.920 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was Atlantis.

00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:41.989 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the other ark lost
its master

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.791 position:30% line:83% align:start
and disappeared
without a trace.

00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:48.696 position:38% line:83% align:start
That was
Red Noah the sinking island.

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:54.101 position:19% line:83% align:start
The last ark lost power
and fell to earth here.

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:57.238 position:24% line:83% align:start
The only survivors
were those aboard this ark.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.839 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Blue Noah.

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.677 position:35% line:83% align:start
It was here
they established a kingdom.

00:09:06.814 --> 00:09:10.017 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then this is your homeland
after all, isn't it?
