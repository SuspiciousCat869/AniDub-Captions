[narrator] Jean, Nadia, Marie,
and King escaped from

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:29.524 position:21% line:89% align:start
the sinking Nautilus

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:33.528 position:5% line:83% align:start
only to find themselves stranded
on a deserted island.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.397 position:7% line:83% align:start
There, our heroes had to learn
to provide for themselves.

Unlike the others, Nadia enjoys
living far from the modern world

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:44.404 position:24% line:83% align:start
and wants to spend
the rest of her life there.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:46.507 position:10% line:89% align:start
But does she truly understand

00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:49.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
the ramifications of
primitive life?

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:53.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
Will anyone ever respond
to their cries for rescue?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
Will they ever learn the secret?

[groaning]

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.228 position:24% line:89% align:start
What is it, Nadia?

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.665 position:16% line:89% align:start
Marie is still sleeping.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:44.966 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your eyes will dry up

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.635 position:5% line:83% align:start
if you keep sleeping the morning
away like this.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.937 position:10% line:89% align:start
But we had such a... [yawns]

00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.573 position:19% line:83% align:start
long time getting camp
all set up last night.

00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:54.341 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.644 position:5% line:83% align:start
We are going to make this island
our home from now on.

00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we had better change
our living schedules.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:00.882 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Our what?
-Huh?

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.750 position:7% line:89% align:start
The very first thing we must do

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.519 position:21% line:83% align:start
is give our new home
a proper name.

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:06.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've considered some options.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.455 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hmm, what did you come up with?

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
Lincoln Island.

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.259 position:30% line:89% align:start
Lincoln Island?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:16.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
Lincoln, the president who freed
the African slaves in America?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.232 position:21% line:83% align:start
Exactly. And that is
Captain's Lagoon.

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:20.467 position:35% line:89% align:start
Captain's?

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because the captain's
cabin landed there.

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.440 position:10% line:83% align:start
Correct. Now then we'll call
that Namaki Beach.

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.375 position:33% line:89% align:start
Namaki Beach?

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.913 position:33% line:83% align:start
Namaki, after
Nadia, Marie, and King?

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:34.381 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right.
-[sighs]

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.518 position:27% line:83% align:start
But why was I not
included in there?

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:38.953 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:41.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
All four of us landed
on the beach, didn't we?

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:43.524 position:38% line:83% align:start
You named
it after the three of you,

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:45.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
so why can't I take
get my name in there as well?

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.463 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's see. Najemaki Beach.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.867 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Well, it's too hard to say.
-Hmm.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess we'll just have
to get used to it, won't we?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.506 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Am I right, King?
-[gasps]

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.876 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess there are more important
things to worry about

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
than the name of a beach.

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:06.313 position:21% line:89% align:start
[animals screeching]

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.683 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] You don't really have to
use the names

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:09.817 position:19% line:89% align:start
if you don't like them.

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.753 position:10% line:89% align:start
What happened to you, Nadia?

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're like a different
person today.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.492 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look here, I had some time
to think things over last night.

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:19.660 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.963 position:30% line:83% align:start
I refuse to be
scared or angry anymore

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:23.396 position:21% line:89% align:start
so I shed my old skin

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.700 position:5% line:83% align:start
and became an enlightened person
this morning.

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:29.771 position:19% line:83% align:start
From this day forward,
I am no longer the Nadia

00:04:29.804 --> 00:04:33.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
you thought you knew,
but I am now reborn!

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:41.682 position:10% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Mr. Shearwater

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
and Mrs. Bunny.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
Good morning to all
my animal friends of the forest.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.324 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, Nadia,

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:54.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
did you bring us all the way out
here just for this?

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.030 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by that?

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:58.065 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have an awful lot
of work to do.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:59.901 position:10% line:89% align:start
We must salvage Nemo's cabin.

00:04:59.934 --> 00:05:02.570 position:24% line:83% align:start
We have to survive
until help gets here.

[purrs]

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
I have decided that we should do
without science and civilization

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:09.510 position:27% line:83% align:start
so we don't need
anybody's help.

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:10.978 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:13.781 position:7% line:83% align:start
From now on, I'm going to live
with nature in the forest.

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:15.817 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come along.

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.522 position:38% line:83% align:start
So no one
wants to follow me, eh?

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:24.625 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I'll do it
even if I have to do it alone.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.494 position:7% line:83% align:start
That's right. I'll do it alone.
I can do it. Just...

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.866 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, Nadia, you're mad!

[waves crashing]

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.659 position:30% line:89% align:start
So what is it?

00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's my invention.

00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:42.863 position:33% line:83% align:start
It is a water
distillation machine.

00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:45.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
We all know that we can't
drink seawater, right?

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:48.602 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Mm-hmm.
-So we boil it inside here.

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.104 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:53.107 position:33% line:83% align:start
The sea salt
will remain inside the machine.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.109 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:58.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then the water becomes steam,
condenses without the salt,

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:00.614 position:30% line:83% align:start
and drips into
the basin ready to drink.

00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:02.183 position:7% line:89% align:start
And that's how we will survive.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.585 position:10% line:89% align:start
Pretty amazing invention, no?

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.788 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hmm. How much water
have you made so far?

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:11.258 position:44% line:89% align:start

Well, Jean, you have no faith in
the power of nature

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:58.039 position:16% line:89% align:start
or the value of animals.

If you stay on this island,

you will regret for the rest of

that you ever put faith

I don't think I can hold
on to this for much longer.

00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:14.656 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hear me, animals of the forest.

00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:17.157 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come to my aid.

00:19:19.927 --> 00:19:21.763 position:16% line:89% align:start
Help me, fish of the sea!

[tense music playing]

00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.771 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why won't they help me
after all I've done for them?

-[Jean] Nadia!

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.928 position:24% line:83% align:start
That was certainly
a dangerous situation, Nadia.

00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:56.329 position:13% line:89% align:start
There is a very good reason

00:19:56.363 --> 00:19:59.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
why the fish didn't come
to save me, Jean.

00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:02.269 position:19% line:83% align:start
They couldn't help me.
You killed them all.

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:05.540 position:38% line:83% align:start
-But I...
-What do you expect us to do?

00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:07.542 position:30% line:83% align:start
Do you want us
to starve to death

00:20:07.575 --> 00:20:10.511 position:7% line:83% align:start
-instead of catching some fish?
-Well, Marie...

00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:14.314 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think those fish
understand that more than you!

[mellow music playing]

00:20:36.504 --> 00:20:38.539 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Why were you in Nemo's cabin?

00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:42.643 position:16% line:83% align:start
You brought--you brought
the hologram back to give me,

00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:43.978 position:35% line:89% align:start
didn't you?

00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:47.447 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Well, I know
it's very important to you.

00:20:49.016 --> 00:20:51.753 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thank you so much, Jean.

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:54.722 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. I was selfish.

00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:59.060 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm an awfully stubborn
person like Grandis said.

00:20:59.093 --> 00:21:02.597 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jean] We can't survive against
nature by ourselves, Nadia.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.865 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:07.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
People are not all that strong

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:09.369 position:35% line:83% align:start
but we have
the ability to think,

00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:11.338 position:10% line:83% align:start
so we have to use our brains
to create inventions

00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.541 position:10% line:89% align:start
that make the world livable.

00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:18.880 position:7% line:83% align:start
Two hundred million years ago,
reptiles ruled over the Earth.

00:21:18.913 --> 00:21:20.882 position:27% line:83% align:start
They could change
their environment at will

00:21:20.915 --> 00:21:23.551 position:7% line:89% align:start
to suit their own convenience.

00:21:23.584 --> 00:21:26.854 position:16% line:83% align:start
They proliferate greatly
but they also ended up

00:21:26.888 --> 00:21:29.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
destroying themselves
and their environment.

00:21:29.991 --> 00:21:32.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just like us humans are today.

00:21:32.093 --> 00:21:34.028 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Precisely.

00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:36.097 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's why
we have to find the science

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
that will allow us
to co-exist with nature.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.470 position:7% line:83% align:start
You see, reptile blood is cold
but human blood is warm.

00:21:43.504 --> 00:21:46.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
I want to believe not
only in science but in mankind.

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:50.377 position:41% line:83% align:start
-I see.
-[Jean] Hmm.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's wrong?

00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:54.115 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
someone's been pretty busy.

00:21:54.148 --> 00:21:57.752 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Huh? Oh, Marie drew
in your encyclopedia.

00:21:57.785 --> 00:22:00.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] When did
she do all of this?

00:22:00.588 --> 00:22:04.892 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Marie] My name is Marie and
I was born on April 10th, 1885

00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:08.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
in a place called
Marseilles, France.

00:22:08.461 --> 00:22:11.065 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't remember anything
about Marseilles

00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:15.002 position:13% line:83% align:start
because my Mama, and Papa,
and Mookie, and I moved to Mahar

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:18.471 position:21% line:83% align:start
in Cape Verde Islands
when I was very little.

00:22:18.506 --> 00:22:21.742 position:33% line:83% align:start
Mama and Papa
and Mookie died there.

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:25.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I'm okay now
because I am not alone.

00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:32.119 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nadia is my sister.
She gets angry really easily.

00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:34.689 position:27% line:83% align:start
She has a lot of
likes and dislikes.

00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:36.591 position:16% line:83% align:start
She says she can talk to
animals

00:22:36.624 --> 00:22:38.659 position:24% line:83% align:start
but I haven't seen
her do that yet.

00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:41.629 position:19% line:89% align:start
And I love her so much.

00:22:41.662 --> 00:22:44.131 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jean is Nadia's husband.

00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:46.968 position:16% line:89% align:start
They are always fighting.

00:22:47.001 --> 00:22:49.804 position:7% line:83% align:start
When I tell them it's a lover's
quarrel, they get mad at me.

00:22:49.837 --> 00:22:52.006 position:16% line:89% align:start
Isn't that mean of them?

00:22:53.107 --> 00:22:56.043 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jean is always making funny toys

00:22:56.077 --> 00:22:58.112 position:24% line:83% align:start
but when I ask him
to play with me,

00:22:58.145 --> 00:22:59.881 position:7% line:89% align:start
he always says, "Maybe later."

00:22:59.914 --> 00:23:02.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
He doesn't get
angry as easily as Nadia

00:23:02.617 --> 00:23:05.586 position:19% line:89% align:start
and I love him so much.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.022 position:33% line:83% align:start
Then there's
King. He's my husband.

00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:11.025 position:7% line:83% align:start
He used to be Nadia's boyfriend
a long time ago

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:14.161 position:7% line:83% align:start
-but I stole him away from her.
-[giggles]

00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:18.165 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's okay because he says
he loves me more anyway.

00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:20.534 position:10% line:89% align:start
We love each other very much,

00:23:20.568 --> 00:23:22.803 position:24% line:83% align:start
even though he acts
a little old for his age.

00:23:22.837 --> 00:23:24.171 position:27% line:89% align:start
I love him, too.

00:23:24.205 --> 00:23:26.874 position:19% line:89% align:start
I wonder what this is.

00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:29.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why does she say
that I get angry easily?

00:23:29.043 --> 00:23:32.179 position:19% line:89% align:start
[laughs] She knows you.

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:33.480 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jean...

00:23:33.514 --> 00:23:35.082 position:35% line:83% align:start
See there?
You're getting angry now.

00:23:35.116 --> 00:23:37.852 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm not angry yet
but you better be careful.

00:23:38.953 --> 00:23:41.088 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, I know
I can be mischievous,

00:23:41.122 --> 00:23:43.524 position:35% line:83% align:start
precocious,
careless, and sentimental.

00:23:43.557 --> 00:23:45.458 position:33% line:83% align:start
I might even
get a little irritable

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:48.562 position:21% line:83% align:start
but everyone loved me
when I was in the circus.

00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:51.966 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Come on.
Don't be so sensitive.
