Hey, aren't those--

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
Gargoyle's
Neo Atlantean battleships.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:41.201 position:13% line:89% align:start
What in the world is that?

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.804 position:24% line:89% align:start
[both] Flying evil.

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:44.505 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'd better head
for cover tout suite.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:45.807 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all] Right.

[grunts]

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:49.811 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait.

00:01:56.651 --> 00:01:58.285 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is bad.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.755 position:24% line:83% align:start
Who'd have thought
they could follow us here?

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:02.289 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do they want from us?

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:04.559 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're probably
trying to kidnap Nadia.

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:07.427 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Impossible.
-Oh, it's possible all right.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.697 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you think
they spotted us already?

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.633 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

[gasps]

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:19.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
[operator] Battleship two,
we have received a message

00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:21.643 position:16% line:89% align:start
from the Deus Ex Machina.

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.410 position:16% line:89% align:start
They have located Nadia.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.278 position:30% line:83% align:start
[soldier] What
did he say? Nadia?

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.315 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[soldier] Is she alive?
-[Gargoyle] Stop babbling.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:30.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not even Emperor Neo in
his greatness

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:33.387 position:27% line:83% align:start
has been able to
locate the Blue Water yet.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.790 position:16% line:89% align:start
That leads me to believe

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
that Nadia and
Nemo are still alive.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:40.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.463 position:10% line:83% align:start
We have returned to the ruins
of Tartessos

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.298 position:35% line:83% align:start
after such
a long absence.

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.802 position:27% line:83% align:start
What a wonderful
surprise for us.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.570 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a terrible surprise for us.

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:50.972 position:30% line:89% align:start
What'll we do?

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.240 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're going to run
away in terror, of course.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.977 position:5% line:83% align:start
These are the monsters that sunk
the Nautilus, you know.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.779 position:27% line:83% align:start
That is the best
idea you've ever had.

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Well, if there
are no objections, I suggest--

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] How nice
to see you again, Nadia.

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.618 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[all] Huh?
-Gargoyle.

00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:05.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
So who in the world is he?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.421 position:21% line:89% align:start
[both] Walking evil.

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nadia, be a good girl

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.693 position:27% line:83% align:start
and come out with
your Blue Water voluntarily.

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:14.227 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's the only way you can
spare the lives

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.530 position:19% line:89% align:start
of your little friends.

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.899 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't have to do that.

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:21.301 position:10% line:83% align:start
Even if you give yourself up,
you know that he'll kill us.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.805 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
Are you having trouble deciding?

00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:26.440 position:5% line:89% align:start
Let me show you what will happen

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
if you don't comply with
my wishes.

[weapon revving]

00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:35.883 position:33% line:89% align:start

[explosion]

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.621 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Oh, no.
-Beast!

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:41.789 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all] Oh, god.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.361 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Nadia, I will give
you one full minute

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.736 position:21% line:89% align:start
to make up your mind.

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
Otherwise, bid
farewell to your friends.

00:03:57.772 --> 00:04:00.041 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[groans]
-Don't listen to him.

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:02.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
But if she doesn't go,
we're all going to be killed.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:04.746 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't wanna die
in some strange place

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.480 position:21% line:89% align:start
for no reason at all.

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:09.016 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean you want her
to sacrifice herself?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
It strikes me as
the logical thing to do.

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.856 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[huffs]
-[all] Keep your mouth shut.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
-I'm going.
-[all] Huh?

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:20.928 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's the logical thing to do.

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can't die for me.

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:23.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
You mustn't.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:25.265 position:7% line:89% align:start
I won't let you die like that.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.704 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both] But...

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:33.875 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nadia, I swear I'll rescue you.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.477 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll wait for you.

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:42.482 position:41% line:89% align:start

[dramatic music playing]

00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:13.981 position:24% line:89% align:start
You can take me now

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:16.083 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you promise me that you'll
spare the others.

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:18.786 position:5% line:89% align:start
The Blue Water is all yours now.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.921 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Very well.

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:21.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
I promise.

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:26.326 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia.

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have the power
to destroy the world.

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:32.432 position:16% line:89% align:start
So don't worry about me.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.001 position:7% line:89% align:start
I will never let them beat me.

00:05:34.035 --> 00:05:35.937 position:38% line:89% align:start
Don't go.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.538 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's all right, Marie.

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:39.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know that Jean
will rescue me soon.

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:43.544 position:7% line:83% align:start
Be a good girl and I'll be back
just as soon as I can.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.780 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good. I'll wait for you.

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.349 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Good girl.
-[blaring]

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:54.889 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.135 position:7% line:83% align:start
[soldier] Lord Gargoyle, we are
bringing Nadia aboard presently.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] I see that.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.439 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bring her to me and
treat her courteously.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.373 position:21% line:89% align:start
[soldier] Understood.

00:06:14.976 --> 00:06:17.879 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] The least I can do
is give them a running start.

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.548 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What do we do?
-We find the Katherine

00:06:20.581 --> 00:06:23.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
and get out of this
accursed place and fast.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.553 position:30% line:83% align:start
And we'll come
up with a plan later on.

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.588 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[all] Uh-hmm.
-[Gargoyle] Now my friends...

[gasps]

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:31.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] You have
a chance to save yourselves.

00:06:31.893 --> 00:06:34.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll give you one minute.

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:37.031 position:19% line:89% align:start
Run wherever you like.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.000 position:7% line:89% align:start
That double crossing scoundrel.

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:40.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no time for that.

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:42.469 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Let's move.
-[all] Yes, ma'am.

00:06:42.503 --> 00:06:44.171 position:30% line:83% align:start
Someday you'll
be sorry, Gargoyle.

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:45.673 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:47.541 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Hurry up.

00:06:47.575 --> 00:06:50.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Only 40 seconds left.

Don't be so rude to our guest.

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:07.161 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, well, Princess Nadia.

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.897 position:19% line:83% align:start
You've honored me with
your presence, once again,

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:11.699 position:33% line:89% align:start
I thank you.

You said you'd spare my friends
if I surrendered myself.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] I did not lie, Nadia.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm giving them
a chance at survival.

00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:22.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's more than
most people are allowed.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:24.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
All of you would be dead at this
very moment

if you hadn't come
out of hiding.

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:27.782 position:27% line:89% align:start
In point of fact,

00:07:27.815 --> 00:07:30.885 position:10% line:83% align:start
you should be thankful to me
for my generosity.

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:33.087 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're still as
inhuman as always.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.022 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] But of course, I am.

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:37.091 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would hate to ever be confused

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
for one of those ridiculous
creatures.

is up, Lord Gargoyle.

I can be quite merciful.

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:01.015 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:07.835 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Fire now!
-Sir!

00:21:07.869 --> 00:21:09.971 position:19% line:89% align:start
I ordered you to fire!

00:21:10.872 --> 00:21:12.039 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.811 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:18.546 --> 00:21:20.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
I made a promise to Nadia
that I would come rescue her.

00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:23.885 position:35% line:83% align:start
I will keep
that promise, Electra.

00:21:23.918 --> 00:21:25.686 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.321 position:24% line:83% align:start
We will not bow to
Gargoyle's demands for anyone,

00:21:28.355 --> 00:21:30.024 position:13% line:89% align:start
not even my dear daughter.

00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:33.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
But Captain, saving one
individual life

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.563 position:30% line:83% align:start
is as great as
saving the lives of many.

00:21:36.764 --> 00:21:38.533 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Captain.
-Captain.

00:21:38.566 --> 00:21:39.767 position:21% line:89% align:start
Please, Captain Nemo.

00:21:39.801 --> 00:21:41.301 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please!

00:21:50.645 --> 00:21:52.780 position:5% line:89% align:start
Here is my Blue Water, Gargoyle.

00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:54.782 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why don't you come down
and get it yourself?

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:55.917 position:21% line:89% align:start
[both] Captain Nemo.

00:21:59.687 --> 00:22:02.056 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
That won't be necessary, Nemo.

00:22:03.591 --> 00:22:04.491 position:30% line:89% align:start
[light flashes]

00:22:08.796 --> 00:22:10.832 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all murmuring]

00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:16.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
[all] It disappeared.

00:22:16.838 --> 00:22:18.471 position:30% line:89% align:start
He has it now.

00:22:18.506 --> 00:22:20.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:22:20.141 --> 00:22:22.810 position:35% line:83% align:start
How did--is
the emperor with you?

00:22:22.844 --> 00:22:24.979 position:10% line:89% align:start
Excellent deduction, Captain.

00:22:25.012 --> 00:22:27.081 position:13% line:89% align:start
As a matter of fact, he is.

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:31.652 position:13% line:83% align:start
But Emperor Neo's power has
never been that strong, Captain.

00:22:35.823 --> 00:22:38.659 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Did the Emperor's
abilities take you by surprise?

00:22:38.693 --> 00:22:40.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's not a child
anymore, you know?

00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:46.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
We have excellent
scientific tools as well.

00:22:46.801 --> 00:22:48.936 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're amplifying
their machine's output

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.638 position:10% line:89% align:start
with Neo's innate willpower.

00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:52.139 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:22:52.173 --> 00:22:53.875 position:13% line:83% align:start
It will be difficult for us
to defeat them.

00:22:55.076 --> 00:22:56.544 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] I'll keep my promise.

00:22:57.545 --> 00:22:59.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because you gave us
the Blue Water,

00:22:59.513 --> 00:23:00.982 position:33% line:83% align:start
I will spare
your daughter's life.

00:23:02.482 --> 00:23:03.918 position:30% line:89% align:start
Goodbye, Nemo.

00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:07.622 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:23:07.655 --> 00:23:09.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
I no longer have
any interest in Tartessos.

00:23:10.858 --> 00:23:14.161 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shall we field test the new
gravity bomb we've developed?

00:23:14.195 --> 00:23:15.529 position:21% line:89% align:start
[soldier] Understood.

00:23:15.563 --> 00:23:17.899 position:27% line:83% align:start
Load the gravity
bomb on the double.

00:23:17.932 --> 00:23:20.134 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No.
-[zaps]

00:23:20.167 --> 00:23:25.006 position:5% line:83% align:start
Witness the resting place of old
Tartessos, Blue Noah, and Nemo.

00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:29.710 position:33% line:89% align:start
[explosions]

00:23:37.885 --> 00:23:40.154 position:19% line:89% align:start
Farewell, foolish man.

00:23:40.187 --> 00:23:43.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.804 position:21% line:89% align:start
