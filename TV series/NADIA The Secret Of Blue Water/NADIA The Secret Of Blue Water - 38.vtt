Hmm. They can't attack us

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
if we deploy our barrier

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:31.906 position:10% line:89% align:start
Look. The tower is destroyed.

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
That will be nothing compared
to what will happen

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.313 position:33% line:83% align:start
if that ship
goes into full attack.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.849 position:19% line:89% align:start
[engineer] She's right.

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:44.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
The whole world
will look like that, worse.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.021 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] That's
why we must stop it.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:48.956 position:10% line:89% align:start
We must bring Red Noah down.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fools. They think they can
destroy Red Noah.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.395 position:7% line:89% align:start
How does he intend to do that?

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's no good. Red Noah's
defenses are too strong for us

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.067 position:27% line:83% align:start
to wage a frontal
attack on it, Captain.

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.069 position:10% line:89% align:start
How do we break that barrier?

00:05:02.103 --> 00:05:03.604 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we can get the Katherine
inside,

00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:04.906 position:30% line:83% align:start
we can disable
it from within.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.708 position:7% line:83% align:start
But how we can get your Gratan
inside Red Noah?

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:11.078 position:10% line:83% align:start
Open electromagnetic barrier
and bring pressure to full.

00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.080 position:7% line:83% align:start
But the barrier will only last
one minute

00:05:13.114 --> 00:05:14.615 position:35% line:83% align:start
under those
conditions.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
Never mind, we must charge
them at maximum airspeed.

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:19.386 position:30% line:83% align:start
Only a barrier
can defeat a barrier.

to kill himself out of despair?

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.004 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Our barrier is red.
Full pressure.

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:38.639 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, all hands brace for impact.

have a breaking point?

Haven't they gotten through yet?

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:05.867 position:13% line:89% align:start
Focus the attack, Helmsman.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.468 position:19% line:83% align:start
Getting the bow through

Should you command it, sir?

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.050 position:24% line:89% align:start
No, it's of no use.

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:44.718 position:7% line:89% align:start
Good idea, sir. We should wait

00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:47.021 position:27% line:83% align:start
until we receive
word from the Gratan.

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
They should have radioed by now.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
What on earth could
they be doing in there?

00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:56.797 position:27% line:83% align:start
How could we get
lost at a time like this?

00:09:56.831 --> 00:09:58.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
I told you before
that we should have stayed

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:00.401 position:24% line:83% align:start

-Oh, you be quiet!

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:02.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
Your chatter is driving me mad!

with all this prattle?

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now, I'll come up
with a brilliant plan.

00:10:07.007 --> 00:10:08.409 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh ho ho!

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:11.812 position:16% line:83% align:start
You know, I expected them
to attack us already.

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:17.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're not afraid of us,

00:10:17.184 --> 00:10:19.386 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now, my dear Nemo,

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.756 position:5% line:83% align:start

Don't say that.

-What's that?
-The light of Babel.

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
They cannot target us

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.125 position:13% line:83% align:start
from that firing position,
can they, Captain?

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.561 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're using Lucifer.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
-We must evade it.
-No! Spread our barrier.

-Energy shockwaves, ma'am.

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.836 position:19% line:89% align:start
I see. And those are...

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.906 position:5% line:83% align:start

you don't know for sure, Sanson.

00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:54.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
But ma'am, the waves were
so strong,

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.217 position:13% line:89% align:start
it can't be anything else.

we're finished for sure.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:53.907 position:10% line:83% align:start
Not yet. It's gonna take some

if you can't find the doorway,

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:55.302 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:13.300 position:24% line:89% align:start
Move in, Helmsman.

00:17:17.271 --> 00:17:19.206 position:35% line:83% align:start

The Nautilus has boarded us.

[man] This can't be.

00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:22.476 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Peace,
let them board.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.811 position:35% line:89% align:start
[man] Sir?

00:17:23.845 --> 00:17:26.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
Red Noah will make a fine
mausoleum for the captain.

[explodes]

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:40.795 position:33% line:83% align:start
[sonar] We've
penetrated the main housing.

00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:42.597 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Bring the Gratan
back on board immediately.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
[helmsman] Aye, aye.

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:46.333 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[Captian Nemo] First officer?
-Aye.

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.335 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Keep
the furnace at full energy.

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:51.873 position:27% line:83% align:start
Make your escape
if I don't return.

00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.273 position:38% line:89% align:start
Captain.

00:17:53.675 --> 00:17:55.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
I must leave the ship

00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:57.679 position:16% line:83% align:start
to attend to some rather
pressing business.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
You're planning to rescue Nadia,
aren't you?

00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:03.483 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Forgive me.

00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:05.553 position:24% line:89% align:start
[helmsman] Captain.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:09.356 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's only natural for a father
to care for his daughter.

00:18:09.389 --> 00:18:12.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have no reason to apologize.

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:14.729 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Electra] He's right.

00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:18.198 position:7% line:89% align:start
But sir, I will accompany you.

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Captain.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.739 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Oh, Jean.

00:18:28.876 --> 00:18:32.245 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Huh? What's this?

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:35.617 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[Electra] That is your weapon.
-[Jean] But...

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
You are responsible for
defending your own life, Jean.

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:42.389 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Do you understand?
-[Jean] Yes.

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:44.859 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whirring]

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:51.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
[operator] The Nautilus
has deployed a small vessel.

00:18:51.431 --> 00:18:53.701 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Gargoyle] Bring it to me.
-[man 1] Understood.

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.237 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Ask his majesty
and Princess Nadia

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
to join me in the throne room.

00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:01.308 position:24% line:89% align:start
[man 2] Understood.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:04.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shall reunite a father
with his long lost son.

00:19:22.864 --> 00:19:24.899 position:30% line:89% align:start
[ship crashes]

[gasps]

00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:43.918 position:5% line:83% align:start
I know you're in here, Gargoyle.
Show yourself to us.

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.960 position:21% line:89% align:start
[tense music playing]

00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:58.666 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] It's
been a long time, Nemo.

00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:05.272 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or should I say Eleusis La
Arwall, King of Old Tartessos.

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:08.810 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thirteen long years have passed
since we've been face to face.

00:20:08.843 --> 00:20:10.945 position:7% line:89% align:start
An interesting choice of words

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:12.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
from one who hides
behind a mask.

00:20:13.014 --> 00:20:17.985 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nemesis La Algolas,
Prime Minister of Old Tartessos.

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:20.521 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] What a lovely
whisper from the past.

00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:23.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
I haven't heard that title
spoken in 13 years.

00:20:23.758 --> 00:20:25.727 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] We've
thrown away the old customs.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] So true.
We can't go back to those days.

00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:30.598 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Indeed.

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:34.802 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, explain to me this
unorthodox greeting, Gargoyle.

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:37.004 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
You shall be tried before God.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.473 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's the meaning of that?

00:20:39.507 --> 00:20:42.375 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, you will stand
accused of your crimes

00:20:42.409 --> 00:20:44.679 position:7% line:89% align:start
and be punished for them here.

00:20:44.712 --> 00:20:46.914 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] You said before God.

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:49.282 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where is this God you speak of?

00:20:49.316 --> 00:20:51.619 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] He stands before you.

00:20:51.652 --> 00:20:53.353 position:38% line:89% align:start
It is I.

00:20:53.386 --> 00:20:55.022 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] That's absurd.

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:57.592 position:5% line:89% align:start
Who shall speak for the defense?

00:20:57.625 --> 00:20:58.860 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] You need no defense.

00:20:58.893 --> 00:21:01.696 position:10% line:89% align:start
God sees through all defenses

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:04.866 position:13% line:89% align:start
and judges under his name.

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:09.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shall I bring forth
the witnesses? [finger snaps]

00:21:11.572 --> 00:21:15.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? Miss Granva,
Hanson, Sanson.

00:21:15.777 --> 00:21:19.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bring forth the executors
of the judgment. [finger snaps]

00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:31.058 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia!

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:35.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Nadia?
-Impossible.

00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:40.433 position:10% line:83% align:start
Damn you. You have taken away
her consciousness.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:43.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's true. She had
no use of it any longer.

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:49.043 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let the trial
commence. Eleusis La Arwall,

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:52.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
you stand accused of
cohabitating with human beings,

00:21:52.747 --> 00:21:56.017 position:30% line:83% align:start
though you were
the rightful King of Atlantis.

00:21:57.585 --> 00:21:59.787 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] It is
the sensible course.

00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:01.122 position:19% line:89% align:start
The ancient Atlanteans

00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:03.624 position:16% line:83% align:start
gave life to man so that
he would serve them.

00:22:03.658 --> 00:22:06.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
But that world belongs
to the humans now, Gargoyle.

00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:09.063 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's not mine anymore.

00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:10.998 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] That is false.

00:22:11.032 --> 00:22:13.601 position:7% line:83% align:start
This world was and always will
be ours.

00:22:13.634 --> 00:22:16.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
Men are defective
and cannot be trusted.

00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:19.941 position:7% line:83% align:start
They wage war on each other in
a quest to destroy themselves.

00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:22.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
They have brought their own
judgment upon themselves.

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:25.079 position:16% line:89% align:start
Their race has no future,

00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.815 position:21% line:83% align:start
unless we reestablish
control over them.

00:22:27.849 --> 00:22:30.417 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're wrong. That isn't true.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.020 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Which is precisely
why you stand accused

00:22:33.054 --> 00:22:35.623 position:30% line:83% align:start
of believing in
such base creatures.

00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:40.393 position:5% line:83% align:start
The new world has no use of weak
Atlanteans such as yourself.

00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:57.812 position:44% line:89% align:start

God cannot be killed.

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:14.996 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry to disappoint you.

-Huh?

00:23:20.001 --> 00:23:23.537 position:30% line:83% align:start
You must shoot
Nadia and Neo. Do it!

00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:27.008 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:35.516 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Ah. Our brave
little boy is with us again.

00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:38.886 position:30% line:83% align:start
But is he brave
enough to kill his Nadia?
