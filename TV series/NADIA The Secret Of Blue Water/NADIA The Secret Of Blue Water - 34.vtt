And those are hippopotami.

But they don't

No, of course not.

Oh, Nadia.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.279 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Jean] So why is Nadia so down
in the mouth lately?

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.981 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm really worried about her.

[Hanson] Maybe she caught
a rare jungle disease.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.986 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] You idiot.
She's lost her love.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.288 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Hanson] She has?
-[Sanson] Yes.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.290 position:38% line:83% align:start
And it's
the worst sickness of all.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.860 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I see.
Is Nadia gonna be okay?

00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:48.730 position:33% line:83% align:start
[both] Jean,
you're much too nice a guy.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.536 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] I feel
sorry for you, Jean.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.740 position:24% line:83% align:start

going to be in love with Nadia,

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:01.408 position:35% line:83% align:start
you have to
prepare for lots of trouble.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.945 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I am,
but I guess I didn't expect her

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:05.680 position:16% line:89% align:start
to be this much trouble.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:08.281 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Listen, Jean,
do you know what it's like

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.551 position:30% line:83% align:start
to be madly in
love with a woman?

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:11.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] No.

00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:13.855 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sanson and Hanson]
It's a living hell.

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.489 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] A living hell?

00:04:15.523 --> 00:04:16.924 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Sanson and Hanson]
You betcha.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.559 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Since the dawn of time,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:21.763 position:7% line:83% align:start
loving women has been the bane
of man's existence.

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:23.698 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Really?

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.433 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Of course teenage girls
are a little less troublesome.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.569 position:35% line:83% align:start
They can be
satisfied with their own love.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:31.438 position:21% line:83% align:start
But grown women, huh,
they're no good.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:32.807 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Yup.
They ask for presents.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.675 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] And outings.

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:37.377 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] And
they want to go to nice places.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.346 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
And they want entertainment.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.449 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] And you better
not get their age wrong.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] And don't dare look
at another woman.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.721 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
And they want to eat good food.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.557 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] And you have to
make them laugh all the time.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.726 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
And you better have a nice car.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.694 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Oh, they ask so much.

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:56.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Men are doomed
to satisfy their whims

00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.366 position:33% line:83% align:start
so they take
advantage of our love.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.468 position:7% line:83% align:start

will ever be happy

-with that arrangement.
-[Hanson] That's right.

of torture in the old days.

-[both] Now you do!

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.718 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Hmm.

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:19.754 position:7% line:89% align:start
I must seize this opportunity.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:21.088 position:41% line:89% align:start
I must.

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:22.723 position:16% line:89% align:start
Love can only bear fruit

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:24.559 position:16% line:83% align:start
when two people are aware
of each other's love.

you're just out of luck, my boy.

What can I do to change that?

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.102 position:30% line:83% align:start

that out for yourself.

-That's right.

to seduce women.

this is your only chance.
