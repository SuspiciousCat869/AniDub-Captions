The Nautilus set course

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.690 position:24% line:89% align:start
for its secret base

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:32.259 position:35% line:83% align:start
deep inside
the Antarctic Continent.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:35.262 position:19% line:83% align:start
Many of our heroes were
anxious about the journey,

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
but Jean was overjoyed at the
prospects of exploration.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:42.904 position:24% line:83% align:start
Upon their arrival,
the submarine was attacked

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:45.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
by a prehistoric nautilus
shellfish.

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
The ship narrowly escaped
and continued their quest

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
for the secret of Blue Water.

Whoa!

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:26.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
What an extraordinary place.

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.812 position:27% line:83% align:start
I cannot believe
a facility like this

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
exists in the South Pole!

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
the South Pole was ice cold?

Reprobate!

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.935 position:27% line:89% align:start
Real cold, Jean.

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:55.368 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh!

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:56.738 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't understand.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.472 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's supposed to be cold.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:03:59.741 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
But not down here.

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:01.943 position:24% line:83% align:start
We are far beneath
the cold surface.

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.578 position:16% line:89% align:start
The molten lava below us

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.646 position:27% line:83% align:start
keeps this place
perfectly warm.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.714 position:44% line:83% align:start
[all]
Oh!

00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:08.015 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
On the ice above us,

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
the temperatures
can get so low

00:04:09.517 --> 00:04:11.652 position:7% line:89% align:start
that even your breath freezes.

00:04:11.686 --> 00:04:13.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, the temperatures
below us

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:15.923 position:30% line:83% align:start
could melt even
the strongest steel.

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.491 position:44% line:83% align:start
[all]
Oh.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:19.359 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
Several thousand years ago,

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.995 position:7% line:89% align:start
the Atlanteans built this base

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:24.431 position:13% line:83% align:start
on the shores of this vast
subterranean lake.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.835 position:10% line:83% align:start
But no one has ever explored
the rest of this continent

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:30.470 position:13% line:89% align:start
and live to tell about it.

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:31.338 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:33.541 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, Ms. Electra--

00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:35.676 position:30% line:83% align:start
You were going
to ask my permission

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
to explore our incredible base

00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:39.412 position:10% line:89% align:start
beneath the ice, weren't you?

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.883 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, yes. Will you let me?

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:43.885 position:24% line:89% align:start
You'd do it anyway.

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:45.686 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, well, go on.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.988 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can? Oh, boy!

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.859 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Grandis]
So this is the supply base

00:04:51.893 --> 00:04:53.861 position:13% line:89% align:start
we've heard so much about.

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:56.063 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't suppose
you mine any diamonds

00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:57.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
from those mineral deposits
over there?

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:59.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nope.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.968 position:33% line:83% align:start
Over there is
our supply of iron ore,

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:02.703 position:19% line:89% align:start
bauxite, and manganese.

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:05.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a veritable treasure
trove of vital materials.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.373 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.449 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Eiko,

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:17.819 position:13% line:89% align:start
what is the purpose of that

00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:19.020 position:16% line:89% align:start
tank exhaust pipes there?

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:21.055 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's the oil supply.

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:23.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
This space is far below
the earth's surface.

00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:25.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
So the crude flows down
instead of up.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.460 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we took that oil,
we'd be rich.

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:31.899 position:16% line:89% align:start
But how would you do it?

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:34.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
You will need a ship
much bigger than ours for that.

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:35.937 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hmm?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.038 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both sobbing]

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.640 position:13% line:89% align:start
And that's why I hate men.

00:05:39.674 --> 00:05:41.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
They always think
with their wallets. Huh!

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:46.814 position:30% line:83% align:start
Chief Engineer,
this is the bridge.

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:49.482 position:24% line:83% align:start
What is the status
of your repairs?

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:53.120 position:16% line:83% align:start

we will need at least 15 hours

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:54.789 position:7% line:89% align:start
in order to complete our work.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:55.823 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:03.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
Have all repairs finished
in 16 hours

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.967 position:19% line:83% align:start

Oh, look, Nadia,
it's the Antarctic ice.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're actually traveling
through an ice tunnel.

[gasps]
What was that?

00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:45.900 position:10% line:89% align:start
It looked like a tree branch.

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:47.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] It was.

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:49.537 position:19% line:89% align:start

[Jean]
The World Tree?

00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:53.541 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nemo]
Yes. A tree of enormous size.

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:55.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
Its roots spread
throughout the globe

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:57.645 position:19% line:89% align:start
that holds up the skies

00:07:57.678 --> 00:07:59.981 position:27% line:83% align:start
and is said to be
the source of all life.

00:08:00.014 --> 00:08:02.950 position:7% line:83% align:start
If a tree that size could have
grown on this continent,

00:08:02.984 --> 00:08:04.752 position:16% line:83% align:start
then I'll bet Antarctica
must have had

00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:06.954 position:21% line:83% align:start

-Oh.
-Captain, it's so amazing

00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:51.659 position:24% line:83% align:start

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.200 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, I will wait outside.

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:01.435 position:38% line:89% align:start
But wait!

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.137 position:16% line:89% align:start
You have nothing to fear.

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:05.607 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:10.678 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?

I can't believe it.

You really are
speaking to me now.

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.523 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
That is true.

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:24.626 position:33% line:83% align:start
I am speaking
directly to your heart.

You can do that?

[Irion]
I can.

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:30.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
It is simple when
we use the Blue Water.

Oh, you're using
the Blue Water.

[Irion]
I am.

You don't have to speak.

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:41.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
You must only think
of what you want to say.

00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:42.510 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'll try.

00:15:42.544 --> 00:15:44.579 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is there something you want
to say to Captain Nemo?

[Irion]
No. We have already

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:47.515 position:16% line:89% align:start

[Irion]
Yes.

00:15:50.618 --> 00:15:53.555 position:13% line:83% align:start
We will not be seeing each
other again on this Earth.

[Nadia]
Why not?

00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:58.593 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
I have lived too long.

00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.962 position:13% line:89% align:start
My life will soon be over.

Too long? How long is that?

00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:07.367 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
During my lifetime,

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:12.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
the Earth has circled the Sun
20,000 times.

[Nadia]
Twenty thousand?

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:16.711 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
That is true.

00:16:16.744 --> 00:16:19.379 position:33% line:83% align:start
According to
the human calendar.

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:20.615 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
Through those years,

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:22.750 position:24% line:83% align:start
you have witnessed
the history of mankind?

00:16:22.784 --> 00:16:24.117 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
Yes.

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:28.455 position:16% line:83% align:start
They are most interesting
species of life

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:33.795 position:7% line:83% align:start
that create wars to seek peace
and wage them to destroy.

00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:38.165 position:10% line:83% align:start
They are the most interesting
species indeed.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
That can't be.

00:16:39.734 --> 00:16:42.236 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
But it is the truth.

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:45.105 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.652 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
What was that?

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.387 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
I sent you some images

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.723 position:30% line:89% align:start
from my memory.

00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:03.357 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
I'm afraid we are

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.626 position:24% line:89% align:start
as you say we are.

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:06.426 position:41% line:83% align:start

Man is an interesting

species of life,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.097 position:19% line:89% align:start
but not a foolish one.

[gasps]

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.636 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Irion]
That is my belief.

00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:18.338 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nemo is my last friend.

00:17:18.372 --> 00:17:20.140 position:24% line:89% align:start
As his final gift,

00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:23.443 position:33% line:83% align:start
he introduced
both of you to me.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:26.179 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm very grateful for that.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.649 position:24% line:89% align:start
He believes in you

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:30.450 position:27% line:83% align:start
and has entrusted
the future to you.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:34.454 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please honor his trust in you.

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:36.624 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is my final wish.

00:17:38.358 --> 00:17:41.461 position:19% line:83% align:start
To make a new friend is
the most precious thing

00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:43.865 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it is my gift to you.

00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:45.800 position:30% line:83% align:start

An unexpected person?

-It did?

Mm-hmm. It went dark
immediately after that.

Why is that?

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:28.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess because--well,
the whale said

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.203 position:27% line:83% align:start
it was because of
the Blue Water.

You've arrived.

[Jean]
Ha-ha! This is incredible.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm standing right on
the South Pole.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:54.055 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ha! I have done it!

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:57.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
But Captain Nemo is the person
who brought you here, Jean.

00:20:58.893 --> 00:21:00.327 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's true.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.864 position:10% line:89% align:start
I didn't get here on my own.

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:04.665 position:21% line:89% align:start
No, you didn't, Jean.

00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
We are here with the help of
the Nautilus

00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:08.703 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the people of Atlantis.

00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:13.508 position:10% line:83% align:start
No man in all of history has
ever set foot on this place.

00:21:13.541 --> 00:21:15.576 position:16% line:89% align:start
But in the next century,

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.678 position:19% line:83% align:start
man will learn to break
through the ice

00:21:17.712 --> 00:21:20.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
and reach this point
by his own power.

00:21:21.448 --> 00:21:24.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
I put my faith in the
inexorable will of mankind.

[Jean]
What is that?

00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:39.499 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Nemo] An aurora.
-[Jean] And what's that?

00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:40.635 position:41% line:89% align:start
Divine.

00:21:41.903 --> 00:21:43.738 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] In scientific terms,

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:45.573 position:21% line:83% align:start
electrons and protons
from the sun

00:21:45.606 --> 00:21:48.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
strike Earth's atmosphere
and create this phenomenon.

00:21:50.144 --> 00:21:55.382 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, scientific terms
describe beauty quite poorly.

[Nadia]
A tear?

00:21:58.719 --> 00:21:59.921 position:33% line:89% align:start
It can't be.

[Irion]
He believes in you

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:06.627 position:27% line:83% align:start
and has entrusted
the future to you.

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:19.472 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Okay. It's ready.

00:22:20.074 --> 00:22:21.075 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:22:21.108 --> 00:22:22.610 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's called ice cream.

00:22:22.643 --> 00:22:23.911 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ice cream?

00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:25.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes. I prepared it right here

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.849 position:30% line:83% align:start
in my automatic
ice cream maker.

00:22:27.882 --> 00:22:29.817 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh.
-You made that?

00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:31.085 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
I made just for you, Marie.

00:22:31.118 --> 00:22:32.385 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:33.654 position:27% line:89% align:start
Go ahead and try.

[all slurping]

Oh, my head is

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:22:40.493 --> 00:22:41.762 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Huh?

00:22:41.796 --> 00:22:44.632 position:30% line:83% align:start
-But it's good.
-[King purrs]

00:22:44.665 --> 00:22:45.700 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you like it?

00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:47.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
I had no idea that ice cream

00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:49.937 position:13% line:89% align:start
is so delicious until now.

00:22:49.971 --> 00:22:53.107 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I made it using
the ice from the South Pole.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.441 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:22:54.474 --> 00:22:57.612 position:21% line:83% align:start
The ice here is about
12,000 years old.

00:22:57.645 --> 00:23:00.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like we're eating
the Earth's history.

00:23:00.581 --> 00:23:02.917 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, I didn't know
the South Pole was so little.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.852 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:06.787 position:19% line:89% align:start
Twelve thousand years,

00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:09.123 position:33% line:83% align:start
even compared
to the age of this ice cream,

00:23:09.156 --> 00:23:13.160 position:7% line:83% align:start
a typical homosapien's lifespan
is incredibly brief.

00:23:13.194 --> 00:23:17.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
The most important thing
is how that lifespan is spent.

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:24.038 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, what's happened to you?

00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:27.642 position:19% line:83% align:start
We've been looking for
Captain Nemo.

00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:29.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
So we went to the surface.

00:23:29.243 --> 00:23:31.478 position:16% line:83% align:start
[both] You went out there
without parkas?

00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:34.548 position:24% line:83% align:start
We thought it would
be warm down here.
