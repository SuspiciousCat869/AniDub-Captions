with a strange moveable island,

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
which arrived next to their home
during a terrible typhoon.

more secrets up his sleeve.

as could be expected

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:41.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
The force of Nadia's destiny
soon drew the children

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.664 position:19% line:89% align:start
into a peculiar cavern

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:46.433 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.640 position:10% line:83% align:start

a collective intelligence
of a former kingdom,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.479 position:19% line:83% align:start

that she was not only the heir

to the Atlantean throne,
but that she was not human.

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:08.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
Soon the island was struck
by violent tremors

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.592 position:16% line:83% align:start

we'll get to Africa a lot sooner

I guess the lion must've drunk

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
some of the red fruit
juice supply.

00:21:42.737 --> 00:21:45.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
What does the red juice
have to do with King running?

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:47.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a secret medicine
found only within my village

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:51.444 position:16% line:83% align:start
that allows the recipient
to exhibit magical abilities.

[woman] What a cute lion.

00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:16.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
[woman] What a poor lion.

[Gonzalez]
What a find, a white lion cub.

00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:22.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is a prized
specimen in our trade.

00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.411 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Nadia] King!
-[all] King!

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:28.983 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Where are you?
-[Marie] King! Here, boy!

00:22:30.117 --> 00:22:32.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[all] Where are you?!
-[laughs]

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.523 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Oh, no! Everybody get down!
-Huh?

00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:42.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What is that?
-It's the treasure hunters.

00:22:42.897 --> 00:22:45.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've had their eye
on our prized possession.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Treasure? -I thought
we'd beaten them back.

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:53.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
-What are they still doing here?
-[Gonzalez] Hamahama!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.976 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that you?

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:57.812 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hiding in plain sight again.

00:22:57.845 --> 00:22:59.647 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hamahama?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
How could he know
that we're hiding out here?

00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:09.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Gonzalez] You seem like
you're looking for something.

00:23:09.724 --> 00:23:11.826 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is this it, by any chance?

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:15.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
[all] That's King!

00:23:17.932 --> 00:23:19.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well now, old friend.

00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.169 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems that our little dispute
has taken a strange turn.

00:23:22.203 --> 00:23:23.671 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's settle up.

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:26.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you would agree to new
negotiations now.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hold your tongue!

00:23:27.742 --> 00:23:29.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't believe your deceptive
manner of talk!

00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:31.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You're hiding something!
-Very well.

00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:34.515 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll give it to
you straight, then.

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:36.817 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you wish for
the lion to remain alive,

00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:40.221 position:7% line:83% align:start
you will deliver your treasure
to me without delay.

00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:43.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
I will give
you 24 hours to comply.

00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:46.060 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you don't
answer me within that time,

00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:49.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll remove the ropes from
the lion

00:23:49.063 --> 00:23:51.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
and replace them
with nails.
