[narrator] Jean, Nadia, Marie,

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
and King escaped from
the sinking Nautilus

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:30.725 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the nick of time,

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.393 position:10% line:83% align:start
only to wash up on the shore
of a deserted island

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:36.163 position:16% line:89% align:start
miles from civilization.

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.199 position:10% line:83% align:start
There they began the arduous
task of starting a new life

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
and growing accustomed to
getting by

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:43.403 position:30% line:83% align:start
without modern
conveniences.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
None of which was made any
easier by Nadia's temper

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:48.876 position:21% line:89% align:start
and underhandedness.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.445 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
the wayward heroine realized

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.448 position:19% line:83% align:start
that her allies were as
important to her as nature,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.217 position:5% line:89% align:start
and that Jean was a true friend.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.756 position:35% line:83% align:start
They shared
their first and second kiss.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.659 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not that it made
their tempestuous relationship

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:06.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
any less turbulent.

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:09.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yet nature sprung a surprise
on our enterprising heroes

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.834 position:24% line:83% align:start
and presented them
with a strange moveable island,

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
which arrived next to their home
during a terrible typhoon.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.275 position:21% line:83% align:start
There they discovered
their former associates,

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.847 position:13% line:83% align:start
Grandis, Hanson, and Sanson
as well as Ayrton,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.417 position:24% line:83% align:start
who proved to have
more secrets up his sleeve.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
Their lives became as normal
as could be expected

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:35.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
which is not to say that they
were entirely bereft

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.793 position:10% line:89% align:start
of intriguing daily oddities.

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:41.428 position:10% line:83% align:start
The force of Nadia's destiny
soon drew the children

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.664 position:19% line:89% align:start
into a peculiar cavern

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:46.433 position:30% line:83% align:start
which bore more
than a passing resemblance

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.636 position:5% line:89% align:start
to their former subaquatic home.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
There Nadia was whisked into
the secret chamber of Red Noah,

00:02:52.674 --> 00:02:55.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
a collective intelligence
of a former kingdom,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.479 position:19% line:83% align:start
which explained to her
that she was not only the heir

00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:04.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
to the Atlantean throne,
but that she was not human.

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:08.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
Soon the island was struck
by violent tremors

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
and Jean launched himself
on a daring rescue mission

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:14.796 position:30% line:83% align:start
to bring Nadia
back to the surface world.

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.465 position:21% line:83% align:start
As is often the case
in this amazing adventure,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
the children were saved from
certain death

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
at the very
last moment,

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:25.840 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the Gratan set sail
for the African continent.

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
But what will life be like

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
now that the secret has been
revealed?

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
What in the name
of Her Majesty is that?

Garfish.

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:47.628 position:21% line:83% align:start
-A Garfish? -It's one
of Gargoyle's submarines.

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.496 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's a submarine?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.999 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then we must beg them to
help us out of this situation.

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.668 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll get their attention.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:56.904 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahoy!

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.271 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please help us.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.339 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahoy!

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
We need your help!

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:04:02.844 --> 00:04:05.046 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you mad? They'll find us.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.014 position:33% line:83% align:start
But seeing as
we're hopelessly lost.

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.016 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would think you'd
want them to find us.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Ahh! -You're
pretty stupid, aren't you?

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.987 position:7% line:83% align:start
You better prepared to withdraw
those words

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.454 position:30% line:83% align:start
or my arms will
hurt you.

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:16.791 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's Gargoyle's submarine.

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:18.458 position:21% line:89% align:start
Didn't you hear that?

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:20.293 position:13% line:83% align:start
He is the one we have been
struggling against

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:21.361 position:27% line:89% align:start
all of this time.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
He wants to take Nadia captive.

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.398 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do you mean that?

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.034 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-He'd kill us all to get her.

[all] Sanson!

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.709 position:10% line:89% align:start
The only way to win this game

00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:37.310 position:13% line:83% align:start
is to strike first and make
it count.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:38.478 position:35% line:89% align:start

-What happened?
-Well, that was a new one.

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:50.390 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, that's fairly obvious.

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.727 position:24% line:83% align:start
I sunk that bucket
with a single shot.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.796 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, no.

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:57.031 position:33% line:83% align:start
I think it's
actually chasing the island.

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.733 position:13% line:89% align:start
What are you talking about?

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.333 position:35% line:89% align:start

explain to me why. -Huh?

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why did a Garfish
suddenly appear at that moment

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:16.416 position:21% line:89% align:start
right at that place?

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.451 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.755 position:35% line:83% align:start
And how did
that island sink so suddenly?

00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:24.457 position:19% line:83% align:start
Not only that, what was
etched into the terrain there?

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.760 position:21% line:89% align:start
You've got to tell us

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:27.662 position:16% line:83% align:start
what happened to you down
there, Jean.

00:05:29.664 --> 00:05:31.999 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nadia is still
fast asleep, Jean.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:35.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
Will you please explain to us
what you saw?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.538 position:19% line:89% align:start
So many amazing things

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:40.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
have happened to us since
we first met.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.977 position:21% line:83% align:start
And many more things

the flying battleship,

00:05:59.694 --> 00:06:02.663 position:19% line:83% align:start
each one alone would be
difficult enough to believe.

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:04.131 position:19% line:89% align:start
We witnessed them all.

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:05.867 position:7% line:89% align:start
But nobody will ever believe us

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.869 position:19% line:83% align:start
when we tell them about
these things.

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:09.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's right, you know,

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:12.106 position:13% line:83% align:start
I would never have believed
such things were possible.

00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:15.509 position:16% line:83% align:start
What is all this rubbish
you're talking about?

00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:18.813 position:10% line:83% align:start
Surely you don't expect me to
believe such whole cloth lies?

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:22.516 position:5% line:83% align:start
Did I actually hear the greatest
imposter in the known world

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
accuse us all of being liars?
What a crock.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.855 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is an enormous list
of events and sights

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.857 position:16% line:83% align:start
that we would've doubted
had we not seen them

00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.158 position:19% line:89% align:start
with our own two eyes.

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:33.794 position:47% line:89% align:start
So?

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:36.530 position:24% line:83% align:start
And yet the things
that I witnessed on the island

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
are the most
unbelievable of them all.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.603 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean, an entire
island sank from under us.

00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:44.906 position:33% line:83% align:start
What could be
more outlandish than that?

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.842 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.579 position:13% line:83% align:start

You've wanted to go to Africa
for such a long time now.

we'll get to Africa a lot sooner

something interesting.

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.502 position:10% line:83% align:start
He said that your Blue Stone
looks exactly like the one

00:15:34.536 --> 00:15:37.037 position:27% line:83% align:start
that the ruler of
the Silver Kingdom had

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.372 position:21% line:89% align:start
many, many years ago.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.541 position:30% line:89% align:start
Silver Kingdom?

00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:44.011 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Hamahama] A very long time ago,
far beyond this village,

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.180 position:27% line:83% align:start
there was a great
kingdom made of silver.

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:48.683 position:7% line:83% align:start
And there was a war when I was
a small boy

00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.552 position:30% line:83% align:start
that destroyed
it completely.

00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:51.753 position:41% line:89% align:start

00:15:51.786 --> 00:15:52.953 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:56.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
The ruler of that kingdom
gave our village a silver column

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.725 position:16% line:89% align:start
as a token of friendship.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:00.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
We keep it safe
behind that door.

Is it in danger?

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:04.031 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Hamahama] Through the years,

00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:06.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
many evil men from Europe,
America,

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
Arabia, and Asia,
have attacked our village

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:10.037 position:21% line:89% align:start
in order to steal it.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
But we have never been defeated.

00:16:12.674 --> 00:16:14.107 position:24% line:89% align:start
And that is because

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.778 position:5% line:83% align:start
we are protected by the power of
Shisa Shisa.

00:16:16.811 --> 00:16:19.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
His fierce loyalty to
our village

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:21.081 position:27% line:83% align:start
has outmanned all
invaders.

00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:24.586 position:13% line:83% align:start
Those evil men have proven
no match for us.

00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:26.554 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] How wonderful.

00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:29.256 position:19% line:83% align:start
It really doesn't have
anything to do with us,

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
but it's merely the protection
of the gods.

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:34.261 position:33% line:83% align:start
Incidentally,
please accept my apology

00:16:34.294 --> 00:16:36.564 position:13% line:83% align:start
for how rude we treated you
upon your arrival.

00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:39.801 position:7% line:83% align:start
But we were afraid that you had
come to attack us as well.

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:43.403 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no need to,
compared with you, Hamahama,

00:16:43.437 --> 00:16:45.507 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm a very evil person.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.174 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come, now.

I'm afraid.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:00.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I'm telling
you the truth, Nadia.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.724 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's strictly against the order
of our people

00:17:02.757 --> 00:17:04.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
to tell a lie for any reason.

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
some of the red fruit
juice supply.

00:21:42.737 --> 00:21:45.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
What does the red juice
have to do with King running?

00:21:45.072 --> 00:21:47.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a secret medicine
found only within my village

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:51.444 position:16% line:83% align:start
that allows the recipient
to exhibit magical abilities.

[woman] What a cute lion.

00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:16.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
[woman] What a poor lion.

[Gonzalez]
What a find, a white lion cub.

00:22:19.406 --> 00:22:22.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is a prized
specimen in our trade.

00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.411 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[Nadia] King!
-[all] King!

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:28.983 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Where are you?
-[Marie] King! Here, boy!

00:22:30.117 --> 00:22:32.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[all] Where are you?!
-[laughs]

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.523 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Oh, no! Everybody get down!
-Huh?

00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:42.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What is that?
-It's the treasure hunters.

00:22:42.897 --> 00:22:45.867 position:21% line:83% align:start
They've had their eye
on our prized possession.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Treasure? -I thought
we'd beaten them back.

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:53.406 position:5% line:83% align:start
-What are they still doing here?
-[Gonzalez] Hamahama!

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.976 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is that you?

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:57.812 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hiding in plain sight again.

00:22:57.845 --> 00:22:59.647 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hamahama?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.149 position:27% line:83% align:start
How could he know
that we're hiding out here?

00:23:07.088 --> 00:23:09.690 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Gonzalez] You seem like
you're looking for something.

00:23:09.724 --> 00:23:11.826 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is this it, by any chance?

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:15.696 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:16.898 position:24% line:89% align:start
[all] That's King!

00:23:17.932 --> 00:23:19.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well now, old friend.

00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.169 position:5% line:83% align:start
It seems that our little dispute
has taken a strange turn.

00:23:22.203 --> 00:23:23.671 position:27% line:89% align:start
Let's settle up.

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:26.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you would agree to new
negotiations now.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.708 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hold your tongue!

00:23:27.742 --> 00:23:29.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't believe your deceptive
manner of talk!

00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:31.913 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You're hiding something!
-Very well.

00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:34.515 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'll give it to
you straight, then.

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:36.817 position:30% line:83% align:start
If you wish for
the lion to remain alive,

00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:40.221 position:7% line:83% align:start
you will deliver your treasure
to me without delay.

00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:43.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
I will give
you 24 hours to comply.

00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:46.060 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you don't
answer me within that time,

00:23:46.093 --> 00:23:49.030 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll remove the ropes from
the lion

00:23:49.063 --> 00:23:51.098 position:27% line:83% align:start
and replace them
with nails.
