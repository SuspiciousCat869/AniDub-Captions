[narrator]
The Nautilus fell under attack

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:30.490 position:10% line:83% align:start
by the gigantic new Atlantean
air battleship

00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:32.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
and its advanced weaponry.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:37.331 position:10% line:83% align:start
After a valiant fight it was
sunk in the South Pacific.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:42.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
Could this be the last voyage
of the uncanny submarine?

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.605 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

[alarm beeping]

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.412 position:7% line:89% align:start
[helmsman] Depth is 600 meters.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.247 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nemo]
How deep is the Kermodec Trench?

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.883 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
Approximately 10,000 meters.

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:57.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can normally handle
that depth

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.721 position:30% line:83% align:start
with no problem
whatsoever,

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:01.889 position:27% line:83% align:start
but in the state
that we're in...

00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:03.858 position:27% line:89% align:start
[water splashing]

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.198 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
how we will stand it.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:12.900 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Garfish fleet
is approaching rapidly.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.407 position:19% line:83% align:start
Depth charges deployed
and approaching.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.544 position:33% line:89% align:start

damaged as well!

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.727 position:7% line:89% align:start
Can you tell me where they are?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
[sonar] Directly overhead.

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.297 position:16% line:89% align:start
Distance is 1,800 meters.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.667 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Compressed air status?

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.336 position:13% line:83% align:start
[helmsman] Only enough left
for one more surfacing.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:57.411 position:16% line:83% align:start
Assemble all crew members
into the central block.

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:58.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
We'll then strike at them
with our combat blocks,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.480 position:24% line:89% align:start
last buoyant force.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:01.983 position:33% line:89% align:start
But, Captain.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.886 position:13% line:83% align:start
Otherwise self-destruction
is our only option.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Now, First Officer.
-Aye.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.290 position:35% line:83% align:start
All hands,
report to the secondary shelter

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.959 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the central block.

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:14.796 position:27% line:83% align:start
Repeat, all hands
report to the secondary shelter

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.531 position:21% line:89% align:start
in the central block.

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:19.366 position:21% line:83% align:start
We will be separating
from the combat block.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.935 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Separating?
-What's that?

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.235 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.303 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
Can you hear me, Jean?

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.271 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I can.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.574 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry for before.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:29.544 position:33% line:83% align:start
You are safe
right where you are.

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:30.745 position:33% line:89% align:start
Do not move.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.914 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ms. Electra!

00:03:32.947 --> 00:03:35.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're going to be fine,
so please don't worry.

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.653 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh... wait!

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:39.821 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll see you later.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.897 position:16% line:83% align:start
Central block separation
is complete.

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.365 position:5% line:89% align:start
Power sources are switched over.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.868 position:19% line:83% align:start
[crew] Combat block is
functioning

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.636 position:16% line:89% align:start
independent of main unit.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.805 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Detonation
is set for 800 meters,

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.373 position:7% line:89% align:start
distance to fleet 1,500 meters.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.909 position:10% line:89% align:start
Release the combat block now.

00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:02.944 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Aye.

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:05.847 position:41% line:89% align:start
[beeps]

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.962 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
[operator] Nautilus
has separated into two parts

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:34.307 position:13% line:89% align:start
at a depth of 2,400 meters.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.910 position:35% line:89% align:start
We did it.

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
The water pressure
has torn them asunder!

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.046 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Incorrect.

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.950 position:19% line:83% align:start
They've only amputated
the weakest link.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.786 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's... that's impossible.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.354 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell the Garfish
to retreat immediately

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.056 position:10% line:89% align:start
or they will soon regret it.

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:50.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
Understood.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.393 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:04.371 position:13% line:83% align:start
[sonar] Garfish destroyed,

-[rumbling]

00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.647 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's always
such a terrible sound.

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.049 position:7% line:89% align:start
It could happen to us as well.

00:05:15.082 --> 00:05:16.918 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.920 position:7% line:83% align:start
It is worth noting that we have
no power left to surface, sir.

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:26.060 position:35% line:83% align:start
[operator]
The Garfish fleet is destroyed.

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:28.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm terribly sorry,
Lord Gargoyle.

00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:29.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Damn them.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.000 position:16% line:83% align:start
How severe is the damage
to the Nautilus?

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:34.836 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sir, that is not
fully known yet.

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:37.404 position:33% line:89% align:start
So resilient.

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.847 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasps]

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
-What on earth is that?
-Good question.

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:52.753 position:7% line:89% align:start
It is a deep sea current, sir.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:54.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
It is flowing southwest
at six knots.

00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:57.124 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.459 position:21% line:89% align:start
Will you see to this?

00:06:00.862 --> 00:06:01.896 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Aye.

00:06:10.738 --> 00:06:13.674 position:13% line:83% align:start
[operator] The Nautilus has
reached a depth of 4,000 meters.

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:16.844 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry,
but it's beyond our range.

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:19.680 position:7% line:83% align:start
[follower 1] It couldn't stand
another assault

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:23.050 position:16% line:83% align:start
even if its hull was made
from a space titanium alloy.

00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:25.686 position:33% line:83% align:start
[follower 2]
Their damage is quite extensive.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.155 position:5% line:83% align:start
[follower 3] It would be a short
exercise to finish them off.

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.092 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] We cornered
it but couldn't kill it.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.160 position:10% line:89% align:start
Who is responsible for this?

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:34.896 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both gasps]

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:36.998 position:19% line:83% align:start
[follower 1] The fault
is entirely mine, my Lord.

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:38.498 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Pay no mind.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.137 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a pity we couldn't witness
the end of the Nautilus.

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:46.741 position:13% line:89% align:start
Report this to the Emperor.

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:47.875 position:19% line:89% align:start
[followers] Understood.

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.713 position:24% line:89% align:start
[man] Emperor Neo,

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:58.853 position:7% line:89% align:start
we have a report from Gargoyle.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.888 position:21% line:89% align:start
Put it through, now.

00:07:00.922 --> 00:07:03.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
[man] Your will is done.

00:07:03.057 --> 00:07:05.092 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Good
news, Emperor Neo.

00:07:05.126 --> 00:07:08.529 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Nautilus lies ruined
at a depth of 4,000 meters

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.064 position:19% line:89% align:start
in the Kermodec Trench.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.465 position:19% line:89% align:start
All are believed dead.

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.834 position:30% line:89% align:start
Pleasant news.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.803 position:10% line:89% align:start
You have served me very well.

00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:17.538 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Excellency,

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.907 position:30% line:83% align:start
may I impose on
Your Highness' goodwill

00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:22.944 position:13% line:83% align:start
and request your assistance
in locating Nemo

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:24.979 position:19% line:89% align:start
and Nadia's Blue Water?

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.214 position:30% line:89% align:start
It is granted.

00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:29.482 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Excellency,
we are most grateful.

00:07:29.517 --> 00:07:31.552 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will present you
with a detailed report

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:33.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the fullness of time
upon my return.

00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:35.156 position:16% line:89% align:start
I long to see you again.

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:38.059 position:33% line:89% align:start
I shall wait.

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:41.762 position:35% line:83% align:start
Excellency,
I remain your humble servant.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.635 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Neo] Nemo and Nadia
have been killed.

For over 12,000 years,

00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:53.874 position:33% line:83% align:start
so much blood
has been sacrificed

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.609 position:19% line:89% align:start
all for the Blue Water.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.788 position:24% line:83% align:start

Can you tell me?

Why did you go back
to being an ordinary father?

It is.

00:20:12.647 --> 00:20:14.582 position:21% line:89% align:start
I want you to tell me

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:17.350 position:7% line:83% align:start
why you couldn't kill yourself
to destroy Gargoyle?

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:22.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't allow myself
to make the same mistake.

00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:24.257 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mistake?

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:27.929 position:13% line:83% align:start
The mistake that caused you
to destroy your homeland

00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:30.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
and kill every person
you ever loved?

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.232 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:36.804 position:10% line:89% align:start
I must atone for what I did.

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:39.507 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.943 position:10% line:89% align:start
I live only for that purpose.

00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:43.745 position:13% line:83% align:start
Then why didn't you destroy
yourself

00:20:43.778 --> 00:20:46.581 position:21% line:83% align:start
when you finally had
the chance?

-Answer.
-For 13 years,

00:20:50.518 --> 00:20:51.919 position:19% line:89% align:start
you've been by my side.

00:20:52.687 --> 00:20:55.355 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think of you as
my own daughter.

00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:57.357 position:13% line:83% align:start
I could not do that to you,
my child.

Electra, I did it for you.

You are unfair.

00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:14.709 position:21% line:89% align:start
I can't kill you now.

00:21:19.647 --> 00:21:22.282 position:13% line:83% align:start
You dare tell me something
like this at this moment

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:27.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
and so I will use
this last bullet on myself.

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:30.423 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll give you back
