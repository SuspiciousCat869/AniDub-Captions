[singing in Japanese]

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:29.824 position:7% line:83% align:start
[narrator] The Nautilus docked
by remote island for supplies,

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:32.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
but encountered
unexpected guests.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.763 position:21% line:83% align:start
Little did they know
that a Neo-Atlantean supply ship

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:38.198 position:7% line:89% align:start
was also moored at the island.

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.602 position:27% line:83% align:start
Marie and Sanson
were chased by soldiers

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:42.604 position:16% line:89% align:start
until they reached camp.

00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:44.505 position:7% line:89% align:start
A soldier tried to shoot Nadia

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
but was killed at
the last minute by Captain Nemo.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:48.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
The adventure continues.

00:01:55.717 --> 00:01:58.151 position:13% line:83% align:start
[sonar] Sir, I've detected
an unidentified ship

00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.286 position:30% line:89% align:start
at two o'clock.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.755 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
We've caught them at last.

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:02.890 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, it has to be the Garfish.

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:04.626 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no other ship
in all the world besides ours

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.229 position:38% line:83% align:start
that can
operate at these depths.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.264 position:35% line:83% align:start
They may be
able to dive like us,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
but that is where
the comparisons end.

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.402 position:7% line:89% align:start
Shall we pursue them, Captain?

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:18.372 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course.
Alter bearing to 2:00.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:20.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
-And full speed ahead.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.745 position:27% line:83% align:start
All hands report
to level two battle positions.

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:25.613 position:24% line:83% align:start
All hands to level
two battle positions.

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:30.250 position:24% line:83% align:start
I repeat, all hands
to level two battle positions.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:33.286 position:7% line:83% align:start
All non-combatants must report
to block three shelters.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.422 position:10% line:89% align:start
Good. Another chance to kill.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.625 position:13% line:83% align:start
But Nadia, it's this times
they might be

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.627 position:21% line:83% align:start
going after Gargoyle
and his assassins.

00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:41.863 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's the difference?
He's a murderer, too.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.632 position:35% line:89% align:start
Despicable.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:45.900 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, but...

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] There's no excuse.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.236 position:35% line:83% align:start
He murdered
that man in cold blood.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.271 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't care
what his reasons were!

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.341 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jean] But that soldier had
his rifle pointed right at you.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
He'd have killed you
if the captain didn't act.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.814 position:7% line:83% align:start
I would rather have died myself
than witness his butchery.

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:02.215 position:7% line:89% align:start
That doesn't make sense, Nadia!

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.385 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[King purrs]
-Marie!

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.292 position:7% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with her, Doctor?

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.829 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
They told me Marie collapsed.

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.564 position:41% line:89% align:start
Marie.

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:18.465 position:41% line:89% align:start
Doctor,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:21.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
Marie, is she--is she
going to be all right?

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.771 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.239 position:33% line:83% align:start
Tell me what
her condition is now!

00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:28.341 position:10% line:89% align:start
It is a rare tropical fever.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:29.977 position:24% line:83% align:start
-A tropical fever?
-A tropical fever?

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.814 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't care what the name
of the disease is, doctor.

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:33.881 position:16% line:89% align:start
She will recover, right?

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:38.285 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Well, that is hard to say.
-What?

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.021 position:30% line:89% align:start
You mean, she--

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:42.824 position:10% line:83% align:start
why don't you give us some of
your advanced miracle medicine

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:44.859 position:16% line:89% align:start
and make her well again?

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:46.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
I said it is very rare,
didn't I?

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:48.930 position:13% line:89% align:start
We don't have the antidote.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:51.766 position:16% line:89% align:start
But you must have--you--

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.035 position:16% line:89% align:start
Marie, she--you have to--

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:56.369 position:24% line:83% align:start
-listen, Hanson...
-[Hanson] Hmm?

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
You and your blessed
science must be able

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.707 position:30% line:83% align:start
to do something
for her, can't you?

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.275 position:35% line:83% align:start
But I know
nothing about medicine.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.311 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ugh, great!

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of this science
and it's of no use!

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Marie gasping]
-What's the matter, Marie?

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:10.885 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can you hear me, my dear?

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:12.887 position:38% line:89% align:start
Can you?

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:18.025 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
[crying] Can somebody do
something for her

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.868 position:13% line:89% align:start
for heaven's sake, please?

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.468 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Doctor] Perhaps...

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:29.537 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perhaps?

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.838 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What is it?
-[sighs]

00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:33.473 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe Captain
Nemo can help her.

00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:38.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
He is a specialist in Marine
Biology and tropical diseases.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.480 position:35% line:83% align:start
Then he can
save Marie from this.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:41.682 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.050 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia!

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.853 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nadia panting]

00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:47.688 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What is it?

00:04:47.722 --> 00:04:51.559 position:13% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo, Marie, she's
contracted a tropical fever.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
The doctor told us
you could help her, Captain.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.765 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've got to do
whatever you can.

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've got to save
her from this, sir.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.036 position:27% line:83% align:start
Are you listening
to me, Captain?

00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:04.739 position:35% line:89% align:start
Save Marie!

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:06.808 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Nadia,

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:09.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
the only antidote
to Marie's fever

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:11.712 position:16% line:83% align:start
is located at the bottom
of Reef 64,

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:15.783 position:19% line:83% align:start
but we are 6,000 meters
from overtaking the Garfish.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:17.618 position:21% line:89% align:start
We have been matching

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:19.720 position:19% line:83% align:start
its course for 10 days
straight already.

00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
We simply can't afford
to let it get away this time.

00:05:23.758 --> 00:05:25.358 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's your excuse?

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:29.396 position:21% line:83% align:start
Capturing the Garfish
must be our primary goal.

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:32.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
And you'll sacrifice
a small child to that goal?

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.636 position:7% line:83% align:start
You'll let her die just so you
can destroy another submarine?

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.071 position:19% line:89% align:start
The crew of the Garfish

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.574 position:24% line:83% align:start
will be killed once
you achieve your goal

00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:43.010 position:10% line:83% align:start
and you are willing to commit
more acts of murder?

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.683 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Answer me!
-Nadia, you must calm down.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.853 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:54.689 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Nadia?
-[Captain Nemo] Hmm?

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:55.957 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Nadia?

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.892 position:19% line:89% align:start
Someone get the doctor.

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:01.662 position:33% line:83% align:start
I just heard
that they've fallen ill!

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:03.965 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Yes, it's true.
-Yes, it's true.

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:06.100 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do they know
what the sickness is?

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.101 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:12.940 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Doctor] Nadia has contracted
the same fever.

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:15.109 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is this fever serious, Doctor?

00:06:16.878 --> 00:06:18.112 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, fraulein.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:20.081 position:30% line:83% align:start
They'll both be
dead in two days.

00:06:20.114 --> 00:06:21.481 position:27% line:89% align:start
[all] They can't.

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.517 position:33% line:83% align:start
I do not have
the right medicine.

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:25.119 position:16% line:83% align:start
Without it, there's very
little I can do.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:26.888 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] I see.

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:29.991 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will speak to the captain
about getting what you need.

00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.626 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Wait a moment, ma'am.
-[Grandis] Ugh!

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.695 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let me speak to him.
-And why is that?

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.432 position:30% line:83% align:start
Because I have
a question for him.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:40.902 position:19% line:89% align:start
I want to know how long

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:42.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
these girls will have to lay
here suffering

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.906 position:16% line:89% align:start
before he can be bothered

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:46.540 position:19% line:83% align:start
to take any interest in
their plight.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:48.943 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:53.547 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is it beneath him to offer
even one word of kindness?

00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.481 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ugh!

00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:56.851 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is he?

00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:58.920 position:7% line:89% align:start
How can a man be so heartless?

00:07:02.223 --> 00:07:04.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
-She what? Nadia as well?
-Yes.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:06.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
We believe she caught
it from Marie, sir.

00:07:07.695 --> 00:07:09.163 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:12.533 position:27% line:83% align:start
With that fever,
they only have 48 hours to live.

00:07:12.566 --> 00:07:14.936 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sonar] We're within
3,000 meters of the Garfish.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.738 position:30% line:83% align:start
We'll be within
firing range in two minutes.

00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:19.807 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] You'll let her die
just so you can

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.575 position:13% line:89% align:start
destroy another submarine?

00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:22.743 position:7% line:83% align:start

lose the Garfish.

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:41.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've sacrifice too
much for this chance.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:44.098 position:30% line:83% align:start

-[Nemo] Assume the command.
-Aye.

00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:34.815 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, we're sure to catch up
with the Garfish

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.283 position:27% line:89% align:start
some other time.

00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:38.753 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's assuming
you remember how to do your job.

00:08:38.786 --> 00:08:40.087 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, right.

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:41.989 position:10% line:89% align:start
We might be in trouble then.

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:44.158 position:16% line:89% align:start
If you know what I mean.

00:08:44.825 --> 00:08:46.861 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:57.338 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jean] We're going to Reef 64?

00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:00.007 position:16% line:83% align:start
You mean Nadia and Marie
are going to be saved?

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:02.309 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yes, it will take about a day to
get there,

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:04.078 position:7% line:89% align:start
but that ought be enough time.

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.146 position:35% line:89% align:start
Magnifique!

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.914 position:38% line:83% align:start

We won!

00:09:06.947 --> 00:09:10.051 position:7% line:83% align:start

Ms. Electra right now.

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:12.753 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:14.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, wait.

00:09:14.088 --> 00:09:16.090 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wouldn't do that. Jean!

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:18.692 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

Oh, me and my big mouth,

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:22.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:26.867 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
I agree, he has changed.

00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:28.803 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's not the Captain Nemo
we've come to know.

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:30.871 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was as surprised as anyone was

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:33.007 position:21% line:83% align:start
when he ordered us to
change course

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.875 position:30% line:83% align:start
and give up our
pursuit of the Garfish.

00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:39.713 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even so, I think he was correct
in making his decision.

00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:42.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
If we were to let
those children die just

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
so we could achieve
our chief objective,

00:09:45.119 --> 00:09:48.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
we would be no better than
Gargoyle and his Neo-Atlanteans.

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:53.260 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, I want to avenge
my son and grandchild,

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.996 position:13% line:89% align:start
but I won't let that happen

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.898 position:13% line:83% align:start
at the expense of innocent
children.

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:02.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
I trust Captain Nemo
with my entire being, Electra.

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:05.773 position:24% line:83% align:start
The only reason any
of us is still alive

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:08.709 position:35% line:83% align:start
is because
he was there to rescue us.

00:10:11.812 --> 00:10:14.882 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I wonder what kind of man
Captain Nemo really is.

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:16.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] That's pretty
bloody obvious.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Hmm?
-He's a scoundrel.

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:19.987 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Do you think so?

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
Haven't you seen that
old man pursuing

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:24.158 position:27% line:83% align:start
Miss Grandis like
he's some teenager?

00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.393 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think you have that
backwards, Sanson.

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:27.628 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut it!

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:31.365 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, Jean, promise me,
when you grow up,

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.335 position:10% line:83% align:start
don't become a creepy old man
like Captain Nemo.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:36.403 position:7% line:89% align:start
Grow up to be a gentleman just

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:38.372 position:16% line:83% align:start
like your friend Sanson,
all right, son?

00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:40.975 position:27% line:83% align:start
You might want to
reconsider that option.

00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut it!

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:46.714 position:24% line:83% align:start
See, Captain Nemo,
he doesn't have what it takes.

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.416 position:16% line:89% align:start
But he shot a man though.

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.919 position:24% line:89% align:start
That means nothing.

00:10:52.153 --> 00:10:53.988 position:16% line:89% align:start
There is a war going on.

00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:56.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even a coward can kill
during wartime, Jean.

00:10:56.891 --> 00:10:57.892 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's not manhood.

00:10:59.426 --> 00:11:01.695 position:10% line:89% align:start
Besides, from what I've seen,

00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:04.732 position:5% line:83% align:start
the captain is more than willing
to let his crew kill and die

00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.233 position:19% line:89% align:start
while he does nothing.

00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:08.202 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're wrong, Sanson.

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:09.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
I saw what he did myself.

00:11:09.504 --> 00:11:10.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:12.973 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:14.675 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're not accustomed
to seeing people die, are you?

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
When I was growing up,
I saw many people die

00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:21.148 position:24% line:83% align:start
during wartime and
widespread epidemics.

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
I even saw my parents die.

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:27.087 position:19% line:83% align:start
Death is far from rare
in the times we live in.

00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.790 position:7% line:83% align:start
And the ability to cause death
is no sign of a great man.

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:20.334 position:33% line:83% align:start
I must teach

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:22.936 position:10% line:83% align:start
If we are within five meters
of each other,

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.607 position:10% line:83% align:start
we can talk through wireless

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.974 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:28.942 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'd have given King
one if we'd known.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.578 position:13% line:89% align:start
What a brilliant invention!

00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:33.080 position:7% line:89% align:start
However, outside of that range,

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:36.083 position:13% line:83% align:start
the wireless system becomes
distorted and unreliable,

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.485 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you must then
implement this light.

00:13:39.953 --> 00:13:42.222 position:27% line:83% align:start

one last thing before we go.

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:54.001 position:13% line:83% align:start
Reef 64 is relatively safe

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:56.437 position:30% line:83% align:start

[Nemo] First officer, it is I.

00:14:11.051 --> 00:14:13.020 position:38% line:83% align:start
We are in

Aye aye, Captain.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.292 position:21% line:89% align:start
Commencing operation.

00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:22.597 position:10% line:83% align:start

to happen, right?

[King whimpers]

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:27.434 position:7% line:89% align:start
There's no need to panic, okay?

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:28.902 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just breathe normally.

00:14:55.663 --> 00:14:58.132 position:5% line:89% align:start

00:14:58.165 --> 00:15:00.702 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Jean,
we haven't time. Hurry.

00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:02.169 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh. Of course, sir.

00:15:03.203 --> 00:15:05.673 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Get a move on there, Jean.
-I'm sorry.

Distance to bottom

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:29.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I've never seen
fish like this before.

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:31.398 position:7% line:89% align:start
Modern man has never seen them.

00:15:31.432 --> 00:15:33.434 position:21% line:83% align:start
The outside world has
considered them extinct

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
for millions of years.

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:35.969 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:36.003 --> 00:15:37.404 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nemo]
But they found their own home

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.507 position:19% line:83% align:start
within the crevices and
currents of this remote reef,

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:41.975 position:13% line:89% align:start
far from man's foolishness.

00:15:42.476 --> 00:15:46.548 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is truly a lost world, just
like in the adventure books.

00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:48.583 position:30% line:83% align:start
You know, this
reef would be a dream

00:15:48.616 --> 00:15:50.451 position:27% line:83% align:start
come true for an
oceanic paleontologist.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.087 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] What's this?

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.256 position:38% line:83% align:start
They call
it the snow of the deep.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's composed of
dead microorganisms.

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:00.394 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jean] That's incredible!

00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:03.263 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] They emit light,
even after death.

[Sanson] There are more things
in heaven and Earth

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.768 position:27% line:83% align:start
than I dreamt of
in our philosophy.

00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:08.268 position:35% line:89% align:start
Poor Nadia.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.470 position:30% line:83% align:start
She would love
to have seen this.

00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:23.417 position:30% line:83% align:start
-We must hurry.

-[sonar over radio] Aye.

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:42.770 position:19% line:89% align:start
This seaweed has grown

00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.806 position:21% line:83% align:start
as tall and thick as
trees in a forest.

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.140 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why did you bring
that rifle with you, Sanson?

00:16:47.174 --> 00:16:48.342 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, you never can tell

00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:49.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you might just
run into something

00:16:49.844 --> 00:16:51.478 position:7% line:89% align:start
that needs to be shot, Hanson.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:54.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
I think you just feel inadequate
without a gun in your hand.

I hope they don't
run into trouble...

00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:10.698 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, it goes further?

00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:12.634 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is there no bottom to this reef?

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:14.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
If there is, it's over
a thousand meters down.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.236 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're not going down
there, are we, sir?

00:17:18.573 --> 00:17:21.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] No. Our destination
is through that opening there.

00:17:21.876 --> 00:17:24.111 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank God. What luck.

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.179 position:24% line:83% align:start
How are we supposed
to get over there?

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.715 position:27% line:89% align:start
Like this, Jean.

00:17:34.889 --> 00:17:37.124 position:24% line:83% align:start

we get back again?

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:38.626 position:10% line:83% align:start

on the shoulders of your suits?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.528 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all] Huh?

an air balloon to pull you up.

Oh, I wondered
what those were for.

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.536 position:21% line:83% align:start
We'd have given King
one if we'd known.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.538 position:30% line:89% align:start
Now, follow me.

00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:01.749 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very good.

00:18:01.783 --> 00:18:03.851 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now let's hurry.
We have no time.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:12.359 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean] My word!

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.865 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is this what we came for, sir?

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:20.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Yes. This is the herb.
-Good!

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:22.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
So the girls are as good

00:18:31.879 --> 00:18:33.180 position:30% line:89% align:start
This is enough.

00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:59.607 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's big.

00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:00.775 position:33% line:89% align:start
And it's old.

00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:02.877 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a dinicthys from
the Devonian era.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.746 position:5% line:89% align:start
It may have taken us by surprise

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:06.614 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I don't care how
big and old it is,

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:09.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
-a fish is still a fish!
-It won't work.

00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:11.318 position:16% line:83% align:start
But how do we know if we
haven't tried?

A dinicthys skin is as hard
as the world's strongest armor.

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:26.299 position:16% line:83% align:start
That spear gun would not
even put a scratch on it.

00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:28.503 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Uh...
-[Hanson] Captain Nemo...

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:29.904 position:30% line:89% align:start
what do we do?

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:31.739 position:10% line:89% align:start
We can't let it trap us here.

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.473 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've got it.

00:19:33.508 --> 00:19:35.442 position:10% line:89% align:start
Everyone put your lights out.

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:37.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's attracted to us because
it equates light with food.

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:38.646 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all] Huh?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.213 position:19% line:89% align:start
[sonar] Where are they?

00:19:40.782 --> 00:19:43.216 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. I hope nothing's wrong.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:47.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Many of the fish
at this depth are phototaxic.

00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:50.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
They instinctively
head for any light source.

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.325 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] I see.
So that's why the dinicthys--

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.861 position:19% line:83% align:start
the fish left the cave
once the lights were out.

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:56.296 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very interesting.

00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.699 position:24% line:83% align:start
We are going to use
that instinct

00:19:57.732 --> 00:19:59.232 position:5% line:89% align:start
and this little item against it.

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:01.234 position:27% line:89% align:start
But what is that?

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:03.004 position:27% line:89% align:start
Pressure switch.

00:20:03.037 --> 00:20:05.338 position:7% line:89% align:start
If we drop this into the abyss,

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
the change in pressure
will activate the charge

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:08.943 position:38% line:83% align:start
and then
the lights will come on.

00:20:08.976 --> 00:20:10.611 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:13.815 position:13% line:83% align:start
[both] Which will draw the
dinicthys away from the cave!

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:20.788 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] That is far too narrow
for a grown man.

00:20:21.823 --> 00:20:23.390 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Jean.
-Yes, sir?

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:25.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
This mission is
terribly dangerous,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.563 position:13% line:83% align:start
but only you and King have
any hope of carrying it out.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.531 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Will you do it?
-Yes.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:31.733 position:27% line:89% align:start
With honor, sir.

Please hurry back, Captain,
before it's too late.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.978 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is very bad.

00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:46.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
We have only five minutes
worth of oxygen left.

All right, Jean. It's up to you.

It's hard to breathe.

00:20:55.723 --> 00:20:56.991 position:16% line:89% align:start
We must be low on oxygen.

00:20:57.692 --> 00:20:59.827 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's even further.
Let's keep moving, King.

All right.

Now, it is tied to the rock.

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:10.470 position:24% line:89% align:start
That should do it.

00:21:10.505 --> 00:21:11.773 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:13.541 position:13% line:89% align:start
The cable is a bit too long

00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:15.543 position:35% line:83% align:start
but I have
nothing to cut it with it.

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:55.817 position:35% line:89% align:start
We made it.

Ha, we got through all
that trouble

00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:04.759 position:24% line:83% align:start
and they lock us up
in this place.

If we didn't
decompress properly,

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:08.696 position:19% line:83% align:start
our bodies would cramp
up and strangle us.

Well, Hanson, I guess

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.899 position:24% line:83% align:start
we owe our lives to
the boy this time.

He stepped in there

It's true.
