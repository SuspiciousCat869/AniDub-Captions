[dramatic music playing]

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:33.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am ready. Begin.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.530 position:7% line:89% align:start
[officer 1] Sir, I shall begin

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:37.899 position:27% line:83% align:start
with the economic
distribution report.

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:40.602 position:21% line:83% align:start
Due to the commercial
disruption operation,

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.771 position:10% line:83% align:start
we have gained control of 80%
of the world's trade in wool

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.673 position:19% line:89% align:start
and other key products.

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:48.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
Armament exports
are progressing smoothly.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:49.911 position:7% line:89% align:start
[officer 2] Anticipated profits

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:51.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
will meet three percent
of our budget.

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:53.380 position:10% line:83% align:start
[officer 3] Our Neo Atlantis
operation

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.216 position:10% line:83% align:start
has strengthened its foothold
in the banking sector.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.352 position:30% line:83% align:start
It now controls
one-and-a-half percent

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.854 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the world's currencies.

00:01:59.887 --> 00:02:02.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
[officer 4] In the military
sector, the final rigging

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.727 position:7% line:83% align:start
on our second aerial battleship
is complete.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.896 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ahead of schedule, I might add.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lord Gargoyle, our
fleet will be expanded

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.167 position:24% line:83% align:start
by the addition of
seven new Garfish,

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
expansion to be complete
within the week.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.373 position:10% line:83% align:start
[officer 6] Sir, construction
has begun

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.474 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the second burner

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:21.909 position:19% line:89% align:start
for the Tower of Babel.

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:24.779 position:16% line:89% align:start
And what of the Nautilus?

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:29.282 position:7% line:83% align:start
[officer 7] Lord Gargoyle, the
Nautilus is believed to be sunk.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.251 position:30% line:83% align:start
Though we have
no physical evidence.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.755 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
We have no physical evidence?

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:36.924 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, knowing
Nemo as well as I do,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.760 position:30% line:83% align:start
I am sure he is
in hiding somewhere

00:02:38.793 --> 00:02:41.461 position:10% line:89% align:start
trying to find out about us.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:48.268 position:30% line:89% align:start
[phone ringing]

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:01.649 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, First Officer Electra here.

00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:03.450 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
[sonar over phone] Sorry
to disturb you, First Officer.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:07.320 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need you on the bridge.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:08.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've sighted what may be
the Garfish

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.358 position:27% line:83% align:start
at a distance of
30,000 meters.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.360 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, yes, I will
be there right away.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:20.267 position:5% line:83% align:start
[groans] I have such a hard time
waking up in the morning.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm still so sleepy.

00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:25.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
Good morning, gentlemen.

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:26.974 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes, I hope so.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.308 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:31.913 position:30% line:89% align:start
[radar beeping]

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:33.514 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you think it's them?

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:34.649 position:33% line:89% align:start
I can't say.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.653 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's gone.

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:40.253 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's not right.

00:03:40.287 --> 00:03:43.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It probably was a whale.
-Ha.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:45.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's try and track it
with directional radio waves.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.729 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Aye.
-Wow.

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:51.666 position:7% line:83% align:start
And now it's time for us to see
who laughs first.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.535 position:19% line:89% align:start
[quirky music playing]

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:05.378 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.748 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] That Jean.

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.750 position:16% line:83% align:start
He's always reading books
in Electra's room

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:10.918 position:10% line:89% align:start
or working on some invention.

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:13.554 position:7% line:89% align:start
He never comes to play with us.

00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:17.859 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:20.828 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nadia, what's wrong?

00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:22.329 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Nadia.

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:27.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you want to play
"Who Laughs First" with us?

00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.670 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:31.371 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, I got it!

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.473 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're feeling bad because Jean
doesn't come around

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:35.743 position:21% line:89% align:start
to see you very much.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.612 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, that's not it at all!

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:42.016 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. [whimpering]

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:44.752 position:30% line:89% align:start
[cries loudly]

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.554 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:47.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm really so sorry.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:49.524 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please don't cry.

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:51.391 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, please.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:54.729 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, um, I know.

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:57.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's go see where Jean is
and ask him to play.

00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:59.366 position:13% line:89% align:start
How does that sound, Marie?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.535 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:01.869 position:38% line:89% align:start
I swear.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.437 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who in the world taught you
to cry like that?

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.842 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sanson. He taught
me lots and lots of things.

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:12.013 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's see. He said it was
always good to lie and cheat.

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:17.785 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, well, I think those people
have terrible ideas.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.487 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.423 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think I'm coming
down with something.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.429 position:10% line:83% align:start
But at least, I have the joy
of washing my captain's clothes.

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:33.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
I must be the luckiest woman
in the whole world.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.769 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bah! And I must be
the unluckiest man

00:05:34.802 --> 00:05:36.537 position:24% line:89% align:start
in the whole world.

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:39.006 position:30% line:83% align:start
God blessed me
with the skills of a playboy

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.374 position:21% line:83% align:start
and just look at how
they go to waste.

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:44.812 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.014 position:30% line:83% align:start
You never were
much of a playboy,

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
so just shut up
and scrub my dainties!

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:56.090 position:10% line:83% align:start
Just pray that you'll become
a man like my Captain Nemo.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.495 position:16% line:89% align:start
How are you doing, Jean?

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.798 position:33% line:89% align:start
I am perfect.

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.100 position:5% line:89% align:start
This will be finished very soon.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:08.903 position:7% line:83% align:start
And everything will be exactly
as I planned.

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:10.671 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:14.041 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, this, it's
something that flies, I guess?

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
But how come I don't see
a propeller on it?

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.649 position:13% line:83% align:start
With this one, air and fuel
are burnt inside the craft,

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.952 position:5% line:83% align:start
which forces flame from the rear
that makes it fly.

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:27.454 position:7% line:89% align:start
The automatic valve is the key.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.960 position:10% line:83% align:start
But the output is still much
too weak to carry a human being.

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:34.562 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:37.198 --> 00:06:39.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
This isn't going to be
another failure, is it?

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all.

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.970 position:35% line:83% align:start
The theory
behind it is foolproof.

00:06:43.004 --> 00:06:44.505 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just you wait, Nadia.

00:06:44.538 --> 00:06:47.440 position:5% line:83% align:start
This invention will take us away
to Africa.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:48.809 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.177 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] All done.
-Huh?

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.748 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ready for takeoff.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
-It's ready?
-It's ready?

00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:56.951 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yes, we can
begin the trial flight.

00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:58.953 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.127 position:47% line:89% align:start
Go!

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.698 position:35% line:83% align:start
-It works!
-Wonderful!

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.566 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just look how fast it goes.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.869 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I knew
that this would work!

00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:17.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
My theory, it was right.

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.073 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Amazing!
-Amazing!

00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:23.811 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no!

00:07:23.844 --> 00:07:24.745 position:35% line:89% align:start
[explosion]

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.147 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.048 position:35% line:89% align:start
I knew it.

00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:32.887 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all] Look out!

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.755 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:38.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Grandis yawns]

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:48.669 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just look what you have done!

00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.738 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

[explosion]

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:59.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What was that?
-It's an attack!

00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:01.749 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.250 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.189 position:24% line:89% align:start
[laughs awkwardly]

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.924 position:30% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Sorry.

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:11.892 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you know
what caused that noise?

00:08:11.926 --> 00:08:14.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
[laughs] It seems that
one of Jean's inventions

Good work.

Can you tell if
it's the Garfish?

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:29.777 position:13% line:83% align:start
They may have pinpointed us
through that explosion.

That's possible.

He's right
because everybody knows

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:41.188 position:16% line:89% align:start
you have to make mistakes

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:45.593 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come now.
I'm not upset in the least.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.194 position:38% line:83% align:start
I thought
that this might happen.

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:49.230 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, I secretly
built a spare engine.

Jean, don't you see?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.302 position:13% line:83% align:start
The reason this one failed
was because you were relying

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:57.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
too heavily on using
your backup engine.

00:10:03.737 --> 00:10:05.739 position:13% line:83% align:start

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:09.743 position:16% line:83% align:start

We don't know where Gargoyle is.

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
You must have a banner

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:31.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
to justify the cause of
your mission...

00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.233 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:37.638 position:7% line:89% align:start
...but there is another reason,

00:20:37.672 --> 00:20:38.840 position:30% line:89% align:start
it's vengeance.

00:20:38.873 --> 00:20:40.975 position:24% line:89% align:start
Vengeance for what?

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:42.309 position:35% line:89% align:start
My brother.

00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.377 position:10% line:89% align:start
I once had a younger brother.

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.680 position:38% line:89% align:start
Brother?

00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:47.815 position:27% line:89% align:start
Where is he now?

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, 13 years ago,
he went to the place

00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:52.553 position:21% line:89% align:start
where my parents are.

00:20:52.587 --> 00:20:53.888 position:41% line:89% align:start
Where?

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:55.556 position:21% line:89% align:start
The bottom of a lake.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.592 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:57.625 --> 00:21:00.695 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Electra] A man came to
my hometown 13 years ago.

00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:03.831 position:33% line:83% align:start
He destroyed
it and killed them all.

00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:05.967 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] And
that man was Gargoyle!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a monster!

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.738 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's true.

00:21:10.772 --> 00:21:13.040 position:21% line:89% align:start
He is a true monster.

00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:15.342 position:27% line:83% align:start
And Captain Nemo
rescued you from him?

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:18.445 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, but I was
not the sole survivor.

00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:23.785 position:13% line:83% align:start
All the survivors gathered
together and built the Nautilus,

00:21:23.818 --> 00:21:26.587 position:33% line:83% align:start
a new weapon,
one that would exact revenge

00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:28.990 position:27% line:83% align:start
upon Gargoyle and
his wicked followers.

00:21:31.092 --> 00:21:32.760 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Let me wash your face.

00:21:32.794 --> 00:21:35.029 position:7% line:89% align:start
Be still, won't you? [giggles]

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Captain Nemo.

00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:43.738 position:10% line:89% align:start
How much longer do you intend

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:46.439 position:10% line:83% align:start
to keep those children aboard
the Nautilus?

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.709 position:21% line:83% align:start
I know that Gargoyle
is after Nadia

00:21:48.743 --> 00:21:50.443 position:7% line:89% align:start
and it's safer for her onboard

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:52.479 position:7% line:83% align:start
but we don't know if this ship
will be sunk tomorrow.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:56.818 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:00.888 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Electra] I am certain you
don't want her to die with you.

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:02.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
[alarm buzzes]

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:04.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
[man] Approaching ship
identified

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:06.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
as Garfish-class submarine.

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:10.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo, please report
to the bridge immediately.

00:22:10.397 --> 00:22:11.833 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] I'll be right there.

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:14.635 position:24% line:89% align:start
Answer me, Captain.

00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:17.538 position:10% line:83% align:start
All hands to battle stations,
First Officer.

00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:19.540 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:21.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:24.579 position:7% line:89% align:start
Sir, I count 20 enemy vessels.

00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.848 position:7% line:83% align:start
It looks like we're surrounded
on all sides, sir.

00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:29.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
Sir, maximum depth here
is only 300 meters.

00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:32.620 position:5% line:83% align:start
[navigator] Captain, we have the
Kermadec Trench at 10 o'clock.

00:22:34.822 --> 00:22:35.723 position:30% line:89% align:start
All ahead full.

00:22:36.557 --> 00:22:37.925 position:27% line:83% align:start
Head straight for
the Kermadec Trench.

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:38.993 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Aye-aye.

00:22:42.063 --> 00:22:44.966 position:13% line:83% align:start
[follower] The Nautilus is
sailing into the Kermadec Trench

00:22:44.999 --> 00:22:46.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
just as we planned.

00:22:47.969 --> 00:22:50.571 position:27% line:83% align:start
The mouse is
racing into the trap.

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:56.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
Your final hour
has arrived, Nemo.

00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:58.579 position:30% line:83% align:start
Order all hands
to battle stations.

00:22:58.613 --> 00:22:59.981 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:23:00.014 --> 00:23:02.717 position:35% line:83% align:start
All hands,
report to battle stations.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.520 position:24% line:83% align:start
All hands, prepare
for submarine warfare.

00:23:06.554 --> 00:23:10.191 position:24% line:83% align:start
All non-combatants,
report to Pod 3 shelter.

00:23:10.224 --> 00:23:12.860 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is bad.
We're in for trouble.

00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:14.494 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:16.731 position:19% line:83% align:start
The tension in the air
feels stronger now.

00:23:16.764 --> 00:23:18.666 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes. Not only that.

00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:20.701 position:24% line:83% align:start
We're being hit by
a greater number of sonar pings

00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:21.602 position:33% line:89% align:start
than before.

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:22.904 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

[Nemo] This is his end game.

00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:43.958 position:21% line:83% align:start
He is attacking with
his full arsenal.
