[narrator] Lost in the ocean,
Jean, Nadia

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.258 position:21% line:89% align:start
and King were rescued

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
by an American battleship.

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.797 position:24% line:83% align:start
The ship soon found
itself under attack

00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:37.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
by a mysterious sea monster,

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
which caused our heroes
to fall overboard.

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:43.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
Adrift on the high
seas once again,

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.773 position:21% line:83% align:start
will they ever learn
the secret of Blue Water?

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.280 position:16% line:89% align:start
[whimsical music playing]

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.250 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] How could that ship
just sail off without us?

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:05.693 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, Hanson, how long
are we going to sit here?

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:07.595 position:27% line:89% align:start
Until nightfall.

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:08.596 position:16% line:89% align:start
Once the stars come out,

00:02:08.696 --> 00:02:11.465 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to use them
to navigate a course

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.266 position:19% line:83% align:start
to the nearest island,
Ms. Grandis.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:14.669 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, good.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.173 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sanson, tell me,
why don't you

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.577 position:27% line:83% align:start
at least take off
your suit coat?

00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:24.679 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not until I've had my shower.

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
At times like this,
it's difficult

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:28.215 position:13% line:89% align:start
to maintain the reputation

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.585 position:10% line:89% align:start
of a stylish gad about town.

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:32.587 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fortunately I'm very good at it.

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:33.888 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:35.857 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why wait for a shower?

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:37.457 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Take a bath!
-[screams]

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.529 position:24% line:83% align:start
And when, oh, when
will I ever learn

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.297 position:30% line:83% align:start
how to pick the
right men? [sobs]

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:51.539 position:5% line:89% align:start
I caused this. I don't know why.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.206 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm just unlucky.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.777 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, you shouldn't let this
bother you so much.

00:02:55.877 --> 00:02:59.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
[sighs] It's because of me
that you're in this mess.

00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:02.517 position:33% line:83% align:start
Before I die,
I want to apologize to you.

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.185 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait. You don't have
to apologize to me.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's all worth it just
to be with you.

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:08.455 position:24% line:89% align:start
You misunderstood.

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.223 position:10% line:89% align:start
I made that apology to King.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.696 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-Fine.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.831 position:13% line:89% align:start
You must be getting hungry.

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.702 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll catch you the biggest fish
in the entire ocean.

00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:23.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jean, you know I
don't eat meat or fish.

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.305 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was talking to King just then.

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
Isn't that right, boy?

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.913 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh. [gasps]

00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:34.448 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is that?

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.449 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hide!

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:40.353 position:33% line:89% align:start
The monster.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.689 position:21% line:89% align:start
It came back for us.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.356 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It looks that way.

00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:44.892 position:27% line:89% align:start
What is it doing?

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.761 position:16% line:89% align:start
Maybe it doesn't see us.

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:47.795 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Hmm.

00:03:48.896 --> 00:03:50.765 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.744 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Nadia, where is she?

00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:10.383 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughter]

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.219 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both gasp]

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:55.630 position:27% line:89% align:start
[King sputtering]

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:09.911 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ohh!
-We're safe now!

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.813 position:30% line:89% align:start
[metal clunks]

00:05:11.913 --> 00:05:14.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's metal! This isn't the belly
of a sea monster.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.751 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is manmade.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:18.351 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Manmade?

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:25.827 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] I... I think--

00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:28.830 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think we're in a submarine.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.731 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Captain Nemo.

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:32.332 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
All of the survivors

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:35.703 position:27% line:83% align:start
were successfully
picked up, sir.

00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:41.441 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] So this
explains everything.

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
There were never
any sea monsters.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:46.614 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It was just a submarine.
-[Nadia] A submarine?

00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:48.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a ship that
can sail underwater.

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.350 position:19% line:89% align:start
Such a great invention.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, this great invention
almost killed those sailors

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.421 position:27% line:83% align:start
and may have sunk
your father's ship.

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.624 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's not necessarily so.

00:05:56.724 --> 00:05:59.660 position:10% line:83% align:start
This must be a drainage port.
Isn't it wonderful?

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
-You're happy?
-Of course I am.

00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:04.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've gone from a battleship

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:07.434 position:16% line:83% align:start
to a modern-day submarine
in only one day.

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.103 position:33% line:83% align:start
I must be the
luckiest boy alive.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.908 position:7% line:89% align:start
Look at this. It's incredible.

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:16.143 position:21% line:83% align:start
There are no rivets,
only this seam.

00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:18.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
-How are they welded together?
-Children...

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
Captain, I'm detecting
faint traces

00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:23.017 position:7% line:83% align:start
of a very small magnetic field
at two o'clock.

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:24.852 position:38% line:89% align:start
It's him?

00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:28.556 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't tell. It's still
too far off to identify.

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:30.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sir, it's most likely
the battleship.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.628 position:38% line:83% align:start
Perhaps.
We'll have to draw closer to it.

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:34.929 position:27% line:89% align:start
Engines to full.

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.464 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aye, aye, sir. Engines to full.

00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:39.000 position:16% line:89% align:start
[whimsical music playing]

[engine starting]

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:44.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, what's that?

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
The engines are on.
We're starting to move.

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:51.112 position:21% line:83% align:start
Full speed. To port,
bearing 027.

00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:52.412 position:30% line:89% align:start
Aye, aye, sir.

00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:55.082 position:16% line:89% align:start
[thrilling music playing]

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:03.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
-But where are we going?
-I don't know.

00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
Darn, this motor is
beyond repair.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.864 position:16% line:89% align:start
[thrilling music playing]

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:15.870 position:38% line:89% align:start
[beeping]

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.205 position:16% line:5% align:start
[officer] Magnetic field
shows no deviation.

00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:21.642 position:13% line:5% align:start
Our present relative speed
is approximately 32 knots.

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.644 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Captain Nemo]
Gargoyle, you've tried to escape

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:27.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
into a nonmagnetic region,
but we found you.

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:28.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
Pardon me, Captain.

00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.818 position:27% line:83% align:start
What should we do
about the children, sir?

00:07:30.918 --> 00:07:32.853 position:13% line:83% align:start
You chose to pick them up,
First Officer.

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:34.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
I leave it in your hands.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:39.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right. They both seem to be
fairly well behaved, don't they?

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:42.129 position:13% line:89% align:start
I cannot tolerate children.

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.000 position:30% line:83% align:start
Or anyone else
for that matter, sir.

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:50.104 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jean, why do you
think this submarine

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:51.505 position:27% line:89% align:start
rescued us? Hmm.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's a mariner's duty to assist
travelers in distress.

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:59.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Maybe so, but
I can't help wondering

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.149 position:16% line:83% align:start
if the crew of this ship
might be after the Blue Water.

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:03.617 position:30% line:89% align:start
The Blue Water?

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:05.653 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's not healthy
to suspect people

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:06.988 position:21% line:89% align:start
you haven't even met.

00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:09.090 position:27% line:83% align:start
I've learned that
it's much safer

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.490 position:19% line:89% align:start
than trusting anybody.

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.492 position:27% line:89% align:start
Um, I don't know.

00:08:14.996 --> 00:08:16.731 position:16% line:89% align:start
I cannot find the latch.

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:18.632 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I'm certain that
this is a door.

00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:21.502 position:35% line:83% align:start
-So, hello?
-[banging]

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:23.004 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why do that?

00:08:23.104 --> 00:08:25.139 position:27% line:83% align:start
I want to see if
anyone will give me

00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:27.141 position:30% line:83% align:start
a tour of this
amazing submarine.

00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:30.111 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Hey, can anyone hear me?

-[gasps]

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:40.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Don't worry.
You're not in any danger.

00:08:41.022 --> 00:08:42.623 position:7% line:89% align:start
Walk down the corridor, please.

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:44.025 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.260 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Let's, go Nadia!
-Nadia?

00:08:47.795 --> 00:08:50.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I think we'll stay here.
-Huh?
