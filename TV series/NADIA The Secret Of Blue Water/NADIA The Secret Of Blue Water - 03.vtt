[narrator] Jean and Nadia's
troubles continued on the waves

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
as Grandis and her henchmen
gave chase

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
in their experimental
watercraft,

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.596 position:35% line:89% align:start
the Gratan.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:37.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
After a clever escape,
Jean took Nadia and King

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
to his workshop in Le Havre

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
where he showed her
his newest invention.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.138 position:24% line:83% align:start
But the wicked trio
was not far behind

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.474 position:30% line:83% align:start
in their always
surprising vehicle.

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:50.410 position:30% line:83% align:start
Our heroes made
yet another daring getaway.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, engine failure
forced them to crash land

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.383 position:19% line:89% align:start
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
Will they stay afloat
long enough

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
to learn the secret
of Blue Water?

[thunder rumbling]

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.818 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jean, it can't stay
above water much longer.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.487 position:21% line:83% align:start
And it will sink that
much faster

00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:34.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
if we don't continue
bailing it out.

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:36.323 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.325 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wish I was as carefree
as King.

[purring]

something's moving out there.

Thank heavens!

Ship sighted, dead ahead.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.291 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ship in distress.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.527 position:41% line:89% align:start
Where?

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
Full stop, 15 degrees to port.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.773 position:38% line:83% align:start
Holland,
prepare the rescue party.

00:03:25.807 --> 00:03:26.941 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:30.645 position:27% line:89% align:start
[boat horn honks]

00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:31.846 position:27% line:89% align:start
They've seen us.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
We are saved.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:35.616 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahoy!

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.317 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahoy!

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.421 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, wow.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.358 position:30% line:89% align:start
[seaman] Ahoy!

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you the only ones
aboard your vessel?

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:51.331 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yes!
We are two children and a lion!

00:03:52.734 --> 00:03:53.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
[seaman] Understood.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.537 position:27% line:83% align:start
Can you maneuver
your vessel closer to the ship?

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes! Yes, of course.

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's a funny
looking boat you have there.

00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.375 position:13% line:89% align:start
It barely looks seaworthy.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.411 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, it's not.
It's an aircraft.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:06.681 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aircraft?

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:08.983 position:30% line:83% align:start
Then shouldn't
it be flying up in the sky?

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.818 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:25.566 position:7% line:89% align:start
[seaman] Secure it well, boys.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:33.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
[door creaks open]

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.015 position:21% line:83% align:start
As you were, my boy.
As you were.

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:43.416 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.952 position:13% line:89% align:start
Welcome aboard the Abraham.

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:47.354 position:19% line:89% align:start
I am Captain Melville.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.657 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is Holland, my first mate.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.926 position:16% line:83% align:start
We wish to thank you very
much for rescuing us,

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.661 position:27% line:89% align:start
Captain Melville.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.429 position:24% line:83% align:start
[laughs] There's no
need to thank an officer

00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.567 position:30% line:83% align:start
for performing
his sworn duty, son.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.803 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you design
that aircraft yourself?

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.738 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I did have
some help from my uncle.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:05.606 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.543 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I hope you will satisfy
our curiosity and allow us

00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:10.778 position:27% line:83% align:start
to take a closer
look at your handiwork.

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.379 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:13.548 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.049 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Webster?
-Aye.

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:21.823 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now then, tell me how you three
ended up adrift in the ocean.

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:22.990 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.402 position:7% line:89% align:start
I think I get the picture, son.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.972 position:19% line:83% align:start
These three reprobates
are chasing after her, huh?

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:39.073 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.944 position:16% line:83% align:start
I cannot tolerate people
who would treat children

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:44.477 position:27% line:89% align:start
in such a manner.

00:05:44.512 --> 00:05:45.880 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:49.650 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think someone's
talking about us right now.

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:50.918 position:24% line:83% align:start
-I'm so beautiful.
-I'm so beautiful.

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:52.086 position:7% line:83% align:start
-How can they help themselves?
-How can they help themselves?

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:53.721 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hey!
-Hey!

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.958 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sanson, you know
the word beautiful was coined

00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:58.626 position:33% line:89% align:start
just for me?

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.164 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh-uh. Oh, but
you're wrong, madame.

00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:04.364 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's for me.

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:10.671 position:19% line:83% align:start
The world is heading to
a new century

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:11.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
and these two are
still stuck in the...

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:17.845 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh. Someone tell
me why I hired you!

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.914 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now find
that little brat for me!

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:20.882 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Right!
-Right!

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.619 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Hey. At
least it stopped raining.

00:06:24.652 --> 00:06:26.386 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.825 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. What's this?

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:32.994 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's the battleship
the Americans built

00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:34.461 position:10% line:89% align:start
to destroy the sea monsters.

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:36.731 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Oh.

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:39.100 position:30% line:83% align:start
We'd be wise to
steer clear of that then.

00:06:39.133 --> 00:06:41.502 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's too big. Oh.

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.506 position:33% line:89% align:start
The airplane?

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:48.109 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Found her!
-Let me see.

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:53.080 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can drop you off in France
in about three days or so.

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:55.082 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.

00:06:55.116 --> 00:06:58.019 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never been
on a real battleship before.

00:06:58.052 --> 00:07:00.554 position:38% line:83% align:start
So would
you mind if I look around?

00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:03.224 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, of course
you can. Treat yourself.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:05.559 position:7% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Oh, thank you, Captain.

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:07.895 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Ayerton?
-Sir?

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.697 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why don't you keep an eye
on our little guests?

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.598 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:17.805 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ma'am,

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:20.107 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're not actually going to
attack the battleship, are you?

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:21.642 position:30% line:89% align:start
But of course.

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
We must get my hands
on the Blue Water, right?

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:25.445 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:07:33.087 --> 00:07:35.856 position:21% line:83% align:start
[seaman] Unknown ship
80 degrees off port stern.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.724 position:41% line:89% align:start
Where?

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.228 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:42.964 position:7% line:83% align:start
I believe that's the steel ship
of which the children spoke.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:46.600 position:10% line:89% align:start
Holland, go get the children.

00:07:46.634 --> 00:07:47.902 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell them we have
more visitors.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.070 position:38% line:89% align:start
Aye aye.

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.539 position:5% line:89% align:start
What? We're going to the bridge?

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.607 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's right. Captain's orders.

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:54.508 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:58.946 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow!

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.581 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tell me, what are the exact
measurements of this battleship,

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:07.254 position:33% line:89% align:start
Mr. Ayerton?

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:12.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? Well, that is
classified information, Jean.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.493 position:38% line:89% align:start
Darn.

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.732 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Nadia?

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.166 position:24% line:83% align:start
Aren't you excited
by all of this?

00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:22.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
These warships are designed
to kill people.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.538 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't find it exciting.

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:25.673 position:35% line:89% align:start
Why do you?

00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:29.510 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh. Yes, you're right.

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:37.318 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.020 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah, you're here.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.689 position:35% line:83% align:start
Looks like
someone is still following you.

00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:43.991 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.995 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Ayerton] Huh?

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:49.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
That is Grandis
and her bullies, all right.

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.899 position:33% line:83% align:start
They must've
followed us into the ocean.

-Hmm.

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:54.716 position:21% line:89% align:start
That scourge, it ran!

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:56.316 position:38% line:89% align:start
Strange.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.252 position:35% line:83% align:start
It acts as
though it's being chased.

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.120 position:21% line:89% align:start
They can't touch it?

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:01.321 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, good.

00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:08.195 position:30% line:89% align:start
Quiet! Get out!

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:21.375 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] If you hadn't bothered
the Captain,

00:17:21.408 --> 00:17:22.577 position:7% line:89% align:start
he wouldn't have chased us off.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.211 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] We couldn't just
stand there

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:25.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
and let them kill
that creature.

00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:27.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
Could we, King?

00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:29.784 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:31.586 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:32.687 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're just wondering what
you'll have for breakfast,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.855 position:35% line:89% align:start
aren't you?

00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:36.456 position:41% line:83% align:start
You can
understand what he thinks?

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.693 position:35% line:83% align:start
Uh-hmm. And
some other animals too.

00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:42.062 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wasn't able to understand
the sea creature.

00:17:42.597 --> 00:17:43.865 position:30% line:89% align:start
But I tried to.

00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:46.266 position:30% line:83% align:start
So you can read
the thoughts of good animals.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.802 position:24% line:89% align:start
And that one's bad.

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:50.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those sea creatures have lived
peacefully since antiquity,

00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:53.106 position:16% line:83% align:start
but they suddenly become
a threat

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.474 position:24% line:83% align:start
when man decides to
invade their home.

00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:56.578 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey. Why are you arguing?

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.580 position:10% line:89% align:start
Where's the sea monster, huh?

00:17:59.747 --> 00:18:01.448 position:30% line:89% align:start
Didn't you see?

00:18:01.481 --> 00:18:04.251 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uh, I was busy in the kitchen
and I missed the whole thing.

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.521 position:33% line:83% align:start
But what were
you doing in the kitchen?

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:09.857 position:7% line:83% align:start
Huh? Uh, I was cooking up food
for the sea monster, you see?

00:18:09.891 --> 00:18:11.124 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:18:11.593 --> 00:18:13.493 position:7% line:89% align:start
The sea creature eat sausages?

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:15.329 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but it's
a military secret.

00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:16.531 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:18:16.564 --> 00:18:17.865 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sausages?

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:19.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
I know King likes them.

00:18:22.837 --> 00:18:25.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why is everything
on this ship so secret?

00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:27.875 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's just
the way it is in the military.

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:30.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
Watch this. I'll make
the sea monster come back.

Look! It's another one!

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.328 position:33% line:83% align:start
It stands to
reason that for a species

00:18:48.362 --> 00:18:50.598 position:30% line:83% align:start
to survive for
10s of 1,000s of years,

00:18:50.632 --> 00:18:54.267 position:16% line:83% align:start
there must be both a male
and a female to procreate.

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:56.236 position:33% line:83% align:start
So, the other
one must be its mate!

Sea monsters
belong to class mammalian.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.756 position:10% line:83% align:start
They have to come up for air,
so they'll be back.

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:16.323 position:16% line:89% align:start
They're coming toward us!
