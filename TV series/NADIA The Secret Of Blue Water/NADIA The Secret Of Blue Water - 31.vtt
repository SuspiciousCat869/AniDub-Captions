[narrator] Life continues in
its usual manner

00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:30.424 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the strange island.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia discovered
an underground cavern

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.830 position:35% line:83% align:start
filled with
alarmingly familiar objects.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:39.433 position:19% line:83% align:start
When Nadia's Blue Water
suddenly began to glow,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:44.371 position:10% line:83% align:start
she mysteriously disappeared
into a solid metal wall.

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:46.473 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now listen closely,

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.878 position:5% line:83% align:start
because the secret of Blue Water
shall now be revealed.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.589 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Hey, Hanson,

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:03.256 position:16% line:83% align:start
I need you to do whatever
you're doing later

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.158 position:35% line:83% align:start
and come up
here and help me now.

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.259 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just a minute.

00:02:07.962 --> 00:02:10.197 position:33% line:83% align:start
Will you stop
doodling in that book?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
Let's fix this thing right now

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:12.800 position:16% line:83% align:start
and get off this wretched
land mass

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.434 position:24% line:89% align:start
with all due haste.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:16.771 position:24% line:89% align:start
All right already.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.709 position:7% line:83% align:start
You really helped us fixed this
balloon in record time,

00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:22.810 position:33% line:89% align:start
my dear girl.

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:24.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
So thank you, Marie.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.747 position:30% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Huh?

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:27.782 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.655 position:21% line:83% align:start
And thank you, King,
for all of your efforts.

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.491 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:41.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
Nadia is pretty late, isn't she?

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.598 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:45.767 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hmm, it's strange
that they'd get lost

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.467 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the forest, isn't it?

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:49.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean is staying
pretty tightlipped about it.

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:50.938 position:30% line:89% align:start
Most peculiar.

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:52.907 position:35% line:83% align:start
And what's
that supposed to mean?

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.777 position:16% line:83% align:start
Keep in mind that Jean's
not a reprobate like you are.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.712 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. Just a minute.

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:00.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was simply referring to the
forest in which they got lost.

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.518 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Come to think of it,
there was something strange

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.352 position:10% line:89% align:start
about the mountain yesterday.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.287 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Ouch.
-That's true.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.356 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid there's
a terrible secret

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.725 position:13% line:89% align:start
hidden within this island.

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:12.593 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:03:12.627 --> 00:03:14.494 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wonder why Jean won't tell us
what he knows about it.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.997 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.800 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess it's just something
he can't talk to anyone about.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.802 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all] Hmm.

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right then.

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:25.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to see
what's on the boy's mind.

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.474 position:35% line:83% align:start
No, Sanson.
I think we should all try

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.777 position:33% line:83% align:start
to leave him
alone for the time being.

00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:32.513 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll just go and cheer him up.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:38.886 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, Jean.

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:43.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What's the matter, lad?
-Huh?

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:44.726 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're not yourself.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.662 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-You know that Nadia is going

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.362 position:16% line:89% align:start
to come back to us, Jean.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you're extremely
worried

00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:52.299 position:30% line:83% align:start
but you'll see
that everything

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.467 position:24% line:89% align:start
will turn out fine.

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.869 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sanson.

00:03:54.902 --> 00:03:56.537 position:19% line:83% align:start
You know exactly where
she is, don't you?

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:57.672 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.707 position:30% line:83% align:start
All right then.
Let's go bring her back.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.323 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Where am I?

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
[robotic voice] This is
the satellite city Red Noah.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:22.295 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Red Noah?

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.331 position:16% line:89% align:start
[robotic voice] Welcome,

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
rightful heir of
the Toris Megistos,

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:27.702 position:30% line:89% align:start
Princess Nadia.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.369 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Me?

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.706 position:30% line:83% align:start
[robotic voice]
We have awaited your arrival

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
so that we may hand down
the history of Atlantis to you.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.479 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] But who are you?

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.749 position:30% line:83% align:start
[robotic voice]
Creations of the inhabitants

00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:44.752 position:24% line:89% align:start
of the M78 Nebula.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.420 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] The M78 Nebula?

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:51.793 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.784 position:7% line:89% align:start
[robotic voice] The M78 Nebula

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.922 position:21% line:89% align:start
is 277.5 light years

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:23.858 position:7% line:89% align:start
from the Earth's solar system.

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.862 position:7% line:83% align:start
The people of Atlantis made an
emergency landing on the Earth

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:31.699 position:21% line:89% align:start
2,400,000 years ago.

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:39.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Atlanteans were forced
to live on Earth

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they were unable to
return to their own star.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.981 position:7% line:83% align:start
Here, they created as powerful
a civilization as they could.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.482 position:30% line:83% align:start
They did so to
banish the darkness

00:05:49.517 --> 00:05:52.452 position:16% line:89% align:start
from this untamed planet.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.959 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in so doing,
they made an unfortunate error.

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:04.632 position:38% line:83% align:start
They used
their technological marvels

00:06:04.665 --> 00:06:06.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
to wage holy wars.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.170 position:33% line:89% align:start
As a result,

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:12.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
their great cities
were reduced to desolation.

00:06:12.907 --> 00:06:16.443 position:35% line:83% align:start
Afterwards,
the few survivors of Atlantis

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:20.982 position:16% line:83% align:start
built a new civilization
on the continent of the Pangaea.

00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:23.951 position:27% line:83% align:start
That civilization
was once again destroyed

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:26.153 position:19% line:89% align:start
by the hunger for war.

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:33.728 position:38% line:83% align:start
You have
the power of Toris Megistos.

00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.830 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Toris Megistos?

00:06:36.697 --> 00:06:38.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
[robotic voice] You see, Nadia,

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:42.536 position:7% line:83% align:start
the Blue Water was once called
the Philosopher's Stone.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.539 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Does this stone
contain such awesome power?

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:48.042 position:27% line:83% align:start
[robotic voice]
That I cannot say.

00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:53.080 position:19% line:83% align:start
The rightful possessor
of the Toris Megistos

00:06:53.114 --> 00:06:56.083 position:13% line:89% align:start
can either be god or devil.

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:59.220 position:30% line:83% align:start
They will know
the beginning of all life.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.689 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
And I have inherited this power?

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.694 position:30% line:83% align:start
[robotic voice]
Yes. You are not a human being.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.963 position:24% line:83% align:start
You are the heir of
the Atlantean dynasty

00:07:08.996 --> 00:07:11.198 position:24% line:89% align:start
of the M78 Nebula.

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.903 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
I am not a human being.

00:07:15.937 --> 00:07:18.205 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am an Atlantean.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Be careful now.
-[Hanson] And come back quickly.

00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.246 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm very sorry.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.181 position:35% line:83% align:start
We all know
that you're the only one

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.917 position:24% line:83% align:start
who can find Nadia
and bring her back to us.

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.819 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thank you, everyone.

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:34.088 position:19% line:89% align:start
[all] Good luck, Jean!

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:35.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.794 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well now, I say we start packing

00:07:39.827 --> 00:07:42.530 position:13% line:83% align:start
so we'll be ready to leave
when Jean and Nadia come back.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:44.031 position:7% line:89% align:start
Um, what happened to the wind?

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:46.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Wind?

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:48.269 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't see any
birds or insects around.

00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:51.038 position:13% line:83% align:start
There aren't any mosquitoes
nibbling at us today either.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:54.075 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:55.910 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[King purrs]
-Here it comes.

[sighs] Oh, my goodness.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.959 position:41% line:83% align:start
What is
happening to this island?

00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:14.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[groans]
-Huh?

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:17.531 position:16% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Please excuse me.
I really didn't mean to do that.

Bonnie Prince Charlie,
look over there.

00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.246 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, what is it now?

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:35.716 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-What are you looking at that?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] The hillside
slid into the ocean.

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:39.820 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's impossible.

00:08:39.854 --> 00:08:43.290 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even so, I'm afraid
this will only be the beginning.

00:08:45.793 --> 00:08:48.295 position:16% line:83% align:start
What a strong earthquake.
Are you all right?

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.666 position:21% line:83% align:start

I think we're all aware that
this island is quite peculiar.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:19.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
To say that it's peculiar
is only scratching the surface.

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.748 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.184 position:21% line:83% align:start
But even a rough idea
is good enough for now.

00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:26.453 position:5% line:83% align:start
We've been living on this island
for four months

00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:27.988 position:7% line:89% align:start
and we all know it's traveling

00:11:28.022 --> 00:11:29.456 position:19% line:83% align:start
in an east to northeast
direction

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.426 position:27% line:83% align:start
at a speed of one
to ten kilometers a day.

00:11:32.459 --> 00:11:35.296 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's scientifically impossible
but it's happening anyway.

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:39.466 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, since yesterday
the speed has been increasing,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.137 position:13% line:83% align:start
which means an entirely new
phenomenon is now taking place,

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.273 position:7% line:83% align:start
which means that we can't tell
what will happen next

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:48.342 position:33% line:83% align:start
because it's
beyond our knowledge.

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:51.879 position:10% line:83% align:start
But if you can't rely on any
of your previous data

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:53.347 position:33% line:83% align:start
then how can
you predict anything?

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.082 position:7% line:89% align:start
With intuition and imagination.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.151 position:33% line:89% align:start
[group] Huh?

00:11:57.184 --> 00:12:00.254 position:7% line:83% align:start

the western sand dune,

00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:11.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
the strange luminescence
in the sky all point to the fact

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.835 position:27% line:83% align:start
that this island

This entire island is listing
precipitously to the east,

00:12:25.145 --> 00:12:28.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
and if it continues to list
in this manner unabated...

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:32.253 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then an earthquake like the last
one could happen all over again?

00:12:32.286 --> 00:12:34.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
An earthquake like that
will definitely happen again,

00:12:34.522 --> 00:12:36.390 position:7% line:89% align:start
but that's not the worst of it.
