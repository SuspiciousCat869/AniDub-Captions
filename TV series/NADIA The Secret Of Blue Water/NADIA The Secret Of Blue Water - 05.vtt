[narrator] Set adrift on
the ocean, Nadia, Jean and King

00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:31.693 position:30% line:83% align:start
were rescued by
mysterious submarine

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:34.361 position:27% line:83% align:start
under the command
of Captain Nemo

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.599 position:7% line:89% align:start
and his first officer Electra.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:41.134 position:13% line:83% align:start
While onboard, the Nautilus
engaged in a fierce battle

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:45.405 position:10% line:83% align:start
with the Garfish, a submarine
commanded by the evil Gargoyle.

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:49.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Nautilus was unable
to defeat its adversary.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:53.213 position:5% line:83% align:start
After several days, the Nautilus
returned to the surface

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.450 position:24% line:83% align:start
and our heroic trio
was given their freedom

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.820 position:10% line:89% align:start
having never met the captain.

00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:01.589 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Nautilus crew converted
Jean's plane into a seaplane

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:04.257 position:7% line:89% align:start
and their new adventure began.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.594 position:38% line:83% align:start
What new
secrets will they discover?

[whimsical music playing]

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:18.271 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Jean] What a wonderful engine.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.643 position:35% line:83% align:start
And we have
a full tank of gas as well.

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:22.644 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't that great?

00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:23.711 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:27.515 position:33% line:83% align:start
I had no idea
flying felt so good.

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why don't we circle around
the island once

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.586 position:30% line:83% align:start
and then go in
for a landing?

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jean, why don't we land soon
in case this engine breaks down?

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:38.258 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gee! Girls just don't understand

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.460 position:27% line:83% align:start
the true romance
of flying through the skies.

[gear creaks]

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.553 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hope you plan on leaving me
a little something to eat.

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:08.890 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Grandis grunts] You can eat
as much of this as you like.

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:11.959 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sighs] I wonder when I'll be
able to sit down

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:14.494 position:13% line:89% align:start
to a civilized meal again.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.563 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
How did a simple jewel heist

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
leave us stranded on
a desert island?

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.570 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.672 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, it happened because
you two know-nothings

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:26.306 position:24% line:89% align:start
couldn't figure out

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
how to handle a couple
of children and a baby lion.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.611 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well now, that explains it,
doesn't it?

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:34.314 position:30% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Oh, my.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.250 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why am I always so unlucky
when it comes to men?

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.522 position:10% line:83% align:start
We are doomed to live out the
rest of our lives on this harsh,

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.991 position:24% line:89% align:start
undignified island.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, dear God, is there
anything I've done

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.362 position:19% line:89% align:start
to deserve all of this?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Sanson] Oh, plenty.
-Hmm.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.534 position:35% line:83% align:start
Your memory
might be failing you.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:55.335 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's tragic. Be careful.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.671 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[grunts] This stinks.
-Hmm?

[grunts]

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:04.344 position:10% line:89% align:start
You talk too much, don't you?

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Yes. I'm so sorry.

[Grandis sighs]

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wish I had the Blue Water
to keep me company.

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.687 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[snores]
-We should think of a way

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.321 position:19% line:89% align:start
to get our hands on it.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.926 position:10% line:83% align:start
I did, but I don't think it's
going to drop out of the sky

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.427 position:27% line:89% align:start
anytime too soon.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.329 position:27% line:89% align:start

[gasps]

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.668 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What's that?
-[Hanson] It's an aircraft.

00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.402 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.706 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] It looks familiar.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.509 position:13% line:89% align:start
[all] Hey, the Blue Water.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:35.676 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.544 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.445 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.582 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I'm scared.
-Hmm.

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:45.753 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't be. This is where
my skill will come in handy.

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:48.556 position:24% line:83% align:start
Landing an aircraft
requires natural dexterity.

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.992 position:13% line:89% align:start
But that's what scares me.

00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:54.394 position:5% line:83% align:start
Jean, you've only had experience
with crash landings.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:57.832 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's why I said
it would take some skill.

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:59.033 position:21% line:89% align:start
I hope you're right.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:00.802 position:33% line:89% align:start
Count on me.

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:01.636 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.839 position:41% line:83% align:start
Look at
the hole in that mountain.

00:05:04.872 --> 00:05:06.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I see some
mining refuge ahead.

00:05:07.008 --> 00:05:09.577 position:16% line:83% align:start
There must be a drilling
operation on the island.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.878 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Hmm.

00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:12.445 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:25.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, that doesn't look right.

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:26.928 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:28.461 position:13% line:89% align:start
They were hit by something.

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.364 position:7% line:89% align:start
This island, it's not deserted.

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.634 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yes. There must be
some desperate bandits

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
around here out to
grab the Blue Water.

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:38.506 position:19% line:83% align:start

-Shut up and move.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.675 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Right. Okay. Bye.
-We need to find them quickly.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.877 position:30% line:83% align:start
So that we can
go and rescue Nadia?

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.113 position:7% line:83% align:start
No. Because this is the perfect
chance to get that jewel.

00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:49.416 position:13% line:83% align:start
But wait, Ms. Grandis, the
Gratan is just about repaired.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.118 position:30% line:89% align:start
We can't wait.

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.521 position:30% line:83% align:start
They could get
seriously hurt if it explodes.

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:54.722 position:47% line:89% align:start
Aw.

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.057 position:35% line:83% align:start
That means
you care about her, don't you?

00:05:56.924 --> 00:06:00.962 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hmm. Just keep
it to yourself [screams].

Although I doubt a mere child

trying to escape from
the island too.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.394 position:16% line:89% align:start
Then we'll go to the cave

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.463 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you can show us
how to get there, Marie.

All right.

Most likely from the aircraft.

We were simply looking for
the Blue Water

about the Blue Water?

that those tawdry posters

00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:13.821 position:30% line:83% align:start

served some purpose after all.
