[narrator] Do you seek

the treacherous waterfalls?

Do you seek the mythical being

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
that dwells in this
unreachable place?

If you do, then you
must first find me.

Countless ships
are being consumed

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:38.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
beneath the waves
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:42.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
The people whisper in fear
about terrible sea monsters.

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:45.178 position:21% line:83% align:start
However, governments
of the world suspect

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
that the ships are
victims of secret

The industrial world, meanwhile,
strengthens itself with steel.

As the 20th Century
draws closer,

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:03.665 position:13% line:89% align:start
civilization grows richer,

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:05.600 position:7% line:89% align:start
but the people tremble in fear,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.269 position:10% line:83% align:start

darken the horizon.

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.271 position:27% line:89% align:start
Those look great!

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.808 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's too bad they'll never
get off the ground.

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.513 position:30% line:89% align:start
It sure is big!

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.481 position:10% line:83% align:start
But they waste too much power
in the drive shaft.

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:11.451 position:16% line:89% align:start
Looks like the crowds are

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:12.720 position:30% line:83% align:start
more impressive
than the inventions.

[announcer] Welcome to the first

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.028 position:21% line:83% align:start
International Flight
Competition.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.463 position:13% line:89% align:start
Today's contest will decide

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:26.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
which airship can fly
the furthest distance.

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:30.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
The grand prize winner
will receive 20,000 francs!

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:35.877 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:37.712 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've been looking for you!

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:40.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Sorry I'm late.
-You didn't miss much.

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:42.750 position:30% line:83% align:start
The first one's
just getting ready to take off.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.452 position:24% line:83% align:start
You think it has a
chance, my boy?

00:04:45.553 --> 00:04:48.689 position:7% line:83% align:start
Those wings are far too flimsy
to support that engine.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
Given the wind speed,
there's no way

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.962 position:21% line:83% align:start
it can fly more than,
oh, eight meters.

00:04:55.062 --> 00:04:57.598 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:04:57.698 --> 00:04:59.299 position:30% line:89% align:start

[announcer] The flight distance
for contestant number one

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:11.712 position:27% line:89% align:start
was eight meters!

And now contestant number two!

This airship has flown
over the White Cliffs of Dover.

And it is by Lord Arkwright.

When is it going to be
our turn, Uncle?

00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:38.673 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, I apologize, Jean.

00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:40.508 position:24% line:89% align:start
I drew number 102.

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:43.376 position:21% line:83% align:start
-The long wait, then?
-I'm afraid so.

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.012 position:30% line:83% align:start
We could still
go take the aircraft

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:46.514 position:10% line:89% align:start
off of the boat if you like.

00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:47.748 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Sure.

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:04.599 position:13% line:83% align:start
[uncle] Did you get seasick
during your travel?

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.834 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes, but nothing terrible.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:09.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm glad you
made it safely, my boy.

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:11.772 position:21% line:83% align:start
You did a remarkable
amount of work

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:12.940 position:13% line:89% align:start
while you were on the boat.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Thank you.

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:16.010 position:19% line:83% align:start
[uncle] I wish I could
have helped,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.912 position:27% line:83% align:start
but you know how
I am with watercraft.

00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:20.882 position:21% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Don't worry
about that, Uncle.

00:06:20.982 --> 00:06:24.417 position:24% line:83% align:start
Speaking of boats,
the Americans have commissioned

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.988 position:27% line:83% align:start
a new battleship
to hunt down the sea monsters.

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:30.524 position:13% line:83% align:start
Perhaps they'll get the one
that took your father.

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.793 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know his death
hasn't been confirmed yet.

[laughs] That was the
top contender.

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:47.909 position:16% line:89% align:start
The grand prize is ours!

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.912 position:30% line:83% align:start
It is, and by a
wide margin, too!

00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:52.513 position:35% line:89% align:start
It is ours!

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:56.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
Once we get our hands
on that kind of money,

00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.552 position:19% line:89% align:start
we will be able to make

00:06:58.653 --> 00:07:01.022 position:33% line:83% align:start
all kinds of
wonderful contraptions,

00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:04.457 position:21% line:83% align:start
and my mean, old wife
will finally stop complaining.

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:05.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
But who cares if she does,

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:07.028 position:13% line:89% align:start
because before we go home,

00:07:07.128 --> 00:07:08.930 position:24% line:83% align:start
we're going to have
some fun in Paris!

to look for your father.

00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:19.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then you'll discover many pretty
girls that would like to meet

00:07:19.173 --> 00:07:20.574 position:33% line:83% align:start

-What is the matter, boy?

Hi, Uncle!

00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:13.828 position:27% line:83% align:start
We won a special
prize for the craft,

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:15.963 position:16% line:83% align:start
but we went out of turn,
so no prize money.

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:17.665 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes!

00:23:17.765 --> 00:23:19.066 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're headed back home.

00:23:19.166 --> 00:23:21.002 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll meet you there!

00:23:21.102 --> 00:23:23.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
[grunts] You be careful now!

00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:26.007 position:10% line:89% align:start
And you treat her well, hmm?

00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:27.541 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:29.710 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Right.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.580 position:16% line:89% align:start
