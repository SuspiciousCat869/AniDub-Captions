That night, Jean's hunting party

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
brought back a baby
deer they had killed.

Oh, Nemo.

You knew it.

she woke up at a decent hour.

Hey, Jean.

You look like the canary
that got eaten by the cat.

Huh? Uh-hmm.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.256 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you worried about Nadia?

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:10.658 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh.

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.694 position:19% line:89% align:start
I can't figure her out.

00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:15.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why did our hunting
bother her so much?

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:18.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
Why can't
she talk to anyone now?

I wish girls
came with instructions.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.503 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, you know what they say,

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:26.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
a woman's heart is like
the mystery of the universe.

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:29.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
You'll never understand
anything they do.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.679 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, it sounds
very usual of Nadia.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:34.515 position:5% line:89% align:start
You don't understand her either?

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.785 position:27% line:83% align:start
You've witnessed
Grandis, haven't you?

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.654 position:21% line:89% align:start
I see what you mean.

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.724 position:5% line:83% align:start
Do you think Nadia wants to live
all by herself?

00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:43.991 position:30% line:89% align:start
Maybe she does.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.661 position:10% line:83% align:start
But humans were not designed
to live alone

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:50.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
and it only brings them misery
when they try.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:53.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nadia will realize this
before too long.

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you sure about that?

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:57.605 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can count on it.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:04:00.307 position:13% line:83% align:start
So it's time for breakfast.
Why don't you fetch them?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.809 position:35% line:89% align:start

Did I eat what?

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did you and the others cook
and eat that poor baby deer?

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.317 position:38% line:89% align:start
Just go!

Why? Why are you so angry
with everyone?

Good morning to
you, Jean and Nadia.

00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:55.730 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why did you kill
that small defenseless creature?

00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:58.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
We did it so we could have
something to eat it.

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:00.367 position:19% line:89% align:start
Did you have to eat it?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jean] We have to eat
in order to live, Nadia.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.739 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] You can eat food
that grows from the ground.

00:05:04.772 --> 00:05:06.439 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Jean] What about people

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.875 position:13% line:83% align:start
that just can't subsist on
things like that?

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.710 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Those
people don't exist.

00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
They just haven't tried
hard enough to eat properly.

00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:13.881 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Maybe or
maybe you're the one

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:14.916 position:10% line:89% align:start
who hasn't tried hard enough.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.383 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] What did you say?

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.786 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh, you're having
another lovers' spat?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.320 position:30% line:83% align:start
-No, we're not!
-No, we're not!

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.558 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I had to eat animals
in order to survive,

00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:25.092 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'd choose not to live.

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:27.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I don't see
what the big problem is, Nadia.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It's so savage.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.632 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Why do you think that?
It's just good food.

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Animals are
our companions, not food.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jean] But they become food
once you cook them.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:38.906 position:7% line:83% align:start
Don't even feel sorry for them
when you see what you've done?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why should I?

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:41.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because the only reason
they're dead

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.077 position:16% line:89% align:start
is to serve your hunger.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.612 position:7% line:89% align:start
If there was a way to eat them

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.013 position:21% line:83% align:start
without killing them,
then I would do it.

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:48.115 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, there's something
terribly wrong with you

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:49.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
if you can casually
kill animals

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
without feeling
any pity for them.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:53.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
I felt kind of bad for
the baby deer

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.089 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I made a little grave for it.

Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:15.643 position:13% line:89% align:start
I have too much work to do,

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:19.046 position:13% line:83% align:start

I'll have some free time.

Hmm, you're no fun. Go!

Pardon me.

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:25.686 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think you're putting a bit
too much pepper in there.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.487 position:30% line:83% align:start
Just enough to
make it taste good.

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:29.456 position:24% line:83% align:start
It only tastes good
if you like too much pepper.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.992 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll decide how much
pepper to put in it,

00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:32.093 position:24% line:89% align:start
and you'll like it.

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:33.460 position:24% line:89% align:start
I only bring it up

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:34.862 position:27% line:83% align:start
because I like to
actually taste my food.

criticizing my cooking, right?

like my food too hot.

-[Sanson] Oh, bugger.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.277 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have the worst luck.

00:16:17.311 --> 00:16:19.379 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, all right.
If I have to go...

00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.281 position:33% line:89% align:start
[all] Uh-hmm.

00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:22.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[officer] The Nautilus?
-[soldier] Yes, sir.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.284 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's definitely her crew.

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:25.753 position:33% line:83% align:start
[officer] Has
anyone spotted you yet?

00:16:25.787 --> 00:16:27.555 position:21% line:83% align:start
[soldier] Not at all.
I'm well hidden.

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.223 position:10% line:89% align:start
We can take them by surprise.

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:30.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
[officer] We don't
have time for that.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:32.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll sail out as soon
as refueling is completed.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.761 position:21% line:89% align:start
[soldier] But, sir...

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:35.295 position:21% line:83% align:start
[officer] We are here
for reconnaissance.

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:37.431 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Return to camp immediately.
-[soldier] Understood.

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.069 position:10% line:83% align:start

-[soldier] Men,

00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:46.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
we're to report back to the camp
on the double.

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.809 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're pulling out

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:49.544 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Move it!
-[soldiers] Understood!

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:51.613 position:19% line:83% align:start
[soldier] This is your

00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:56.784 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] If it weren't for
bad luck,

00:16:56.818 --> 00:16:58.418 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'd have no luck at all. Hmm?

00:16:58.452 --> 00:17:01.321 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why does an island this small
have a railroad system.

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:02.356 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing but big rocks.

00:17:03.257 --> 00:17:05.593 position:10% line:83% align:start
Must be a quarry around here
somewhere.

Lord, it's hot.
Where is the wood?

00:17:18.773 --> 00:17:20.474 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Jean.
-Hi.

00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:21.643 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're not mad at me anymore?

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:23.343 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must help me find Marie.

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:26.213 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-I can't find Marie or King.

00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:28.550 position:13% line:83% align:start
They--you've gotta help me
look for them, Jean.

00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:29.617 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:55.342 position:41% line:89% align:start
Marie?

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.845 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Ga... Ga?
-What do you mean by ga?

00:17:59.914 --> 00:18:01.716 position:38% line:89% align:start
Gargoyle!

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.555 position:27% line:83% align:start
So you came back
for more pain, did you?

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:10.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
I guess I'll just have to
give you a beating, right?

[machine whirring]

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:16.463 position:10% line:89% align:start
How did you learn to do that?

00:18:18.231 --> 00:18:19.801 position:35% line:83% align:start
You really
don't like to play fair?

00:18:19.834 --> 00:18:21.603 position:21% line:89% align:start
What? Your dukes up.

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:38.620 position:24% line:89% align:start

-[Sanson] [grunts] Just my luck.

00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:44.559 position:21% line:89% align:start
Move! Move! [grunts]

00:18:44.592 --> 00:18:46.493 position:24% line:89% align:start

Oh, just look at what that
overgrown bucket of scrap iron

00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:56.236 position:21% line:83% align:start

-Hey.

[grunts]

00:18:59.907 --> 00:19:02.275 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't be a sore loser.

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.278 position:30% line:83% align:start
See you later.
Better luck next time.

We spoke too soon, Marie.

00:19:32.807 --> 00:19:34.609 position:33% line:89% align:start
Unbelievable.

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:36.209 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Look.
-Scissors. Scissors.

00:19:36.243 --> 00:19:37.912 position:19% line:83% align:start
What is it that always
beat scissors?

00:19:39.446 --> 00:19:40.548 position:44% line:89% align:start
Rock.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:45.987 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right.

[laughs]

00:19:55.295 --> 00:19:56.531 position:10% line:89% align:start
[both] That was a nice catch.

00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:05.807 position:16% line:89% align:start
But a really sorry throw.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.274 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Oh, come on.

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:09.877 position:7% line:89% align:start
[both] Please, make it go away.

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:15.950 position:10% line:89% align:start

-Uh-uh.

If there are

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:37.337 position:19% line:83% align:start
why isn't the Nautilus

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:47.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, I am, sir.
The probability is absolute.

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:48.850 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:51.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
