[narrator]
Tired of being treated

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.157 position:33% line:83% align:start
like a child
by the Nautilus crew,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.360 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jean set about building
a new aircraft.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.229 position:19% line:83% align:start
However, he discovered
that he may be mature,

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.165 position:24% line:83% align:start
but he still needs
the help of others

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
to accomplish his goals.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:42.570 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jean's new craft worked
wonderfully

00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:44.706 position:27% line:83% align:start
and he took Nadia
into the skies.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:46.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
During their flight,

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:48.643 position:35% line:83% align:start
he promised
that he would grow up

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:50.545 position:24% line:89% align:start
to be her protector

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:54.281 position:35% line:83% align:start
and the one
who would take her to Africa.

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:58.820 position:13% line:83% align:start
Will they one day discover
the secret of Blue Water?

Captain, it seems
to be a British cargo ship.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.724 position:27% line:83% align:start
They don't appear
to have noticed us yet, sir.

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:39.794 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maintain our present position
until it has gone.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:42.429 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Aye, aye.
-[horn blaring]

00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:52.339 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're leaving.
We're safe for the time being.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.808 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.877 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's been a long time since
we've been so close to land.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.345 position:35% line:83% align:start
[engineer]
It certainly has.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.848 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hope the landing party
finds something useful.

want me to put these?

you have to hold my hand.

[man] Captain?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.469 position:41% line:83% align:start

Honey, hold my hand.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.805 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't go away.

[man 1]
We don't get much news

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.880 position:7% line:89% align:start
about sea monsters these days.

00:03:32.914 --> 00:03:34.448 position:16% line:89% align:start
And I have to wonder why.

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.983 position:41% line:83% align:start
[man 2]
I hear that the American fleet

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:38.686 position:16% line:83% align:start
finished off that blasted
menace once and for all.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.988 position:41% line:83% align:start
[man 3]
Oh. Do you think that's true?

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:42.355 position:41% line:83% align:start
[man 2]
Yeah, I reckon it is.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.258 position:27% line:83% align:start
They said it was
over 200 meters long.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.327 position:41% line:83% align:start
[man 1]
That's one large haul.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.463 position:24% line:83% align:start
The Americans sure
can pack a lot of power.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[man 4]
At least we can sail

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:52.734 position:27% line:83% align:start
the briny depths
once again in safety.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.268 position:16% line:83% align:start
[man 2] While the scurvy
bugger has picked up pieces

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.404 position:16% line:89% align:start
like crabs and predators.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.940 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Farewell to the sea monster.
-[man 1] Hear, hear.

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.508 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.476 position:10% line:89% align:start
The Nautilus is popular here.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.811 position:38% line:89% align:start
Seems so.

00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:06.279 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not a very good feeling.

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:07.347 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:09.650 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:10.718 position:24% line:89% align:start
[helmsman] Join us.

00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:13.521 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did you find some leads?

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.989 position:19% line:89% align:start
I didn't find anything.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:17.759 position:10% line:83% align:start
The Neo Atlanteans must have
gone completely undercover.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.761 position:35% line:83% align:start
[helmsman]
As I expected.

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:21.896 position:16% line:83% align:start
This journal has the last
report I could find.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.502 position:10% line:83% align:start
The seas have been delivered
from the dreaded savage.

[scoffs]

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.837 position:30% line:89% align:start
Try as I might,

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:31.005 position:33% line:83% align:start
there wasn't
any new information

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:32.707 position:27% line:83% align:start
to be found about
the Garfish sub

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.474 position:19% line:89% align:start
or the Neo Atlanteans.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.078 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then they've stopped attacking
cargo ships

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:39.514 position:27% line:83% align:start
in favor of some
new fiendish agenda.

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:41.381 position:7% line:89% align:start
A construction of a new tower?

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.517 position:35% line:89% align:start
I doubt it.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.018 position:27% line:83% align:start
They'll probably
attempt something

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:45.686 position:16% line:83% align:start
that has a better chance
of success.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.588 position:19% line:89% align:start
But what could that be?

00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:49.791 position:24% line:83% align:start
We were sent ashore
to find that out.

00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.526 position:10% line:89% align:start
But what if we find nothing?

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.661 position:16% line:83% align:start
What will the captain say
if we come back empty-handed?

00:04:54.562 --> 00:04:56.564 position:16% line:83% align:start
You should probably worry
more about Electra.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hmm, well, we'd definitely be
in some serious trouble.

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.737 position:44% line:83% align:start
[all]
Hmm.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:04.906 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here's my report, sir.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:06.339 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:07.942 position:7% line:89% align:start
The Nautilus' present position

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.011 position:19% line:89% align:start
is West 25, North 306.

00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:12.547 position:19% line:83% align:start
Our depth is presently
96 meters

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.347 position:33% line:83% align:start
with the main
and auxiliary engines

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.817 position:24% line:89% align:start
operating smoothly

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.920 position:27% line:83% align:start
and food supplies
adequate for 20 days or more.

00:05:18.953 --> 00:05:20.955 position:35% line:83% align:start
-However...
-Go on.

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.423 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sir, three rounds
of battle repairs

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.927 position:21% line:83% align:start
have left us short of
maintenance materials.

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:30.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
I strongly recommend
that we return to our base.

00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:31.833 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:33.835 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll consider it
after the landing party

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:34.902 position:16% line:89% align:start
brings back its findings.

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:35.970 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
Yes, sir.

00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:38.039 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
So now,

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.674 position:13% line:89% align:start
we're apprentice engineers.

00:05:39.707 --> 00:05:41.843 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're gonna get
our suits all dirty.

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:42.844 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
Hmm.

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:45.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] We've certainly
been to a lot of places.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.113 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:46.147 --> 00:05:48.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
Europe must be far,
far away by now.

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:52.587 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder where we are
at this very moment.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.057 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have no map and no compass,
so I have no idea.

00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:58.526 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.094 position:24% line:83% align:start
From the stars that
we saw last night,

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.996 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd say we're pretty far south.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:04.497 position:35% line:89% align:start
South, eh?

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:08.002 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wonder how far south
the captain's sailing.

[buzzer buzzes]

[Nemo]
Attention, all hands.

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:17.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
We are setting course for
Antarctica to take on supplies.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.614 position:41% line:83% align:start
[both]
We're going where?

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:20.480 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:29.489 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:32.093 position:16% line:89% align:start
What on earth are these?

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:33.794 position:27% line:89% align:start
Arctic clothing.

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:35.796 position:30% line:89% align:start
Arctic clothes?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.732 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Yes, it will protect
you from the extreme cold.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:39.934 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:42.003 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.972 position:21% line:89% align:start
This won't do at all.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:47.074 position:13% line:83% align:start
No one should have to wear
such dowdy clothes.

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:50.211 position:30% line:89% align:start
That they are.

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:52.980 position:13% line:83% align:start
I could never allow Captain
Nemo to see me

00:06:53.014 --> 00:06:55.683 position:13% line:83% align:start
in something so inherently
unflattering.

-[growling]
-Mm-hmm.

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:57.952 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:06:57.985 --> 00:06:59.854 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:04.025 position:27% line:83% align:start
So why do we need
to dress for cold weather?

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:06.894 position:7% line:89% align:start
We are going to the South Pole.

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.529 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're going where?

00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.798 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
You've got to be kidding.

00:07:10.831 --> 00:07:12.465 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whose idea was that?

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nemo has really lost it
this time.

00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:17.004 position:19% line:89% align:start
His home port is there.

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:18.072 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah-hah.
