[Gargoyle] Jean,

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.773 position:7% line:83% align:start
even your love can't bring her
back to consciousness,

ever.

00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:28.549 position:10% line:89% align:start
Now, from my merciful heart,

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will offer you one last chance

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:33.788 position:7% line:89% align:start
to live out a long life, Nemo.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.892 position:38% line:83% align:start
Will you,
former king of Atlantis

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:41.729 position:10% line:83% align:start

to lead the human race

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:44.632 position:19% line:83% align:start
back to their rightful
place below us?

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.702 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] The answer is the same
as it was 13 years ago.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:48.870 position:35% line:89% align:start
I will not.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.340 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Hmm.
What a fool you are.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:56.243 position:19% line:89% align:start
Have you yet to awaken?

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.311 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do not take
the human race lightly.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.914 position:7% line:89% align:start
They are not nearly as foolish

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
as you would imagine them to be,
Gargoyle.

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:03.985 position:35% line:89% align:start
I disagree.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:06.654 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just look at how the boy failed
to shoot Nadia

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:08.288 position:35% line:83% align:start
when he had
the opportunity.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.257 position:5% line:89% align:start
He could've served your purpose.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.627 position:10% line:89% align:start
He could've saved your life.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
No! It shows the tenderness
of the human heart.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.964 position:10% line:89% align:start
It shows their great virtue.

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:19.600 position:19% line:89% align:start
It is of no use to them

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:21.536 position:35% line:89% align:start
or to you.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
The time has come for you
to leave us, Nemo.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:26.808 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will allow you to
hear your son's voice

once more before you depart.

be killed by your own children?

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:24.565 position:35% line:83% align:start
I did it as
a symbol of our friendship.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.701 position:24% line:89% align:start
Not as it once was.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.781 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes. This is the New Nautilus.

00:04:39.814 --> 00:04:41.749 position:5% line:89% align:start
Are you all right first officer?

00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:44.552 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yes. Can
you pinpoint my location?

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:45.653 position:19% line:89% align:start
[sonar] Yes. Go ahead.

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:50.525 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Shift the electron
turret 0.60 degrees to my left

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:51.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
and fire.

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:53.060 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's insane to ask that!

00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:54.762 position:10% line:89% align:start
The blast would kill you all.

are you impressed?

00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:21.856 position:24% line:83% align:start
The latest fruit of
Neo Atlantean science.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.791 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? Science? It made him?

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.626 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Yes.

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:29.764 position:19% line:83% align:start
His body was destroyed
during your ill-advised

tampering with
the Tower of Babel, Nemo.

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:36.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
But our scientific
genius came to his aid.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
We've allowed him
to live for 13 long years,

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.078 position:33% line:83% align:start
so you should
not think badly of me.

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.713 position:19% line:89% align:start
You should be grateful.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:10.271 position:24% line:89% align:start
the story is over.

00:11:14.108 --> 00:11:15.209 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bad news.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.444 position:19% line:83% align:start
Red Noah is just about

Well, crew members,
we have one option.

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:36.897 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Now that Emperor Neo
has passed away,

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:40.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
you are the true successor of
the Blue Water, Princess Nadia.

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:43.771 position:38% line:83% align:start
He's dead
because you killed him.

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:45.507 position:13% line:89% align:start
He had served his purpose.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.474 position:7% line:89% align:start
He was of no further use to me.

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:49.877 position:30% line:89% align:start
Princess Nadia,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
put the Blue Waters back
in their proper place

00:11:52.313 --> 00:11:54.415 position:27% line:83% align:start
and set this ship
on its correct course.

00:11:55.517 --> 00:11:57.184 position:35% line:89% align:start
I will not.

00:11:57.218 --> 00:12:00.154 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't you value the lives
of your father and friends?

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:02.089 position:7% line:89% align:start
As successor of the Blue Water,

00:12:02.122 --> 00:12:04.425 position:16% line:83% align:start
I freely choose to allow
the ship to crash.

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:06.460 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jean] That's right, Nadia.

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.329 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about us.

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:10.731 position:33% line:83% align:start
New Nautilus
will be able to rescue us all.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.235 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you and I can return
to Earth with each other.

Jean.

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:19.106 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes, you are
quite the brave lad,

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.808 position:13% line:89% align:start
but are you foolish enough

00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:23.177 position:13% line:83% align:start
to throw your life away so
recklessly?

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.212 position:10% line:89% align:start
You are the foolish one, sir.

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:28.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
You think you can control
the human heart like a machine.

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.350 position:21% line:89% align:start
A ridiculous thought.

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:32.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
But then, how can you begin
to control

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:34.021 position:30% line:83% align:start
what you don't
understand?

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:37.391 position:5% line:83% align:start
My father and brother sacrificed
their lives for their beliefs.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.493 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will follow in

I will not.

Oh, no, no.

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:18.032 position:27% line:83% align:start

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.579 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] I will stay here.

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.317 position:10% line:83% align:start
I will destroy Red Noah with
the Nautilus

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.553 position:33% line:83% align:start
to make sure
that you get out safely.

00:20:52.587 --> 00:20:54.287 position:33% line:89% align:start
But Captain.

00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:58.325 position:21% line:89% align:start
Nadia, this is my all

00:20:58.358 --> 00:21:00.494 position:7% line:89% align:start
from a father to his daughter.

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:01.461 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please accept it.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.498 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:21:04.532 --> 00:21:05.800 position:38% line:89% align:start
I can't.

00:21:05.833 --> 00:21:07.535 position:35% line:89% align:start
I need you.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:09.369 position:7% line:89% align:start
I want to be with you, Father.

00:21:09.402 --> 00:21:10.437 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sonar] Be quiet!

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.940 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:21:12.974 --> 00:21:16.376 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please, you have to understand.

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:27.522 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Grandis.

00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:29.422 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:31.458 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Please,
look after the children for me.

00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:34.629 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:21:35.963 --> 00:21:38.666 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Electra. No, Medina.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.401 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:43.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] You must
care for things without me.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:49.544 position:41% line:89% align:start
I will.

00:21:49.577 --> 00:21:50.511 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:04.525 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nadia, no matter
what may happen, live!

Huh?

00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:04.652 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:07.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
Thank heavens.

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:12.760 position:33% line:89% align:start
Where are we?

00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:15.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
Aboard my father's spaceship.

00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:17.464 position:24% line:89% align:start
Another spaceship?

00:23:18.498 --> 00:23:19.834 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.036 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're all going back to live
in your world, Jean.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.178 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's not right, Nadia.

00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:33.681 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're going to our world.

00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:35.549 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:37.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
You were born
on the planet Earth.

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:40.521 position:35% line:83% align:start
We are both
citizens of the planet Earth.

00:23:44.692 --> 00:23:46.193 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, Jean.

00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:50.031 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Look, a shooting star.

00:23:51.232 --> 00:23:53.034 position:27% line:83% align:start
[nurse] What did
you wish for, Marie?

00:23:54.735 --> 00:23:56.737 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wished that Sanson and
everybody else

00:23:56.771 --> 00:23:58.471 position:30% line:83% align:start
would come home
safely and soon.

00:23:58.506 --> 00:24:00.041 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, what'd you wish for?

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:02.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
The same as you.

00:24:02.877 --> 00:24:07.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
And also, I wish that no one
would ever have to experience

00:24:07.248 --> 00:24:09.116 position:27% line:83% align:start
what we have all
had to go through.

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:12.086 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Uh-hmm.
-[purrs]

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:13.821 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Marie] That's a good wish.

00:24:35.943 --> 00:24:38.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, that was the end
of our long adventure,

00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:41.515 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I want to tell you what
has happened since that day.

00:24:42.917 --> 00:24:45.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
12 years have gone by
since the crew of the Nautilus

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:47.788 position:16% line:83% align:start
bid farewell to the ship
that saved them.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm pleased to say that each
member of the crew

00:24:52.126 --> 00:24:54.128 position:10% line:89% align:start
is now leading a happy life.

00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:58.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
Eiko, the sonar officer finally
won the heart of Nurse Ikoli.

00:24:58.132 --> 00:25:00.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
Electra is bringing up
her child wonderfully.

00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:04.872 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia
were married five years ago.

00:25:04.905 --> 00:25:07.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
They moved to Jean's
old house in La Havre.

00:25:10.177 --> 00:25:13.214 position:10% line:83% align:start
Jean and his uncle are still
thoroughly absorbed

00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:14.382 position:21% line:89% align:start
in their inventions.

00:25:14.415 --> 00:25:17.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nadia and Jean's aunt are
constantly keeping them in line.

00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:19.120 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:26.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nadia still will
not eat meat or fish.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.195 position:7% line:89% align:start
It wouldn't be right after all.

00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:33.167 position:33% line:83% align:start
Miss Grandis
is still living the single life,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
her search for
a new love continues,

00:25:35.936 --> 00:25:39.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
and she certainly
has no shortage of offers.

00:25:39.707 --> 00:25:42.109 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hanson started his own
automobile company

00:25:42.143 --> 00:25:43.177 position:19% line:89% align:start
and is now the richest

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.013 position:5% line:89% align:start
of all the people in this story.

00:25:46.047 --> 00:25:49.083 position:5% line:83% align:start
He tells me he's looking forward
to marrying a beautiful wife.

00:25:50.317 --> 00:25:52.787 position:5% line:89% align:start
Mr. Ayerton went home to England

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.123 position:13% line:83% align:start
where he became the heir to
a grand mansion.

00:25:56.157 --> 00:25:58.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
I didn't know
he was really a count.

00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:01.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, you want to know
what became of Sanson?

00:26:01.829 --> 00:26:03.130 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:26:03.164 --> 00:26:05.599 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's an interesting story.

00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:07.368 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here's what happened.

00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:11.672 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sanson settled down and married
the love of his life, me.

00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:16.610 position:7% line:83% align:start
Next year, I'm going to follow
Nadia's footsteps

00:26:16.644 --> 00:26:18.179 position:35% line:83% align:start
and become
a mother myself.

00:26:20.081 --> 00:26:21.982 position:16% line:89% align:start
My dream has always been

00:26:22.016 --> 00:26:24.385 position:24% line:83% align:start
to spend a pleasant
Sunday afternoon

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:27.088 position:30% line:83% align:start
walking through
a beautiful park with my family.

00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:32.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, bye for now.
