[narrator] As apprentice
crew members of the Nautilus,

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
our heroes began a new life
under the waves.

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.360 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
transition to the nautical role

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:37.264 position:30% line:83% align:start
was not without
some unsavory complications.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.666 position:21% line:89% align:start
Grandis pursued Nemo.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.602 position:19% line:89% align:start
Everyone pursued King,

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
and Jean sought the scientific
knowledge he craved

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
yet the secret of Blue Water
remains hidden.

[Hanson] The machines on
this ship are simply amazing!

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look how fast this thing
cuts through steel!

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.260 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sanson, come look at this.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.730 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please don't bother me.

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:10.598 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yawns]

00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:14.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Say, how long have
we been aboard this ship anyway?

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.570 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hard to say.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.505 position:27% line:83% align:start
You could figure
it out by counting up

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:19.774 position:10% line:83% align:start
the number of meals we've had
and dividing by three.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.611 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, no. The fish
is what's killing me.

00:02:23.645 --> 00:02:27.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
Fish for breakfast, fish
for lunch, more fish for dinner.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.249 position:7% line:83% align:start
Every day, it's the same thing
over and over.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.820 position:10% line:83% align:start
Grab your plate and eat fish,
fish, fish, fish, fish, fish!

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:37.491 position:19% line:83% align:start
Overall, I have to say
I'm a bit tired of fish.

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:40.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
But cooking has really
brightened Ms. Grandis' mood.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.263 position:27% line:83% align:start
And Ms. Electra's
pretty nice, too.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.532 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.299 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.436 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes. And then
there's Ms. Granva. Yes.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.272 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:55.677 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't just stand there!

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
Put on something
beautiful, Nadia.

00:02:57.712 --> 00:03:00.313 position:30% line:89% align:start
But I don't...

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.583 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, just put on the dress.

00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.553 position:33% line:83% align:start
That uncomely
ensemble you've put together

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:08.890 position:13% line:83% align:start
does nothing to accentuate
your womanly charms,

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:10.692 position:21% line:89% align:start
but please hurry up.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:14.494 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't be late getting Captain
Nemo my lovingly prepared meal.

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.463 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just a bit longer, My Sweet.

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.833 position:27% line:83% align:start
Soon, you will be
drinking my charm

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.935 position:30% line:83% align:start
and feasting on
my devoted love for you.

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:23.705 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:25.573 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now hurry into that dress!

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:32.245 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Eat it while it's hot.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.015 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tonight, I have prepared

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:36.283 position:10% line:83% align:start
something especially for you,
Captain.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.251 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, thank you, Ms. Granva.

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.822 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yes. Thank you very much.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.693 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.930 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is it to your liking, Captain?

00:03:48.963 --> 00:03:50.965 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Hmm, it's delicious.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:55.335 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, I am so delighted.

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.604 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Hmm.

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:58.438 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Hmm.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.677 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I made
something special for you, King.

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:12.920 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm. [chuckles]

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:14.622 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, do you like it?

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
Grandis cut one of
her old dresses down to my size.

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:20.695 position:30% line:89% align:start
[King assents]

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:22.964 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, you look so pretty!

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:25.465 position:10% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Thank you, Marie.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:28.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, what do you think?

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:30.938 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't mind if I do?

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:42.550 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're terrible!

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:43.918 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, sorry!

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.554 position:16% line:89% align:start
I have horrible manners.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:48.321 position:30% line:83% align:start
Marie is always
pointing that out.

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:48.990 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:53.326 position:19% line:83% align:start
I see you've found time
to visit with Ms. Electra.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.495 position:19% line:89% align:start
Jean, you make me sick!

00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.533 position:19% line:89% align:start
What is she mad about?

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:01.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
Women are strange
and she's the strangest.

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:02.737 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I can't stand it anymore!
-Huh?

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.515 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:15.983 position:38% line:83% align:start
This mess
is going on far enough.

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:18.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
Every day we eat fish, fish,
and more fish.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.755 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't stand looking
at it [indistinct] any longer.

00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:23.024 position:33% line:83% align:start
The sight of
fish fills me with rage.

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:24.826 position:13% line:89% align:start
And it's not just the food.

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:28.062 position:7% line:83% align:start
What good is wearing a nice new
suit when you can't show it off?

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:31.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
Now, I want a big juicy steak
and I want authentic!

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:33.935 position:10% line:83% align:start
And I would love nothing more
than a juicy steak

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.435 position:21% line:89% align:start
or a nice lamb chop,

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.470 position:33% line:83% align:start
but where do
you expect me to find those

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:39.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
-on a bloody submarine?
-Now, now, Ms. Granva.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.374 position:27% line:83% align:start
When you've lived
your whole life on land,

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.944 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's hard to give up
the comforts

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:44.745 position:13% line:89% align:start
you've grown accustomed to.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.615 position:5% line:83% align:start
That will cause you to get angry
until you've gotten used

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
to our way of life here.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.819 position:30% line:83% align:start
[clears throat]
I'm afraid our cook is right.

00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:54.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
You and your men are going
to have to adapt to our ways

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:57.091 position:19% line:83% align:start
just as the entire crew
has adapted, Ms. Granva.

00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:00.161 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, thanks for the advice,
but I'm quite content here.

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.463 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I'm more than happy to
eat fish every day, Ms. Electra.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.966 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Bah.
-I, myself, would enjoy

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:07.935 position:19% line:83% align:start
a more varied menu, but
we all have our burdens to bear.

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.105 position:27% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Just what
did you mean by that?

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.841 position:27% line:83% align:start
That sounds like
a crack about my cooking!

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.643 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Oh, dear.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:18.145 position:19% line:83% align:start
I certainly didn't mean
to imply anything like that.

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:24.451 position:30% line:89% align:start
[clears throat]

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:27.121 position:33% line:89% align:start
Captain Nemo?

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Have you finished, sir?
-Have you finished, sir?

00:06:30.992 --> 00:06:31.826 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

00:06:34.028 --> 00:06:35.062 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've had enough.

00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.034 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, wait, but you haven't even
touched your dessert, Captain.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.171 position:13% line:89% align:start
No, thank you, Ms. Granva.

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.607 position:30% line:89% align:start
All right. Hmm.

00:06:56.918 --> 00:07:00.821 position:30% line:83% align:start
But this is my
special dessert. [sobs]

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:03.724 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sanson, this is all your fault
for opening your big,

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:05.192 position:30% line:89% align:start
yapping mouth!

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:09.163 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I was just trying to
honestly express my opinion.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.464 position:33% line:83% align:start
I didn't know
you hated fish so much.

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:13.200 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well then eat this!

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.071 position:10% line:83% align:start
[cook] Oh, dear, no, please.
Put down the knife.

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:17.972 position:30% line:83% align:start
You don't know
what you're doing.

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:19.040 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Ms. Granva, no!

00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:20.508 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] How does it taste?

00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] No. You know what,
I'm sorry!

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:24.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Stop it!
I demand that you stop it

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:25.212 position:13% line:89% align:start
this instant, both of you!

00:07:25.246 --> 00:07:28.716 position:21% line:89% align:start
[indistinct chatter]

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:31.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll take my meals in
my room from now on.

00:07:36.624 --> 00:07:38.559 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] You're
worried, aren't you?

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:40.227 position:35% line:89% align:start
[gasps] No.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:42.163 position:10% line:89% align:start
The ship is functioning well.

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:44.031 position:7% line:89% align:start
I was referring to our guests.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.900 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:07:45.933 --> 00:07:49.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, they just need time to
get used to life onboard, sir.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.605 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
If there's no sign
of Gargoyle today,

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:57.545 position:16% line:83% align:start
we'll dock for a hunting
expedition tomorrow.

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:58.946 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will go as well.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.181 position:30% line:89% align:start
Good idea, sir.

00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.753 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:08.055 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hmm? Anything else?

to say, Captain?

We'll talk

Well, my refined upbringing

Oh, the memories.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.700 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone used to call me

Oh, yes.

It was love at first sight.

Well, I should have
listened to my father.

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:31.405 position:27% line:83% align:start
That charming cad
was merely a swindler.

00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:33.941 position:33% line:83% align:start
There was no
nobility in his heritage.

00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.643 position:24% line:89% align:start
He had enchanted me

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:38.311 position:13% line:83% align:start

arm's reach of father's money.

As my dowry, father agreed to
take care of my fiance's debts,

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.618 position:5% line:89% align:start
which was enormous as his charm.

00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:46.253 position:13% line:83% align:start
We lost much of our fortune
to his creditors,

00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:48.355 position:33% line:83% align:start
and he simply
stole everything else.

love, and I lost my home.

All my lovely friends vanished.

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:08.643 position:7% line:89% align:start
No one wanted a damaged woman.

our chauffeurs Sanson
and our mechanic Hanson.

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.348 position:19% line:89% align:start
We sustained ourselves

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
by selling off mother's jewels
piece by piece.

00:20:17.719 --> 00:20:19.787 position:35% line:83% align:start
Before long
her jewelry box was empty,

00:20:19.821 --> 00:20:22.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
and I even ended up
having to sell that for food.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.527 position:5% line:83% align:start
But those men never abandoned me
and I'm so grateful for that.

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:33.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
I would do anything
to have them,

00:20:33.968 --> 00:20:36.336 position:24% line:83% align:start
though stealing was
our preferred method.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:40.340 position:13% line:83% align:start
I vowed never to rest until
I had every jewel in the world.

Don't worry, dear.

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:44.879 position:7% line:89% align:start
I have lost the burning desire

00:20:44.912 --> 00:20:47.380 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:20:57.892 --> 00:21:00.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
You grasp the Blue Water
with such ferocity,

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:02.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you don't grasp
your most precious gift.

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:04.565 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:07.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
Surely you can see
how much Jean cares for you,

00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:10.303 position:13% line:83% align:start
yet you refuse to treat him

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:12.472 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean and I are

I understand that you may feel
that way now.

But one day, you will
feel differently towards him.
