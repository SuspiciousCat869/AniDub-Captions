[narrator] Island life keeps
getting stranger and stranger.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.558 position:10% line:89% align:start
After eating tainted spinach,

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:32.359 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nadia grew ill,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.429 position:7% line:83% align:start
which drove Jean and Marie into
the jungle for medicinal herbs.

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean discovered
medicine of a different sort.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.634 position:16% line:89% align:start
Overcome with gratitude,

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nadia entreated
the delusional Jean

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:45.238 position:10% line:83% align:start
to stay with her and gave him
his first real kiss.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.407 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will our heroes
ever find the time

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.677 position:35% line:83% align:start
to discover
the secret of Blue Water?

[whimsical music playing]

00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:07.427 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, you remember nothing?

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.765 position:7% line:83% align:start
I found the glowing mushroom in
that cave and then it got foggy.

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.366 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.569 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did I do anything,
something awful?

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:17.237 position:7% line:89% align:start
Well, it wasn't very nice, no.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.506 position:41% line:89% align:start
Oh, no.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.575 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes. Oh, well.

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:22.910 position:10% line:83% align:start
You should be glad you aren't
able to remember it now.

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:24.746 position:13% line:89% align:start
It sounds really terrible.

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.446 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ew.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.182 position:30% line:83% align:start
You are lucky,
but Nadia remembers.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.953 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-[Nadia] This feels so good.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
I never expected
to take a shower on this island.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:38.593 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's good to have
an inventor around, eh?

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
Marie wants to take
a shower when she's done.

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:42.262 position:38% line:89% align:start
You know?

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:44.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've said it before but
you really are a genius, Jean.

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:49.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
Genius is simply 1%
inspiration, 99% perspiration.

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:51.405 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, who said that, huh?

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:53.541 position:19% line:89% align:start
The great scholar Jean,

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Jean Roque Raltique.
-Jean Roque Raltique?

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.945 position:30% line:89% align:start
Your relative?

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, he's me.

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.348 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Jean.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.518 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's a pretty clever quote.
Don't you think?

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.920 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should publish it
before someone steals it.

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:07.522 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi, Nadia.

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:09.624 position:19% line:83% align:start
-This is for your hair.
-[gasps] Huh?

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:12.292 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, great. You made shampoo?

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.996 position:13% line:83% align:start
I made it from seaweed, so
you don't have to rinse it out.

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:16.363 position:38% line:89% align:start
And it...

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.268 position:16% line:89% align:start
Naughty boy, don't look.

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.340 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nadia humming]

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.977 position:7% line:89% align:start
Naughty? She didn't get angry?

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:32.880 position:35% line:89% align:start
I know. I--

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.989 position:33% line:89% align:start
[clattering]

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:46.259 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Hey, the shower stopped.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.932 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, darn it. It's broken.

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:56.436 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's going to take me
a little while to fix it.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Oh, well.
I guess I'll have to wait.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.373 position:41% line:89% align:start
Thanks.

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.514 position:16% line:89% align:start
I really liked it though.

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.616 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll try your shampoo later
after you fix it,

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.885 position:30% line:83% align:start
and thanks for
making it, Jean. Bye.

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.654 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's strange. She's not angry.

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:15.757 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maybe she's had
more bad spinach.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.825 position:38% line:89% align:start
[growls]

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.297 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
Hey, Jean, how do I look?

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:29.637 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought I'd try something
a bit different, you like it?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
What did you make it from? Huh?

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:34.809 position:5% line:89% align:start
What happened to the curtain?

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:36.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come on, Jean, say it's nice.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:41.048 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh, it's nice. Very nice.

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:42.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot. Bye.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:49.389 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Marie] Stop right there.
Don't you run away from me.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.626 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, you think you're too fast?

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.828 position:5% line:89% align:start
I bet I know how I can stop you.

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:56.964 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's see if you can outrace
my flying stick.

You're far too little to
get away from me, young man.

00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:14.447 position:30% line:83% align:start
You should have
learned that evil never wins.

let's play Gratan now.

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
Marie will play Gratan this time

00:05:50.084 --> 00:05:52.520 position:33% line:83% align:start
and King will
play Gargoyle's tank.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.756 position:19% line:89% align:start
Here comes the Gratan.

Our days in the Nautilus
are behind us now.

So, the rest of our lives
are waiting ahead of us.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.658 position:13% line:89% align:start
Will we stay here for long?

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:35.062 position:30% line:83% align:start
Will we live on
this island forever?

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:41.468 position:13% line:89% align:start
Right. I must talk to her.

-[Nadia] Jean.
-Hmm?

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.908 position:10% line:89% align:start
Right. We'll talk, right now.

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:53.714 position:38% line:83% align:start
Just put
your ear to it like this.

00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:56.584 position:16% line:83% align:start
-We need to talk, Nadia.

Hmm!

See? Can you hear it?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.969 position:5% line:89% align:start
Like waves crashing inside.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.083 position:27% line:89% align:start
Done. You ready?

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.217 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll turn it on.

00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.186 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hold on just a second, Jean.

It'll be good this time.

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:46.767 position:19% line:89% align:start
I need to redesign it.

-But it's good for tonight.
-[Nadia] Why is that?

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:50.738 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Because I'm cranking it by hand.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:55.910 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, can you see it?

00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:58.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I see something,
but I don't see it clearly.

00:07:58.646 --> 00:07:59.814 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] That's funny.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.585 position:13% line:89% align:start
This isn't in focus at all.

00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:06.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
The eyepiece is missing.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:08.956 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aha!

00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:13.661 position:5% line:83% align:start
This telescope doesn't have
any way to secure the eyepiece.

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:16.697 position:24% line:89% align:start
It should work now.

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:19.667 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] I don't see it.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.569 position:7% line:89% align:start
Move it a little to the right.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.905 position:38% line:83% align:start
-See it?
-[Nadia] There it is.

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:26.273 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did the moon move?

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:27.641 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, but we did.

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:30.311 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] But we stayed here.

00:08:30.344 --> 00:08:33.748 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Jean] You see, Nadia, the Earth
rotates on its axis once a day.

00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:35.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, it looks like
the moon is moving.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.651 position:38% line:89% align:start
Rotates?

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
A famous scientist named
Copernicus

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:41.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
was able to figure
out this theory.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.825 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then Galileo went on to prove it
even though no one believed him.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.028 position:16% line:89% align:start
Everyone at the time

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:49.163 position:24% line:83% align:start
