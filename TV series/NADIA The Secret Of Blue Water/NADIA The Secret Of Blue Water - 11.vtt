[singing in Japanese]

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
[narrator] The Nautilus
was caught in a trap

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.525 position:24% line:83% align:start
devised by Gargoyle
during his airborne escape.

00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:33.260 position:24% line:83% align:start
Out of desperation,
Nemo allowed Hanson

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.295 position:7% line:89% align:start
and Sanson to attempt a rescue.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:38.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jean, who had sneaked
aboard the Gratan,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
became an accidental
third member of the crew

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.370 position:35% line:83% align:start
that saved
the majestic submarine

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.806 position:10% line:89% align:start
from the horrible sea mines.

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:46.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
The adventure continues.

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.551 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Electra]
I object to this proposal.

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:59.486 position:10% line:83% align:start
This crew has a daunting task
ahead of us.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.357 position:10% line:83% align:start
We must concentrate our total
efforts towards this objective.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.392 position:24% line:83% align:start
To blithely take on
new crew members at this time

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.761 position:21% line:89% align:start
would greatly hinder

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:10.163 position:10% line:83% align:start
our mission and put the crew
in unwarranted danger.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.366 position:24% line:83% align:start
For the well-being
of the Nautilus,

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.202 position:19% line:83% align:start
I stand firmly opposed
to the motion before us.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, but we're
short of personnel.

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:20.273 position:33% line:83% align:start
In addition,
the first officer's objections

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
do not take into account

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.678 position:16% line:83% align:start
that they have all served
this ship well so far.

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:25.713 position:27% line:89% align:start
I strongly agree.

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:28.181 position:16% line:83% align:start
If they think of Gargoyle
as their enemy,

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.951 position:27% line:83% align:start
then their goals
are the same as ours.

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.419 position:35% line:83% align:start
There's one
thing that bothers me.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now, what if they were to leave
the ship at some point?

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.891 position:13% line:83% align:start
They could take the secrets
they've learned

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:38.726 position:21% line:83% align:start
from the Nautilus and
misuse them.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.694 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't need to
worry about that.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.328 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.397 position:16% line:83% align:start
Those people could never
completely understand

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
the breadth of our
scientific knowledge.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:46.501 position:33% line:89% align:start
He is right.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
No crew member fully comprehends
the super-science

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:51.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
that governs the Nautilus.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
They'll learn to use it,

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.977 position:10% line:83% align:start
but they would never be able
to duplicate it on their own.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.311 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Electra] This issue
is without merit.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] I can't stand
this much longer!

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:02.984 position:30% line:83% align:start
How much longer
are those hotheads

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:05.452 position:13% line:83% align:start
going to keep us cooped up
in this tiny room?

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.690 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a brand-new suit
and no one to show it off to.

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.425 position:19% line:89% align:start
They all look the same.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.761 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah, look who's talking!

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:14.962 position:24% line:89% align:start
Just look at them.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:16.798 position:27% line:83% align:start
Each one has its
own subtle character.

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:18.599 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you say so.

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.535 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, do you think
they'll let us stay aboard?

00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:22.503 position:16% line:89% align:start
I hope they kick us off.

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.272 position:10% line:83% align:start
The sooner I get out of here,
the happier I'll be.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.542 position:19% line:83% align:start
Still, there's so much
technological knowledge

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.342 position:24% line:89% align:start
to learn from them.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.679 position:30% line:83% align:start
I would love to
apply what they know

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.815 position:7% line:83% align:start
about deep-sea diving mechanics
to the Gratan.

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:36.584 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're nuts. They're not going
to give you that information.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:38.519 position:35% line:89% align:start
They might.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.322 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even so, we can't make
the decision to leave.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:43.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's all up to the mademoiselle.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:44.926 position:41% line:83% align:start
-True.
-Hmm?

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.260 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Ah.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:53.534 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.537 position:7% line:89% align:start
"Oh, goodness me, Miss Granva.

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
You look
simply ravishing today."

00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:01.709 position:33% line:83% align:start
"Ooh, oh, how
perfectly sweet of you, Captain.

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:03.443 position:19% line:89% align:start
You're flattering me."

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:07.414 position:5% line:83% align:start
"My dear lady, it isn't flattery
when you're telling the truth."

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.551 position:33% line:83% align:start
And then he--
Oh, you're so silly!

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.420 position:33% line:89% align:start
[King purrs]

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:17.058 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] I hereby confirm
that Grandis, Hanson, and Sanson

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.595 position:13% line:83% align:start
are accepted as apprentice
crew members of the Nautilus.

00:04:20.628 --> 00:04:22.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
-It still bothers you?
-[gasps]

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.665 position:24% line:89% align:start
Um, no, it's just--

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.434 position:19% line:83% align:start
are you certain we can
put our trust in those three?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.038 position:16% line:89% align:start
Particularly Miss Granva.

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:34.976 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why do you single Grandis out?

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.945 position:24% line:89% align:start
I--No reason, sir.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.416 position:35% line:83% align:start
[all] What?
Apprentice crew members?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.686 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes. From this day forward,
the three of you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
will be working exclusively
under my command.

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:49.690 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't you want to reconsider?

00:04:49.724 --> 00:04:50.758 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.728 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:56.898 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh. Who's responsible
for this dire turn of events?

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:01.769 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, thanks, God!

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:04.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
I didn't know if you had
listened to my fervent prayers.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry I doubted you!

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Where's the captain?
-Uh...

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:10.945 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:12.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Miss Electra?
-Huh?

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.481 position:13% line:83% align:start
I want to learn everything
about this ship.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.553 position:16% line:83% align:start
The science you use here
is unbelievable.

00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:20.487 position:5% line:89% align:start
You are doing things that no one

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.056 position:21% line:83% align:start
has ever even sought
to attempt before.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.626 position:30% line:83% align:start
I want to learn
everything that you know

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.962 position:7% line:83% align:start
-and use it to benefit mankind!
-Right!

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:32.834 position:24% line:89% align:start
I understand, Jean.

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:34.902 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I cannot allow you
to wander freely

00:05:34.936 --> 00:05:36.003 position:24% line:89% align:start
around the vessel.

00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.638 position:47% line:89% align:start
Eh?

00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:39.372 position:19% line:89% align:start
However, I will let you

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:41.776 position:5% line:83% align:start
read all the books in my library
you wish.

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Thank you, Miss Electra!
-[chuckles]

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:46.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Nadia] Miss Electra.
-Oh?

00:05:46.413 --> 00:05:48.816 position:35% line:83% align:start
And what am
I allowed to do onboard?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.450 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, you'll be entertained

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
as the honored guest of
Captain Nemo.

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.789 position:27% line:83% align:start
Although you must
still obey the rules

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
that Jean is expected to follow.

00:05:56.524 --> 00:05:59.927 position:16% line:83% align:start
-No. I want a job to do.
-But...

00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.597 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am accustomed to working
for my food and shelter,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I don't plan
to stop that now.

00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:05.967 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's a good girl!

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.401 position:7% line:83% align:start
The Bible says, "If a man won't
work, neither shall he eat."

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.171 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. If that is your wish,

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
then you can assist
Miss Grandis.

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.709 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Good.
-Marie wants a job, too.

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:17.812 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-What kind of job can Marie do?

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.981 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, I can do anything!

00:06:20.014 --> 00:06:23.084 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm sure I can think
of something for you to do.

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.056 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.658 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'll find something for you too.

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:31.859 position:41% line:89% align:start
[purrs]

00:06:35.096 --> 00:06:37.031 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sonar]
Activate internal diagram media.

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:40.034 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now pay attention.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
This is the interior
of the Nautilus.

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.871 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is where we are right now.

00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:45.472 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:47.575 position:10% line:89% align:start
And here, we have the hangar,

00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:49.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
the crew's quarters,
and the engine room.

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:53.014 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why doesn't the diagram show
where the propellers are?

00:06:53.047 --> 00:06:55.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[gasps] That's right!
-We don't use propellers here.

00:06:55.783 --> 00:06:58.485 position:7% line:83% align:start
You see, the Nautilus is moved
by water jet propulsion.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:59.987 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Jet propulsion?
-Jet propulsion?

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:01.756 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's that, exactly?

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.525 position:13% line:83% align:start
The Nautilus takes water in
through intake valves,

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:07.728 position:21% line:83% align:start
ionizes it, and then,
using a superconductor coil

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:10.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
for magnetic induction,
it converts it to plasma,

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:13.200 position:10% line:83% align:start
ejects it through the stern,
which in turn propels the ship.

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:15.736 position:10% line:89% align:start
You apply magnetic induction?

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.106 position:7% line:83% align:start
What energy source can provide
such a large amount of power?

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
A boiler or a battery
would be too weak.

00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:25.012 position:16% line:83% align:start
The power source is here,
the very heart of the ship.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:27.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, but what exactly
is the power source, sir?

00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:29.684 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, don't start
calling me "sir."

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:31.585 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm not that old, you know?

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.120 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could you go ahead
and answer his question?

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:35.156 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, the energy comes
from the particle anni--

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.158 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's classified data.

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:38.693 position:19% line:89% align:start
What? I can't hear you.

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:40.628 position:33% line:89% align:start
I apologize,

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.664 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I'm forbidden to talk
about that part of the ship.

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:46.033 position:24% line:83% align:start
Anyway, no ship can
compete with ours,

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.601 position:21% line:89% align:start
not even the Garfish.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.070 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Garfish?

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.138 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes. You've seen it, Jean.

00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:52.840 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's Gargoyle's submarine.

00:07:52.873 --> 00:07:54.508 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Garfish...

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:57.845 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now I would like to take you
on a tour of the bridge.

00:07:57.878 --> 00:07:59.647 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] Ooh.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.749 position:13% line:83% align:start
You won't be allowed to go
up there during maneuvers.

00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.050 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:04.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
What? Marie?

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.020 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is something wrong?

00:08:06.053 --> 00:08:08.122 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes. I want to work.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.523 position:19% line:89% align:start
I don't want to study.

00:08:09.557 --> 00:08:10.992 position:24% line:89% align:start
But don't you see?

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:13.728 position:7% line:83% align:start
Schoolwork is the kind of work
a child is supposed to do.

00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:15.596 position:21% line:89% align:start
But I am not a child!

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:17.131 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wanna do real work!

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.867 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yes, but studying and working
are the same thing.

00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:23.004 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Then I don't wanna work.
-What shall we do?

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:24.972 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[King purrs]
-Hmph.

00:08:25.306 --> 00:08:27.875 position:10% line:89% align:start
My, aren't you a clever lion?

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:30.878 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shall we study mathematics
without Marie, King?

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:31.946 position:41% line:89% align:start
[purrs]

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.547 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:35.516 position:7% line:83% align:start
Please solve the first problem
on the board.

00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:37.885 position:41% line:83% align:start
-One...
-[purring]

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:38.919 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Yes.

00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:40.654 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's amazing.

00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:43.257 position:7% line:89% align:start
A lion who knows his addition.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.160 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Good boy.
-[purring]

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.295 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah? I can add too!

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.998 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh? Then let's try something
a little different.

00:08:51.932 --> 00:08:54.301 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What's three minus two?
-[purrs]

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.904 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey! It's my turn to answer!

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.606 position:35% line:89% align:start
One! Hmph.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:00.574 position:21% line:89% align:start
What are you wearing?

00:09:00.608 --> 00:09:03.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
That getup makes you
look like a field worker.

00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:07.348 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sorry. It was too big on me,
so I cut it.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.784 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, if you don't mind
being seen that way,

00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:12.086 position:24% line:83% align:start
let's make our way
to the kitchen, shall we?

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.623 position:19% line:89% align:start
What on Earth is this?

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:16.824 position:33% line:83% align:start
[cook] Well,
that's the cold storage.

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:18.059 position:27% line:89% align:start
How can that be?

00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:19.960 position:7% line:89% align:start
Everything looks frozen to me.

00:09:19.994 --> 00:09:22.096 position:7% line:89% align:start
It can't be frozen without ice.

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:23.931 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:25.833 position:33% line:83% align:start
We don't use
ice for cooling, lady.

00:09:25.866 --> 00:09:27.068 position:24% line:89% align:start
We use electricity.

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:28.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
You do?

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.172 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is this electricity
something cold?

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.040 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, let me
explain it this way.

00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:35.176 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm just a cook,
not a science officer.

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:37.144 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, what is this?

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:38.712 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's an electric stove.

00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.884 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Electric stove?
-Mm-hmm.

00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:45.152 position:33% line:83% align:start
-And juicer?
-Uh-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:46.787 position:35% line:83% align:start
-And mixer?
-Mm-hmm.

00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:47.955 position:35% line:83% align:start
-And oven?
-Uh-huh.

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:49.023 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:55.262 position:16% line:89% align:start
Here, and here, and here!

00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.234 position:13% line:89% align:start
My, all run by electricity?

00:10:01.368 --> 00:10:03.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
An electric dishwasher?

00:10:03.904 --> 00:10:07.174 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes! But electricity
can't do two major things.

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.742 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:10.077 position:33% line:83% align:start
It can't use
a good cooking knife...

00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:13.681 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it can't love to cook.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.318 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Ouch!

00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:21.088 position:16% line:83% align:start
-You cut yourself again?
-Mm.

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:25.226 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, children nowadays,
can't even chop seaweed right.

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:28.229 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-You're quite the problem child.

00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:31.098 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you keep that up, you're
going to run out of fingers.

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.402 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[whimpers]
-No more knives for you.

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:37.171 position:10% line:89% align:start
Can you open that box for me?

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:38.239 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.875 position:44% line:89% align:start
Agh!

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:45.746 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's right.

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:48.916 position:10% line:83% align:start
You did say the sight of meat
or fish makes you ill.

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.384 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.919 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ooh.

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.758 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, all right, then.

00:10:57.791 --> 00:11:00.928 position:5% line:83% align:start
I guess I'll just have to finish
cooking this luxurious meal

00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.429 position:10% line:89% align:start
without a kitchen assistant.

00:11:02.463 --> 00:11:04.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laughs]
-Uh-huh.

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:06.333 position:24% line:83% align:start
They certainly have
plenty of fish here.

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:08.469 position:24% line:83% align:start
The menus must get
terribly monotonous.

00:11:08.503 --> 00:11:11.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can you even
touch those things?

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:12.873 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, it won't bite you.

00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:14.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's nothing to be
afraid of, my dear.

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:15.743 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.378 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, but you're holding
a dead body.

00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:18.946 position:35% line:89% align:start
Dead body?

00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.148 position:33% line:83% align:start
I see nothing
here but good food.

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:23.984 position:13% line:89% align:start
And besides, it's adorable.

00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:26.320 position:30% line:83% align:start
And my charming
captain will love it!

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:28.022 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cook] Hmm?

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.326 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm.

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.161 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, smells good.

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:36.130 position:38% line:89% align:start
Perfect.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:37.331 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.302 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.237 position:7% line:89% align:start
Dinner is served, Captain Nemo.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.171 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Ah.
-Ah.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm, what is it?

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:48.510 position:38% line:83% align:start
-A fish?
-[laughs]

00:11:48.543 --> 00:11:50.811 position:19% line:83% align:start
I call it Grandis Fish
a l'amour.

00:11:50.844 --> 00:11:52.479 position:38% line:83% align:start
I'm sure
you will love it, Captain.

00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:53.914 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes. Enjoy.

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:56.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
How come the rest
of the crew only gets

00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:58.185 position:30% line:83% align:start
a bowl of soup
and a glass of water?

00:11:58.219 --> 00:11:59.486 position:35% line:89% align:start
Quiet, you!

00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:01.488 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're still young! Just eat it!

00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:03.023 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:05.192 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, eat it while it's hot, sir.

00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:06.493 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh... [groans]

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:16.303 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, do you not like it?

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:17.838 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? No.

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:18.506 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:12:22.243 --> 00:12:23.277 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:24.878 --> 00:12:26.280 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good!

00:12:26.313 --> 00:12:28.415 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Hooray!
-Huh?

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:31.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
It looks a bit strange,
but it really is quite tasty.

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:33.821 position:41% line:89% align:start
May I?

00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:36.156 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chatter]
-[Nemo] Help yourselves.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.324 position:38% line:83% align:start
[crewman]
Can I have some of that?

00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:38.560 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Nemo] Have some more, please.

00:12:38.593 --> 00:12:40.327 position:33% line:83% align:start
-All of you.
-[crewman] My goodness.

00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.395 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.366 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[crewman] Thank you, sir.
-[sighs]

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:51.205 position:24% line:83% align:start
That is remarkable
news about the lion,

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.408 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I must say I am amazed
by Grandis' culinary skills.

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:57.244 position:10% line:83% align:start

In this day of modern science,

why do we end up working
as scrub-brush operators?

As long as we're on this ship, I
wouldn't expect anything better.

you two grumbling about?

00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:37.505 position:19% line:89% align:start
I could kiss it. Mwah!

00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:41.274 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been so long
since we saw the sun.

00:20:41.308 --> 00:20:43.544 position:13% line:89% align:start
Watch out. I'm Miss Granva.

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:50.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hmm, I never knew the wind

00:20:54.956 --> 00:20:56.724 position:19% line:89% align:start
At ease, Officer Jean.

00:20:56.758 --> 00:20:59.459 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm glad to see
you took leave of the books.

00:20:59.493 --> 00:21:00.862 position:13% line:89% align:start
It is such a beautiful day.

Uh...

00:21:02.563 --> 00:21:04.297 position:19% line:89% align:start
Enjoy it all you wish.

00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:06.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
We'll be on
the surface for 24 hours.

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:08.536 position:19% line:89% align:start
The deck will be free.

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:10.505 position:13% line:89% align:start
I recommend it most highly.

Jean, is something wrong?

Mm, the more I read,
the more I don't understand.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.029 position:24% line:83% align:start
I see. Maybe I can
help you understand.

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:38.966 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tell me, is this ship really
a killing machine?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.936 position:7% line:89% align:start
Did Captain Nemo tell you that?

00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:45.438 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm. In the engine room.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
I only went in there
to look for King.

I'm sorry.

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:51.344 position:24% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Forgive me.

-Yes.

But what does it mean?

00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:09.429 position:41% line:89% align:start
Listen.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
Man has been given
a great deal of knowledge.

00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:15.670 position:19% line:83% align:start
But since he's capable
of both good and evil,

00:22:15.703 --> 00:22:17.905 position:21% line:83% align:start
that knowledge can be
used either way.

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:20.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
Often, man won't even know
the difference.

00:22:20.875 --> 00:22:23.578 position:30% line:83% align:start
Therefore, even
with the best of intentions,

00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:25.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
that knowledge can
create great misery.

[Electra] The incredible
power of this ship

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:36.924 position:16% line:83% align:start
would prove too tempting
a weapon if mankind knew of it

00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:39.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
and, in his hands,
would lead to destruction.

Jean, as you grow older

00:22:59.513 --> 00:23:01.816 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I believe that
it is a good ship.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.119 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is, because the captain
is a good man.

00:23:08.756 --> 00:23:09.824 position:38% line:89% align:start
I wonder.
