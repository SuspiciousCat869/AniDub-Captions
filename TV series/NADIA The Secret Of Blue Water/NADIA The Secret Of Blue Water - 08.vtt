[narrator] Nadia was
captured by Gargoyle,

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
the leader of the nefarious
organization, Neo Atlantis.

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:33.861 position:10% line:83% align:start
While Jean tried desperately
to find her

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.463 position:16% line:89% align:start
in the vast dark kingdom.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
Under Gargoyle's
inhuman questioning,

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.770 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nadia confessed that Jean was
in possession of the Blue Water.

00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:44.572 position:27% line:83% align:start
She learned from
her interrogator

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:47.307 position:19% line:83% align:start
that the Neo Atlanteans
had constructed

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.377 position:21% line:83% align:start
a terrible new weapon
called The Tower of Babel

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.481 position:7% line:83% align:start
and witnessed the demonstration
of its hideous power.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:59.152 position:5% line:83% align:start
Our heroes watched as the weapon
destroyed an entire island.

Will the devil's light destroy

Hmm?

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:20.440 position:13% line:83% align:start
We've traced the origin of
the beam to Sector SP03, RP40.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:21.809 position:30% line:89% align:start
Excellent work.

-Yes, sir.

[Nemo] Gargoyle,

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:04.317 position:10% line:83% align:start
you've harnessed the power of

[Gargoyle] Extraordinary.

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
We have achieved what
the builders

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:24.005 position:24% line:83% align:start
of the first tower
of Babel could not.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.273 position:41% line:83% align:start
We have
reached the throne of God.

00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:32.513 position:13% line:83% align:start

Ow! I hope
that won't happen again.

00:04:16.824 --> 00:04:18.960 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you still alive, Hanson?

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.629 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, I don't think so.

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought I saw a light beam
shoot out of that stone block.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:24.999 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's a lightning bolt.

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.035 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both scream]

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.570 position:38% line:89% align:start
Got you.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.639 position:24% line:83% align:start
How about you tell
us where the girl is?

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.473 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Grandis] Now, now.

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:35.710 position:5% line:89% align:start
Dear boy, we don't want the girl

00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:37.779 position:24% line:83% align:start
as much as we want
the Blue Water.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:40.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, Nadia still has it.

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:42.049 position:38% line:83% align:start
And those
soldiers still have Nadia.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
-That's just great!
-Oh, come on.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Once we take
care of Nemo and this Nautilus,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
we will have everything
we need to rise again.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.663 position:10% line:83% align:start
You will be my special guest
until the submarine lies rusting

at the bottom of the sea.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.434 position:30% line:83% align:start
Stubborn child,
you must remember...

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.905 position:5% line:83% align:start
the lives of Marie and your lion
depend on your manners

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:04.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
while you're here.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.110 position:30% line:89% align:start
One more thing,

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:12.613 position:10% line:83% align:start
I believe you're going to see
your boyfriend again very soon,

00:05:12.647 --> 00:05:15.448 position:7% line:83% align:start
though he may not be as lively
as he was before.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:27.061 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Sanson] Miss Granva,
what do we do now?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, Jean, what do you say
we join forces for a while?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
Forces?

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.804 position:7% line:83% align:start
It'll be an all for one and one
for all partnership

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:38.673 position:13% line:89% align:start
until we leave the island.

00:05:38.706 --> 00:05:39.574 position:35% line:89% align:start
[both] Huh?

00:05:39.607 --> 00:05:40.741 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:41.876 position:38% line:89% align:start
But I...

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.444 position:5% line:89% align:start
You have nothing to worry about.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.981 position:35% line:83% align:start
We'll keep
our hands off the Blue Water.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:49.150 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-We'll postpone our quest

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.818 position:33% line:83% align:start
for the jewel
until Nadia is free.

00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:51.886 position:33% line:89% align:start
How about it?

00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:54.088 position:41% line:89% align:start
Maybe.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:56.624 position:13% line:83% align:start
But they may have taken it
from her by now.

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:59.126 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then, the four of us will just
have to get it back from them.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.095 position:27% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Good.

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.997 position:33% line:83% align:start
It looks like
we have a new partner.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.866 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Let's get out of here.
-[both] Yes, Miss Granva!

00:06:19.747 --> 00:06:20.681 position:33% line:89% align:start
Look at that.

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:22.950 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whatever could it be?

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.121 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, I think it's
a submarine portal.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.456 position:27% line:83% align:start
We can see it now
because the tide is low.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:30.558 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hah.

00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.026 position:35% line:83% align:start
I'm willing
to bet that the Gratan

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:33.628 position:27% line:83% align:start
could easily fit
through that big opening.

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:34.929 position:35% line:89% align:start
The Gratan?

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:36.097 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.200 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Grandis Tank
or Gratan for short.

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.702 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's my own
incredible invention.

00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:43.537 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:46.173 position:19% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, I didn't
design it to operate underwater.

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:47.508 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fool!

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.143 position:16% line:89% align:start
What did you do that for?

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:53.781 position:16% line:83% align:start
I christened that vehicle
with a beautiful name Katherine.

00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:56.717 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you insist
on calling it the Gratan?!

00:06:56.751 --> 00:07:00.487 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, this Gratan--I mean, where
can we find this Katherine?

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.059 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, it took on some heavy
damage from the battleship,

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:08.062 position:7% line:83% align:start
so I hid it in the forest where
I don't think they can find it.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:09.563 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:09.597 --> 00:07:10.865 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:13.134 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hanson, go get it.

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:14.902 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're such a genius.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.203 position:13% line:89% align:start
You can fix it right away.

00:07:16.237 --> 00:07:18.139 position:30% line:89% align:start
I am a genius.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.206 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.808 position:35% line:89% align:start
But, ma'am,

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.910 position:5% line:83% align:start
this might be too difficult even
for the Gra--Katherine.

00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.946 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Why?
-Just look around.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
They have the entire complex
sewed up tight

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:29.951 position:24% line:83% align:start
with armed sentries
guarding every square inch.

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:33.955 position:10% line:83% align:start
They won't overlook something
as conspicuous as the Katherine.

00:07:33.988 --> 00:07:36.924 position:30% line:83% align:start
You always see
the negative side of everything.

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.993 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why can't you be real men?

00:07:39.026 --> 00:07:41.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
[both] We're doing
the very best that we can.

00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:45.833 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] What is that?

00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:48.769 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's the water intake point
for the power plant.

00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.705 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-How do they use the water?

00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
A thermo-electric plant
turns water into steam,

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:56.610 position:16% line:83% align:start
which powers the turbines
that make electricity.

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:58.112 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:07:58.145 --> 00:08:00.848 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, if the water is cut off.

00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.718 position:16% line:89% align:start
[all] [gasp] A blackout!

Aren't these exquisite?
