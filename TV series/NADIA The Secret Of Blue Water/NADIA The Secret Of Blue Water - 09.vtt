00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:28.388 position:10% line:83% align:start
[narrator] The year is 1889.
While at the World Exposition,

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.391 position:19% line:83% align:start
young Jean was smitten
with a young girl named Nadia.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.861 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jean helped his new friend
escape from jewel thieves

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.463 position:30% line:83% align:start
who were after
her gem, the Blue Water.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.365 position:16% line:83% align:start
Their adventure continued
on the waves

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.133 position:24% line:83% align:start
aboard an American
battleship

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.836 position:16% line:89% align:start
that hunted sea monsters.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.571 position:24% line:83% align:start
Later, they were on
the submarine Nautilus

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:45.138 position:27% line:89% align:start
with Captain Nemo

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:47.274 position:33% line:83% align:start
and witnessed
an undersea battle.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.710 position:13% line:89% align:start
After leaving the Nautilus,

00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:51.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
they were shot down over
a strange island

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.147 position:10% line:83% align:start
where they met a new friend,
the young Marie.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
However, the island
was under the control

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
of an evil organization
called the Neo Atlanteans.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:02.222 position:10% line:89% align:start
Former enemies became allies

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.292 position:7% line:83% align:start
in order to escape the clutches
of this terrible group

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.295 position:5% line:89% align:start
and their vile leader, Gargoyle.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.330 position:33% line:83% align:start
Their escape
would have been foiled

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
if not for the last-minute
intervention of Nemo and

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:14.569 position:19% line:89% align:start
his wonderful machine.

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:17.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
Gargoyle fought back
with his fearsome weapon,

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.806 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Tower of Babel.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
But it destroyed
his compound instead.

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:23.745 position:41% line:83% align:start
What is
the secret of Blue Water?

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:30.752 position:35% line:89% align:start
[rumbling]

00:02:34.522 --> 00:02:37.592 position:21% line:83% align:start
Those poor islanders.
Will they survive this?

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.794 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course. I saw them
gathering on the beach.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.495 position:10% line:89% align:start
And now that Gargoyle's gone,

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.665 position:13% line:83% align:start
they'll be able to rebuild
their homeland in freedom.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:48.435 position:13% line:89% align:start
Good. New life, new times.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.671 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.577 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Sanson] Hey, Jean.

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.513 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:02:58.546 --> 00:03:00.915 position:13% line:83% align:start
What are you doing up here?
We need your help.

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:03.483 position:35% line:83% align:start
-With what?
-The Katherine got badly damaged

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:04.652 position:19% line:89% align:start
and is taking on water.

00:03:04.686 --> 00:03:06.954 position:21% line:89% align:start
My Gratan is sinking.

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:09.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Won't somebody save my baby?
-Huh?

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.727 position:27% line:83% align:start
All this because
we came to save you. [sneezes]

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.696 position:21% line:89% align:start
M-Me, I have a cold.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmm, ah. I know. We can
ask the Nautilus for assistance.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.501 position:27% line:89% align:start
[all] Nati what?

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.970 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's the name of the submarine
that rescued us back there.

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.418 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[sighs]
-[Electra] Captain,

00:03:38.452 --> 00:03:40.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
the radio room just intercepted
an SOS message

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:42.590 position:7% line:89% align:start
from that bizarre little ship.

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:44.491 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Read it.
-Aye.

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.029 position:5% line:83% align:start
"Yoo-hoo, save us pretty please,
love Grandis."

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:50.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
-That's what it says.
-Bring them aboard.

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:53.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Are you sure?
-I am.

00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.904 position:5% line:83% align:start
They put up a good fight against
Gargoyle and the Neo Atlanteans.

00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.673 position:7% line:89% align:start
We should reward them for that.

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:00.675 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll notify the loading crew.

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.745 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Morse code beeping]

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.848 position:30% line:83% align:start
[gasps] They're
going to help us.

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.050 position:30% line:89% align:start
[all] Yes! Yes!

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.552 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[laughing]
-I'll get a tour this time.

00:04:11.586 --> 00:04:13.487 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't like this. But why?

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.694 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[Grandis sneezing]
-What a giant boat.

00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:22.630 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You can say that again. Whoa.
-Sure can.

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:25.800 position:5% line:83% align:start
I had no idea that a submersible
of this size even existed.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.400 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's beyond modern science.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:30.638 position:19% line:83% align:start
[squeals] I can't wait
to get onboard. Huh?

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:33.007 position:30% line:83% align:start
What is wrong?
You don't look happy.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
No. I'm frightened
of this ship.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.011 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.980 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Maneuver your vessel
to our aft.

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:40.948 position:13% line:89% align:start
We will collect you there.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:56.864 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Gee, how odd.

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:05.039 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:05:08.543 --> 00:05:11.378 position:21% line:89% align:start
[tense music playing]

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:21.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sir, the castaways
have been brought aboard.

00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:23.858 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo, I have my
final damage report for you.

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:30.097 position:33% line:83% align:start
All is sound,
but the automatic hydrogen line

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.634 position:10% line:83% align:start
and the magnetic field system
need immediate attention.

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.903 position:33% line:83% align:start
And how long
will it take you to repair them?

00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:37.538 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll need 48 hours.

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:39.774 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh. Any chance
you can shorten that?

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:43.678 position:10% line:83% align:start
If he says he needs 48 hours,
then we will give him 48 hours

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:46.714 position:7% line:83% align:start
so we can make sure the repairs
are done properly and well.

00:05:46.747 --> 00:05:48.683 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aye. I've already switched
all circuits over

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
to reserve power, sir.

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:54.822 position:7% line:83% align:start
I see. That means our movements
are severely restricted.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:57.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
-It can't be helped, sir.
-I know you're doing your best,

00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:00.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I hope an emergency
does not present itself

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:01.963 position:19% line:89% align:start
before you're finished.

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:03.798 position:13% line:89% align:start
My sentiments exactly, sir.

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, you best get started.

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:06.968 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aye.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.706 position:10% line:83% align:start
Sir, the crew and I heartily
regret that Gargoyle escaped.

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:13.841 position:21% line:89% align:start
Only for the moment.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.011 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll never give up my pursuit.

00:06:17.044 --> 00:06:18.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
Every single sailor aboard
the Nautilus feels

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.982 position:16% line:89% align:start
just as you do, Captain.

00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:24.986 position:5% line:83% align:start
The crew of that strange tank is
in aft dock. What shall we do?

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:28.756 position:5% line:83% align:start
Give them the best care possible
and tend to the injured.

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.726 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll leave it in your hands.
However, we--

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
We can't afford to have
outsiders

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.695 position:16% line:89% align:start
roaming around the ship,

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.030 position:21% line:83% align:start
so when their vessel
is repaired,

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:37.865 position:24% line:83% align:start
give them plenty of
food and water

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.700 position:13% line:89% align:start
and send them on their way.

00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:41.569 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's what you
were going to say, right?

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:42.435 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mmm.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.841 position:19% line:89% align:start
[quirky music playing]

00:06:46.874 --> 00:06:49.510 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:06:49.543 --> 00:06:51.879 position:33% line:83% align:start
No one taught
them their manners.

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:55.616 position:7% line:83% align:start
They haul in the Katherine and
leave us to catch cold in here.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.652 position:27% line:89% align:start
That isn't right.

00:06:57.685 --> 00:06:59.220 position:13% line:89% align:start
I am glad they rescued us,

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:02.623 position:19% line:83% align:start
but they do seem a tad
unfriendly, right?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hmm. Well, at least those two
are having a good time.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.065 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.935 position:10% line:89% align:start
They did this without rivets.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:17.038 position:7% line:83% align:start
How on Earth do you think they
joined the seams together, huh?

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:21.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
Like I said, this whole ship
is one big scientific wonder.

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:24.779 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we're going to be on it
for some time.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.781 position:30% line:83% align:start
[both] We're so
lucky, aren't we?

00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:28.516 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm?
-Huh?

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.784 position:41% line:89% align:start
[cries]

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.686 position:30% line:89% align:start
This is a door?

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:33.921 position:38% line:83% align:start
Yes. It's
opened by itself before.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.455 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[gasps]
-Ah.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.195 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hello, Electra.

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.831 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's you again, Jean.

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:45.266 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[laughs]

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:48.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
Welcome aboard our ship.
Make yourselves at home.

[Marie gasps]

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:51.038 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:54.075 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Excuse me, I--
-Stay there.

00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:56.610 position:16% line:83% align:start
On behalf of my friends,
I want to thank you

00:07:56.644 --> 00:07:59.747 position:13% line:89% align:start
for rescuing us, dear lady.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.115 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.251 position:33% line:83% align:start
Introductions
first. This is Hanson,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:07.755 position:19% line:83% align:start
-my personal assistant.
-What? Assistant?

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:10.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
The lady over there
is Mademoiselle Grandis Granva.

My name is Sanson, of course,
and I am at your service.

00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:19.600 position:13% line:83% align:start
-I would just like to say--
-Sanson!

00:08:19.633 --> 00:08:20.935 position:24% line:83% align:start
You do not have to
identify yourself

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.104 position:13% line:89% align:start
to someone wearing a mask.

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:26.607 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's quite right. My apologies.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.677 position:13% line:83% align:start
I am First Officer Electra,
at your service.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.013 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:33.647 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmph.

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:40.321 position:30% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia,
what an unexpected surprise.

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:42.089 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes. We're glad too.

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:44.291 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, who's that?

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:47.962 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her name is Marie.
We met her on the island.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:49.263 position:13% line:89% align:start
And where are her parents?

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:52.233 position:5% line:89% align:start
Gargoyle's soldiers got to them.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.801 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:56.971 position:5% line:83% align:start
You are now under the protection
of the Nautilus.

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.807 position:10% line:83% align:start
We will prepare rooms for you
and see to your needs.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.308 position:35% line:89% align:start
In return,

00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:04.045 position:19% line:83% align:start
we ask that you do not
move about the ship unescorted.

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:05.813 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:07.782 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you well?

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:11.218 position:19% line:83% align:start
No. Your miserable ship
has given me a cold.

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:15.122 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, how dreadful.
I'll send for the doctor.

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:17.124 position:13% line:89% align:start
Everyone, please follow me.

00:09:21.028 --> 00:09:24.698 position:7% line:83% align:start
He told you that he knew things
about your past, Nadia?

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:26.667 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes. That's not all.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.936 position:19% line:83% align:start
He called that weapon,
the Tower of Babel.

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:33.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wonder why he would name a
weapon after an old Bible story.

00:09:33.207 --> 00:09:35.009 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
anything about the Bible.

00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:37.378 position:13% line:83% align:start
But he also kept referring
to the Orihalcon.

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.047 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Orihalcon?
Just a moment.

00:09:40.081 --> 00:09:42.750 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's what they called
the glass block in the tower.

00:09:42.783 --> 00:09:45.152 position:27% line:83% align:start
It appeared to be
very much like the Blue Water.

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:47.188 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Really?
-Yes.

00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.925 position:10% line:83% align:start
So there must be some sort of
secret connection at work here.

00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:54.061 position:38% line:83% align:start
And maybe
the Nautilus is part of it.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.904 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, Hanson, any luck so far?

00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:06.941 position:7% line:83% align:start
The lock seems to be controlled
electrically or magnetically.

00:10:06.974 --> 00:10:08.676 position:33% line:89% align:start
I can't tell.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:12.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's incredible.
But too advanced for my hairpin.

00:10:12.146 --> 00:10:14.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll leave this one
up to you this time.

00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:17.184 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have no idea
how to get us out.

00:10:17.218 --> 00:10:19.153 position:13% line:89% align:start
Brute strength won't work.

00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:24.191 position:24% line:89% align:start
[groans] I give up!

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.765 position:13% line:89% align:start
You think Grandis is okay?

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.301 position:30% line:83% align:start
The doctor said
she just had a common cold.

00:10:34.335 --> 00:10:38.038 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Good. Let's go visit her.
-But how do we get out?

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:39.373 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll ask them to
open the door.

00:10:39.406 --> 00:10:40.741 position:38% line:89% align:start
But how?

00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:42.409 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't be stupid.

00:10:42.443 --> 00:10:45.079 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're listening
in on us right now.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.780 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've got a point there.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.386 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm, found you.

00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:59.927 position:7% line:83% align:start
Excuse me! We would like to see
Ms. Granva right now!

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.462 position:41% line:89% align:start
Please.

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:03.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Electra] But of course
you may see her.

00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:05.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Huh? Way to go.
-Huh? We did it.

[sighs] Ms. Granva?

00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:12.907 position:16% line:89% align:start
Doctor, will she recover?

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.276 position:16% line:83% align:start
If-if anything happens to
her, I swear--

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.044 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't you worry.

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:20.347 position:7% line:83% align:start
The medication will have her on
her feet by tomorrow morning.

00:11:20.381 --> 00:11:22.349 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-She'll recover in one day?

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:25.219 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laughs]
-It... It must be magic.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:28.088 position:13% line:89% align:start
No. It's just good science.

00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:31.025 position:13% line:89% align:start

-[Electra] No, sir.

00:11:47.775 --> 00:11:50.311 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm afraid that the loss
of their command center

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:53.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
will only cause them
to find better hiding places.

No. I'll stay here.

sometimes you speak too freely.

Yes. I have a bit of a surprise
for you, sir.

Ah. The ones
who had the aeroplane.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.406 position:24% line:83% align:start
I very much regret
my decision

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.509 position:21% line:83% align:start
to send them away to
that island.

I have no need to do that.

[Hanson] Yeah.

00:14:46.521 --> 00:14:49.624 position:38% line:83% align:start
What's so
appealing about old men?

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:51.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[Hanson] You said it.
-Huh?

00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:54.128 position:19% line:83% align:start
-I won't stand for it.
-Uh-huh.

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:59.667 position:7% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Look, Hanson, fix this
thing as quickly as possible.

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:02.336 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Why?
-Don't you see?

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:04.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
We need to leave this
ship immediately.

00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.273 position:41% line:89% align:start
We do?

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:09.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course! We must get her away
from that oily Captain Nemo.

-Well? Well what?

It's just there's so much
to learn around here.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
Listen here. These fellas are
in the middle of a raging battle

00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:22.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
with that monster Gargoyle
and his soldiers.

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:25.392 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't want to get killed
for hanging around here, do you?

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:28.362 position:33% line:83% align:start
Nah, Electra
wouldn't let that happen.

Agh! You always go mooning

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:36.738 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, I do not.

00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.973 position:35% line:83% align:start
So, who do
you think is prettier?

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:42.209 position:16% line:89% align:start
Electra or Grandis, huh?

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.378 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, I don't know.

00:15:44.411 --> 00:15:48.516 position:10% line:83% align:start
-What's that? Speak up, boy.
-I guess it's--

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.251 position:35% line:83% align:start
-It's who?
-Grandis.

00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:53.588 position:7% line:83% align:start
Then you're going to assist me
with my plan

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:55.757 position:7% line:89% align:start
to get off of this ship, right?

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.492 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Mm-hmm.
-Good boy.

00:15:58.526 --> 00:15:59.561 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:01.094 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Well, let's get started

00:16:01.128 --> 00:16:03.531 position:21% line:83% align:start
-right away, Hanson.
-[Hanson] Right.

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:05.232 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Say, Nadia,

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:08.135 position:10% line:83% align:start
why don't we go pay a little
visit to Grandis?

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:10.304 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Why should we?
-Why should we?

00:16:10.337 --> 00:16:12.740 position:30% line:83% align:start
They turned out
to be pretty good people.

00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:14.742 position:24% line:83% align:start
Those three helped
rescue the three of you

00:16:14.776 --> 00:16:17.010 position:7% line:89% align:start
from Gargoyle and his minions.

00:16:17.044 --> 00:16:19.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
And so now were
supposed to trust them, right?

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:23.150 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, but, of course.
They have earned it.

00:16:23.183 --> 00:16:26.053 position:27% line:83% align:start
They saved me so
they could steal my Blue Water,

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:28.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that's the only reason
they did it, Jean.

00:16:28.422 --> 00:16:31.291 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Oh, I don't know.
-I do.

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I was with them
for a very long time,

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:35.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
and the Blue Water
didn't light up even once.

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:37.632 position:21% line:89% align:start
Then, it was broken.

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:40.334 position:7% line:83% align:start
That doesn't seem very likely,
does it, huh?

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.604 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Blue Water probably
only lights up like that

00:16:42.637 --> 00:16:43.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
when I'm wearing it.

00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.773 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, I guess you are right.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.812 position:7% line:83% align:start

-It must be a cold.

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:53.480 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Poor guy.
-You'll be all right, King.

00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:56.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
Open wide, dearest. Good boy.

00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:59.219 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, no. It's all swollen.

00:16:59.253 --> 00:17:01.689 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What should we do?
-The doctor can make him well.

00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:03.691 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Of course.
-I just know he can.

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:07.160 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Good idea. Thanks a lot, Marie.
-[chuckles]

00:17:07.194 --> 00:17:09.263 position:5% line:83% align:start
We should get him an appointment
right away.

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.465 position:13% line:83% align:start
We could look in on Grandis
while we are at it.

00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:13.233 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm only worried about King.

[sighs]

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:19.139 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're going to go in there
and convince her

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:21.074 position:30% line:83% align:start
that she needs
to leave this ship.

00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:23.343 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Yes, but--
-It always ends up

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:26.313 position:19% line:83% align:start
with either her getting
tired of him or him dumping her,

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:28.482 position:27% line:83% align:start
so it's not going
to work out anyway.

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:31.184 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's best she get away from Nemo
as quickly as she can.

00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:32.319 position:41% line:89% align:start

-Huh?
-[Jean] Hi.

00:17:42.697 --> 00:17:44.331 position:38% line:83% align:start
What are
you doing out and about?

00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:46.868 position:16% line:83% align:start
It looks like King caught
a nasty little cold,

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:50.270 position:30% line:83% align:start
and we--we want
to look in on Grandis.

00:17:50.304 --> 00:17:52.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, how cute. That's
so very thoughtful of you,

00:17:52.707 --> 00:17:54.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
but why don't you wait out here
for a while?

00:17:54.609 --> 00:17:56.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
We have very important business
to discuss.

00:17:56.878 --> 00:17:58.746 position:7% line:89% align:start
Our business is important too.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.815 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Blue Water
is not lighting up, Nadia.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:02.584 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's because Grandis
isn't here

00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:04.184 position:10% line:89% align:start
to try and steal it from me.

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:06.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
You two shouldn't quarrel
about things like that.

00:18:06.453 --> 00:18:08.823 position:13% line:89% align:start

That's noisy. What is it?

00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:11.866 position:10% line:89% align:start
It sounds like church to me.

[Electra] No, you mustn't.

[gasps] Huh?

Nadia? What do you think
you're doing here?

When I--When I heard this music,

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:09.023 position:13% line:83% align:start
I--I thought I heard my...
mother calling me.

Please, Nadia, wake up.

I...

Captain Nemo is the one
playing that music, Nadia.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.832 position:24% line:89% align:start
Now go back to bed.

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:19.767 position:33% line:89% align:start
Captain Nemo?

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.571 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes. That hatch
leads to his cabin,

00:23:23.604 --> 00:23:26.406 position:13% line:83% align:start
but no one is ever allowed
to enter there.
