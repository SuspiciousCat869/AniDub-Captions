[narrator] Life
on a deserted island

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:30.558 position:10% line:83% align:start
had done little to cure Nadia
of her selfish ways.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:33.561 position:16% line:83% align:start
In fact, things have only
taken a turn for the worse.

00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.196 position:24% line:83% align:start
Early one morning,
she dragged Jean, Marie,

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.600 position:35% line:83% align:start
and King on
a march to the jungle,

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:41.502 position:38% line:83% align:start
renaming
everything to suit her taste.

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.271 position:30% line:83% align:start
She proclaimed
that she was a new girl now

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.542 position:10% line:83% align:start
and would no longer need the
help of science or technology

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:49.577 position:16% line:89% align:start
to live her simple life.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:51.846 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
her rebirth did not stop her

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.448 position:7% line:83% align:start
from raiding her friends' camp
for supplies

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.685 position:7% line:83% align:start
and draining their food stores
for her own needs.

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:01.689 position:10% line:83% align:start
She soon discovered that life
without scientific progress

00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:05.492 position:16% line:83% align:start
was a bit more difficult
than she had assumed.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:08.763 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jean and Marie generously
took her back to live with them.

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:13.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
But will her explosive nature
lead to further problems?

00:02:13.735 --> 00:02:15.803 position:19% line:89% align:start

How do you know I did?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.386 position:27% line:83% align:start
How can you be so
contemptuous of me?

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.321 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'd like to know
how you could tell it was there.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.224 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jean, I can tell
when I'm tasting it.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.559 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's yummy.

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:40.928 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't have a problem with
the taste,

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.797 position:10% line:89% align:start
just that you used it at all.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, we really don't have
a whole lot of food

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.267 position:30% line:83% align:start

around here, Nadia.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.269 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, please. Listen.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.272 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's no meat!
-[sighs] Right.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.776 position:16% line:89% align:start
Eating animals is cruel!

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.310 position:24% line:83% align:start
No human being has
the right to feed off others!

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.246 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's not an animal!

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.648 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's food for us to eat.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.786 position:7% line:83% align:start
The worst thing is that you hid
it in there just to trick me.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.688 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why did you lie to me?

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.656 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I didn't lie to you.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
And besides, it's very
nutritious

00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:12.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
and good to keep up
your strength.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.629 position:19% line:83% align:start
No creature should have
to give up its life

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:16.631 position:30% line:83% align:start
so that you can
build up your strength.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:17.999 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then why don't you go
and tell that to all the animals

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.736 position:7% line:89% align:start
that eat each other to survive?

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.236 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's another sick lie!

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a scientifically
proved fact

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
that some animals
eat each other to live.

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.644 position:16% line:83% align:start
And that's why I can give
no credence

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:30.978 position:13% line:89% align:start
to your deceptive science.

00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:33.715 position:35% line:83% align:start
Everything
it teaches is a big lie!

00:03:33.748 --> 00:03:35.917 position:24% line:89% align:start
You're a liar! Ugh!

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
Man has been eating meat
since the dawn of time

00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.353 position:5% line:89% align:start
and that is why he's multiplied.

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:43.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
And that's why he's so evil.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.325 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? Nonsense!

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.327 position:30% line:83% align:start
Maybe you don't
want to admit it, Jean.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
But eating meat makes you evil.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.531 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, please.

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:52.867 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you eat that,
you'll be as evil as Jean is.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.836 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Did you know that?
-[grunts]

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:56.537 position:10% line:89% align:start
You should throw it all away.

00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.472 position:13% line:89% align:start
That will be such a waste.

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:00.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
You are the ones
who are wasting everything.

00:04:00.675 --> 00:04:03.044 position:24% line:83% align:start
You waste lives so
you can fill up your stomachs!

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.646 position:19% line:83% align:start
You waste your own life
if you starve to death!

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's better than killing.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.684 position:5% line:83% align:start
But eating meat makes your blood
strong and helps you fight off

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:11.819 position:7% line:89% align:start
all sorts of terrible diseases.

00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:15.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
If my blood can't get by
without meat, then so be it.

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.824 position:16% line:89% align:start
It still makes you evil.

00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.893 position:41% line:83% align:start
That is
complete nonsense, Nadia.

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:19.827 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look at Marie and me.

00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:21.596 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ha!

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:22.997 position:24% line:83% align:start
You lied to me, and
that proves that you're evil!

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:25.700 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you want to
be evil like Jean?

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:27.367 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-How can you stand there

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.003 position:19% line:89% align:start
and say that about me?

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
And after everything that
we have been through together.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
And using your devious
corrupted mind,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.742 position:10% line:89% align:start
you tried to make me like you

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.476 position:7% line:89% align:start
by sneaking meat into my food.

00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
All I want is for
you to be healthy.

00:04:38.713 --> 00:04:41.414 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I won't reduce myself
to eating your sickening omelet.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.483 position:5% line:89% align:start
If you want to cook for me,

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:44.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll just have to make
a plain omelet.

Today, we begin a new operation.

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.850 position:27% line:83% align:start
We shall restore
the holy fortress at long last.

00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:12.886 position:5% line:89% align:start
It will carry us to the heavens.

All will know of
its terrible power,

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:18.626 position:13% line:89% align:start
all will know the Red Noah.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.562 position:21% line:89% align:start
Once it is restored,

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:23.497 position:19% line:83% align:start
the ignorant human race
will have no choice

00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.502 position:24% line:83% align:start
but to cast itself
at the feet of Neo Atlantis.

That's not smart
to eat rotten food.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.649 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] It was a devious trap
set by Gargoyle.

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:44.619 position:24% line:83% align:start
He must've planted
the poisoned spinaches cans

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.253 position:24% line:89% align:start
to try to kill us.

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:49.156 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well then, it's lucky for you,
he didn't decide to use

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
a lethal type of poison
to try to kill you with.

00:14:51.626 --> 00:14:56.063 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just admit that you ate a rotten
food and got too hungry to stop.

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're so greedy.

00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:00.934 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, Nadia, you should've
let us share our food with you.

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:04.204 position:10% line:83% align:start
No! I would rather suffer the
worst stomach pains in the world

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:05.439 position:21% line:89% align:start
than to ever consume

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:07.575 position:21% line:83% align:start
the desiccated flesh
of a living creature.

00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:11.111 position:21% line:89% align:start
She sure is stubborn.

00:15:11.145 --> 00:15:13.447 position:19% line:83% align:start
Are you having trouble
with your bowels, Nadia?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.015 position:27% line:89% align:start
You have a fever?

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:16.283 position:33% line:89% align:start
I feel fine.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:17.351 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:19.386 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's a fever.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.723 position:21% line:89% align:start
I do not get fevers!

00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:24.692 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think I might have a way
to cure that really quickly.

00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.563 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't bother. I need sleep.

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.566 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're going to
need a lot more than that.

[Jean] You're going to need
to stay here

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.242 position:19% line:89% align:start
and take care of Nadia.

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:44.411 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
But I wanna go with you.

00:15:44.445 --> 00:15:45.580 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jean] You can't.

00:15:45.613 --> 00:15:47.615 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nadia might eat
some more rotten food.

00:15:47.649 --> 00:15:49.349 position:10% line:89% align:start
You must keep an eye on her.

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.453 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
King can keep an eye on her.

[Jean] No, he can't.

Besides, we don't know
what might happen in the jungle.

00:15:56.724 --> 00:15:58.292 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have to stay here.

Why? Why do
you have to kill him?

00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:40.535 position:38% line:83% align:start
It is not
something I want to have to do.

00:16:40.568 --> 00:16:42.737 position:35% line:83% align:start
He has hurt
you because of his illness.

But Momo is my very
best friend, Ring Master.

[Ring Master] If I have to
choose between the two of you,

00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.646 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll take you, Nadia.

what must be done.

have, he'll die very peacefully.

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.622 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's better for him this way.

-No! Please don't kill him!

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:06.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's got to be something
you can do to avoid this.

you to stay at home.

Ah!

You better keep your teeth away
from me, do you understand me?

00:21:30.992 --> 00:21:33.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, I always brush my teeth
after every meal.

00:21:38.699 --> 00:21:40.433 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just look at you.

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.737 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why do you cause
me so much trouble?

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.972 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're supposed to be
the one taking care of me.

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:48.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
I swear, and if you want me
to drag you home again,

00:21:48.676 --> 00:21:50.745 position:10% line:89% align:start
you better lose a few pounds.

Geez, some people eat anything.

You mean this
happened while he was out

looking for medicinal herbs
to help cure me?

3:00, cuckoo.

00:22:02.422 --> 00:22:05.392 position:16% line:83% align:start
He told me that he wanted
to sink his teeth into me

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:07.094 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then he tried to grab me.

00:22:07.128 --> 00:22:09.362 position:24% line:89% align:start
He did this for me?

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
Isn't he awful?

00:22:10.832 --> 00:22:12.399 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thank you, Jean.

-Is it time for dessert?

00:22:31.052 --> 00:22:33.621 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I had
a dream while you were gone.

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:35.556 position:35% line:83% align:start
I realized
that none of us can live alone.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.490 position:24% line:89% align:start
We need each other.

00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:40.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had never really thought
about us that way before,

00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:41.762 position:30% line:83% align:start
but now I know
it to be the truth.

00:22:41.796 --> 00:22:45.800 position:24% line:83% align:start
I had a dream once
about a talking sausage.

00:22:45.833 --> 00:22:48.636 position:16% line:89% align:start
For so long, I was alone.

00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:51.672 position:30% line:83% align:start
I never needed
anyone's help for anything.

00:22:51.706 --> 00:22:53.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I soon found out
that without other people,

00:22:53.608 --> 00:22:56.177 position:5% line:89% align:start
I was making it hard for myself.

He would spend all of his day
and night digging his tunnels.

00:22:59.747 --> 00:23:02.884 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, for the first time
I can understand

00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:04.919 position:10% line:89% align:start
all for one and one for all.

[Jean groans]

[Nadia]
I can allow others to help me

00:23:07.454 --> 00:23:09.590 position:35% line:83% align:start
as long as
someone is thinking about me.

00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:13.027 position:13% line:83% align:start
If someone loves you enough
to worry about you,

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
then you have all that you need,

00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:16.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
especially if that person

00:23:16.597 --> 00:23:19.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
is willing to put their life in
danger to help you.

00:23:19.667 --> 00:23:22.503 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's what
I learned from my dream, Jean.

00:23:24.505 --> 00:23:27.541 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's a lot
heavier than I expected.

00:23:27.575 --> 00:23:30.811 position:16% line:83% align:start
I so want you to take me
to Africa with you some day.

00:23:30.845 --> 00:23:33.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
Africa is such
a big place, Nadia.

00:23:33.214 --> 00:23:35.883 position:16% line:83% align:start
Perhaps, you should stop
talking now, Jean.

00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:38.185 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:23:39.954 --> 00:23:41.789 position:19% line:89% align:start
Take your glasses off.

00:23:41.822 --> 00:23:42.823 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:23:42.857 --> 00:23:45.059 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't see you.

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:48.062 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, Jean, stay with me forever.
