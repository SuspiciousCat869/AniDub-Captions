Caught in a cunning trap

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:28.255 position:27% line:89% align:start
set by Gargoyle,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.424 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Nautilus fell prey
to an attack

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:34.361 position:16% line:83% align:start
by American naval forces
led by Captain Melville.

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
Damage to the ship
caused a lethal gas leak

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:39.366 position:16% line:83% align:start
that threatened the life
of three sailors,

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.904 position:10% line:83% align:start
including Jean's new friend,
Ensign Fait.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:45.205 position:21% line:83% align:start
In order to minimize
the damage,

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:47.809 position:21% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo ordered
the engine room sealed,

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:51.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
ensuring the death of the
sailors.

about the dark side of science

[Nadia] Gargoyle wants
to sink this ship

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.153 position:10% line:83% align:start
but he also wants to get his
hands on the Blue Water.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
The Blue Water is causing
all of this violence.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.729 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's the reason
that so many people have died.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.165 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is the Nautilus
that important?

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.469 position:27% line:83% align:start
Is the Blue Water
so important?

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:50.772 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Captain Nemo]
It is.

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:53.808 position:27% line:83% align:start
The Blue Water
must be protected

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
even if it costs us
everything.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:01.314 position:5% line:83% align:start

[Nadia]
If it's going to cause me

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.794 position:27% line:89% align:start
so much anguish,

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:14.796 position:21% line:83% align:start
then I don't want to
protect it anymore.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:21.468 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:24.539 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, I can't!

[Captain Nemo]
As I am sure you are all aware,

00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:48.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
our last battle cost us
the lives of three

00:03:48.062 --> 00:03:51.264 position:33% line:83% align:start
comrades from
the engine room crew.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.034 position:7% line:89% align:start
Their remains must be returned

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:56.003 position:27% line:83% align:start
and laid to rest
in the soil of their homeland.

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:58.506 position:19% line:89% align:start

Yes, Nadia?

00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:28.536 position:7% line:89% align:start
I need--I need your help, Jean.

00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:34.842 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-What is it?

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:36.043 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Well,

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.578 position:30% line:83% align:start
when I increase
the magnification

00:04:37.612 --> 00:04:38.813 position:21% line:89% align:start
on the microscope...

00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:42.617 position:13% line:89% align:start
the designs are still there

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.919 position:21% line:83% align:start
and they appear to be
three-dimensional.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:48.890 position:33% line:83% align:start
I wonder what
these designs are for?

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:53.561 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is that?

00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:56.531 position:24% line:83% align:start
It is armor plating
for the Nautilus.

00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:59.634 position:16% line:83% align:start
There is no harder metal
in existence in all the world.

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:05.740 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:07.708 position:35% line:89% align:start
Incredible.

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:10.812 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's cut into this
as if it were paper.

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:14.481 position:7% line:83% align:start
But how can a piece of crystal
do something like that?

00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:17.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
What on earth is the Blue
Water made of?

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, I am sorry, Nadia,

00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
but this is beyond my abilities
of comprehension.

00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:27.595 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh. Thank you, Jean.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:30.798 position:24% line:89% align:start
I am sorry, really.

[soft chuckles]

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.039 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why was this stone given to me?

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:44.045 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is this what the captain
called destiny?

00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:45.646 position:35% line:89% align:start
That it is.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.615 position:24% line:83% align:start
Fait and the others
were required

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.116 position:16% line:89% align:start
to sacrifice their lives

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.985 position:10% line:89% align:start
so that ours could be spared.

00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:54.655 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was their destiny.

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.991 position:16% line:83% align:start
The one written for them
in the eternal stars.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.963 position:7% line:83% align:start
So they had to die even though
they wanted to live?

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.699 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's correct.

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] That means
the reason they died...

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.106 position:7% line:83% align:start
the very reason they were even
aboard the Nautilus,

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.976 position:13% line:83% align:start
the reason the Blue Water's
in my possession,

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
and all of this warfare
is all a part of destiny?

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:21.916 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's correct.

00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:24.552 position:27% line:89% align:start
Didn't you know?

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:27.054 position:13% line:83% align:start
This has been your destiny
since you were born.

00:06:28.556 --> 00:06:30.791 position:35% line:89% align:start
Please, no.

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:33.127 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then, what is the reason
I was born in the first place?

00:06:35.096 --> 00:06:38.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
You were born so that you could
one day realize your purpose.

00:06:44.005 --> 00:06:45.139 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]

with these thoughts,

00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.142 position:24% line:83% align:start
is that the destiny
of the one

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:49.777 position:33% line:83% align:start
who possesses
the Blue Water?

Very well. You may come in.

Why did...

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.944 position:21% line:89% align:start
Why did Mr. Fait die?

00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.047 position:30% line:83% align:start

Yes.

Darkness is the lordship of
insecurity.

00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:29.150 position:35% line:83% align:start
It is truly
the kingdom of death.

Do not forget the darkness
when there is light.

00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:34.856 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do not forget the flower
when there is darkness.

Do not deny the unmerciful
force of your nature

00:22:37.892 --> 00:22:40.628 position:7% line:83% align:start
when you peer into the darkness
within your heart.

00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:42.597 position:10% line:83% align:start
Close your eyes and think of
the darkness.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.099 position:13% line:89% align:start
Learn to live in awe of it.

We relinquish you now
to the rest of unbroken slumber

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.839 position:27% line:83% align:start
till we return to
our home above.

From this day forward,

00:22:53.541 --> 00:22:56.143 position:21% line:83% align:start
we become inhabitants
of the darkness.

00:22:56.177 --> 00:23:00.147 position:16% line:83% align:start
Each one of us offers up
flowers and an uneasy peace

00:23:00.181 --> 00:23:04.085 position:16% line:83% align:start
within our hearts to you,
our departed comrades.
