[narrator] After
leaving the Nautilus,

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.892 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jean's plane was shot down
over a remote island

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
where Grandis and
her gang were waiting.

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
While exploring the island,

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:39.701 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia came upon
a small girl named Marie

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:43.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
who had survived an attack
that had killed her family.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:46.874 position:24% line:83% align:start
Marie told them of
the mysterious soldiers

00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:48.743 position:30% line:83% align:start
who had chased
her into the woods.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:52.412 position:7% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, Grandis and her boys
had problems of their own.

00:01:53.748 --> 00:01:56.851 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia told Marie
that her parents were dead.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
Overcome with grief,
Marie tried not to believe them.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.792 position:21% line:83% align:start
Will their new charge
help them discover

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:06.159 position:16% line:89% align:start
the secret of Blue Water?

[Jean] Hmm.

00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:38.593 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Let me see.

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:41.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's a nice big
church near our house.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:44.666 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let's see.

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.201 position:24% line:83% align:start
-In this area, hmm?
-Uh-hmm.

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:51.973 position:16% line:83% align:start
Me and Mama and Papa went
there for services every Sunday.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.509 position:38% line:83% align:start
You did?
You're a good girl.

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:55.943 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Marie giggles]

00:02:58.713 --> 00:03:00.480 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
That's obviously the church.

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
So that means--huh?

[vehicle approaching]

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is that?

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.403 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.473 position:13% line:83% align:start
That truck is being pulled
around by the robot?

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:29.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
But no, maybe the truck
operates it like a human tank.

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:34.849 position:44% line:89% align:start

[Jean] Children.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:56.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're looking for us.
Just as I thought!

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.238 position:10% line:89% align:start
The girl is not to be harmed.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.241 position:16% line:89% align:start
He's talking about Nadia.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.810 position:38% line:89% align:start
But why?

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.047 position:16% line:89% align:start
I need to find that port.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm here, so that must be north.

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then, this is the road
Marie told me about.

00:04:13.688 --> 00:04:14.889 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.864 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Marie] The port?

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:25.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a place where all
the ships come to rest.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.434 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, I know what that is.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.570 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's right down
the road by our church.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:32.439 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a big place with all
sorts of ships floating in it.

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:34.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
Papa always took me there.

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] How nice.
I'm sure you enjoyed that.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.320 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:57.832 position:7% line:89% align:start
They've got it locked up tight.

00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:00.768 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll never be
able to sneak in there.

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:03.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
Look at all those crates.

00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:04.839 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder what's inside of them.

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:09.076 position:24% line:83% align:start
Goodness! There at
the top, it's bright as day.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.444 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even Paris doesn't
have this many lights.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.614 position:5% line:89% align:start
But I don't see any power lines.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:18.519 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aha!

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:26.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
They run them up the mountain.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.461 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess that building
is a power plant.

You have to say, "Goodnight, my
dear Marie," like Mama says it.

00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:29.489 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, please forgive me.

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:34.195 position:16% line:89% align:start
Goodnight, my dear Marie.

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.596 position:16% line:89% align:start

[Jean] The soldiers
are all over the town and port.

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:10.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
Anyone else in the island is
either dead or soon to be dead.

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:11.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] How do you know that?

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:14.135 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Because those men
are all murderers.

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:15.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
But we need to find
the living ones

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.204 position:7% line:89% align:start
and help them get out of here.

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:19.140 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] How do
you plan to find them?

-[Nadia] You don't know, do you?

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:23.611 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Jean] What do you want from me?

If you have a brilliant plan,
please tell me what it is.

know whether--

I'm sorry, Marie.
We're just talking loud.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.461 position:5% line:83% align:start
We did not mean to frighten you.
And we're sorry.

Oh, okay. That's good.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:51.038 position:5% line:83% align:start
You must keep in mind that there
is very little that we can do.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to keep
Marie's welfare in mind too.

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:55.242 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] You don't
have to tell me that.

00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:57.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know we have to
keep her out of danger.

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.779 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Jean] All right.

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:00.181 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now I think that the center
of their operation

is in the middle of

out more tonight.

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:27.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's much too dangerous
for you to go there alone.

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:29.310 position:24% line:89% align:start
There's no choice.

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:32.146 position:13% line:83% align:start
See, there may be innocent
people imprisoned there,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.315 position:19% line:83% align:start
-and I must find them.
-Don't do it!

Listen to me, Nadia.

Everything
we know about the island

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:40.254 position:24% line:83% align:start
is only what Marie
has told us in her stories.

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
Just a map.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.859 position:5% line:83% align:start
What we need is some information
that can help people.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.995 position:41% line:83% align:start
-But--
-No need to worry.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:50.297 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have already figured out
a way to get in there

If we're going to
get off this island,

00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.174 position:30% line:83% align:start
then we'll need
to start taking some risks.

[Gargoyle] Yes.

00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.253 position:13% line:89% align:start
[soldiers] Kneel, mankind!

00:17:33.287 --> 00:17:35.657 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Have
you found the girl?

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.190 position:21% line:89% align:start
[commander] No, sir.

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:39.226 position:24% line:83% align:start
But we do have some
powerful bait to draw her to us.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.460 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Be swift.

00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.764 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't care how,
just so she is taken alive.

00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:44.231 position:21% line:89% align:start
[soldier] Understood.

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
I cannot believe
how large this organization is.

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:49.571 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:17:49.604 --> 00:17:51.839 position:7% line:89% align:start
Neo Atlan, what does that mean?

00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:55.743 position:7% line:89% align:start

If we stay up here,
we'll be mulched into dust.

00:18:07.722 --> 00:18:08.790 position:13% line:89% align:start
We need to get down there.

00:18:10.758 --> 00:18:12.259 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:13.728 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It's getting hotter!

00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:32.179 position:33% line:89% align:start
Grab my hand!

[Gargoyle] What is your progress
with the artificial Orihalcon?

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:59.507 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Chief] We show a delay of 0.01%

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
but we're confident it will be
ready in time for the test.

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:02.877 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Uh-hmm.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I've never felt
heat like this before.

00:19:05.847 --> 00:19:07.347 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jean] We have to endure it.

00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:08.850 position:30% line:83% align:start
We can't afford
to be seen outside.

00:19:08.883 --> 00:19:10.317 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Maybe so.

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:14.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
I prefer getting caught
to falling in there.

00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:15.690 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:19:16.858 --> 00:19:18.325 position:33% line:83% align:start

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:29.904 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Uh-huh.

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:33.173 position:24% line:89% align:start
[continue panting]

00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:36.209 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please don't give me
any more scares like that.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.579 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:39.747 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

[machinery whirring]

00:19:54.996 --> 00:19:56.631 position:33% line:89% align:start
Interesting.

00:19:56.664 --> 00:19:58.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
They are manufacturing
large glass blocks

00:19:58.498 --> 00:19:59.867 position:19% line:89% align:start
out of molten crystal.

00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:01.703 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do they use those for?

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:03.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[sighs] One track mind.
-Hmm?

00:20:09.944 --> 00:20:11.846 position:7% line:89% align:start
It is a fully automated plant,

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:14.949 position:5% line:83% align:start
that is good for us since no one
is here attending the machines.

00:20:14.982 --> 00:20:16.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
But they do have guards.

00:20:16.784 --> 00:20:17.719 position:33% line:89% align:start
[both gasps]

00:20:20.888 --> 00:20:22.990 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] So what do we do now?

00:20:24.058 --> 00:20:26.661 position:10% line:83% align:start
There should be fewer guards
around once night falls,

00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:29.262 position:21% line:83% align:start
so we should be able
to sneak inside

00:20:29.296 --> 00:20:30.865 position:10% line:89% align:start
under the conveyor mechanism.

00:20:30.898 --> 00:20:32.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:36.537 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Chief] The artificial
Orihalcon incorporates all

00:20:36.571 --> 00:20:38.673 position:27% line:83% align:start
of our scientific
discoveries to date.

00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:41.008 position:7% line:89% align:start
Theoretically, it will perform

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.578 position:19% line:83% align:start
precisely according to
our original plans.

00:20:43.611 --> 00:20:45.713 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
Theories are of no use to me.

00:20:45.747 --> 00:20:48.381 position:16% line:83% align:start
Its practical application
is my only concern.

00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:55.623 position:27% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:59.392 position:21% line:89% align:start

-It's never done this.
-Oh.

00:21:10.104 --> 00:21:11.304 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa!

00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.580 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Chief] It's--it's never reacted
in this manner before.

00:21:19.614 --> 00:21:21.082 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Investigate this.

00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.517 position:38% line:83% align:start
Find out
what it's responding to.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.751 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Chief] Understood.

00:21:23.785 --> 00:21:27.387 position:35% line:83% align:start
Could it be

Surrender to

-No, just for you.
-Huh?

00:22:39.193 --> 00:22:41.394 position:24% line:83% align:start
Take this with you
and get up there quickly

-Huh?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
[commander] I will give you
until the count of five,

00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:46.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
then we will fire.

You go! I will distract them.
