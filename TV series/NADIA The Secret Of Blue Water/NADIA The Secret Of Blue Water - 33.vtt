[narrator] Nadia and the rest
of our heroes crash-landed

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.258 position:24% line:83% align:start
right in the middle
of an African village.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.427 position:33% line:83% align:start
It was there
that they met Hamahama

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.863 position:30% line:83% align:start
with whom Nadia
quickly fell madly in love.

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.701 position:16% line:89% align:start
This upset Jean terribly.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.705 position:5% line:83% align:start
Meanwhile, King ran into trouble
when he was captured

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:47.140 position:7% line:89% align:start
by treasure-seeking scavengers

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:49.611 position:30% line:83% align:start
who had set up
camp near the village.

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:52.814 position:13% line:83% align:start
The scavengers immediately
demanded the treasures

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:55.315 position:30% line:83% align:start
in exchange for
King's safe return.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.218 position:38% line:83% align:start
What will
happen to the poor lion?

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.420 position:13% line:89% align:start
Has Nadia found a new love?

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:05.392 position:27% line:83% align:start
The next 24 hours
hold all the answers.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.232 position:7% line:83% align:start
In the meantime, make yourself
more useful, Hamahama.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.301 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why not dust
off my treasures, eh?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.770 position:24% line:89% align:start
I know that voice.

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:16.938 position:35% line:89% align:start
Who is it?

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.239 position:16% line:89% align:start
He hasn't changed a bit.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:20.942 position:33% line:83% align:start
Miss Grandis,
don't let them see you.

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.310 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll never forget Gonzalez.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.746 position:27% line:89% align:start
[both] Gonzalez?

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:25.913 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hey, wait.
-[Grandis groans]

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:29.717 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, isn't this a surprise?

00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're Grandis Granva,
aren't you?

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.589 position:41% line:83% align:start
I never
expected to find you here.

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:37.424 position:5% line:89% align:start
You lose contact with a dear one

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.561 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then she turns up
right in the middle of Africa.

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:43.497 position:33% line:83% align:start
Good heavens,
is she an old friend of yours?

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.267 position:10% line:83% align:start
Must be. She sure looks like
she knows you.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.538 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, she was just
one of my earlier exploits.

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.873 position:21% line:89% align:start
She simply adores me.

00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:53.240 position:30% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Right?

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:55.375 position:35% line:89% align:start
[trembles]

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.678 position:38% line:89% align:start
Eat lead!

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.514 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.549 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, I was just reminiscing.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:02.717 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.284 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's about that man, right?

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:06.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm the most unfortunate
woman in the world.

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.423 position:7% line:83% align:start
I try to put the past behind me
and then it finds me,

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:11.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
it finds me right here in Africa

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.528 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it seems to have found

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:15.897 position:24% line:83% align:start
a pair of girls to
hang on his arms

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.932 position:7% line:89% align:start
just to make bad matters worse.

00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:20.367 position:30% line:83% align:start
Passionate love
has turned to hatred.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.368 position:35% line:89% align:start
Can it be?

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.771 position:19% line:89% align:start
Could I still love him?

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:26.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been learning a lot
about how a woman acts

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.407 position:21% line:83% align:start
-when she's in love.
-Huh?

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.445 position:30% line:83% align:start
A woman's heart
is much like the hot water

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.313 position:7% line:89% align:start
pouring out of this showerhead.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.882 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sometimes, it can cool off

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:36.818 position:33% line:83% align:start
and sometimes
it gets so boiling hot

00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.452 position:24% line:89% align:start
you can't touch it.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
It flows from
a cold to a hot temperature

00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:42.824 position:5% line:89% align:start
according to the laws of nature.

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:44.625 position:24% line:89% align:start
And just like that,

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.028 position:27% line:83% align:start
I will flow into
the arms of my love.

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.395 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:49.329 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:52.299 position:27% line:83% align:start
Would you please
be careful for once?

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.401 position:7% line:89% align:start
We were almost scalded in here.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:55.937 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hmm? [laughs]

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.672 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:00.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
Is that better?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.809 position:33% line:89% align:start
Stop staring.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:07.014 position:24% line:89% align:start
I feel sad for him.

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:13.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Hanson] Well, now that
the Gratan is up and running,

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:15.388 position:30% line:83% align:start
what do you say
we go rescue King?

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.058 position:24% line:89% align:start
Here's a question.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.961 position:10% line:83% align:start
How can Miss Granva and Nadia
take a nice leisurely bath

00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:21.394 position:33% line:83% align:start
at the moment
that King's very life

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.764 position:16% line:89% align:start
hangs over the precipice?

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:23.965 position:13% line:89% align:start
I tell you, quite honestly,

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:26.466 position:7% line:89% align:start
I just don't believe those two.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:29.504 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, you have to understand
Miss Grandis' situation.

00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:32.640 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our enemy is the first man
she has ever loved.

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:34.307 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's most unfortunate.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:36.811 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's what
our real problem is,

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.814 position:21% line:83% align:start
what if she falls in
love with him all over again?

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.481 position:13% line:89% align:start
But how could she do that?

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:44.451 position:24% line:83% align:start
Her current hatred
is rooted in past love.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.419 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hope she doesn't succumb
to that old disease.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.488 position:30% line:83% align:start
I must arrange
a meeting with him.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:49.824 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:53.460 position:33% line:83% align:start
Regardless of
our sordid past together,

00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:55.530 position:30% line:83% align:start
Gonzalez and I
have known each other longer

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:57.665 position:10% line:89% align:start
than anyone else we know now.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:00.568 position:16% line:83% align:start
And since I've become so
beautiful since he last saw me,

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
he'll want to speak with me
for say 15 minutes.

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:06.641 position:21% line:83% align:start
But he's awfully good
at deceiving people, you know?

00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:08.643 position:16% line:89% align:start
Two can play at that game

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:11.512 position:19% line:83% align:start
and those harlots will
not beat me at my specialty.

00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:12.880 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:14.048 position:19% line:89% align:start
While you distract him,

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Hamahama will rescue King.
-[laughs]

00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:17.852 position:19% line:83% align:start
So we don't have to do
anything?

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.486 position:10% line:89% align:start
We don't have to do anything?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.455 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess not. Hamahama
is going to rescue King.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.525 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did Nadia make that decision?

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:25.927 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Hmm.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't let it discourage you yet,
little fella.

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:32.099 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nadia is so determined to deny
the superiority of science

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
that we have got
to prove her wrong here.

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:36.737 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right. She can't make us give up
like that, Jean.

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:38.539 position:16% line:89% align:start
We are going to show her.

00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:41.008 position:13% line:83% align:start
We are going to rescue King
from Gonzalez' clutches

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.410 position:30% line:83% align:start
before Hamahama
even has a chance

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.079 position:10% line:89% align:start
to get close to that trailer.

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:48.583 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then when she's seen
the power of science at work,

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:50.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
she'll take back everything
she's ever thought

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:53.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
and look at you in a whole
different light, because--

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:56.791 position:16% line:83% align:start
Because Jean never takes
second place to Hamahama.

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:59.026 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.828 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's right.
Just you wait, Nadia.

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.464 position:21% line:89% align:start
[speaking in Gullah]

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:12.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What's happening?
-Our treasure is damaged.

00:06:14.075 --> 00:06:15.877 position:27% line:83% align:start
But that's a can
of food, Hamahama.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.045 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's not just a can of food,

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:20.447 position:35% line:83% align:start
it's a very
important can of food.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.983 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:23.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] King
must have done this.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.053 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what,

00:06:26.087 --> 00:06:28.055 position:10% line:89% align:start
Gonzalez has done this to you

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.790 position:27% line:83% align:start
and he should be
ashamed of himself

00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
for eating the treasure
of your village, Hamahama.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.828 position:10% line:89% align:start
King doesn't have much time.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:35.428 position:16% line:89% align:start
We've got to rescue him.

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:37.765 position:27% line:89% align:start
Grandis is gone?

00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:39.901 position:10% line:83% align:start
Shouldn't we be rescuing King
right now?

She isn't in the tent either.

-Oh, not with him.

Oh, you mean the chap tied

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:13.668 position:21% line:83% align:start
He can leave as soon
as they deliver the treasure

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.703 position:24% line:89% align:start
which they must do

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.972 position:16% line:83% align:start
because they can't allow
their guardian animal to perish.

You see my dear lady,

Bravo again, Mr. Gonzalez.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.814 position:19% line:89% align:start
It is a brilliant plan.

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:29.016 position:13% line:83% align:start
That treasure will be ours
within the hour.

will just the two of us

00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:36.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
be able to rescue
King from Gonzalez?

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:38.592 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're a tribe
that has never been defeated

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.161 position:33% line:83% align:start
and we're not
going to start now.

00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:41.896 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, don't worry, Nadia,

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.631 position:16% line:89% align:start
they're no match for us.

What is this
treasure you want so badly

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.970 position:24% line:83% align:start
and why is it worth
all of this effort?

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:50.738 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.707 position:7% line:83% align:start
But I was sure you'd come here
to take it for yourself.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.176 position:33% line:83% align:start

Now all I have to
do is play for time,

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:17.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
which should give Nadia
the perfect opportunity

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.066 position:24% line:89% align:start
to whisk King away.

with a much better plan.

How are we going to rescue
that poor little guy?

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:46.093 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think I should go by myself
from here on out,

00:08:46.127 --> 00:08:47.795 position:27% line:89% align:start
so you wait here.

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.231 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Uh, maybe I could act
as your decoy.

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:52.099 position:38% line:89% align:start
My what?

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:55.102 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will go in there
and draw Gonzalez' attention

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.704 position:10% line:89% align:start
and then you can rescue King.

00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.640 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just do it, okay?

Yes.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.980 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] You mean
there's a pillar of silver

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:07.948 position:16% line:89% align:start
and it's in that village?

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:10.084 position:38% line:83% align:start
I will be
the richest man in Europe.

Correction, the richest man

Oh, my dear Grandis.

Can you believe how young
we were back then?

All that I have ever wished for

00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:25.733 position:5% line:89% align:start
in this wretched world is money.

And why not?

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:30.571 position:24% line:83% align:start

[Ayerton]
Gonzalez is a gifted conman

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:46.207 position:35% line:83% align:start
which makes
him a crafty opponent

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.909 position:16% line:83% align:start
but all he has for backup
are two young women.

00:11:48.943 --> 00:11:51.212 position:30% line:83% align:start
That decidedly
gives us the upper hand

00:11:51.245 --> 00:11:52.514 position:21% line:89% align:start
when we confront him.

00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:55.349 position:38% line:83% align:start
Now then,
Grandis, Nadia, and King

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.051 position:5% line:89% align:start
are currently being held captive

00:11:59.453 --> 00:12:00.854 position:33% line:89% align:start
Now what if--

are you listening?

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:04.959 position:13% line:83% align:start
What if Gonzalez discovers
what King has done,

00:12:04.992 --> 00:12:08.095 position:13% line:83% align:start
that his precious treasure
has been eaten by him?

00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:10.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
What would his reaction
to that be? Perhaps...

But not just to
King, to the ladies, too.

Her fate could be
the worst of them all.

He could deceive her once again!

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.988 position:19% line:83% align:start
She could fall for that
desiccated middle-aged man

once more.

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:37.391 position:16% line:83% align:start

Huh? You can't

will soon deliver it

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:01.448 position:27% line:83% align:start
and they will do
so to save your lives.

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:03.284 position:5% line:89% align:start
You should see that as an honor.

00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:05.520 position:5% line:83% align:start
Nobody's ever going to bring you
that treasure.

00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:07.187 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What did you say?

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.857 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because there isn't any more
treasure to bring.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.892 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should never con
a con artist, little girl.

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.827 position:30% line:89% align:start
But it's true!

00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:16.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
The treasure was just an
ordinary can of food, you cad!

00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:19.166 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was completely worthless!
[gasps]

You should learn to tell
better lies than that, love.

00:13:22.136 --> 00:13:23.538 position:16% line:83% align:start

[laughs]

00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:27.141 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] All right, then.

00:13:27.174 --> 00:13:29.443 position:30% line:83% align:start
We've recovered
the Gratan's balloon again.

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:30.911 position:10% line:89% align:start
Luckily, it caught up with us

00:13:30.944 --> 00:13:32.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
as we were racing through
the woods,

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:34.948 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I guess it's
better late than never.

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:37.284 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's under repair as we speak,
which means--

00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:39.286 position:19% line:89% align:start
Good! That's very good!

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
It means we can strike them
from both the land

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:42.923 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the sea simultaneously.

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:44.626 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why do I always
have to be the one

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:46.994 position:10% line:89% align:start
to mend this stupid balloon?

00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:48.262 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton]
How's it coming, Marie?

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.930 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm working on it!

00:13:49.963 --> 00:13:51.599 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] As you see,

00:13:51.633 --> 00:13:55.102 position:10% line:83% align:start
Gonzalez' vehicle is located
at the top of the hill,

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.505 position:21% line:83% align:start
which gives it a view
of the entire vicinity.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:59.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no direction
from which the Gratan

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:02.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
or the balloon could strike
without being detected.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:04.144 position:24% line:89% align:start
So we just give up?

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:05.979 position:13% line:89% align:start
We can't use the equipment,

00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:08.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
so we might as well kiss the
ladies a fun farewell, Hanson!

00:14:09.016 --> 00:14:11.553 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can't even think
of giving up at this point!

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:14.556 position:19% line:83% align:start
What I was going to say
was that we can win this.

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:17.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
As long as we are convinced
of our victory!

00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.226 position:24% line:89% align:start
[insects chirping]

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:20.994 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Gonzalez] They're late!

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:22.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just who do they think
they're dealing with?

00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:24.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, everything's
gonna be all right,

00:14:24.398 --> 00:14:26.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
so don't get yourself
into a snit, cuddle bear.

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.268 position:19% line:89% align:start
That poor little lion,

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.971 position:10% line:83% align:start
he doesn't have too much time
left to live now, does he?

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:34.007 position:13% line:83% align:start
Fool! You could never hope
to best Hamahama.

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.945 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hamahama has never been defeated
in battle before, Gonzalez.

00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:40.615 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now, now, ladies should be
demure and silent

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:43.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
and concern themselves
with womanly matters.

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:45.620 position:33% line:83% align:start
Women should
be graceful and sweet

00:14:45.653 --> 00:14:47.955 position:33% line:83% align:start
and not worry
their pretty little heads.

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:50.257 position:7% line:83% align:start
-They should know their place.
-[growls]

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.394 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look, we have a slim chance
at winning this thing.

00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:55.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a river running
right next to the hill.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.533 position:33% line:83% align:start
We can charge
from that direction.

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:01.468 position:30% line:83% align:start
He won't expect
an aquatic attack.

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:04.371 position:33% line:83% align:start
No, he won't.
But the river's far too narrow

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.973 position:7% line:89% align:start
for the Katherine to navigate.

00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.642 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah, but I thought of that.

00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:10.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've already custom-installed
two of the Gratan's screws

00:15:10.477 --> 00:15:12.146 position:21% line:89% align:start
onto Hamahama's canoe

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:14.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
so that it can make
a considerably faster approach.

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:15.583 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:18.152 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wonderful idea!

00:15:18.185 --> 00:15:21.388 position:7% line:83% align:start
Modern science and traditional
culture joining together

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:24.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
so that we may launch
our attacks in concert

00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:25.292 position:27% line:89% align:start
with each other!

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.494 position:30% line:83% align:start
What is my role
in this terrific plan?

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:29.296 position:41% line:83% align:start
We will
definitely need something

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:32.199 position:5% line:83% align:start
to draw Gonzalez' attention away
from the point of attack,

00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:34.334 position:24% line:83% align:start
so you will launch
a full frontal attack

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:35.603 position:19% line:89% align:start
on the armored vehicle

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:37.271 position:33% line:83% align:start
while we come
up from behind him.

00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:38.740 position:38% line:89% align:start
A decoy?

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:40.207 position:21% line:89% align:start
But tell me, Hanson,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.176 position:27% line:83% align:start
what will become
of the Katherine here?

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.211 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've already made peace with it.

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.313 position:33% line:83% align:start
We must risk
the loss of everything

00:15:46.346 --> 00:15:49.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
to rescue King and the ladies
from that despicable man.

00:15:49.717 --> 00:15:52.152 position:13% line:83% align:start
Therefore, we must give up
the Gratan if we must.

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:53.320 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, I see.

00:15:53.353 --> 00:15:54.556 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well, we must
do what we have to.

00:15:54.589 --> 00:15:56.356 position:30% line:89% align:start
It is decided.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.426 position:13% line:83% align:start
I will act as the decoy to
draw away Gonzalez' attention.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.229 position:30% line:83% align:start
-To you, Jean.
-King is part of the plan, too.

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:05.533 position:5% line:83% align:start
We must make him drink a dose of
the red fruit juice once again.

00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:08.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
Right. It will give him
a sudden burst of strength.

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.237 position:7% line:89% align:start
And with his newfound strength,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.439 position:27% line:83% align:start
he'll be able to
break free of his bonds.

00:16:12.473 --> 00:16:14.041 position:24% line:89% align:start
And at that point,

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.477 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'll send in
Red King to take his place.

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.178 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, what an excellent plan!

00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:20.013 position:19% line:89% align:start
Only one small problem.

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:21.683 position:27% line:83% align:start
How are we going
to get King to drink the juice

00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:23.383 position:30% line:83% align:start
while he's tied
up to that cross?

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:26.353 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our only chance is to shoot it
directly into his mouth.

00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:27.722 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea!

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.624 position:30% line:83% align:start
Lucky, we have
a marksman on hand.

00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:32.660 position:33% line:83% align:start
Explain to me
why I have to be the decoy now.

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.395 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, it's because you have proven

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:37.665 position:16% line:83% align:start
such as a wonderful skill
for driving, Count Ayerton.

00:16:37.699 --> 00:16:39.567 position:10% line:89% align:start
But that's not fair, Sanson.

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:42.169 position:13% line:83% align:start
What if he ends up breaking
the Gratan all over again?

00:16:42.202 --> 00:16:43.538 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then you'll fix it.

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
You said yourself
you're willing to give it up.

00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:47.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes! But I don't
want to lose her

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:48.776 position:5% line:89% align:start
just because he can't drive her!

00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:51.211 position:24% line:89% align:start
We need to go now!

00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:53.681 position:5% line:89% align:start
Fine. But I'll be in there, too.

00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:55.617 position:33% line:83% align:start
And Marie and
I will take the balloon.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.217 position:41% line:89% align:start
And me?

00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:59.219 position:24% line:83% align:start
You launch Red King
from the boat, Jean.

00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:01.523 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm with Jean.

00:17:01.556 --> 00:17:03.257 position:19% line:89% align:start
Then everything's set.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.193 position:21% line:83% align:start
