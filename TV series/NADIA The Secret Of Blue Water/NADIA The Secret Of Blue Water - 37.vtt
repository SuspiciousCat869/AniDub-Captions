[Gargoyle] Come with me, Nadia.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.772 position:38% line:83% align:start
I want to
introduce you to someone.

00:01:46.808 --> 00:01:49.443 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your Majesty, Emperor Neo.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.715 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have brought
Princess Nadia to you.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.851 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm. Thank you.

[groans]

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.790 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Emperor Neo] So you are Nadia.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:05.225 position:33% line:89% align:start
Isn't that...

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.227 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's the Blue Water!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's correct. Your father's
most prized memento.

Your Majesty,

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
we humbly request your aid
in bringing Neo Atlantis

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
to supremacy once again.

00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:24.912 position:38% line:89% align:start
Granted.

[rumbling]

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.198 position:16% line:89% align:start
[follower] Sir, Red Noah.

00:02:46.668 --> 00:02:48.870 position:21% line:89% align:start
We found it at PX703

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:50.905 position:5% line:89% align:start
among the ruins of old Atlantis.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] So, it was in that
pile of junk all along.

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:57.310 position:5% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It's not a pile of junk.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:59.312 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a sacred resting place.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
A living man has
no use for the dead.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.252 position:35% line:83% align:start
Therefore,
it is a useless junkyard.

[Gargoyle] Speaking of junk,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.658 position:7% line:89% align:start
what has become of Nemo's ship?

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.327 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sir, we cannot
detect any signs of life

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.496 position:24% line:83% align:start
or energy readings
coming from the area.

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:19.499 position:7% line:83% align:start
It must have taken a direct hit
and evaporated.

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:20.568 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.770 position:35% line:89% align:start
Very well.

00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:24.404 position:33% line:83% align:start
We must offer
our prayers for them.

[trembles]

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:28.676 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:31.946 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, Jean.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.514 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:35.348 position:38% line:89% align:start
Amazing.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never imagined there
could be a tunnel like this

00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.786 position:13% line:89% align:start
under the entire continent.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.655 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not just under Africa.

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:42.957 position:19% line:83% align:start
There are many tunnels
just like this one.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.959 position:19% line:83% align:start
They stretch underneath
the entire lengths

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
of five continents
and seven oceans.

00:03:46.894 --> 00:03:49.831 position:13% line:83% align:start
Did the ancient Atlanteans
also build these tunnels?

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:51.599 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Electra] That's correct.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.835 position:13% line:83% align:start
The old Nautilus was saved
from complete destruction

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:55.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
due to underwater currents

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.505 position:10% line:89% align:start
that carried it to the tunnel

00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:59.372 position:19% line:83% align:start
that we're traveling in
right now.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.808 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's incredible.

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:02.844 position:30% line:83% align:start
We shall always
owe our thanks to Atlantis then.

00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:04.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
The most important issue

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.681 position:7% line:83% align:start
is that we have been spared to
fight again.

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:08.716 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now all we have
to do is rescue Nadia

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.885 position:5% line:83% align:start
and defeat the flying battleship
with our cannons.

00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:14.488 position:5% line:83% align:start
-No Jean, it won't be that easy.
-Hmm?

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:17.390 position:27% line:83% align:start
Now that Gargoyle
has both Blue Waters,

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
he'll launch Red Noah
and fulfill his destiny.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:22.730 position:13% line:89% align:start
[triumphant music playing]

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:28.468 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's impossible.

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:30.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is Red Noah?

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:33.074 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Yes, this is the ship
that will restore Atlantean

00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:34.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
-control over the world.
-[gasps]

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:37.979 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Now, allow me to
guide you

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:39.714 position:16% line:89% align:start
to the other Noah's Ark.

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] Once he gets
his hands on Red Noah,

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.525 position:33% line:83% align:start
Gargoyle will
proceed with the first phase

00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.492 position:24% line:83% align:start
-of his final plan.
-What's that?

00:04:52.527 --> 00:04:55.730 position:24% line:83% align:start
I will declare war
on the entire planet.

00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:57.497 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's insanity.

00:04:57.532 --> 00:04:59.366 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Far
from it, my dear girl.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.968 position:7% line:89% align:start
There is nothing in that world

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.404 position:7% line:89% align:start
greater than glorious Red Noah.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.042 position:27% line:83% align:start
Those opposed
to it will be punished.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.611 position:21% line:89% align:start
Those pathetic humans

00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.980 position:27% line:83% align:start
could never hope
to even touch this ship.

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:17.652 position:7% line:83% align:start
The human race doesn't possess
the power to defeat Red Noah.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:19.352 position:7% line:89% align:start
But since your ship was created

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:20.922 position:21% line:83% align:start
by the super science
of Atlantis,

00:05:20.955 --> 00:05:22.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
it can overpower it.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] But this ship is
not yet perfect.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.794 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Huh?

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.130 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nemo] The main
engine is still untested.

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.430 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Electra] You must keep in mind

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:31.966 position:10% line:83% align:start
that this has been sealed in
the earth

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.467 position:13% line:89% align:start
for more than 12,000 years.

00:05:34.502 --> 00:05:36.403 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes, but if that works,

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:37.972 position:13% line:89% align:start
the ship can fly anywhere.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
-It can?
-Oh, yes, Jean.

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:43.911 position:30% line:83% align:start
An entire ship
that can fly through the sky?

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:46.479 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes. Both Red Noah and Nautilus

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:49.016 position:13% line:89% align:start
were originally spaceships.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
-They're spaceships?
-[Nemo] Yes, Jean.

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:54.922 position:13% line:83% align:start
Both ships were left behind
after the people of Atlantis

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:56.824 position:21% line:83% align:start
made their emergency
landing on Earth

00:05:56.858 --> 00:06:00.427 position:21% line:89% align:start
2,400,000 years ago.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.830 position:13% line:83% align:start
-So what you're saying is--
-Exactly.

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:05.398 position:27% line:83% align:start
The old Nautilus
was originally one, two.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:06.701 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:09.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean like the one
we saw inside Red Noah?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's correct, Jean.

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:12.974 position:19% line:89% align:start
A complete battleship.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.475 position:21% line:89% align:start
This ship, Eritrium,

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
is a light speed equipped
interstellar battleship

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.083 position:21% line:83% align:start
and is the prototype
of the old Nautilus.

00:06:22.116 --> 00:06:25.019 position:27% line:89% align:start
Eritrium? [gasps]

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.121 position:30% line:83% align:start
The name we saw
on the craftsman's name plate.

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.824 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes. That was
taken from the spaceship.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.159 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yes. Well,
even if this ship can fly,

00:06:32.193 --> 00:06:33.794 position:16% line:89% align:start
do you think it can stand

00:06:33.828 --> 00:06:35.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
any chance against that enormous
Red Noah?

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:36.998 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-hmm.

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.000 position:30% line:89% align:start
I know it can.

00:06:39.033 --> 00:06:40.668 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is a light speed

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.671 position:33% line:83% align:start
intersidereal
powerful space battleship.

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:47.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
The original meaning
of its name was Excelion.

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:50.845 position:13% line:83% align:start
Its main engine is a large
Orpheus-grade furnace

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:52.580 position:19% line:89% align:start
the same as Red Noah's.

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:55.616 position:33% line:83% align:start
So a particle
annihilation engine?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.184 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even better than that, Jean.

00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:59.486 position:33% line:83% align:start
We are using
a flywheel mechanism

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.188 position:16% line:89% align:start
as the auxiliary engine.

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:03.891 position:38% line:89% align:start
So I see.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.160 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't see why
the particle annihilation engine

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:07.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
would have any
trouble defeating Red Noah.

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:10.731 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Electra] You see,
only an Orpheus furnace

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:12.934 position:35% line:83% align:start
can defeat
an Orpheus furnace, Hanson.

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:13.834 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Hanson] Oh.
-[Jean] I understand.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:15.136 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Hanson] Whoa.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.737 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Now that you put it that way--

00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:18.005 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] Wait for me, Nadia.
-[Hanson] I get it now.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I will be
there to rescue you.

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:25.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Follow
me, Princess Nadia.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.082 position:5% line:89% align:start
I will show you around the ship.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:32.186 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your father would've
done this himself had he lived.

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.222 position:10% line:89% align:start
How do you like your attire?

00:07:35.256 --> 00:07:37.158 position:33% line:83% align:start
We took very
careful measurements

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:39.527 position:7% line:89% align:start
and made it especially for you.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.928 position:30% line:89% align:start
Do you like it?

00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:42.063 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Of course not.

00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:43.698 position:33% line:89% align:start
It shames me.

00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:45.099 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] I'm sorry.

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.568 position:13% line:89% align:start
I myself like it very much.

00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:51.005 position:24% line:89% align:start
[machine whirring]

00:07:57.745 --> 00:07:59.747 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Do
you know what this is?

00:08:01.182 --> 00:08:04.251 position:5% line:83% align:start
[gasps] It looks like a human...
preserved.

00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:06.120 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Yes.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.189 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is the first
human being assembled

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:10.958 position:13% line:89% align:start
by the ancient Atlanteans.

00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:12.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
-His name is Adam.
-Adam?

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.296 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle]
The Old Testament says

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.932 position:27% line:83% align:start
that God created
him in his own image.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It really is a human?

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:23.304 position:7% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] It's an experiment.

00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:25.740 position:24% line:83% align:start
It seems that this
was the smallest size

00:08:25.773 --> 00:08:27.308 position:16% line:89% align:start
they could make at first.

00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.076 position:30% line:83% align:start
They continued
to refine their model

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.845 position:24% line:83% align:start
until they reached
the present day size.

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:34.248 position:30% line:83% align:start
So then, humans
were always meant to--

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.583 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:08:35.616 --> 00:08:37.284 position:38% line:83% align:start
They were
created to be the servants

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.754 position:10% line:89% align:start
of the people from Atlantis.

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:45.659 position:13% line:83% align:start
It all happened almost two
and a half million years ago.

00:08:45.693 --> 00:08:48.129 position:24% line:83% align:start
When the Atlanteans
first came to Earth,

00:08:48.162 --> 00:08:50.331 position:13% line:89% align:start
they were too few in number

00:08:50.364 --> 00:08:53.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
to properly advance
their civilization.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:57.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
So they tried to make
loyal servants for themselves.

00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:58.839 position:10% line:89% align:start
They started with the whales,

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.609 position:5% line:89% align:start
which seemed fairly intelligent.

00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:03.878 position:24% line:89% align:start
That was a failure.

00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:06.714 position:16% line:83% align:start
Some of their descendants
survived to this day.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:10.017 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
They were just like Irion.

00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:11.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
You know of him, do you?

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:15.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
Next, they turned
to the primates.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.893 position:13% line:83% align:start
They allowed them a rather
high intellectual level

00:09:18.926 --> 00:09:21.962 position:13% line:83% align:start
so that their motor skills
could be used more effectively.

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:23.130 position:35% line:89% align:start
However...

00:09:23.164 --> 00:09:24.965 position:35% line:83% align:start
This time,
they made the human beings

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:28.069 position:30% line:83% align:start
to look exactly
like their Atlantean creators.

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.871 position:10% line:83% align:start
But Charles Darwin's theories
maintains that man evolved

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.873 position:7% line:89% align:start
naturally from the lower apes.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:36.710 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Electra] Jean, are you familiar
with the term missing link?

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:37.945 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Missing link?

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:39.680 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Yes.

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:42.149 position:35% line:83% align:start
It is said
that humans evolved from apes

00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:45.219 position:30% line:83% align:start
but that leads
to some important questions.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.689 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why does man
have so little hair on his body?

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.225 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why is he able to
use complicated tools?

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.927 position:13% line:89% align:start
How did he learn to speak?

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:58.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
Science still doesn't know
how to answer these questions.

00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
The link that connects
human beings to the apes,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
this link has of yet
never been discovered.

00:10:06.941 --> 00:10:09.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
If we take into account
that the Atlanteans

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.044 position:5% line:89% align:start
forged that linked themselves...

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.846 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Electra] Precisely,

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.914 position:10% line:89% align:start
then it makes perfect sense.

00:10:13.948 --> 00:10:17.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jean] But how can you make
a monkey into a man?

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:18.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
Quite simply.

00:10:18.953 --> 00:10:20.788 position:30% line:89% align:start
Through genes.

00:10:21.956 --> 00:10:23.224 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Genes?

00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:24.758 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Yes.

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.629 position:7% line:83% align:start
It is like a natural blueprint
for the creation of man.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was the ancient Atlanteans
who drew this blueprint.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:36.237 position:21% line:89% align:start
[gasps] What's this?

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.805 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah, yes.

00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:41.809 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.945 position:35% line:89% align:start
[trembles]

00:10:46.814 --> 00:10:49.183 position:21% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] These are
incomplete specimens,

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:51.385 position:24% line:89% align:start
failed experiments.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:55.356 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is truly mankind's museum
of his storied past.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:57.158 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] It's horrible.

00:10:58.359 --> 00:11:00.227 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] Do you think so?

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.663 position:35% line:83% align:start
You really
shouldn't let it upset you so.

00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:07.434 position:5% line:83% align:start
We Atlanteans are their creators
and their masters.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.437 position:21% line:89% align:start
You must realize this

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:12.773 position:7% line:89% align:start
and accept it, Princess Nadia.

00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:16.977 position:19% line:89% align:start
I will never accept it.

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.246 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.115 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, that won't do.

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:29.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's wrong Princess Nadia?

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:30.958 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't you have anything to say?

00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:33.827 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have nothing to say to you.

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Gargoyle] Hmm.
That's unfortunate.

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:38.499 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Emperor Neo]
I would like to speak with you

00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.467 position:30% line:83% align:start
so that we may
learn from each other.

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:45.072 position:7% line:83% align:start
I would rather give up my life
right here and now

00:11:45.105 --> 00:11:46.207 position:13% line:89% align:start
than to ever help you two.

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:48.809 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nadia...

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:52.112 position:27% line:83% align:start
you must not say
such sad and hurtful things.

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:57.418 position:33% line:83% align:start
You will live
with me from now on.

00:11:57.451 --> 00:11:59.486 position:7% line:89% align:start
Please don't make it difficult.

00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:03.958 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't command me! I hate you!

00:12:03.991 --> 00:12:05.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
You don't like me at all?

00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:08.530 position:27% line:83% align:start
It seems that you
like humans more than us

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:11.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
even though we are
true Atlanteans like yourself.

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:13.200 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've spent my
whole life with humans,

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.302 position:24% line:83% align:start
you just fear what
you don't understand.

00:12:15.336 --> 00:12:17.871 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Emperor Neo laughs]

00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:20.374 position:41% line:83% align:start
You say
the same things Nemo did.

00:12:20.407 --> 00:12:23.043 position:19% line:83% align:start
You have been separated
from your father a long time

00:12:23.077 --> 00:12:25.045 position:35% line:83% align:start
but you are
his daughter nonetheless.

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:27.147 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Why don't you try
to live among them?

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:29.483 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Emperor Neo] Nadia, you must
look at your beloved humans

00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:30.552 position:33% line:89% align:start
more closely.

00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:32.152 position:38% line:89% align:start
You see,

00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:35.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
they shamefully discriminate
against their own kind,

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:38.325 position:24% line:83% align:start
simply to maintain
their temporal power

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:41.228 position:7% line:89% align:start
and elusive idea of happiness.

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:43.931 position:5% line:89% align:start
If they can't accept themselves,

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:46.800 position:33% line:83% align:start
they'll never
accept an alien like you.

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:49.236 position:21% line:89% align:start
I don't believe that.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.006 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Emperor Neo] The human
race will never improve, Nadia.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:54.808 position:27% line:83% align:start
Servitude was all
they were ever equipped for.

00:12:54.842 --> 00:12:58.479 position:24% line:83% align:start
They need a strong
and unyielding master like us.

00:12:58.513 --> 00:13:00.247 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] I won't accept that.

00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:03.050 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Emperor Neo]
That is the sad reality.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:06.887 position:24% line:83% align:start
I am not interested
in living among animals.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.524 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's why you can carelessly
kill them as you do.

00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:11.526 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's why you've become
such a heartless monster!

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.028 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why you stole my Blue Water!

00:13:14.061 --> 00:13:16.430 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Gargoyle] That is incorrect.

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.567 position:16% line:83% align:start
His Majesty, the Emperor,
is the true successor

00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.068 position:24% line:89% align:start
to the Blue Water.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:23.437 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.906 position:30% line:83% align:start
I have finally
inherited my birthright,

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:28.375 position:7% line:83% align:start
-the Blue Water from my father.
-Huh?

00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:33.213 position:35% line:89% align:start
A brother?

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:40.287 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:42.122 position:27% line:89% align:start
I let you escape.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:44.425 position:5% line:89% align:start
I let you get away 13 years ago.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:47.428 position:16% line:89% align:start
[dramatic music playing]

00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:50.431 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Emperor Neo] For some reason

00:13:50.464 --> 00:13:52.466 position:7% line:89% align:start
I couldn't kill my own sister.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:59.073 position:5% line:83% align:start
It must be fate that has brought
us together again after so long.

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:02.577 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's a very sad fate.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
Since all I really wanna do
is destroy you.

00:14:05.479 --> 00:14:08.583 position:13% line:83% align:start
-That is a fruitless wish.
-Oh, it will come true.

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:11.018 position:7% line:89% align:start
You should abandon that desire,

We are trying to
lead this foolish race

in order to save them from

Ah.

if we do not step
in and take the reins.

But when you had the chance,

you yourselves destroyed
all of Atlantis

to survive

it will only bring you death.
