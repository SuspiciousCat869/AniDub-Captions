[narrator] Believing
that they were under attack

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
from the dreaded
Kings of Terror,

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.859 position:30% line:83% align:start
our heroes made
a desperate escape,

00:01:31.893 --> 00:01:34.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
only to discover
that the feared witches

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:37.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
were none other than Grandis,
Hanson, and Sanson

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.233 position:16% line:89% align:start
in an elaborate disguise.

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
Reunited in the unfamiliar
surroundings

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.706 position:19% line:89% align:start
of the strange islands,

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.643 position:13% line:83% align:start
they set about creating as
comfortable a home as possible,

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:51.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
but soon discover that
problems arise

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
even among the best of
friends,

00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
and this group was never
that friendly to begin with.

00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:58.753 position:13% line:89% align:start
What new challenges await?

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.187 position:16% line:89% align:start
Will Jean and Nadia ever

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.155 position:7% line:83% align:start
acknowledge their feelings for
each other?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.291 position:19% line:83% align:start
Or will Nadia's attempt
at cooking kill them?

00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:06.928 position:27% line:83% align:start
And what secrets
have yet to be uncovered?

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
Will our heroes solve
the greatest of all mysteries?

No, please, please, no!

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:27.180 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, it was just a dream.

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:29.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What's the matter?
-[gasps]

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.820 position:30% line:83% align:start
I am so sorry,
did I just wake you up?

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:34.187 position:10% line:89% align:start
Were you having a nightmare?

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:37.190 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, I was.

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.793 position:33% line:83% align:start
I was having
another dream about him.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.496 position:21% line:89% align:start
I've gone from being

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.398 position:13% line:83% align:start
the loveliest young lady in
the region

00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.467 position:27% line:83% align:start
to the unluckiest
woman in the world.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:50.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
I could say the very same thing
about myself, I think.

00:02:50.905 --> 00:02:53.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
Your situation is
much better than mine.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jean is a wonderful
boyfriend for you.

00:02:57.745 --> 00:02:58.946 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know that but--

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
You get to see him
every single morning.

00:03:01.883 --> 00:03:04.852 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've grown used to it but
that is a most wonderful thing.

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:06.688 position:13% line:89% align:start
My situation is different,

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.623 position:10% line:89% align:start
which should be quite evident

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.858 position:10% line:83% align:start
to anyone who lays eyes on me
these days.

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:14.629 position:10% line:83% align:start
I fell in love with someone I
should never have loved, Nadia.

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:17.532 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid the heart
is not always kind to us.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:18.900 position:19% line:89% align:start
But how can I love Jean

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:21.502 position:16% line:83% align:start
if I don't want him to be
around me all of the time?

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:24.337 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's because of
the circumstances, see,

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
one day you are going to
want him right by your side.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
But when that day comes,

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.679 position:7% line:83% align:start
he may not necessarily be able
to be there for you.

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:34.414 position:24% line:83% align:start
You have no reason
to worry, Ms. Grandis,

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:37.250 position:7% line:83% align:start
you have all of the men on this
island at your beck and call.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.522 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.490 position:30% line:83% align:start
I had my eye on
it before you did!

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:46.326 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know
I always get the last one.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.895 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've eaten enough already!

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.765 position:21% line:83% align:start
I caught the fish so
I should get to eat them, too!

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:53.835 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, well, I made the fishing
rod you caught them with,

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.604 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I also built the stove
they were cooked over!

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:58.539 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Oh, really?
-Yeah!

00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.411 position:27% line:89% align:start
Are these the men

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
you were just speaking so
glowingly about, Nadia?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.448 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:10.551 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well,
I suppose my fate is sealed.

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.854 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Ayerton]
Au contraire, Mademoiselle.

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:16.490 position:19% line:83% align:start
You see, there are two
kinds of people in this world,

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:18.626 position:19% line:89% align:start
good ones and bad ones.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.763 position:30% line:83% align:start
Would you care
for a lovely spot of tea?

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:22.830 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.502 position:10% line:89% align:start
So what kind of person am I?

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:29.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Please, allow me.
-[gasps]

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:32.305 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.408 position:13% line:83% align:start
I had no idea that you knew
how to read palms.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.713 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, I can't really but...

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:41.983 position:21% line:89% align:start
But, go on, but what?

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:44.719 position:13% line:83% align:start
It is very well-documented
that luck can change

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:47.420 position:35% line:83% align:start
for certain
special people... [chuckles]

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:50.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it depends completely
on the men around them. Huh.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.360 position:16% line:89% align:start
What a load of nonsense!

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.929 position:7% line:89% align:start
Men have nothing to do with it!

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:57.064 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Nadia sighs]

00:04:57.098 --> 00:04:59.567 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't understand them.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.903 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's happened now?

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:04.539 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, they're always getting
extremely upset

00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:06.473 position:33% line:83% align:start
over the most
trivial things.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.375 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Everyone's like that, Nadia.
-[sighs]

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.745 position:16% line:89% align:start
I never acted like that.

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.648 position:35% line:83% align:start
We do what
we have to in order to survive.

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:15.950 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You really think so?
-Man cannot live alone,

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:16.951 position:24% line:83% align:start
there are obstacles
they must overcome...

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.451 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes. But--

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.921 position:13% line:89% align:start
in order to form societies.

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:22.089 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's as natural
as anything else.

00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:23.825 position:16% line:89% align:start
In fact... [makes sound]

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:24.992 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:05:25.026 --> 00:05:26.794 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:29.864 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you use
that toothbrush every morning?

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:31.833 position:30% line:89% align:start
Why do you ask?

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
Because it's the one I use
every morning, too.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.370 position:38% line:89% align:start
[humming]

Hmph. That hurt!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.388 position:5% line:83% align:start
That will teach you to trespass,
you stupid oaf!

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:57.892 position:38% line:83% align:start
And just
who claimed that land for you?

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.961 position:7% line:89% align:start
It was claimed a long time ago.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:01.729 position:10% line:89% align:start
You better tell me what time,

00:06:01.762 --> 00:06:03.430 position:21% line:83% align:start
what day, what month,
and what year!

before you were even born!

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:15.475 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just how did you get
the dinosaurs

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.144 position:13% line:89% align:start
to settle it for you, huh?

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:18.980 position:13% line:89% align:start
I settled it all by myself.

00:06:19.013 --> 00:06:21.682 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ah, then that's exactly
how you should live!

-[laughs]
-Quiet!

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:26.020 position:41% line:83% align:start
This is
an intractable border now,

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:27.722 position:27% line:89% align:start
do not cross it!

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:29.924 position:13% line:89% align:start
But what if I fly over it?

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.126 position:13% line:89% align:start

It's beyond me,

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:39.967 position:19% line:83% align:start
why do those two insist
on acting that way?

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are they fighting again?

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:45.940 position:21% line:83% align:start
They fight constantly
like ill-bred children.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:48.910 position:13% line:89% align:start
How very childish of them.

00:06:48.943 --> 00:06:51.145 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there anything you can do
to stop them, Ms. Grandis?

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:59.419 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Grandis] Oh.
I have the worst luck with men.

The spot is so warm
you won't need firewood.

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:13.561 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's all right.
I don't wanna get burned again.

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:16.197 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear. Is that Ms. Grandis?

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.968 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wonder what she's doing there.

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:22.770 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Don't spy on her.

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:29.577 position:7% line:83% align:start
She's throwing bottled messages
into the ocean.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.613 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? She's given
that man all her heart.

00:08:32.646 --> 00:08:34.115 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:36.917 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're so insensitive. You'll
never understand a woman's soul.

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.954 position:16% line:83% align:start
How can you expect me to?
I am a boy after all.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.690 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least you could
give it a try, couldn't you?

00:08:42.723 --> 00:08:45.026 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm. [crunches]

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.627 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, delicious.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:49.697 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't nibble now
or you'll spoil your dinner.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.599 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm not going
to spoil my dinner.

00:08:51.632 --> 00:08:53.034 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wanna see what it tastes like.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:55.603 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, can I assume you like
what you taste?

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.005 position:13% line:89% align:start
[squeals] I like it a lot!

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's almost like you're
a real-life chef or something.

00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:01.942 position:27% line:89% align:start
I am most honored

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:04.578 position:10% line:83% align:start
by your enthusiastic praise,
my dear lady.

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:06.347 position:27% line:83% align:start
-I am flattered.
-[giggles]

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
Um, are you really a rich
nobleman, Mr. Ayerton, really?

00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:12.787 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.322 position:10% line:83% align:start
It seems hard to believe that
a man with a bunch of servants

00:09:15.356 --> 00:09:17.258 position:30% line:83% align:start
would learn to
cook like you can.

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:21.328 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, my upbringing taught me
what delicious meals taste like.

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:23.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
I partook of so many
wondrous meals

00:09:23.898 --> 00:09:25.966 position:27% line:83% align:start
when I was living
in England.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
Their opulent tastes
still linger on my tongue

00:09:28.836 --> 00:09:31.238 position:21% line:83% align:start
as I constantly cook
to replicate the encounter.

00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:32.907 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hmm.
-Ah.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.076 position:35% line:83% align:start
I will make
a promise to you, my dear.

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:36.877 position:19% line:89% align:start
Ah, are you ready then?

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:39.947 position:21% line:83% align:start
When you grow up and
become a beautiful young woman,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.616 position:21% line:83% align:start
I will escort you to
an exquisite dinner

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.185 position:13% line:89% align:start
fit for a princess, Marie.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:45.920 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[King screaming]

00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:51.125 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Ayerton] King?
-[Marie] King!

00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:55.629 position:5% line:89% align:start
It looks like you caught a crab.

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:58.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
Did you do decide to do
some fishing, silly boy?

00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.835 position:30% line:89% align:start
[King groaning]

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.204 position:16% line:83% align:start
What luck, it looks like
I'll be able to prepare

00:10:03.237 --> 00:10:05.406 position:38% line:83% align:start
some crab
salad after all, Marie.

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:06.974 position:10% line:89% align:start
You've been a very good boy.

00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:12.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
Everyone, this is an English
luncheon I have prepared

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.348 position:27% line:89% align:start
with great skill.

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:17.751 position:19% line:83% align:start
So I kindly implore you
to enjoy it to the fullest.

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:28.662 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why isn't anyone
eating? It's really good.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.931 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Oh, well, why not?
-Oh, well, why not?

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:32.299 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Stop mimicking me.
-Stop mimicking me.

00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:34.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both grunting]

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:40.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both shouting]

00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:42.943 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't put up with this
nonsense any longer, Hanson!

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:46.113 position:21% line:83% align:start
And I'm sick to death
of the sight of you, Sanson.

00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:47.848 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Let's fight a duel.
-Let's fight a duel.

00:10:47.882 --> 00:10:50.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait a minute, you two.
Don't get so upset.

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:54.822 position:5% line:83% align:start
We can't have any violence here.
I have an idea. A race.

00:10:54.855 --> 00:10:56.090 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Race him?
-Race him?

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:58.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
Right. That's how it's been
done

00:10:58.192 --> 00:11:00.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
throughout the annals of
history.

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
Warring nations settled
their differences

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:04.031 position:16% line:89% align:start
through sporting events.

00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:08.002 position:7% line:83% align:start
They each sent representatives
to run a race.

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.704 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's how
the Olympics were started.

00:11:10.738 --> 00:11:12.006 position:21% line:89% align:start
However, in England,

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:14.708 position:5% line:83% align:start
horse racing is the choice sport
of kings.

00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:17.912 position:13% line:83% align:start
Of course, on this island,
we are somewhat limited

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:19.880 position:33% line:83% align:start
in our choice
of suitable animals.

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.315 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:23.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
Added to which, there's
only one of them to race.

00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:26.754 position:5% line:89% align:start
And only a lion can beat a lion.

00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:30.324 position:10% line:83% align:start
So Hanson will have to build
his own King to enter the race.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:32.259 position:7% line:89% align:start
Now, just hold it right there.

00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:34.762 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why am I the one
who has to build a lion?

00:11:35.496 --> 00:11:37.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
So that we can achieve
a proper balance here.

00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:39.333 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Proper balance?
-Right.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.269 position:7% line:83% align:start
See, you will use your strength
to train King,

00:11:42.303 --> 00:11:44.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
and Hanson will use his
scientific knowledge

00:11:44.872 --> 00:11:47.041 position:7% line:89% align:start
to construct a mechanical King.

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:49.009 position:16% line:83% align:start
And then we'll all get to
watch them fight it out.

00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:50.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Oh, I get it now.
-Oh, I get it now.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:53.814 position:7% line:83% align:start
So you both must stop fighting
in front of the children.

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:56.383 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, yes.

00:11:56.417 --> 00:11:59.053 position:7% line:83% align:start
We must teach them that there's
always a peaceful way

00:11:59.086 --> 00:12:01.355 position:38% line:83% align:start
to settle
an argument, isn't that right?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.072 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
Good morning, Nadia.

00:12:18.105 --> 00:12:19.373 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:20.908 position:19% line:89% align:start
What are you drinking?

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:22.076 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, just a little milk.

00:12:22.876 --> 00:12:23.911 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:26.180 position:30% line:89% align:start
[goat bleating]

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.318 position:38% line:83% align:start
Where did
you find this, around here?

00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:33.521 position:21% line:83% align:start
I found it wandering
around in the woods,

00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:35.189 position:13% line:89% align:start
but don't you tell anyone.

00:12:37.825 --> 00:12:40.961 position:16% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Why can't I tell?

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:44.198 position:7% line:83% align:start
Because the others will eat her
if they find her here.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.432 position:30% line:89% align:start
They'd eat her?

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:48.068 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes. Because that's the way
they always are.

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:50.337 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not always.

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:53.173 position:7% line:83% align:start
I don't think they'd wanna kill
the goat because if they did,

00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:54.942 position:33% line:83% align:start
they wouldn't
get to drink her milk.

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:56.176 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.112 position:33% line:83% align:start
Do you really
believe they'd let it live?

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:00.814 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Hey, what are you two doing?

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:04.552 position:5% line:89% align:start
See, he's looking for some food.

00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:06.453 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow. I've never seen that goat--

00:13:06.487 --> 00:13:09.524 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's not here for you
to roast up and eat, Jean.

00:13:09.557 --> 00:13:11.158 position:33% line:83% align:start
Did you catch
that all by yourself?

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:13.561 position:27% line:83% align:start
I didn't have to
catch it as you put it.

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:15.963 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're good friends, right?

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:18.132 position:33% line:89% align:start
[goat bleats]

00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:19.300 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hah.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:21.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nadia, really?

00:13:21.035 --> 00:13:24.071 position:7% line:83% align:start
I will never, ever forgive you
if you try to eat it, Jean.

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:25.573 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's amazing!

00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:28.242 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, you really can communicate
with animals, huh?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Well, it's just
something

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:36.016 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've learned to do
over time.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.420 position:19% line:83% align:start
It first happened when
I was four or five years old.

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:41.989 position:27% line:83% align:start
I was in the back
of a circus wagon,

00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:44.458 position:33% line:83% align:start
traveling to
another performance.

00:13:45.593 --> 00:13:47.861 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[bellowing]
-Huh?

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.930 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:56.170 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I saw my
friend Smokey taken away.

00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:00.575 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was because they thought
he was too old to work.

00:14:00.608 --> 00:14:02.876 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[distant mooing]
-[gasps]

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.947 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] He cried all the way
begging them not to kill him.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.848 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:11.385 --> 00:14:13.588 position:5% line:83% align:start
But there was nothing I could do
for my friend.

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:15.189 position:24% line:89% align:start
And since that day,

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:19.026 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can understand
what animals say.

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.894 position:30% line:89% align:start
I had no idea.

00:14:21.663 --> 00:14:24.465 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, that's why
you don't eat meat like we do?

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:27.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
For everyone else, they're
just another source of food.

00:14:27.468 --> 00:14:30.304 position:10% line:83% align:start
But to me, it's like watching
the murder of a friend.

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:32.507 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, I'm so sorry for you.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
It doesn't mean
the same to you

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:36.076 position:33% line:83% align:start
