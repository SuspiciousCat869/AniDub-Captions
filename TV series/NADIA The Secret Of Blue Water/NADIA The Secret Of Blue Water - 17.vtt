[narrator]
The Nautilus crew

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
returned to Atlantis

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.357 position:7% line:89% align:start
to bury their fallen comrades.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.794 position:33% line:83% align:start
While there,
Jean found out that his father

00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:34.428 position:13% line:89% align:start
was killed by the Garfish.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.129 position:10% line:89% align:start
He decides that he will stay

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:37.364 position:24% line:89% align:start
aboard the Nautilus

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
and see their journey
to the end,

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.469 position:21% line:83% align:start
but who will tell him
the secret of Blue Water?

Oh, pardon me.

[Grandis laughing]

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:24.378 position:13% line:89% align:start
Now look here, Ms. Grandis!

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.914 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just what do you think
you're doing out here?

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:29.751 position:21% line:83% align:start
Having a much better
time than you, huh.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:31.552 position:7% line:89% align:start
While you are aboard this ship,

00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:33.755 position:30% line:83% align:start
you must follow
the daily exercise regimen.

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:35.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:40.427 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can't be bothered to engage
in your childish contortions.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.430 position:33% line:83% align:start
Beauty needs
only rest and proper pampering.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.833 position:13% line:83% align:start
I certainly can understand
your aversion

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:47.434 position:21% line:89% align:start
to regular exercise.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.270 position:13% line:83% align:start
With so much extra weight,
it must be tiring.

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.773 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.641 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, you do this every day

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.410 position:10% line:83% align:start
and it still has done nothing
for those hips of yours, dear.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.445 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
What was that?

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Grandis]
You heard me.

[electric zapping]

00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:06.453 position:44% line:83% align:start
[all]
One, two, three, four,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.388 position:35% line:89% align:start
five, six.

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:10.223 position:38% line:89% align:start
One, two.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.526 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
It feels good

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.260 position:19% line:89% align:start
to stretch your muscles

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.762 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the sea air,
don't you think?

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:16.363 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Most definitely.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:17.598 position:27% line:83% align:start
Even the Nautilus
can feel cramped

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:18.966 position:24% line:89% align:start
after a long haul.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.434 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
I haven't heard you complain

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
about being on board
in quite a while.

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:24.337 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Really? I guess I'm getting

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.807 position:10% line:89% align:start
used to the sea-faring life.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.307 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
Even though we still eat

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.776 position:7% line:89% align:start
nothing but fish at every meal?

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.911 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Hmm. I hadn't given

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:31.378 position:16% line:89% align:start
that much thought lately.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.780 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
I remember when you used to

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:34.347 position:33% line:89% align:start
keep me awake

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.517 position:27% line:83% align:start
complaining about
the earaches you'd get

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.452 position:30% line:83% align:start
from traveling
underwater.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:39.821 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
Oh, well, I guess my ears

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:40.988 position:13% line:89% align:start
got used to the ship, too.

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:42.957 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[all] Whoa.
-[Sanson] Huh?

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.826 position:44% line:83% align:start
[man]
Excellent.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.260 position:10% line:89% align:start
[all cheering and applauding]

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.664 position:7% line:89% align:start
Nadia's getting back to normal.

00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.699 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yes. She acts like a kid now.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:55.770 position:21% line:83% align:start
-So tell me, Hanson.
-Hmm?

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.638 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ms. Electra?

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.675 position:19% line:83% align:start
What about her, Sanson?
What's up?

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:04.344 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, do you want me to tell you
how to get closer to her?

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:05.680 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, I don't--

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:08.549 position:13% line:83% align:start
I have years of experience
in this field

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
and the best strategy
is a full attack.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.021 position:10% line:83% align:start
That doesn't sound too nice.
Attack?

00:04:14.055 --> 00:04:16.356 position:21% line:89% align:start
Attack. Love is war.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to be bold,
be aggressive,

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:22.029 position:10% line:83% align:start
you must approach your target
actively and quite positively.

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:24.665 position:7% line:89% align:start
A do or die spirit is required.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.035 position:7% line:83% align:start
Do not give up until the prize
is in your tenure.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.905 position:27% line:89% align:start
[water splashes]

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.673 position:10% line:89% align:start
How do I make the first move?

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:33.908 position:33% line:89% align:start
With flowers.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.544 position:38% line:89% align:start
Flowers?

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:37.745 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.380 position:24% line:83% align:start
Flowers break down
a woman's resistance.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:42.750 position:27% line:83% align:start
But there aren't
any flower shops

00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:44.417 position:19% line:89% align:start
aboard this submarine.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then I guess you'll
have to make some.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.622 position:35% line:89% align:start
Make some?

00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:48.856 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.826 position:21% line:83% align:start
You have to make them
with your own two hands!

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:53.828 position:38% line:89% align:start
But--hmm.

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.563 position:30% line:89% align:start
[electric zaps]

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.598 position:41% line:83% align:start
[both]
Mm-hmm.

00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:58.599 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sonar]
Wait up.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.969 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What is it, Eiko?

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:05.640 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jean, how would you like
to be a part of a fan club?

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:06.974 position:38% line:89% align:start
Fan club?

00:05:07.008 --> 00:05:10.410 position:30% line:83% align:start
The Ikoli Club
in honor of the ship's nurse.

00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:13.413 position:10% line:89% align:start
Every member gets this photo

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.717 position:13% line:89% align:start
and also a membership card.

00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:17.618 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who belongs to it?

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:20.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all laugh]

00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:24.391 position:16% line:89% align:start
She certainly is popular.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.927 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, Jean, you want to join?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, I'd like to.

00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.664 position:30% line:89% align:start
But what is it?

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:32.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm a fan of Nadia.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.602 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hmm, so what?

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:36.403 position:38% line:89% align:start
So what?

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:38.438 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't have two girls
at the same time.

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:44.111 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen up, Jean, because
I'm gonna give you some advice.

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.882 position:33% line:83% align:start
That is that,
and this is this.

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.117 position:30% line:89% align:start
Which is which?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.122 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know, you're just a kid.

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:57.490 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm a lot more
than just a kid, Eiko.

00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:58.726 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just look at yourself,

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.962 position:16% line:83% align:start
starting a silly fan club
for a ship's nurse,

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:02.797 position:16% line:83% align:start
a club I won't be joining
by the way!

00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:04.665 position:38% line:89% align:start
Goodbye!

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:05.933 position:33% line:89% align:start
[door slams]

00:06:05.967 --> 00:06:07.101 position:24% line:89% align:start
What's eating him?

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:12.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Have you noticed that
the crew is acting a lot nicer

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.542 position:10% line:89% align:start
to us since we left Atlantis?

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:17.410 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, but I think that's
because they feel sorry for us.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:18.813 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:21.515 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's typical grown-up behavior,
if you ask me.

00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:22.683 position:35% line:89% align:start
Grown-ups.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:25.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
All they ever do is treat me
like a child.

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:26.754 position:21% line:89% align:start
But you are a child.

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:28.656 position:35% line:89% align:start
Is that so?

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
A child is not able to make
its own decisions, is it?

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:32.860 position:35% line:89% align:start
Like what?

00:06:32.894 --> 00:06:34.996 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, for one thing--

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.496 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] I found you!
-Huh?

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.199 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.101 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now, it's Jean's turn
to be it.

00:06:40.134 --> 00:06:41.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Darn.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:44.572 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Well, hurry!
-[Jean] I will, Marie.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:47.041 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] You'll never find us.
-[Jean grunts]

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.077 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ready or not.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:51.946 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Marie]
Wait! Don't look for us yet.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.516 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's much more
to being a grown-up, Jean.

Well, what do you want?

00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:02.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
I-I have an important
request, Captain.

This, I cannot do, Jean.

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:17.204 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is it because I'm too young?

00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.875 position:27% line:83% align:start
Not at all.
I won't allow you to kill.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:22.076 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:22.109 --> 00:07:23.711 position:35% line:89% align:start
You see...

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:27.248 position:10% line:83% align:start
the reason we fight this war
is to prevent someone like you

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
from having to fight
and kill other people.

Electra, would you
do me a favor?

00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:45.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you explain that
to Captain Nemo,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.269 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you can persuade him
to change his mind.

[Electra]
That, I cannot do.

But why not?

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
Captain Nemo made
a wise decision.

00:07:56.177 --> 00:07:58.145 position:30% line:83% align:start
I won't ask him
to reconsider it.

[Grandis] Are you sure
that's what you want?

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:12.793 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sure, I'm sure.

00:08:12.827 --> 00:08:15.596 position:10% line:83% align:start
I already asked Captain Nemo
and Electra directly.

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.099 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, and what did they tell you?

00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:21.602 position:33% line:89% align:start
They said no.

00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:23.037 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah, that's what I thought.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.306 position:13% line:89% align:start
But it is really important

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.975 position:16% line:83% align:start
that I become an official
member of the Nautilus crew!

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:29.610 position:16% line:89% align:start
Can't you please help me?

00:08:29.643 --> 00:08:31.712 position:38% line:83% align:start

There's nothing we can do.

00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:33.781 position:27% line:89% align:start
Jean, think hard.

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:35.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
You're going about it
the wrong way.

Huh?

00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:38.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it really means
that much to you,

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:40.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
you're going to have
to keep pressing Captain Nemo

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
and Electra until they realize
your usefulness.

Um, not really.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.372 position:21% line:83% align:start
and appears much more
interested in diagrams

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:26.974 position:10% line:89% align:start
than in pretty little girls.

00:13:27.007 --> 00:13:28.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, you'd better get
back to work now.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:31.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
You don't know what
you're talking about!

00:13:32.012 --> 00:13:33.113 position:33% line:89% align:start
I don't know.

00:13:33.147 --> 00:13:35.082 position:24% line:89% align:start
[stomach growling]

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.585 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hmm, I must be hungrier
than I thought.

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:41.221 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, is there anything
left to eat over there?

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:43.223 position:30% line:83% align:start
Have you looked
at the clock lately?

00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:44.626 position:47% line:89% align:start
No.

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:46.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you think Ms. Grandis
has gone to bed yet?

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:48.962 position:16% line:89% align:start
You chose to skip dinner,

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:51.165 position:27% line:83% align:start
so you'll have to
make your own meal tonight.

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:54.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't do that.
I-I don't know how to cook.

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:56.370 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:13:56.403 --> 00:13:59.306 position:7% line:83% align:start
At home, my auntie always used
to prepare my meals for me.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.510 position:7% line:83% align:start
Besides, all of your meals have
been prepared by someone else.

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:07.481 position:21% line:83% align:start
Jean, you have lived
a very sheltered life, my boy.

00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:09.450 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you making fun of me now?

00:14:10.518 --> 00:14:12.654 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I'm just envious.

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:15.889 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Listen, me and Sanson,

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:17.559 position:30% line:83% align:start
we have had to
fend for ourselves

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:19.360 position:10% line:89% align:start
since we were just children.

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:22.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
We had to find our own food
and clothing.

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:25.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you want to know
why that was?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.001 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'll tell you why,

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.504 position:21% line:83% align:start
because if we didn't,
we'd have died.

00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:32.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
If you're not a child,

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:35.976 position:27% line:83% align:start
go to the kitchen
and learn how to feed yourself.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.085 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:48.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
I acted a bit out
of character there.

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:49.557 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:53.661 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's going on?
And at this time of night?

00:14:53.695 --> 00:14:56.531 position:21% line:89% align:start
[indistinct chatter]

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.636 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, now I get it. Huh?

00:15:01.669 --> 00:15:04.104 position:30% line:89% align:start
OK. It's ready.

00:15:04.138 --> 00:15:05.472 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh!

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:08.375 position:27% line:83% align:start
This small token
is just cheap paper refuse

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:10.377 position:35% line:83% align:start
compared to
your incomparable beauty,

00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:12.413 position:27% line:83% align:start
but my shy heart
begs me to offer it.

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:15.583 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, please accept it.

00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:19.521 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:15:19.554 --> 00:15:20.988 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
Sanson!

00:15:21.723 --> 00:15:24.626 position:24% line:83% align:start
What are you doing
with my flower?

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:27.227 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh, I was just
giving them a test run

00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:28.630 position:21% line:83% align:start
to see if they worked
on the ladies

00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:29.731 position:7% line:89% align:start
like I--uh, you wanted them to.

00:15:29.764 --> 00:15:33.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[grunts]
Just testing them out?

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.536 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ah! No!

00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.638 position:21% line:89% align:start
I didn't mean it--oh!

00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:37.539 position:35% line:89% align:start
[men grunt]

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:40.708 position:47% line:89% align:start
No!

00:15:40.742 --> 00:15:43.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
You all are taking what
I'm saying the wrong way.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.946 position:21% line:89% align:start
[indistinct chatter]

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.718 position:38% line:83% align:start
Stop it!
What is all the ruckus?

00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:53.521 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:55.088 position:24% line:83% align:start
All of the sailors
have come to pester

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
my granddaughter again.

00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:59.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, if you need
medical attention,

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:00.662 position:16% line:89% align:start
let me see your injuries.

00:16:00.695 --> 00:16:01.596 position:44% line:89% align:start
See?

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:06.133 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hmm. This looks serious.

00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:08.202 position:24% line:89% align:start
How did it happen?

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:11.405 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, um... [laughs]

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:15.075 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[Marie] Where are you going?
-What?

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:17.512 position:33% line:83% align:start
You made Jean
something to eat, didn't you?

00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:20.380 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess Nadia really
has eyes for Jean.

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.015 position:27% line:89% align:start
That's ludicrous.

00:16:22.817 --> 00:16:24.752 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't hide what
we already know.

00:16:24.786 --> 00:16:27.287 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's natural for people in love

00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.557 position:30% line:83% align:start
to be together
as much as possible.

00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:31.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
Enough, Marie!

00:16:31.492 --> 00:16:33.460 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wherever did you learn
such silly things?

00:16:33.494 --> 00:16:34.729 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ms. Grandis.

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:36.564 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Grandis sneezes]
Hmm?

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.767 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
That woman,

00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:41.636 position:24% line:83% align:start
she's always up to
something devious.

00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:44.004 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:48.776 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where is he going now?

00:16:54.716 --> 00:16:55.750 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jean.

00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:58.085 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia.

00:16:58.118 --> 00:16:59.654 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Nadia]
I was looking for you,

00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:02.089 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I never expected
to find you here.

00:17:02.122 --> 00:17:03.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Well, when I have
a problem to solve,

00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:05.560 position:16% line:89% align:start
I come in here to think.

00:17:05.593 --> 00:17:07.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] That's probably because
you feel more at home

00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:10.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
-surrounded by machinery.
-[Jean] You think so?

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.634 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] Oh, my.
I forgot all about your snack.

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.271 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:17:17.304 --> 00:17:18.640 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's so rude.

00:17:18.673 --> 00:17:21.341 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to make that?

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:25.045 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, oh, of course.
Thank you so much.

00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:26.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
Eat it all up.

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:28.148 position:21% line:89% align:start
[nervously chuckles]

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:34.556 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hmm. So, what is this thing?

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.526 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[Jean] It's a ship's engine.
-[Nadia] It is?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes. It's a particle
annihilator.

00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.196 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.699 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
I wish I knew.

00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:47.401 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's far beyond the science
of the 19th century.

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.470 position:24% line:83% align:start
And it's certainly
beyond my understanding.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:17:53.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hmm, impressive.

00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:56.376 position:19% line:83% align:start
[Jean] If it fell into
ordinary hands,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
it would be used as a power
source to kill people.

00:18:00.582 --> 00:18:02.482 position:33% line:83% align:start
That is what
Captain Nemo told me.

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
I find it really sad
that the world

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.522 position:30% line:83% align:start
of the grownups
has to work that way.

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:09.591 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:18:09.624 --> 00:18:12.794 position:7% line:89% align:start
I-I don't want to be an adult.

00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:14.796 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wish I could
be one right now.

00:18:14.829 --> 00:18:15.663 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:19.366 position:30% line:83% align:start
Dreams are hard
to realize as a child.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.202 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can only spend our time
chasing them.

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.571 position:30% line:89% align:start
When I grow up,

00:18:23.605 --> 00:18:26.406 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll be able to make my dreams
come true myself.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.275 position:10% line:89% align:start
The best part of adulthood is

00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.477 position:16% line:83% align:start
having the power to make
your hopes reality.

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.347 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Hanson]
These-These are for you.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.416 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh, are you quite sure those
are for me?

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.852 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, miss.

00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:40.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
It-It was hard getting the
coloring right.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.389 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, you made these?

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:44.424 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Y-Yes.
-Thank you!

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
These will certainly
brighten up my dull quarters.

00:18:46.894 --> 00:18:49.831 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh, would you--would you--uh--

00:18:49.864 --> 00:18:51.365 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:52.800 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll give some to Captain Nemo,

00:18:52.834 --> 00:18:53.901 position:21% line:89% align:start
if that's all right.

00:18:53.935 --> 00:18:55.302 position:44% line:89% align:start
Nemo?

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:57.170 position:13% line:89% align:start
The captain is really such

00:18:57.204 --> 00:18:59.373 position:7% line:89% align:start
a flower aficionado, you know.

00:18:59.406 --> 00:19:01.274 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, oh, I didn't know that.

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:04.545 position:13% line:89% align:start
Then give him some for me.

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.881 position:24% line:89% align:start
[laughs nervously]

00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:08.650 position:38% line:83% align:start
[Sanson]
And so you walked away

00:19:08.683 --> 00:19:10.551 position:7% line:89% align:start
without saying anything, right?

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:13.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Mm-hmm.
-What an amateur!

00:19:13.253 --> 00:19:15.489 position:21% line:83% align:start
What happened to your
do or die spirit?

00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.425 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't need it.

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.861 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:19:19.894 --> 00:19:23.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
I-I don't want to do or die,
OK?

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.201 position:16% line:89% align:start
You may call me a coward,

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:30.938 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I'd rather
sit back and wait.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.675 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:37.512 position:10% line:83% align:start
This is where the problem is,
in the variable unit.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.781 position:21% line:89% align:start
What should I do now?

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:43.685 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't figure
this out myself.

00:19:44.786 --> 00:19:46.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have to do this entirely
on your own.

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:49.489 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, Jean, I want to fly again.

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:51.826 position:24% line:83% align:start
Adults are supposed
to give advice to children.

00:19:53.561 --> 00:19:54.696 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Children, eh?

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:57.865 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's it!

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:01.502 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Come in.
-Well, I was hoping to ask

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:04.237 position:7% line:83% align:start
your advice on a little problem
I have, Hanson.

00:20:04.271 --> 00:20:06.708 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hmm, of course.

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:10.277 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, you should have
come to me long ago, young man.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.446 position:30% line:83% align:start
Don't act like
you won't help me.

00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:16.784 position:27% line:83% align:start
See, the problem
is inside the variable unit.

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:18.820 position:16% line:89% align:start
All right. Show it to me.

00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:20.621 position:44% line:89% align:start
This?

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:22.724 position:7% line:83% align:start
Oh, why don't you try changing
the shape of the cam?

00:20:22.757 --> 00:20:24.257 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Jean] The shape?
Oh, I see!

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kid, you must have
finally realized

00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:27.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
what you can and can't
do by yourself.

00:20:27.762 --> 00:20:29.362 position:35% line:83% align:start
That means
you're almost a man.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:30.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Jean]
Yes! That solves it!

00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:34.769 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[man 1] Hmm. Interesting.
-[man 2] Oh, right.

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:37.505 position:24% line:89% align:start
Look at that! Jean?

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:41.374 position:21% line:89% align:start
[indistinct chatter]

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:43.945 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You did it, Jean!
-[Jean] Yes! Thank you!

00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:45.580 position:24% line:89% align:start
Something is wrong.

00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:47.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no balloon
or wings on it.

00:20:47.515 --> 00:20:48.850 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you sure it can fly?

00:20:48.883 --> 00:20:51.586 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't worry.
This one is all worked out.

00:20:51.619 --> 00:20:54.454 position:24% line:83% align:start
But so are the ones
that crashed.

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:55.823 position:21% line:89% align:start
Those were different.

00:20:55.857 --> 00:20:58.760 position:10% line:83% align:start
I had some expert assistance
when I built this one.

00:20:58.793 --> 00:21:01.662 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-Can I fly, too?

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:04.832 position:13% line:83% align:start
I think we should let them
be alone on this flight, Marie.

00:21:04.866 --> 00:21:07.034 position:16% line:89% align:start
So they can be all mushy?

00:21:07.068 --> 00:21:08.503 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's right, dear.

00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:10.705 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Well, climb in.
-OK.

Ready for takeoff.

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:25.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Jean, is this safe?
-Just don't worry.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.755 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go.

-Take off!

Come on!

Jean, take 'em away!

00:21:50.678 --> 00:21:52.980 position:21% line:83% align:start
-You can do it, Jean!
-Right!

00:21:53.748 --> 00:21:55.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
Lift off!

Let's fly! Yeah!

[all cheering]

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.836 position:27% line:89% align:start
We made it! Hah!

00:22:14.869 --> 00:22:16.904 position:33% line:83% align:start
We're flying!
We're really flying!

You see? Like I said, it works!

00:22:19.941 --> 00:22:22.109 position:35% line:83% align:start
Yes, Jean,
you're definitely a genius.

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:29.684 position:33% line:83% align:start
Well I'll be,
that is one sharp kid.

He really did it!

Well, I think
he's become a man today.

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:34.956 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:36.958 position:38% line:83% align:start
Oh, Jean,
you really did it!

this feels wonderful!

I've never been
this close to a cloud before.

00:22:53.674 --> 00:22:56.443 position:7% line:83% align:start
[gasps] I can almost reach out
and touch them!

Do you want to go into them?

-Huh?
-[Jean laughs]

Jean, I can't see anything!

00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:07.154 position:35% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Now,
you can see everything.

00:23:08.556 --> 00:23:10.524 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Nadia.
-[Nadia] Yes, Jean?

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:12.994 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jean] I can see something
very clearly now.

-[Nadia] What?
-The difference between

the Jean I was
and the Jean I will be now.

00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.100 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm going to study science

00:23:20.735 --> 00:23:22.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
and learn about life
in the grown-up world.

00:23:22.737 --> 00:23:25.539 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm going to learn
about everything everywhere.

And even though
this little craft

00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:30.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
won't be able to take us
all the way there,

00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:34.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have every confidence
that one day

00:23:34.548 --> 00:23:37.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
when I have become
a man who can look after you,

00:23:37.251 --> 00:23:39.720 position:21% line:83% align:start
I promise I will take
you to Africa.
