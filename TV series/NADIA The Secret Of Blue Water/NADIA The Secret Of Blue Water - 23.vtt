[narrator] What an adventure
it has been thus far.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.738 position:16% line:83% align:start
It all started when Jean
met Nadia

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
at the World Exposition
in Paris.

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:50.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
At the time, she was pursued
by ruthless jewel thieves

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:54.147 position:10% line:83% align:start
who wanted to get their hands
on her gem, the Blue Water.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.584 position:30% line:83% align:start
After a daring
escape in Jean's airplane

00:01:56.618 --> 00:02:00.187 position:21% line:83% align:start
and a terrifying stay
on an American battleship,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.758 position:10% line:83% align:start
our heroes and villains were
stranded on a strange island.

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.628 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jean and Nadia made
a new friend in young Marie,

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
who was soon captured along
with Nadia by the evil Gargoyle.

00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:13.200 position:13% line:83% align:start
The wicked man showed Nadia
his new weapon,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.502 position:24% line:89% align:start
the Tower of Babel,

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.705 position:7% line:83% align:start
which was capable of destroying
an entire island.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.575 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jean rescued Nadia
from Gargoyle's clutches

00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:22.577 position:13% line:89% align:start
and the villain's compound

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.580 position:7% line:83% align:start
was destroyed by Captain Nemo's
submarine, Nautilus.

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:33.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jean and the others boarded
the Nautilus where Grandis

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
promptly fell in love
with the reticent captain.

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:39.393 position:30% line:83% align:start
Nemo and Nadia
seem destined to meet

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:41.929 position:10% line:83% align:start
as the captain also possessed
the Blue Water Gem.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:46.968 position:5% line:83% align:start
And so they began their new life
aboard the Nautilus

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.271 position:24% line:83% align:start
trying to fit into
the very strange environment.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.809 position:5% line:83% align:start
After surviving attacks of every
sort and losing close friends,

00:02:54.842 --> 00:03:00.748 position:7% line:83% align:start
the Nautilus was challenged by
a Neo Atlantean air battleship.

00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:02.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
After a dreadful midair siege

00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:05.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
that tore the submarine
to shreds

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.354 position:19% line:83% align:start
and caused Grandis and
her boys

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.691 position:21% line:83% align:start
to be hurled towards
the horizon,

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:14.729 position:10% line:83% align:start
the mighty Nautilus was sunk
by Gargoyle's hideous invention.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:18.265 position:10% line:83% align:start
Nadia soon learned that Nemo
had caused the destruction of

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.634 position:21% line:89% align:start
his beloved homeland

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.369 position:33% line:83% align:start
and had vowed
to destroy Gargoyle

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:26.674 position:30% line:83% align:start
and his liege,
Emperor Neo, at all cost.

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:30.545 position:13% line:83% align:start
However, Nemo's reluctance
to give Nadia's life for victory

00:03:30.578 --> 00:03:33.380 position:30% line:83% align:start
led to betrayal
from his first officer, Electra,

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:37.719 position:33% line:83% align:start
who revealed
that Nemo was Nadia's father.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:41.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
As Nemo released the children
from the embattled submarine,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:44.859 position:33% line:83% align:start
he told Nadia
only one thing. Live.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.227 position:13% line:89% align:start
And so our story continues.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.965 position:27% line:89% align:start

you took leave of the books.

It is such a beautiful day.

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:54.015 position:33% line:83% align:start
It is because
the captain is a good man.

Perhaps I have said too much.

He was already badly injured.

pointed right at you, Nadia.

-what will happen to us then?
-Huh?

We're trapped

and we don't know where
we're going.

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:18.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
We might sink to
the bottom of the sea and drown

us if we ever reach the surface.

If those books are such a help,

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.140 position:7% line:83% align:start
then they should get us out of
this mess.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.109 position:35% line:83% align:start

We must open that hatch.

[Nadia] What?

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:20.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
But opening the hatch will
let even more water rush in.

Even Marie and King here

No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.420 position:10% line:89% align:start
If we let the water rush in,

00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:28.255 position:10% line:83% align:start
then the rest of the air will
rush out

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:30.758 position:19% line:89% align:start
at the exact same time.

-Then what?
-Then this.

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.129 position:7% line:89% align:start
Air is much lighter than water

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:37.965 position:19% line:83% align:start
so it will rise towards
the surface immediately.

00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:42.236 position:16% line:83% align:start
We can catch the escaping
air bubbles under the umbrella

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:43.904 position:21% line:89% align:start
and hold on tightly.

00:11:43.938 --> 00:11:45.507 position:13% line:83% align:start
The air will push anything
in front of it

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.274 position:5% line:89% align:start
towards the surface as it rises.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.877 position:30% line:83% align:start
Therefore, with
the air pushing the umbrella

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.180 position:19% line:83% align:start
and us attached to it,
we'll be up above in no time.

I really do envy Hanson.

00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:31.713 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish I could invent
something useful for once.

00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:35.415 position:7% line:83% align:start
There are a lot more important
things in life than inventions.

[stomach rumbles]

[Nadia] I'm so hungry.

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:48.863 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] We should try to find
something to eat soon

00:18:48.896 --> 00:18:49.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
before it gets dark.

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:56.470 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's too far.

00:19:00.608 --> 00:19:04.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
We'll starve to death, and
that's the saddest thing of all.

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:07.247 position:30% line:83% align:start
I got it. Marie
and King could...

-[both] Hmm?
-Boat! There's a boat!

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:15.188 position:13% line:83% align:start
-There's a boat over there.
-Where?

00:19:15.222 --> 00:19:17.224 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Jean] Right there.

00:19:17.257 --> 00:19:19.159 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all] Hey!

00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:23.665 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:29.336 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.676 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's just no use because
there's no way they can hear us.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:36.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
You give up far
too easily, Nadia.

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:38.178 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch this.

00:19:39.647 --> 00:19:42.684 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

[dramatic music playing]

00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:23.658 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm so hungry.

00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:24.792 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:20:29.429 --> 00:20:31.032 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Marie] Here.

00:20:31.065 --> 00:20:34.367 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look, it's rations
from the captain's cabin.

00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:36.904 position:7% line:89% align:start
Where did you get that, Marie?

00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:38.573 position:24% line:89% align:start
I brought it over.

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:41.475 position:13% line:89% align:start
[both] How did you do that?

00:20:41.509 --> 00:20:42.342 position:38% line:89% align:start
I walked.

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:44.545 position:30% line:89% align:start
[both] But how?

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Marie] See, Jean,
we can walk right to it.

00:20:51.986 --> 00:20:53.221 position:19% line:89% align:start
The tide has gone out.

00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:55.923 position:41% line:89% align:start
Lucky.

00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:02.864 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, problem.

00:21:02.897 --> 00:21:04.866 position:33% line:89% align:start
What problem?

00:21:04.899 --> 00:21:06.768 position:13% line:89% align:start
We don't have a can opener.

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:08.703 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, I don't care.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:10.303 position:7% line:89% align:start
I couldn't eat any of the food

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:12.006 position:33% line:83% align:start
they kept on
the Nautilus anyway.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:14.842 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, but we're
going to starve to death.

00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:18.713 position:16% line:89% align:start
Jean, King can open them.

00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:21.582 position:27% line:89% align:start
I don't see how.

00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:26.988 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

good for your insides, King.

-Oh, King.
-The food is for us all.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
Okay. Let's eat.

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:06.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
You had more than enough to eat,
didn't you, boy?

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:07.862 position:24% line:89% align:start
You did a good job.

00:22:07.895 --> 00:22:10.932 position:38% line:89% align:start
[whines]

00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:16.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jean] This is okay
for you to eat, Nadia.

00:22:16.904 --> 00:22:18.773 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but what is it?

00:22:18.806 --> 00:22:21.542 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's a whole can
of chopped and fried potatoes.

00:22:21.576 --> 00:22:23.010 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

Delicious. [chuckles]

-Do you think so?
-Yes.

00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:32.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
But that is the very same
seasoning

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.789 position:13% line:89% align:start
that they use on the meat.

00:22:34.822 --> 00:22:37.825 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who cares? I'm not opposed
to eating the seasoning, Jean,

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:39.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
just the flesh of animals.

00:22:39.126 --> 00:22:40.628 position:13% line:89% align:start
[Jean] So I guess it's just

00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:42.429 position:16% line:83% align:start
all a matter of like and
dislike then?

00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:43.664 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Marie] That's right.

00:22:43.698 --> 00:22:45.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
[all] Likes and dislikes!
Likes and dislikes!

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.101 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Never mind.

[dramatic music playing]

00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:07.420 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't step on it.

00:23:07.454 --> 00:23:08.890 position:21% line:89% align:start
What is all of this?

00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:11.592 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm trying to figure out
the location of this island

00:23:11.626 --> 00:23:13.127 position:7% line:89% align:start
from the position of the stars.

00:23:16.097 --> 00:23:18.032 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Nadia.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.873 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's okay.
You don't need to do that, Jean.

00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:28.509 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

00:23:29.744 --> 00:23:31.879 position:16% line:83% align:start
We are the only ones
on this entire island.

00:23:31.913 --> 00:23:33.915 position:13% line:89% align:start
There's no evil around here

00:23:33.948 --> 00:23:36.183 position:19% line:83% align:start
and there are no people
that I hate around me.

00:23:37.685 --> 00:23:39.720 position:33% line:83% align:start
If Marie and
King are by my side,

00:23:39.754 --> 00:23:42.156 position:16% line:83% align:start
then I can spend the rest
of my life on this island.

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:45.059 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nadia...

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:51.431 position:30% line:89% align:start
what about me?
