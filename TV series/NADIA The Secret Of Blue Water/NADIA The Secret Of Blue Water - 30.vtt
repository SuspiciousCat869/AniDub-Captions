[narrator]
Life on the deserted island

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
just gets more and more
bizarre,

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.793 position:19% line:83% align:start
but who would have ever
thought of

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:34.227 position:27% line:83% align:start
a battle between
robotic lions?

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.397 position:13% line:83% align:start
The unstable peace of their
daily existence was shattered

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.802 position:16% line:83% align:start
when a cold war developed
between Hanson and Sanson.

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:42.503 position:16% line:89% align:start
Even the best of friends

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:44.672 position:13% line:83% align:start
sometimes grow tired of one
another,

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:46.173 position:13% line:89% align:start
and soon Hanson and Sanson

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:48.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
were planning to settle
their differences

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:52.212 position:7% line:83% align:start
with a race between King and...
well, King.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.682 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hopefully, a peaceful solution
to their conflict

00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:57.284 position:35% line:83% align:start
would bring
about a return to serenity.

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.588 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hanson decided to use
his technological wizardry

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:04.559 position:13% line:83% align:start
to create a mechanical King
that would run the race for him,

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:07.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
while Sanson tried in vain
to use his incredible strength

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.231 position:16% line:83% align:start
to persuade the real King
to be his champion.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:15.268 position:7% line:83% align:start
He soon decided to enlist Jean
to build a robotic King for him.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:17.170 position:19% line:89% align:start
And so the race was on.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.506 position:30% line:89% align:start
Jean gave chase

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.274 position:13% line:83% align:start
and ended up taking a trip
to the bottom of the sea.

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
By the way, what is
the secret of Blue Water?

How does it look?

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.769 position:38% line:83% align:start
It looks
like we're in the clear.

00:02:47.802 --> 00:02:49.604 position:30% line:83% align:start
Rev the engine
up a little more please.

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.241 position:19% line:89% align:start

-[Marie] I can't sleep.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.881 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Good morning, everybody.
-Gather around.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
We are going to show
you something

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:02.917 position:30% line:83% align:start
that will make
you happy.

-Ah.
-[Nadia] Wow.

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.425 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, now, now.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.461 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, it looks repaired.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:16.597 position:27% line:83% align:start
All we have to do
is patch the balloon

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.465 position:35% line:83% align:start
and we can
finally get off this island.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.537 position:30% line:83% align:start
How wonderful.
We can finally go home.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes. Marvelous.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.808 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, we won't be able to eat
together like this

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:28.609 position:33% line:83% align:start
too many more
times, will we, Hanson?

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.343 position:7% line:89% align:start
When you really think about it,

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.947 position:24% line:83% align:start
life on this island
wasn't so bad all in all.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.783 position:27% line:83% align:start
We had fresh air,
the murmuring of a brook,

00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:38.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
birds singing,
gentle sea breezes.

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.589 position:38% line:83% align:start
You have
a romantic way about you today.

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:44.391 position:7% line:83% align:start
You almost appear as if you're
bidding the island farewell.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.461 position:7% line:83% align:start
We all know what we're leaving
but where are we going?

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:49.964 position:7% line:83% align:start
If the balloon works as before
and the wind speed is good,

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:52.900 position:13% line:83% align:start
we will be on Africa's east
coast in less than two weeks.

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.401 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Africa?

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.971 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm. The wind
will carry us there.

00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:00.742 position:5% line:83% align:start
Oh, thank you, Jean, for finally
making my dream come true.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:04.612 position:16% line:83% align:start
But why is Africa a dream
come true for you, my dear?

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:07.749 position:10% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Because that is where
I was born, Ms. Grandis.

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:09.751 position:16% line:89% align:start
I don't care where we go

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
as long as it's a place
with plenty of food and drink

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.555 position:35% line:83% align:start
and people
who will prepare it for me.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.692 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm tired of cooking
this boring island food.

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.527 position:35% line:89% align:start

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.378 position:10% line:83% align:start
[grunts] We'll come down with
malaria

Oh, stop.

I'll ask Jean to
make us some bug spray.

why I must be forced to sew.

It's women's work and
as anyone can see, I'm a man.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.632 position:30% line:89% align:start
I quit! I quit!

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:00.568 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Sanson.
-[grumbles]

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.738 position:13% line:83% align:start
-God, he is so impossible.
-It just goes to prove

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:05.873 position:7% line:83% align:start
that there are two kinds of men
in this world,

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:08.475 position:13% line:89% align:start
the useful and the useless.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.546 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I imagine
you fall into the former ranks?

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.548 position:5% line:89% align:start
To be perfectly honest with you,

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:16.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
a count of my order would
rarely ever work like this,

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:19.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
but being the all-around
handyman that I am,

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:20.353 position:30% line:89% align:start
I can't resist.

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:29.697 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, would you look at that.

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.467 position:21% line:89% align:start
Cheeky little devils.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.741 position:7% line:83% align:start
So what do you think you'll do
when we get to Africa, Hanson?

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:42.743 position:35% line:89% align:start
Let me see.

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:44.912 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, with Ms.
Grandis the way she is now,

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:47.882 position:19% line:83% align:start
there aren't really too
many things we can do anymore.

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.416 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why is that?

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.718 position:41% line:83% align:start
Because
we don't have a mission now.

00:05:51.652 --> 00:05:53.453 position:24% line:83% align:start
When we were after
the Blue Water,

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.422 position:38% line:83% align:start
we spent
our time being bad guys.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.092 position:10% line:83% align:start
But ever since we boarded the
Nautilus, we've been good guys.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.094 position:13% line:89% align:start
So I don't know what to do.

00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
That's because Gargoyle is worse
than you three ever were.

00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:05.833 position:7% line:83% align:start
How about you? What do you plan
to do when we get there?

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.168 position:38% line:89% align:start
Well, I--

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:08.970 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nadia is looking for
her birthplace

00:06:09.003 --> 00:06:09.904 position:19% line:89% align:start
and I'm going to help.

00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:11.639 position:19% line:89% align:start
Do you mean to tell me

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:13.841 position:10% line:83% align:start
that Nadia doesn't even know
where she was born?

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.442 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yes. It's sad.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.144 position:27% line:83% align:start
She doesn't know
where or when she was born.

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:18.713 position:30% line:89% align:start
No idea at all.

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.014 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, I see.

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.650 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then that explains
why she's so eccentric.

What do you mean I'm eccentric?

[both gasp]

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:27.188 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, hi, Nadia.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.958 position:24% line:83% align:start
I, uh, didn't mean
anything by that. [chuckles]

00:06:30.992 --> 00:06:32.593 position:19% line:89% align:start
Jean, I need your help.

00:06:32.627 --> 00:06:34.161 position:30% line:83% align:start
Could you come
on down from there?

00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:35.630 position:33% line:89% align:start
Some liquor?

00:06:35.663 --> 00:06:38.733 position:24% line:89% align:start
Shh. Keep it quiet.

00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:39.867 position:19% line:89% align:start
Don't tell the others.

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.869 position:21% line:89% align:start
So then, where is it?

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:46.741 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's in a secret not far from
here. Make sure it stays secret.

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:50.912 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have successfully cultivated
a daring natural wine

00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:54.148 position:19% line:83% align:start

some wild vine berries you see.

00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.550 position:35% line:83% align:start
-It's wine?
-Right.

00:06:56.584 --> 00:06:58.986 position:38% line:83% align:start
Something
you couldn't find anywhere else.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.889 position:33% line:89% align:start
Natural wine.

wonderful things on this island.

Listen, the mosquitos will soon
suck us dry if we stay here.

00:07:11.032 --> 00:07:12.934 position:27% line:89% align:start
What do you say?

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:15.136 position:30% line:83% align:start

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.387 position:24% line:89% align:start
I had nothing to do

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.257 position:21% line:83% align:start
so I thought I'd help
by bringing in the wash.

But I thought you went riding
with Hanson and Sanson.

00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:29.430 position:16% line:83% align:start
No. The chariot was built

[Ayerton] I have something
very important

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:38.238 position:30% line:83% align:start
to say to you,
Grandis.

00:15:38.272 --> 00:15:41.108 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why so serious all of a sudden?

I'd like you to come
live with me, dear lady.

What do you say we postpone

until after the wine tasting?

Huh.

00:15:57.424 --> 00:16:00.360 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you concocted this whole
story just to get me alone?

00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:01.696 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is that what you're saying?

00:16:01.729 --> 00:16:04.097 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's not important how I got you
all alone, you see.

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:06.634 position:21% line:83% align:start
I only lied to you so
that we may discuss this

in our own sweet privacy.

And to be even
more specific than that,

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:21.583 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to be the wife
of Count Ayerton Grenavan,

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:23.651 position:27% line:83% align:start

you didn't need it, Jean?

00:16:29.323 --> 00:16:31.158 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know that I haven't eaten it

00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:33.795 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I wouldn't because it would
make you so incredibly angry.

00:16:33.828 --> 00:16:36.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
Which means, if it weren't for
me, you would want to eat it?

it to a tree.

extremely worried

00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:44.484 position:35% line:83% align:start
if we don't
show up at camp soon.

00:19:44.519 --> 00:19:47.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
It would be really bad if we got
lost in here after dark,

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.422 position:21% line:89% align:start
so, Nadia, let's go.

[groans]

00:20:05.506 --> 00:20:07.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, Headman.

00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:10.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please don't call me that
and please let me out of here.

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:14.347 position:5% line:83% align:start
Take this opportunity to reflect
upon your shoddy conduct.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:16.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
You better, Headman.

00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:19.654 position:10% line:83% align:start
Incidentally, I haven't seen
Jean or Nadia in some time.

00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:22.924 position:13% line:83% align:start
[grunts] Where in the world
are those two hiding out today?

00:20:22.957 --> 00:20:25.459 position:10% line:83% align:start
That crafty little French kid
sure knows what he's doing.

00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:26.794 position:38% line:89% align:start
Pervert!

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
-It's so cold.
-Air conditioning.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:32.499 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.869 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:39.941 position:10% line:89% align:start
[Jean] What are those things?

00:20:39.974 --> 00:20:43.010 position:19% line:89% align:start
[somber music playing]

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:49.684 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's an old factory.
Look at all those chimneys.

00:20:49.717 --> 00:20:51.986 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is this Gargoyle's?

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:53.453 position:35% line:89% align:start
[Jean] No.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.893 position:30% line:83% align:start
That looks just
like the Nautilus.

00:20:58.926 --> 00:21:01.328 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's that doing
in a place like this?

00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:03.497 position:38% line:83% align:start
This just
doesn't make any sense.

00:21:03.531 --> 00:21:06.399 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why would you suspend
a submarine from the ceiling?

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.368 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wonder what this place
has been used for.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:10.938 position:5% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] I can't believe we lived
on this island all this time

00:21:10.972 --> 00:21:12.740 position:13% line:89% align:start
and didn't know about this.

00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:14.909 position:13% line:83% align:start
[Jean] We need to get back
and tell everyone about this.

00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.911 position:13% line:89% align:start
This is an incredible find.

00:21:16.944 --> 00:21:18.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Nadia] But how do
we get back to the entrance?

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.615 position:13% line:89% align:start
This walkway doesn't stop.

00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:23.084 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Don't worry.
If we keep going forward,

00:21:23.117 --> 00:21:24.819 position:13% line:83% align:start
then we'll have to come out
on the other side.

00:21:24.852 --> 00:21:26.788 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] But I am worried.

00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.023 position:30% line:83% align:start
And you should
be worried, too, Jean.

00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:30.625 position:30% line:83% align:start
[Jean] You take
everything too seriously.

00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:33.393 position:13% line:83% align:start
You won't live long enough
if you behave that way.

00:21:34.929 --> 00:21:36.396 position:16% line:89% align:start
[Nadia] Do you mean that?

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:38.398 position:19% line:89% align:start
Of course I do, Nadia.

00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:41.434 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:21:42.937 --> 00:21:44.806 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's happening?

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:48.543 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yes. My name is Nadia, yes.

00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:52.580 position:27% line:83% align:start
I know your name!
But who are you talking to? Ahh!

00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:58.418 position:27% line:83% align:start
No. Another dead
end. What do we do?

00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.756 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes, Jean is
a very good friend of mine.

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:05.059 position:10% line:83% align:start
[Jean] Why are you acting so
strange all of a sudden, Nadia?

00:22:05.927 --> 00:22:07.595 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia?

00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:08.963 position:41% line:89% align:start
Nadia?

00:22:09.831 --> 00:22:10.932 position:30% line:89% align:start
Snap out of it!

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:13.734 position:33% line:89% align:start
[screams] Ow!

00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:16.704 position:35% line:89% align:start

[gasps]

00:22:25.847 --> 00:22:27.648 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's all right, Jean.

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:28.716 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:30.618 --> 00:22:32.452 position:38% line:89% align:start

You're not supposed to be
out of your hole, Headman!

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:34.849 position:35% line:83% align:start
I have been
released, so God himself

00:23:34.882 --> 00:23:37.484 position:30% line:83% align:start
must have come
down to aid my freedom.

00:23:38.986 --> 00:23:40.453 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:43.024 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Good Lord.
-What is that?

00:23:44.892 --> 00:23:46.861 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Ayerton] An aurora.
