1
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,057
Queen:
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,326
There's only four of them!

3
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,234
They beat 1,200 players
all on their own?

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,438
( grunts )

5
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,781
Enough, this ends now!

6
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,936
( chuckles )

7
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,638
Queen:
<i>You're mine.</i>

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,587
( gasps )

9
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,325
Queen:
<i>No! You can't</i>
<i>dodge that.</i>

10
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,227
<i>You can't dodge that!</i>

11
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,166
Boy:
<i>Tell me if this story</i>
<i>rings a bell.</i>

12
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,102
<i>It may just be an urban legend,</i>

13
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>but I assure you,</i>

14
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,204
<i>it's a good one.</i>

15
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,238
<i>There exists a band</i>

16
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,406
<i>of anonymous players,</i>

17
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,309
<i>gamers who obliterate</i>
<i>anyone who comes to face them,</i>

18
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,945
<i>reaching scores never</i>
<i>achieved before or since.</i>

19
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,782
<i>In every game they play,</i>
<i>their win records are flawless.</i>

20
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,251
<i>Since their user names</i>
<i>are always left empty,</i>

21
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,454
<i>they are simply known</i>
<i>to people as "Blank."</i>

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,024
<i>And according to every player</i>
<i>who has encountered them,</i>

23
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,226
<i>they're indeed unbeatable.</i>

24
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,460
Cheaters?

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,162
You think that's how
they keep winning?

26
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,430
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,666
It's got to be just
a lousy group of hackers.

28
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,802
Come on, there's no way
they could beat 1,200 people

29
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,603
with just the four of them.

30
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:20,106
Auto‐aimers and wall hacks,
hitbox manipulation.

31
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,107
They got to be cheating.

32
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,776
Oh, do they?

33
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,345
And here I thought cheating
was our expertise.

34
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,980
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>I'd wouldn't be able</i>

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,682
<i>to cast so many spells</i>
<i>like that.</i>

36
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,617
Man:
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>This is different.</i>

37
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,385
Queen:
<i>But Blank dodged them anyway.</i>

38
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,854
<i>They already knew</i>
<i>I was cheating</i>

39
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,791
<i>to cast consecutive spells</i>
<i>before I even did it.</i>

40
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,159
They're amazing.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,528
They're like super geniuses
or something!

42
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,263
You think maybe
they'd go out with me?!

43
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:47,033
Man:
Oh, God.
Queen:
( cackling )

44
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,770
Boy:
<i>And so the rumors spread with</i>
<i>their infamy.</i>

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,874
<i>You know, urban legends</i>
<i>are like a kind of wish.</i>

46
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,075
<i>Because...</i>

47
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,342
( powers down )

48
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,145
<i>in reality...</i>

49
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,582
<i>the least interesting answer</i>

50
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,284
<i>is usually the correct one.</i>

51
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,290
( sighs )
We won... somehow.

52
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,725
( sighs )

53
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,427
Hey, listen, Little Sis,
could you do me a favor

54
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,997
<i>and please stop controlling</i>
<i>the main account for Blank</i>

55
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>with your feet?</i>

56
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,299
<i>Kind of nasty.</i>

57
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,335
Hungry, I'm still hungry.

58
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,072
Want some, Sora?

59
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,841
Sora:
Sure, why not?

60
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,779
<i>( electronic music plays )</i>

61
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,619
Sora:
<i>Really splurging on some</i>
<i>fancy rations, huh, Shiro?</i>

62
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:41,187
Shiro:
<i>Nutrition's important.</i>

63
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,056
Listen, the human brain
can function

64
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,424
as long as it has glucose.

65
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,060
White bread is best
in terms of cost‐performance.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,895
Yeah.
Thanks for the lecture.

67
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,131
But I need other types
of nutrients, too,

68
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,766
or I won't get any bigger.

69
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,335
Sora:
<i>You're already a perfect,</i>
<i>flawless beauty,</i>

70
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,637
<i>you darling girl.</i>

71
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,573
Mm.
Sora:
Hey, what time is it?

72
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,876
Shiro:
<i>Um... 8:00 A. M.,</i>
<i>the middle of the night.</i>

73
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,046
Sora: What day?
Does that even
matter to a NEET?

74
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,647
It does!

75
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,215
It tells me when MMORPGs
are going to have new events!

76
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,684
And wha‐ wait!

77
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,452
I know you've been up
for five days straight,

78
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,789
but if you quit now,
I won't have a healer!

79
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,857
I know you can do it.

80
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,392
You seriously think
I can control four characters

81
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,696
at one time?
Shiro:
Just believe.

82
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,497
Wait, no!
Please don't fall asleep!

83
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>If you go to sleep,</i>
<i>Shiro, everyone‐</i>

84
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,068
<i>and by everyone,</i>
<i>I mean me‐ will die!</i>

85
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,171
<i>( shouts )</i>
<i>Okay, fine, fine,</i>
<i>I'll do it!</i>

86
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,074
<i>I can take these suckers!</i>
<i>( mouse clicking rapidly )</i>

87
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,844
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

88
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:42,248
Boy:
<i>This world is chaotic,</i>
<i>unfair, and unforgiving.</i>

89
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,850
<i>It has no meaning or value.</i>

90
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,521
<i>However, some people simply</i>
<i>refuse to accept this,</i>

91
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,356
<i>even though they know</i>
<i>they can't change anything.</i>

92
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,025
<i>They wish that</i>
<i>the world could be</i>

93
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,494
<i>just a little more interesting.</i>

94
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,963
<i>And that's how</i>
<i>urban legends are formed,</i>

95
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,499
<i>from wishes like that.</i>

96
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,768
<i>Okay, so let's get</i>
<i>things started.</i>

97
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,538
<i>Let's offer a subtle</i>
<i>stylistic catalyst</i>

98
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,439
<i>for a chance</i>
<i>at a new beginning.</i>

99
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,942
<i>Let's ask the question...</i>

100
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,745
<i>"Have you ever heard</i>
<i>the latest rumor?"</i>

101
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,313
<i>(tablet beeps)</i>

102
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,247
Email.
Sora:
Listen, your brother's been
playing four characters

103
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,017
Sora:
Listen, your brother's been
playing four characters

104
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,184
on four separate screens.

105
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,186
I don't know what you want,
but I'm seriously about

106
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:24,257
to drop dead here.
Shiro:
It may be from a friend.

107
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,193
Whose friend?
Shiro:
Your friend?

108
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,895
( wheezes and laughs)
That's weird.

109
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,231
I thought I heard my sister
say something really mean

110
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,366
and sarcastic to me.

111
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,804
Huh?

112
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,941
Sora:
<i>What is this?</i>

113
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,911
<i>And how does this guy know that</i>
<i>the two of us are siblings?</i>

114
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,748
What should we do?

115
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,554
Sora:
<i>Is he trying to</i>
<i>cut a deal with us?</i>

116
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:57,924
Well, it might be fun
to see where this goes.

117
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,696
Huh? Chess?

118
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,666
Shiro:
<i>Well, good night.</i>
<i>( thud )</i>

119
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,233
Huh, wait, wait!
Don't fall asleep yet.

120
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,604
I can't handle a high‐level
chess simulation on my own!

121
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,241
Sora:
<i>Chess is a finite</i>
<i>two‐player, zero‐sum,</i>

122
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,277
<i>perfect information game.</i>

123
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,845
<i>Luck plays no part in it.</i>

124
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,447
<i>Theoretically, to each game,</i>
<i>there is a perfect solution</i>

125
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,517
<i>that will never fail.</i>

126
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,452
<i>Of course, that's only</i>
<i>if you have a mind capable</i>

127
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:31,124
<i>of calculating</i>
<i>the 10'^120 possible states</i>

128
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,826
<i>of the board.</i>

129
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,530
Shiro:
Chess is no different

130
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,866
than simply playing
tic‐tac‐toe.

131
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,870
That's right.

132
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,772
Sora:
<i>Shiro has beaten</i>
<i>a program designed</i>

133
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:49,009
<i>to defeat grandmasters</i>
<i>20 times in a row,</i>

134
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,478
<i>alternating between</i>
<i>going first and second.</i>

135
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,447
<i>However...</i>

136
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,850
( gasps )

137
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,686
Shiro:
<i>It cut off</i>
<i>its own piece's advance.</i>

138
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,088
Hold on, Shiro.
What?

139
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,725
A program will always
select the best strategy.

140
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,593
You can win 'cause
they're predictable.

141
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:10,030
But this one's deliberately
using a bad move

142
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,964
<i>to lure you in.</i>

143
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,966
Sora:
It's a human.
Shiro:
Hmm...

144
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,568
Don't worry, if it's
a contest of skill,

145
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,002
you've got this
in the bag.

146
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,305
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>I'll tell you when they're up</i>
<i>to something tricky.</i>

147
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,307
<i>The two of us,</i>
<i>Sora and Shiro,</i>

148
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,843
<i>form two halves of a whole.</i>

149
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,411
<i>Now let's see</i>
<i>if there's somebody</i>

150
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,814
who's got the balls
to beat us.

151
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,288
( both groan )

152
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,325
Male computerized voice:
<i>Checkmate! You are winner!</i>

153
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,161
( both sigh )

154
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,764
( yawning )
Yeah, we won!

155
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,100
I haven't worked
this hard in a long time.

156
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,935
Was that guy really human?

157
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,070
<i>( chimes )</i>

158
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,238
Together:
Huh?

159
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,547
What the hell?

160
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:09,355
Sora:
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"is it fun?"</i>

161
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,558
<i>In this game there's no way</i>
<i>to know the rules</i>

162
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,595
<i>or how to win,</i>
<i>yet there are 7 billion players</i>

163
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,429
<i>all making whatever</i>
<i>moves they want.</i>

164
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,398
<i>If you lose too much,</i>
<i>or win too much,</i>

165
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,200
<i>there are penalties.</i>

166
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,101
<i>You can't pass your turn,</i>

167
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,469
<i>and if you complain,</i>
<i>people look down on you.</i>

168
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,805
<i>There's no parameters</i>

169
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,508
<i>or freakin' genre</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

170
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,242
<i>You know what you call that?</i>

171
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>You call it...</i>

172
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,579
Sora and Shiro:
<i>A crappy game.</i>

173
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,215
<i>( chimes )</i>

174
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,255
( laughs )

175
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,491
Sora:
Uh, believe me,
if there's a world like that,

176
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,893
then the two of us,

177
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:50,664
<i>well, we were born</i>
<i>in the wrong one, for sure.</i>

178
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,766
( both gasp )

179
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,301
(static buzzing)

180
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,972
Huh? What the‐
Sora?

181
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,642
Boy:
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I think so, too!</i>

182
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,343
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it sounds like you two</i>

183
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,912
<i>don't have any business living</i>
<i>in this world at all!</i>

184
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,048
( both shout )
Boy:
<i>So how does this sound?</i>

185
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,817
<i>How would you like</i>
<i>a second chance to be made anew</i>

186
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,186
<i>in the world in which</i>
<i>you should have been born</i>

187
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,821
<i>in the first place?</i>

188
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,293
<i>Welcome to the world</i>
<i>of my creation!</i>

189
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,461
( both shout )

190
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,229
What's going on?!

191
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,431
( shouts )

192
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,602
This is the ideal world
you've always dreamed of‐

193
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,370
the world of games!

194
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:30,904
It's Disboard!

195
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,205
It's Disboard!
Sora:
Shit!

196
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,407
You see, everything
in this world
(whimper)

197
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,042
is decided by a simple game‐

198
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,680
Government, politics,
even the lives of its people.

199
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,714
Shiro:
Who are you?

200
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,983
Me?
They call me Tet.

201
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,719
I live over here.
I'm a god.

202
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,453
A god?
You're so short.

203
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,990
Now's not the time!
We're gonna die!

204
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,357
Try to stay focused, please.

205
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,894
So everything here is decided
by ten simple pledges.

206
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,630
( beep )
One‐ Killing others,
waging war,

207
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,398
and stealing from people
is strictly forbidden

208
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,933
in this world.

209
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,069
(beep)
Tet:
Two‐ All conflicts,
no matter how great or small,

210
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,105
must be resolved
through games.

211
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,740
<i>(beep)</i>
<i>Three‐</i>
<i>Before the games begin,</i>

212
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,809
<i>each player</i>
<i>must bet something</i>

213
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,243
<i>that they agree</i>
<i>is of equal value.</i>

214
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,213
<i>( beep )</i>
<i>Four‐ As long as it doesn't</i>
<i>go against number three,</i>

215
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,281
<i>what they bet</i>
<i>and the rules of the game</i>

216
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,082
<i>will not be questioned.</i>

217
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,352
<i>( beep )</i>
<i>Five‐ The challenged party has</i>
<i>the right to determine</i>

218
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,987
<i>the rules of the game.</i>

219
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,457
<i>( beep )</i>
<i>Six‐ All bets made in</i>
<i>accordance with the pledges</i>

220
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,459
<i>must be upheld.</i>

221
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,029
<i>(beep)</i>
<i>Seven‐ Conflicts between</i>
<i>groups will be overseen</i>

222
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,032
<i>by appointed representatives</i>
<i>with absolute authority.</i>

223
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,868
<i>( beep )</i>
<i>Eight‐ Being caught cheating</i>
<i>during a game</i>

224
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,503
<i>results in an instant loss.</i>

225
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:39,773
(beep)
And nine‐ In the name
of Almighty God,‐that's me‐

226
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,775
the previous rules
may never be altered.

227
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,077
Okay, great, now would you
shut up and save us?!

228
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,747
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>The ground! the ground,</i>
<i>the ground, the ground!</i>

229
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,982
Shiro!
Sora!

230
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,684
(explosion)
Sora:
( grunts )

231
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,261
( wheezes )

232
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:06,399
Number ten‐
Let's all have fun
and play together!

233
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,367
( laughs )

234
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,636
Sora:
Huh? Hey!

235
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,606
Tet:
<i>( distantly ) I look forward</i>
<i>to seeing you two again.</i>

236
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>it won't be long.</i>

237
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,781
Sora?

238
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,950
Shiro:
Where are we?

239
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,821
( wind whistles )

240
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,297
(loud crash)

241
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,802
( roars )

242
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,209
You know what, sis?
Hmm?

243
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,011
Sora:
I've always thought life
was just a game

244
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:55,015
for masochists and losers,
and what happened?

245
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,717
The game just crashed!

246
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,819
Oh, what's going on?

247
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,487
Together:
<i>This game is total crap!</i>

248
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,495
Man:
<i>Long ago, in the</i>
<i>far distant past,</i>

249
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,633
<i>the gods, along with</i>
<i>their families and creations,</i>

250
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,835
<i>waged a seemingly</i>
<i>never‐ending war</i>

251
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,469
<i>for the right</i>
<i>to rule this world,</i>

252
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,473
<i>They fought for the right</i>
<i>to become the One True God.</i>

253
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,309
<i>Eventually, it became clear</i>
<i>there would be no real victor,</i>

254
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,780
<i>as the sky, the sea,</i>
<i>the land and the stars</i>

255
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,183
<i>were all destroyed</i>
<i>in the devastating battles.</i>

256
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,653
<i>However,</i>
<i>hidden amongst the wreckage,</i>

257
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,555
<i>a single deity</i>
<i>had survived.</i>

258
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,791
<i>Although he never participated</i>
<i>in the conflict,</i>

259
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,359
<i>the title became his.</i>

260
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,161
<i>His name was Tet,</i>

261
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,364
<i>and he was known</i>
<i>as the God of Play.</i>

262
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,432
Tet:
<i>You creatures who have</i>
<i>fought with violence,</i>

263
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,536
<i>blood, and death,</i>
<i>who built a tower of corpses</i>

264
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,004
<i>that rises to the sky,</i>

265
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,239
<i>and who still</i>
<i>call yourselves wise,</i>

266
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:53,940
<i>tell me this:</i>

267
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,309
<i>What makes you different</i>
<i>from wild animals?</i>

268
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,378
Man:
<i>In the face</i>
<i>of their shattered world,</i>

269
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,782
<i>excuses were meaningless</i>
<i>and God spoke‐</i>

270
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,617
<i>"Thou shalt not kill</i>
<i>one another.</i>

271
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,686
<i>Murder and thievery</i>
<i>in this realm</i>

272
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:06,553
<i>is henceforth forbidden."</i>

273
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,422
Tet:
<i>You 16 races full</i>
<i>of greed and hubris,</i>

274
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,092
<i>I command you to use</i>
<i>your ingenuity and wit,</i>

275
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,894
<i>your great fortunes</i>
<i>and power</i>

276
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,996
<i>to build me a tower</i>
<i>of knowledge</i>

277
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,631
<i>and to prove to me...</i>

278
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,500
Man:
Your strength of mind.

279
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,135
Okay, I think I get it.

280
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,337
So everything in this world
is decided by games,

281
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,039
because the God of Play
is in charge?

282
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,974
That's right,
and by the way...

283
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,275
Hmm? What now?

284
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,077
Do you suppose
you could find it in your heart

285
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,679
to at least leave us
a pair of pants?

286
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,482
Sora:
Uh, Numero seis‐ Any bets made
in accordance with the pledges

287
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,984
must be upheld.

288
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,686
So we bet everything
we could offer,

289
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,221
including our lives,
and you in turn,

290
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,523
bet everything
you had on you,

291
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,224
which just so happened
to include your pants.

292
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,692
Okay, that's true,
but still,

293
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,561
You can't leave us here
like this!

294
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,930
Let's go, Shiro.
(all screaming)
Roger.

295
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,298
Please, double or nothing!

296
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,167
I can't go back to
the village in my undies.

297
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,070
Sora:
<i>Huh, seems like even bandits</i>
<i>can't rob or kill you.</i>

298
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,139
That's pretty convenient.

299
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,609
Nah, I bet they couldn't
even if they tried.

300
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,177
Anyway.

301
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,514
Seems like everything comes down
to your skill at the game.

302
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,957
( grunting )

303
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,959
Hey, how about you
speed this up?

304
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,127
Would you shut up!
I'm thinking here!

305
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:24,097
I just need a second,
okay?

306
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,599
Yeah, you can think
all you want,

307
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,067
but it won't change
your hand.

308
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,103
Sora:
<i>A gambling tournament to decide</i>
<i>the next king?</i>

309
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,839
It was the Old King's
dying wish.

310
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,207
Apparently,
he wanted the next ruler

311
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,977
to be humanity's
greatest gambler or something.

312
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:40,346
Huh, so even the ruler
is decided by a game.

313
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,716
Woman:
<i>The red‐headed girl is</i>
<i>Stephanie Dola.</i>

314
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,652
<i>She's the granddaughter</i>
<i>of the Former King,</i>

315
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,421
<i>but because of his will,</i>
<i>she can't inherit the throne.</i>

316
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,858
<i>So she's entered the gambling</i>
<i>tournament as well.</i>

317
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:56,396
Hmm? Hey, Shiro,
are you doing okay?

318
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,031
Shiro:
<i>I'm good.</i>

319
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,702
Huh?
What's the matter?

320
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,237
Got a crush?
Yeah, right.

321
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,707
I was just wondering if you
were going to enter this thing.

322
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,373
Who, me?

323
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,443
Oh, no, this is all I need
right here, Kiddo.

324
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,546
And... besides...

325
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:14,681
<i>Kurami over there</i>
<i>is so strong that most</i>

326
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,517
<i>of the other players</i>
<i>have already pulled out</i>

327
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,585
<i>before they had</i>
<i>the chance to lose.</i>

328
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,555
In other words,
you're too scared to enter?

329
00:15:21,555 --> 00:15:22,589
What'd you say?

330
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,125
So, as long as you
don't actually lose to her,

331
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,127
you can go home and tell
all your friends

332
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,428
whatever you want,
am I right?

333
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,864
"Oh, I won because
she was so pathetic.

334
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,165
<i>I let her go."</i>

335
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,068
Well, aren't you something?

336
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,738
So let's play,
Little Boy.

337
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,372
Sorry, but I don't play
for fun.

338
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,141
You got to put something
on the line...

339
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,776
<i>like that bag of cash.</i>

340
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,911
What? Do you know much
is in here?

341
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,913
The deal is that
we have to bet something

342
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,583
of equal value
or it isn't official.

343
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,318
Pledge three, right?
I suppose that's fair.

344
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,219
How's this?

345
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,656
You can do whatever
you want with the two of us.

346
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,657
Our lives are yours.

347
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,392
Sora:
<i>Sell us, leave us to die,</i>
<i>your choice.</i>

348
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:00,994
Seriously?

349
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,295
Why not?

350
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,364
Sora:
We'll play a single hand
of poker.

351
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:04,965
Uh...

352
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,099
What do you say?

353
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,169
I'd love to show one
of the locals how it's done.

354
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,436
Confident, huh?

355
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,806
Better watch that mouth
of yours.

356
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,009
All right,
have it your way.

357
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,944
I swear by the pledges.

358
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:20,480
I swear by the pledges.

359
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,184
Together: <i>Aschente!</i>

360
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,525
Woman:
<i>Just a stupid redneck kid</i>
<i>with more confidence</i>

361
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>than experience.</i>

362
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,563
<i>A bluff like that might work</i>
<i>on the backward dolts</i>

363
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,998
<i>in your village...</i>

364
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,001
<i>...but not here!</i>

365
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,705
Sora.

366
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,610
Oh, no, run into
some bad luck?

367
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,544
Poor baby.

368
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:53,747
Yeah, I started the day
with a 10,000‐meter skydive,

369
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,649
<i>then walked forever</i>
<i>under the blazing sun.</i>

370
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,217
<i>through some screwed‐up</i>
<i>wilderness‐</i>

371
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,185
<i>definitely a bad day.</i>

372
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,353
You did what now?

373
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,956
Just forget I said anything.
You ready?

374
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,492
( chuckles )
Ready... and waiting.

375
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,493
<i>How about you?</i>

376
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,462
<i>Perhaps you'd like</i>
<i>to draw the cards again?</i>

377
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,365
No thanks, we're cool.
<i>Oh.</i>

378
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,736
In that case...
too bad, kiddo!

379
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:17,971
Full house, Asshole!

380
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,807
Oh, you're right.
That is too bad.

381
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,510
Huh?

382
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,978
<i>( gasps )</i>

383
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:25,946
Ro...

384
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,549
Royal...

385
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,718
<i>s‐straight...</i>

386
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,255
f‐f‐flush?!
( wails )

387
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,257
Oh, no way!
No friggin' way

388
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,192
( shrieks )
Uh, yeah, way.

389
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,962
That's more than one
in 6 million odds!

390
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,264
Yep, and you just got
really unlucky.

391
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,600
But how?!
Sora:
<i>Pledge six‐</i>

392
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,869
All bets must be upheld,
am I right?

393
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,436
So pay up.

394
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:55,275
Just... who are you people?

395
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,078
Nobody special, just...

396
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,214
a new player in town.

397
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,755
Sora, that was mean.

398
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,625
You could have least tried
to hide you were cheating.

399
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,294
Well, let's review pledge
number eight, shall we?

400
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,163
Being caught cheating during
a game means an instant loss.

401
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,800
In other words,
if you're not caught, it's fine.

402
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,135
How much is in there?

403
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,203
No clue.

404
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,271
Well, just leave it to me.

405
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,542
Big Bro's an expert
at negotiations.

406
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,645
I'll take a room.
One bed will be just fine.

407
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:34,114
How many nights
would this get me?

408
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:35,616
Just one night.

409
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,551
( chuckles )
I'm really tired.

410
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,219
Come on, dude,
You're gonna tell me

411
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,622
how many nights
I can really stay here?

412
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,256
If you're trying
to cheat someone,

413
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,991
you should pay
more attention to your tone

414
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,993
and where you're looking at.

415
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,461
Fine, two nights, then.

416
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,431
Man, you really
are not good at this!

417
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,834
Listen, Pierre,
if you're gonna lie,

418
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:57,971
you better be careful
who you do it to, okay?

419
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,139
Man: <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

420
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,207
Okay, four nights,
awesome.

421
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,544
Hey, kid,
what's your name?

422
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,546
Hmm?

423
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,914
You can just leave it blank.

424
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,589
Sorry for the wait,
Shiro.

425
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,058
That girl's
about to lose it.

426
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,059
Sora:
<i>No kidding.</i>

427
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,328
<i>Doesn't look like anyone taught</i>
<i>her what "poker face" means,</i>

428
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,864
<i>unlike her opponent.</i>

429
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,398
Hmm, she's cheating.

430
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,934
Think so, yeah.

431
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,070
But how?

432
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,838
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

433
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,642
Now wait a minute.

434
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,444
<i>Something else</i>
<i>is going on here.</i>

435
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,449
( laughs )
Seriously?

436
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,251
Kurami:
You can fold
whenever you want.

437
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,587
Stephanie:
Would you please
shut up already!

438
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:49,623
Just be quiet and focus
on your own cards, all right?

439
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,930
Finally!

440
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,702
Listen,
that girl is cheating.

441
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,436
Uh...

442
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,647
Hey, you still playing
or what?

443
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:17,584
Huh? Oh, yes,
of course I am.

444
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,287
Sora:
<i>Smartphones, DSPs, Tablet PC.</i>

445
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,790
I got the battery
and the solar charger,

446
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,891
cables, and everything.

447
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,260
Well, all things considered,
Is this it?

448
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,795
after everything
that happened today,

449
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,397
I'd say we're lucky
to have this much.

450
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,900
I can't connect.

451
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,901
Figures.

452
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:39,272
<i>This really is an</i>
<i>honest‐to‐God fantasy world.</i>

453
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,807
And the way
she was cheating...

454
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:43,276
that was like
its own fantasy, too.

455
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:48,014
Sora, can you beat
real magic?

456
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,422
I guess that
was a dumb question.

457
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,859
Hey, Shiro...

458
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,394
usually, in, like,
comics and stuff

459
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,996
when the main characters
end up in another world,

460
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,932
they try their best
to find a way home, right?

461
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,306
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>But why would they want</i>
<i>to go back to a world</i>

462
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:17,277
if it's total... shit?

463
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,151
( sighs softly )

464
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,753
( chuckles )

465
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,692
Shiro:
I thought the same thing.

466
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,631
Well, then it's settled.

467
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,438
Sora:
<i>Let the real game begin.</i>

468
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,841

<i>( taps on door )</i>

470
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,309
Shiro, as your brother,
I'm really happy

471
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,446
that you love me so much,
but let go of me for a second.

472
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,215
<i>( footsteps )</i>

473
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,382
Sora:
<i>Who's there?</i>

474
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,952
Come on, man,
I paid up front already.

475
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:49,395
Would it be okay
if I came in for a second?

476
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,632
Shiro:
We're gonna save the day?

477
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,735
Sora:
<i>Sure, why not,</i>
<i>it'll be fun, right?</i>
