1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,046
Welcome, I'm the one
they call Jibril.

2
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,381
You are King Sora
and Queen Shiro?

3
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,150
What business
do the new rulers

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,819
of Imanity have with me?

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,921
Oh, so you know
us already.

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,256
That'll make this easier.

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,159
I'll just tell you then.

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,795
<i>I want this library.</i>

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,491
Jibril:
<i>You</i> amigos <i>want to take</i>
moi <i>library away.</i>

10
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:09,195
My word, that's not <i>es</i> possible.
I would <i>comprende.</i>

11
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,331
Okay, Steph,
this is a Flugel, right,

12
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,433
a god‐killing warrior
just like you said?

13
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,901
That's what
she's supposed to be.

14
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,136
I must have been
as cattywampus

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,204
as a squab hit in the face
with a bean gun.

16
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,440
Or, wait, sorry,
pea shooter, I mean.

17
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,575
She corrected herself.

18
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,610
You remind me of
this awful comedian I saw,

19
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,547
so, if you're doing this
on purpose, please spare us.

20
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,681
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

21
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,750
I had thought it was a uniquely
avant‐garde way of speaking,

22
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,152
but you're saying somebody
already beat me to it?

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,787
Yeah, and they suck, too.

24
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,090
Jibril:
<i>Let us return</i>
<i>to the matter at hand.</i>

25
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,159
You said you desire
my library.

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,427
Should I assume
that means...

27
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,931
that you wish to challenge
me to a game, human?

28
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,768
Uh‐huh.
I do, actually.

29
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,603
How interesting.

30
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,072
<i>Before the ten pledges</i>
<i>were put into effect,</i>

31
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,708
<i>we Flugels spent our days</i>
<i>collecting severed heads</i>

32
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,442
<i>off the corpses</i>
<i>of our victims.</i>

33
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,478
<i>However, now that murder</i>
<i>is forbidden,</i>

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,081
<i>we are satisfied with</i>
<i>collecting knowledge instead.</i>

35
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,116
<i>It's no exaggeration</i>
<i>to say the books containing</i>

36
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,485
<i>that knowledge and the places</i>
<i>where they are held,</i>

37
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:09,189
<i>are, in Flugel society,</i>
<i>considered to be as valuable</i>

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,291
<i>as one's life.</i>

39
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,295
So since you're asking me
to bet my life away,

40
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,964
what are you offering me
in exchange?

41
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,236
More than 40,000 books
from another world.

42
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,839
( screams )

43
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,073
Oh, no, you didn't.

44
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,975
It's okay, Shiro,
in our line of work,

45
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,677
that's a really good sign.

46
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,079
For 40,000,
that's quite a prize.

47
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,214
Where do you keep
all these books?

48
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,582
Right in here.

49
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,551
<i>I got them to study</i>
<i>for quiz games‐</i>

50
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,886
<i>dictionaries,</i>
<i>medical reference guides,</i>

51
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,854
<i>philosophy books.</i>

52
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,457
<i>It's chock‐full of</i>
<i>information from our world.</i>

53
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,359
Wait, you're honestly
trying to tell me

54
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,061
that you came here
from another world?

55
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,962
Yep.

56
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,497
That's not possible.

57
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,465
Huh?

58
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,967
You want to
back us up here?

59
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,435
Oh, I, uh...

60
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,403
If you were going to summon
a living creature

61
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,506
from another world,
it would require

62
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,709
a massive amount of magical
energy to sustain them here.

63
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm afraid that even
the Old Deus

64
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,880
would find such a task
extraordinarily difficult.

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,650
I don't really get it,
but proof trumps all.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,451
Look at this. Not sure
if you can read it‐

67
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,354
What are you talking about?
I can speak every one

68
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,390
of the over 700 languages
fluently, so...

69
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,426
<i>I can't read these words.</i>

70
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,695
<i>A brand‐new language?</i>

71
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,164
And there are 40,000 books
full of this?

72
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,133
( screams )
So much knowledge
from another world!

73
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,336
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

74
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,006
Hey, you're drooling!
You're drooling on it!

75
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,941
Oh, my, excuse me. I see.

76
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,844
I am indeed interested in
this little thin board thingy.

77
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,780
And yet, I fear
I still can't trust

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,915
<i>that you're from another world</i>
<i>without some sort</i>

79
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,116
<i>of proof to persuade me.</i>

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,884
<i>Help me out here.</i>

81
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,819
What kind of proof
are you looking for?

82
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,321
Could you please
allow me to inspect your bodies?

83
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,257
Inspect our bodies?
Why would you do that?

84
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,527
What the hell
are you checking for anyway?

85
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,195
Your erogenous zones.

86
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,462
Oh! do it for as long
as you like,

87
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,098
as hard as you like,
wherever you like!

88
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,432
Nothing good
can come from this.

89
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,702
Sora, that's
rated‐R stuff.

90
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,937
( grunts )
Damn it, you're right. Fine!

91
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,839
Just leave the stupid
pants on, but listen up!

92
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,541
This is a give and take
situation.

93
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,844
You touch me,
and I get to feel you up, too!

94
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,846
Are you crazy?
She's not just gonna let you‐

95
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,549
Of course.
That'll be perfectly fine.

96
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,751
I'm losing my mind!

97
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,025
So do you not care
for how it feels

98
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,760
when I stroke you that way?

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,796
Uh, no, it feels
pretty okay, I suppose,

100
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,497
more so than
one might expect.

101
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,700
but, uh, how to put it?

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,969
I guess I'm just feeling
a little let down,

103
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,337
kind of disappointed.

104
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,507
Is this not one
of your erogenous zones?

105
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,475
I mean, no,
it isn't, not really.

106
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,810
but, frankly,
even if it was,

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,980
I don't think any man would be
willing to admit that, okay?

108
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,916
And allow me to add I was hoping
you'd touch me somewhere else,

109
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,951
to say the least.

110
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,454
But all of our power comes
from the pulsating lines

111
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,923
<i>of currents called</i>
<i>our spirit circuits.</i>

112
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,925
<i>These lines are more</i>
<i>concentrated at our wings</i>

113
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,827
<i>which is why</i>
<i>they are so very sensitive</i>

114
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,566
and also very erogenous.
( moans )

115
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,668
Um, you like that, baby?
What, right here, you say?

116
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,136
And when you touch me
like that I just...

117
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,437
( cries out )

118
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,206
What are we even doing
anymore?!

119
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,109
I'm just helping a girlfriend
out by stroking her soft parts.

120
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,043
Right, sis?

121
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,879
Yep, it's super healthy.

122
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,346
I can't believe that
I'm seeing this.

123
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,349
I mean, she's a god‐killing
ultimate weapon.

124
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,387
Jibril:
<i>( moans )</i>

125
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,890
Ahem, as far as I can tell,
there would appear

126
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,893
to be no spirits whatsoever
residing within your bodies.

127
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,995
In other words, by the standards
set in our world

128
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,764
you two aren't technically
even defined as life.

129
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:41,067
Flugel are like living deities
and Imanity fungus.

130
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,302
So what does that...

131
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,670
Make us?

132
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,573
Completely unknown!

133
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,776
A mystery is the most wonderful
thing in existence.

134
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,579
It is the wellspring from which
all new knowledge is born,

135
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,447
and there is nothing
quite as spectacular

136
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,182
as the unknown!

137
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,051
Uh, okay, good for you.

138
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,521
Guess it's safe to assume that
we've proven we're not

139
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,588
from your world, then?

140
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,656
Yes, that's right.

141
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,824
I assumed you were nothing more

142
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,592
than a feeble Imanity,
but I was mistaken.

143
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,729
My apologies.
I meant no offense.

144
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,631
Of course, I will
accept your challenge,

145
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,799
but I'm afraid I don't
really have much to offer you

146
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,468
that's worth 40,000 books
from another world.

147
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,837
I just want the library.

148
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,973
How about I bet myself
as well as everything I have.

149
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,407
Really?!
Seriously?!

150
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,843
Jackpot!

151
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,010
Jibril:
<i>Is that acceptable?</i>

152
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,280
Sora:
<i>Oh, yeah, we want all</i>
<i>of your personal rights</i>

153
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,414
<i>as a living being.</i>

154
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,950
Why, that's just excellent.

155
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,586
Oh, if I win,
I would like to add a clause

156
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,354
that states that you have
to come by the library

157
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,956
for tea once in a while.

158
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,525
I'm ever so eager to learn
more about you.

159
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,260
( giggles )

160
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,662
I have no problem
with that,

161
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,565
assuming you do win,
of course, but in that case,

162
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:47,433
we get a second request
if we win, right?

163
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,403
Yes, in the extraordinarily
unlikely event

164
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,238
that such a miracle occurs.

165
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,607
( giggles )

166
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,915
Jibril:
The game will be word chain,

167
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:05,418
but not your run‐of‐the‐mill
kind of word chain‐

168
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,120
Materialization word chain.

169
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,089
Oh...
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Materialization word chain?</i>

170
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:09,990
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Materialization word chain?</i>

171
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,692
Jibril:
<i>Yes, the rules are simple.</i>

172
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,326
<i>Just like</i>
<i>a normal word chain,</i>

173
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,562
if you use a word
that's already been used,

174
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,130
<i>fail to answer after</i>
<i>30 seconds,</i>

175
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,767
<i>or can no longer continue,</i>
<i>then it's game over for you.</i>

176
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,536
Sora:
<i>Can words be in any language?</i>

177
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,505
Jibril:
<i>Yes, but just so you know,</i>

178
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,372
<i>imaginary things</i>
<i>that do not exist</i>

179
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,509
<i>won't count</i>
<i>as a proper answer.</i>

180
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,412
<i>And remember, we're playing</i>
<i>materialization word chain.</i>

181
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,680
If you say something
that's here,

182
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,848
it will disappear.

183
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,585
If it's not here,
it will appear.

184
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,622
I'm sure you can guess
the implications.

185
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,423
Of course,
once the game's over

186
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,091
everything that happened
will be undone.

187
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,228
So don't hesitate
to show off your knowledge.

188
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,362
I got it.

189
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,897
Okay, Shiro,
come sit here.

190
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,299
We'll do this together
just like we always do.

191
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,903
It makes no difference.
You are completely outmatched.

192
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,673
Take all the help you can get
and try to stay alive.

193
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,709
Steph:
What? Wait,
you mean you can die?

194
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,545
Jibril:
You can, but only
as a consequence

195
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,046
of actions taken
in the game.

196
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,615
Your opponent cannot
directly attack you.

197
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,517
Okey dokey, then, folks,
You have fun.

198
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,152
I'll just be on my merry way‐

199
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,086
Here we go.

200
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,656
( screams )

201
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,358
All right,
let the game begin.

202
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,760
Give us your
best shot.

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,061
Would you please stop ig‐

204
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,896
Steph, sit, stay.

205
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,332
No, now I cant run away.
I've had it with this.

206
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,402
Steph:
It's not fair! (cries)
I will offer you
the first move.

207
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,337
<i>Pick any word you like.</i>

208
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,406
So let me think about this.

209
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,375
Okay, I'll start with...

210
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,843
atom bomb!

211
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,146
Huh?

212
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,348
What is this?

213
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,953
( gasps )
Bkuli'ans!

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,670
Jibril:
Self destructing
for your first move, hmm?

215
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,705
That was Bkuli'ans,

216
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:08,542
one of the highest level
sealing spells, very handy.

217
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,175
You were fortunate.

218
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,712
If I hadn't decided to be so
benevolent as to protect you,

219
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,647
<i>the game would</i>
<i>have ended already.</i>

220
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,016
Benevolent?
Oh, give me a break.

221
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,379
Bkuli'ans!

222
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:18,885
Sora:
I was simply testing the
waters to see what lengths

223
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,687
<i>you'd be willing to go to</i>
<i>in order to keep</i>

224
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,889
<i>this interesting little game</i>
<i>of ours running.</i>

225
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,591
Pretty great lengths,
it would seem.

226
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,325
That's right.

227
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,528
Now that I've busted out
the most powerful weapon

228
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,361
<i>in my planet's arsenal,</i>

229
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,897
<i>I see that you won't</i>
<i>be so easy to dispose of.</i>

230
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,133
I'm so glad we
understand each other.

231
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,570
The last thing I want is to
waste my time in a dull game.

232
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,871
Oh, don't worry,

233
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,706
I think I can keep these
things lively.

234
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,908
Spirit circuits.

235
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,382
Well, you certainly
got right to it.

236
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,118
I wanted to try out
the new phrase I learned.

237
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,286
What? You mad?

238
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:53,987
No, it's fine.

239
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,823
Not having them in me
just limits my physical
abilities a bit

240
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,224
and prevents me from flying,

241
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,460
but I still have
spirits in my body,

242
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,562
so I'll be able to manage.

243
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:05,465
If anything, I suppose
it just makes me a bit anxious.

244
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,268
Oh, like when your cell phone
can't get a wireless connection?

245
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,970
Cell phone? Wireless?

246
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,937
Do they have something to do

247
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,606
with that magic board
doohickey?

248
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, back off!

249
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,909
if I lose,
then I'll tell you.

250
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,243
<i>Sora, I think she's...</i>

251
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,614
Yeah, she's really getting
into this game.

252
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,048
Hey, Jibril, your turn,
come on.

253
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:26,319
Oh, yes, that's right.
I'll do an easy one.

254
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:26,953
Stallions.

255
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,488
Steph:
Stall‐
( screams )

256
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,290
Okay, naughty bits.

257
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,091
Both: Huh?

258
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,092
Huh?

259
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,393
You cool?

260
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,829
( groans )

261
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,236
<i>Steph:</i>
<i>Why do you keep doing</i>
<i>weird things to me?!</i>

262
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,979
I'm getting a little tired
of this bleak scenery.

263
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,048
Let's liven things up a bit.

264
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,783
Beach.

265
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:57,984
Sora &amp; Shiro:
( scream )

266
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,385
Okay, this is
nice and all,

267
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,354
but it's rough on someone
who never leaves home.

268
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,356
My turn!
Hooter‐nub!

269
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,126
Oh, I get it.
Let me try this.

270
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,594
Bikinis.

271
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,530
Jibril, you don't
understand at all!

272
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,964
If you want to see bikinis,

273
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,465
you need to get rid
of the clothing first!

274
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,667
That's how it works!

275
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,736
Oh, I see,
I'm sorry I ruined it.

276
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,137
Too bad I can't
take it back.

277
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,339
Would you two
at least pretend like this

278
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,274
is a life or death struggle?!
Whatever.

279
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,976
Suitcases.

280
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,578
Don't you mean baggage?

281
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,880
Anyway,
how does squall sound?

282
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,249
Huh? Hey, wait.

283
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,917
It all worked out
in the end, Jibril!

284
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,519
<i>Getting a up skirt look</i>
<i>at a bikini bottom</i>

285
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,020
<i>is a rare thing.</i>

286
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,522
<i>and since Steph</i>
<i>wasn't wearing underwear,</i>

287
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,023
<i>we don't have to worry</i>
<i>about an extra pair</i>

288
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,324
<i>of panties</i>
<i>getting in the way.</i>

289
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,493
Oh, yay,
I'm so glad it worked out.

290
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,163
And now it'll be complete.

291
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,531
Ladies wear!

292
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,398
( screams )

293
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,466
Huh?

294
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,768
Oh?

295
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:50,904
Steph:
( sobs ) No!

296
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,472
( laughs )

297
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,807
How do you like that, sis?

298
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,375
<i>No nether regions at all,</i>

299
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,578
<i>and we've still got the shoes,</i>
<i>knee socks and collar.</i>

300
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,180
<i>In other words, it's even</i>
<i>better than pure nudity.</i>

301
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,815
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>suitable for all ages,</i>

302
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,950
<i>very healthy and natural,</i>
<i>moderately sexy,</i>

303
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,451
<i>but not like super dirty</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

304
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,453
<i>Hey, you know what</i>
<i>we should call this?</i>

305
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,024
the super healthy
un‐nude beach deluxe!

306
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,192
Sora, Omega good job.

307
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,897
Give me back my clothes!
<i>Give me back my dignity!</i>

308
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,935
( screams )

309
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,307
Hey, Jibril, don't
you ever get hungry?

310
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,642
Mantle.

311
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,776
Oh, I'm fine.

312
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,344
Unlike you pathetic humans,

313
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,780
I don't require the intake
of organic substances.

314
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,181
<i>Elooshig'o.</i>

315
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,551
I see.

316
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,885
But you get tired,
don't you?

317
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,220
<i>The sun will come up soon.</i>

318
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,022
<i>Hurry up and lose</i>
<i>those already.</i>

319
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,489
<i>Outer core.</i>

320
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,224
( screams )

321
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,560
Aw, if you're all pooped
and you want to quit,

322
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,427
go right ahead.

323
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,294
I'm not going to stop you.

324
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,697
I've already had more fun
than I've ever expected

325
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,265
playing with you weaklings.

326
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:52,866
Epic clock.

327
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,100
( yells )

328
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,302
You keep calling us
weaklings and feeble.

329
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,471
It's really starting
to get on my nerves.

330
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,640
<i>Killer creature.</i>

331
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,908
<i>Well, to a mighty Exceed</i>
<i>rank six like yourself,</i>

332
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,977
<i>I'm sure us folks</i>
<i>at the bottom of the list</i>

333
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,346
<i>must look like ants</i>
<i>or whatever, huh?</i>

334
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,670
But you know what?

335
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,683
Ants are pretty strong
and there's lots of them, too.

336
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,284
I humbly apologize.

337
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,153
I hadn't considered the idea
that you Imanity

338
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,421
were smart enough to think
of yourselves

339
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,657
as anything but weak.

340
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:18,525
Well, if you think
that longevity

341
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,526
and strength equal power,

342
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,995
then you must
be even dumber than we are.

343
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,096
( scoffs )

344
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,465
You're saying I'm inferior
to Imanity?

345
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,268
Please, do understand
that my feelings towards you

346
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,937
are best described
as curiously, not respect.

347
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,373
So don't get too comfortable,
little ant.

348
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,009
I could easily squish you.
anytime I like.

349
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,512
Effulgent oil.

350
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,681
Sora:
<i>And that's exactly</i>
<i>why you're weak.</i>

351
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:44,017
You're so egocentric,
you don't even know it.

352
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,151
Egocentric?

353
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,452
Yep, I'll write it.

354
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,489
It means you think
you're the center of everything.

355
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,125
Obviously.
I know what the word means.

356
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,294
And what makes you think
I'm so egocentric?

357
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,262
You say you're curious
about the unknown,

358
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,998
but you're so wrapped
up in yourself,

359
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,534
that you can't even
appreciate it.

360
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,703
It's about time
I taught you a lesson.

361
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,705
Allow me to show you...

362
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,107
just how weak
you really are.

363
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,576
Hey, Steph,
thanks for the hard work.

364
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,745
If you hadn't kept
all those monsters at bay,

365
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,680
there's no way
we would have won.

366
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,815
That's a little premature.

367
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,316
Sorry about this, Steph.

368
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,085
This'll kill you,
so try to hang in there.

369
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,021
Wait, what?

370
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,190
( both roar )

371
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,494
Both:
Lithosphere!

372
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,464
Huh?

373
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:35,936
Huh?

374
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:39,205
( screams )

375
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,108
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>The lithosphere</i>
<i>is our planet's outer surface.</i>

376
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,710
<i>You were too busy</i>
<i>enjoying yourself</i>

377
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,879
<i>to see that I was slowly</i>
<i>dismantling this planet,</i>

378
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,015
<i>starting with its mantle,</i>
<i>then erasing the outer core.</i>

379
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,450
<i>Maybe you would</i>
<i>have caught that</i>

380
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,452
<i>if you weren't</i>
<i>so damn egocentric.</i>

381
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,055
<i>You failed to fear</i>
<i>and respect the unknown,</i>

382
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,792
<i>and that, my dear,</i>
<i>is what makes you weak.</i>

383
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,093
Now I see.

384
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,796
<i>This is why you erased</i>
<i>my spirit circuits.</i>

385
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,798
<i>You wanted me to fall</i>
<i>to my doom.</i>

386
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,001
<i>The core has an internal</i>
<i>temperature of 6,000 degrees</i>

387
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,971
<i>and a surface temperature</i>
<i>of 3,000 degrees.</i>

388
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:13,306
Well, you're in the same
pickle I am,

389
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,209
so let's keep playing
and see who goes first.

390
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,045
You were worried about
the sun coming up, right?

391
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,714
<i>Early morning halo.</i>

392
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,950
( both gasp )
Oxygen gas.

393
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,586
( chokes )

394
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,154
So you want to smother
me to death now?

395
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,123
You'll have to
do better than that.

396
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,892
Let's keep
this game going.

397
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,326
Sonata.

398
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,796
Agricultural enthusiasts.

399
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,431
You're making this
way too easy.

400
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,201
Okay, still air.

401
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,104
<i>Once the air comes back,</i>
<i>I can breathe.</i>

402
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,139
( gasps )
What the...

403
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,407
Sora:
<i>Yes, I was right,</i>

404
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,510
<i>Jibril doesn't know</i>
<i>atomic theory.</i>

405
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,344
<i>You thought</i>
<i>if you couldn't breathe</i>

406
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,313
<i>all you had to do</i>
<i>was bring back air, right?</i>

407
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,583
<i>Nope, not quite.</i>
<i>All I got rid of was oxygen.</i>

408
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,919
<i>The rules say if something's</i>
<i>there, it disappears</i>

409
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>and if it isn't there,</i>
<i>it appears.</i>

410
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,659
<i>The other gases disappeared</i>
<i>and oxygen came back.</i>

411
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,460
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>at these pressures,</i>

412
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,796
<i>your body cannot absorb</i>
<i>this much oxygen properly,</i>

413
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,899
<i>and it becomes as good</i>
<i>as poison to your system.</i>

414
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,234
That may be so.

415
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,637
but at this rate,
you're just as doomed as I am.

416
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,507
<i>Ew.</i>

417
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,475
Sora:
<i>Circular breathing.</i>

418
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,244
<i>What, don't tell me</i>
<i>you didn't see that one coming?</i>

419
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,212
<i>This is the difference</i>
<i>between you and us.</i>

420
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,048
Shiro, let's go.

421
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:28,782
Okay.

422
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,117
( both exhaling sharply )

423
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:33,554
Sora and Shiro:
<i>Real atmosphere.</i>

424
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,790
Can you feel that?

425
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,191
<i>The zero pressure environment</i>

426
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,260
<i>created by the absence</i>
<i>of the atmosphere</i>

427
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,129
<i>will cause the air left</i>
<i>inside of you to expand</i>

428
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,098
<i>until you burst!</i>

429
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,167
<i>If you understood that,</i>
<i>then you'd know why</i>

430
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,570
<i>we exhaled the way we did.</i>

431
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,273
Jibril:
<i>Still, it is useless.</i>

432
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,141
( gasps )
<i>My voice?</i>

433
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,342
<i>( laughs )</i>

434
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,545
<i>Sound can't travel</i>
<i>in a vacuum,</i>

435
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:02,348
<i>so if you can't answer</i>
<i>in the next 30 seconds...</i>

436
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,619
Jibril:
<i>Then I lose.</i>

437
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,654
<i>Is that what</i>
<i>you're thinking?</i>

438
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,027
Hmm, it's too bad
you're nothing

439
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,630
but a pathetic
little Imanity.

440
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,399
You do your race proud,
for what it's worth,

441
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,735
<i>but I'm afraid</i>
<i>that this is the absolute</i>

442
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,303
<i>end of the road.</i>

443
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,239
<i>Do you see now?</i>

444
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,908
<i>This difference between us</i>
<i>is a barrier</i>

445
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,811
<i>that Imanity will never</i>
<i>be able to overcome.</i>

446
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,814
<i>Why, you can't even find</i>
<i>a way to answer me.</i>

447
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,181
( grunts )

448
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,316
<i>Isn't it ironic?</i>

449
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,284
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>you will lose as a result</i>

450
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,622
<i>of the soundless</i>
<i>fiery world you created.</i>

451
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,424
<i>Alas, you never stood a chance.</i>

452
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,426
( gasps )

453
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:53,567
Sora:
<i>When Coulomb's</i>
<i>force vanishes</i>

454
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,502
<i>and all that's left</i>
<i>is the nuclear force</i>

455
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,470
<i>that draws atoms together,</i>

456
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,573
<i>the result is an</i>
<i>astronomical phenomenon</i>

457
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,576
<i>that normally only occurs</i>
<i>by the gravitational collapse</i>

458
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,578
<i>of super massive planets,</i>

459
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,747
<i>a hyper nova,</i>
<i>an explosion capable</i>

460
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:10,851
<i>of destroying stars</i>
<i>dozens of light years away.</i>

461
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:14,555
<i>It has the temperature</i>
<i>of 50 billion degrees Celsius,</i>

462
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,623
<i>rivaling the dawn of creation.</i>

463
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,526
<i>Just try and survive</i>
<i>that, Flugel!</i>

464
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,563
Jibril:
<i>He's right. So he</i>
<i>got me after all.</i>

465
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,264
<i>Even if I die,</i>
<i>only a fraction</i>

466
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,900
<i>of a second earlier,</i>
<i>I still lose.</i>

467
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,703
<i>I see now for the first</i>
<i>explosion was simply a ruse</i>

468
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:33,073
<i>to see if he could words</i>
<i>his opponents didn't know.</i>

469
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,708
<i>That little demonstration</i>
<i>gave him</i>

470
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,611
<i>all the information he needed</i>
<i>to set his trap for me.</i>

471
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,213
<i>He orchestrated it so that</i>
<i>everything that happened</i>

472
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,782
<i>after that</i>
<i>was just a distraction</i>

473
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:45,118
<i>to keep me entertained enough</i>
<i>to miss his true intent.</i>

474
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,452
<i>Now that I think of it,</i>

475
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,790
<i>the game was over</i>
<i>after the very first move.</i>

476
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,294
<i>These otherworldly beings,</i>
<i>no, these Imanity,</i>

477
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,263
<i>they're a terrifying race</i>
<i>of creatures.</i>

478
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,566
<i>( explosion )</i>

479
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,717
I died, didn't I?

480
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,450
Yep, welcome back.

481
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,652
First you degrade
the crap out of me,

482
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,121
then you use me as a decoy
and then just sat back

483
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,122
and watched me die?!

484
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:25,025
The inhumanity!
I mean, in‐Imanity!

485
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,627
Steph, sit and beg.

486
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:27,628
( barks )

487
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,898
How long is this
day anyway?

488
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,467
Well, I'm sure you have
a lot to complain about.

489
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,703
But if it weren't for you,
we would have lost.

490
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,939
Thanks a lot, Steph.
You're great.

491
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,541
( whimpers )

492
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,443
I was utterly defeated.

493
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,712
No matter how much
you tried to lure me,

494
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,313
in the end,
there was no way to know

495
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,683
I would answer
with "egocentric."

496
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,852
That's the kind of risk
a madman would take.

497
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,219
( chuckles lightly )

498
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,288
I am challenging God,
after all.

499
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:57,323
Could a sane
person do that?

500
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,860
You're going...
to do what?

501
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,929
Sora:
<i>It was Tet who called us</i>
<i>to this world.</i>

502
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,666
He wants us to challenge him,

503
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,434
so we'll give him a run
for his money, right?

504
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,770
<i>Now then, Jibril,</i>

505
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,638
<i>since you lost,</i>
<i>according to the pledges,</i>

506
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>everything you have</i>
<i>now belongs to us.</i>

507
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,076
<i>Oh, that's right,</i>
<i>those 40,000 books</i>

508
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,343
<i>in my tablet</i>
<i>were just bait.</i>

509
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,411
<i>Feel free to borrow it</i>

510
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,681
and read them whenever
you feel like it.

511
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,449
You can keep using
the library, too, if you want.

512
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,619
Jibril:
<i>Oh, my dear departed lord,</i>

513
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,489
oh, Artosh, he who created us
but no longer draws breath,

514
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,158
at last I achieved
the long‐held dream.

515
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:34,460
I found those worthy
to call master.

516
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,596
Those who I can
serve faithfully

517
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:37,631
with every ounce
of my being.

518
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,032
<i>Though born of Imanity,</i>

519
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,935
<i>they would command the Elves</i>
<i>and even myself,</i>

520
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:45,371
<i>overturning my preconceived</i>
<i>notion of the world.</i>

521
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,473
My masters, my lords,

522
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,444
I, Jibril of the Flugel,
ranked six in the Exceed

523
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,814
member of The Council
of Wings,

524
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:57,851
henceforth offer
my very being to you.

525
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:01,054
From now on,
I will find no greater pleasure

526
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:04,124
than carrying out your will,
my dear masters.

527
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,226
Well, all righty,
that sounds great.

528
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:07,360
Right, Shiro?

529
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,929
Mm.

530
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,531
<i>Welcome to the team.</i>

531
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,803
Okay, guys,
I've been a dog long enough!

532
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,773
I mean, I'd be dead
in dog years by now.

533
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,064
Sora:
<i>I used to be a gamer like you.</i>

534
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,866
Then I took an
arrow in the knee.

535
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,935
<i>Steph:</i>
<i>Stop it. Just stop.</i>
