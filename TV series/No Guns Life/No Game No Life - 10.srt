1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,437
We shan't allow you to fight
the Eastern Federation.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,839
Do our lives
mean nothing to you?

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,273
Man:
<i>Come out, you moron!</i>

4
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,210
<i>We know you're working</i>
<i>with the Federation!</i>

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,213
( groans )

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,916
So, um, this is nice,
sitting all together like this,

7
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,619
but why are
we here again?

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,555
You remember what I told you
after we won yesterday.

9
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:25,058
Demand number two‐
I want you, Elf.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,993
<i>Fiel, I'm gonna</i>
<i>reserve the right</i>

11
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,862
<i>to alter your memories</i>
<i>as I please.</i>

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:29,830
What?

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,899
If I'm not mistaken,
you need us to spy for you.

14
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,000
You want spies?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,569
The reason we bet
Imanity's race piece

16
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,672
is because if we did it,
it would make you, Miss Kurami,

17
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,142
<i>spy of the Elven Gard</i>
<i>come out of hiding.</i>

18
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,312
and when you did,
we could beat you in a game.

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,981
You thought that
if you could somehow

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,115
give your memories
to me during the game,

21
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,051
you could bring me
over to your side

22
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,186
without using the pledges
to force me.

23
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,055
However, even though
I agreed to help you,

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,990
I didn't see anything
in your memories

25
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,391
that would lead me
to believe that

26
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,193
you can beat
the Eastern Federation.

27
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,028
Are you sure
you can do it?

28
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,665
I said I could,
didn't I?

29
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,900
Anyway, I've brought
the lot of you here

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,669
for a very
particular reason.

31
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,538
Before we go any further,
there's something we must do.

32
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,676
This next step is crucial
to us fighting together.

33
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,678
What is it?

34
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,847
This sounds bad.

35
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:25,318
Let's get intimate, yeah!

36
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,731
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

37
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,482
What do you mean by intimate?

38
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,152
I'm going to assume
you mean introductions... hmm?

39
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,354
( giggles )

40
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,090
( clears throat )

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,627
I'm Kurami Zell,
nice to meet you.

42
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,995
That's it?

43
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,329
Shiro:
<i>Just your name?</i>

44
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,431
Steph:
<i>Don't you have</i>
<i>anything else to add?</i>

45
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,267
Sorry, that's all
I want to say.

46
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,403
Um... she's 18 years old,

47
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,739
which is the same as me,
158 centimeters tall,

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,373
her measurements
from the top are‐

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,242
Hey, stop!
That's not fair!

50
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,443
And her bras
are padded.

51
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,578
So she's actually
a size‐

52
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,616
Fine, fine! Stop! I'll do it
for real, just shut up!

53
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,918
But it doesn't make any sense
to do my introduction

54
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,820
before you hear Fiel's first.

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,590
Why, hello there, everyone,
I'm Fiel Nirvalen,

56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,359
and all of you except that
hideous demon over there

57
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,229
<i>can feel free to simply</i>
<i>call me Fiel if you like.</i>

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,899
Why, it seems you've already
become prejudiced against me.

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,702
Have I done something
to offend you, my dear?

60
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,371
Let's see.

61
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,873
<i>I suppose it might have</i>
<i>a little something to do</i>

62
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,676
<i>with the hundreds of thousands</i>
<i>of my people slaughtered</i>

63
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,745
<i>by the hands of a</i>
<i>certain filthy Flugel</i>

64
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,480
<i>during the great war...</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,616
Defendant Jibril,
your plea?

66
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,653
Goodness, I don't know
what to say.

67
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,754
<i>See, this is what happens</i>

68
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,956
<i>when forest creatures</i>
<i>learn magic.</i>

69
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,357
<i>If you dumb little animals</i>

70
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,192
<i>hadn't put an anti‐flight spell</i>
<i>over your city,</i>

71
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,861
<i>I never even would have</i>
<i>noticed you.</i>

72
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,464
<i>Your little trick brought</i>
<i>nothing but tragedy.</i>

73
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,199
I fell out of the sky
and got a big ouchy

74
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,801
on my head, you know?

75
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,503
It's not my fault that
you all ended up dying

76
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,404
for putting me
in a cranky mood.

77
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:34,741
Judgment‐ the defendant
Jibril is guilty.

78
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,709
Oh, poop!

79
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,278
Okay, since we're gonna
work together,

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,145
I don't want any hard feelings.

81
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,782
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>What could Jibril do</i>
<i>to help you forgive her?</i>

82
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,019
Okay, I'm afraid that's a very
difficult question for me.

83
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,220
Hey, Fiel...

84
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,054
Hmm?

85
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,357
Kurami:
<i>We're going to need her power</i>
<i>for Sora's plan to work.</i>

86
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,393
Could you do it
for me, at least?

87
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,928
All right,
how about...

88
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,463
you lick my feet and say,
"please forgive me,

89
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,166
M'lady Fiel," and then
I'll consider pardoning you.

90
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,702
Huh? What's this?

91
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,505
You long‐eared, tree hugging
mongrels certainly are cocky

92
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,107
considering how pitifully weak
and easy to kill you are.

93
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,443
And the verdict‐
Jibril is guilty.

94
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,145
( yells )
What now?

95
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,081
I seriously have to lick this
gross little monster's hooves?

96
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,082
Serve your sentence.

97
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,218
( gasps )
Okay...

98
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,153
( giggles )

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,922
This is the biggest
pile of bull crap,

100
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:25,425
but if that's my master's order,
then I have to obey.

101
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,929
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>( flatly )</i>
<i>Please forgive me,</i>
<i>my lady Fiel.</i>

102
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,497
Since you're so pathetic
I suppose I must.

103
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,033
Wow, that went better
than I thought.

104
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,302
My Master, licking this vulgar
forest turd's feet

105
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,704
and having to apologize

106
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,341
is surely the ultimate
humiliation, and yet, why?

107
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,776
Why, when I think that
I'm doing it

108
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,145
because you ordered me to
does it excite me so?

109
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,680
Tell me, Master...

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,348
<i>Who is Blank</i>
<i>that they're capable</i>

111
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,650
<i>of doing this to a Flugel?</i>

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,317
Steph:
<i>Excuse me!</i>

113
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,019
If we're talking about
hard feelings,

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,120
then I have my share, too.

115
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,422
That girl used Elven
magic to cheat against me

116
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,660
and I'm still super
pissed off about it!

117
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,862
( nasally )
It's your fault
for being a sucker.

118
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,596
( screams )

119
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:05,999
<i>Upon closer inspection,</i>
<i>maybe he's just a bully.</i>

120
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,537
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>Fiel is my childhood</i>
<i>best friend,</i>

121
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,139
but to be specific,
she's also my owner.

122
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,440
All:
Huh?

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,242
The kingdom of Elven Gard
is a democracy,

124
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,679
but despite that fact,
they maintain a social hierarchy

125
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,915
and promote the control
of lower‐ranked races.

126
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:22,949
To put it bluntly,

127
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,319
their society revolves
around a slave system.

128
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,522
You mean, Kurami is‐

129
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,923
That's right.

130
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,392
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>My family has been slaves</i>
<i>of the Nirvalen nobility</i>

131
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,528
<i>since my</i>
<i>great‐grandfather's era.</i>

132
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,863
<i>I was born and raised</i>
<i>among Elves.</i>

133
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,899
<i>The Nirvalen is one</i>
<i>of the most famous families</i>

134
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,669
<i>in Elven Gard and has served</i>
<i>in the senate for generations,</i>

135
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,206
<i>but Fiel never seemed</i>
<i>to care about my position.</i>

136
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,407
Fiel:
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

137
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,544
Fiel, please don't be
so nice to me anymore.

138
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,478
If you treat a slave
like me as a friend,

139
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,947
then you might
get in trouble.

140
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,282
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>But she did treat me</i>
<i>as a friend.</i>

141
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,951
That doesn't bother me.

142
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,320
Kurami:
<i>Of course, in public,</i>
<i>she can't allow herself</i>

143
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,922
<i>to show any</i>
<i>signs of it.</i>

144
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,224
To be honest, I think
the whole idea of slavery

145
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:06,092
is rather cruel
and unnecessary.

146
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,228
Since the last head
of the family passed away

147
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,195
about a year ago,

148
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,464
Fiel is now their
de facto leader.

149
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,966
So from the perspective
of society,

150
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,236
<i>our relationship has become</i>
<i>even more complicated.</i>

151
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:16,937
Wait a minute, Fiel!

152
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,972
Does that mean you're an
acting senate member now?

153
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,908
And since your sort of plotting
in secret to free the slaves,

154
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,244
wouldn't that make you
guilty of treason?

155
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,345
All:
Huh?!

156
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,080
I know, right?!
It's like a huge deal!

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,550
Yeah, a huge deal
you were actually able

158
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,984
to follow all that.

159
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,419
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna pound you.

160
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,722
Are you sure you're okay
with this, Fiel?

161
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,490
<i>Steph:</i>
<i>I mean, considering</i>
<i>your position,</i>

162
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,092
<i>aiding us could lead</i>
<i>to the destruction</i>

163
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,528
<i>of Elven Gard society</i>
<i>as you know it.</i>

164
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,797
Oh, yes, I've already
thought this through,

165
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:48,168
and I'm okay with anything so
long as Kurami doesn't get hurt.

166
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,235
( sighs )

167
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,505
I honestly don't care
in the slightest what happens

168
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,607
to my family
or that kingdom

169
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,275
because they're a bunch
of stuck‐up pricks

170
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,977
who can all die
and rot in Hell.

171
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,144
( giggles )

172
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,247
Wow, Fiel, that's a bit harsh,
don't you think?

173
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,749
Kurami's all I care about,

174
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,551
and I need to keep
her very close

175
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,620
<i>because she cries whenever</i>
<i>I'm not around.</i>

176
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,322
I don't cry!
I never cried in my life.

177
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,291
Dude, When you lost that battle
against me for the crown...

178
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,158
No, no, no!
Dude, When you lost that battle
against me for the crown...

179
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,694
No, no, no!
<i>...you were bawling</i>
<i>like a little baby.</i>

180
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,862
I did nothing of the sort!
I did not cry!

181
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,130
I had something in my eye!

182
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh dear, I was afraid
that would happen.

183
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't listen to them.
I didn't cry.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,802
Just because you've known me
since I was a baby,

185
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,404
doesn't mean you can treat me
like a kid forever, you know!

186
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,407
Kurami tries to
push herself too hard.

187
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,875
<i>Fiel:</i>
<i>Oh, there, there.</i>

188
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,745
She seems kind of more like her
nanny than her best friend.

189
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,247
Fiel:
<i>Oh, there, there.</i>
Kurami:
<i>( crying )</i>

190
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,584
Anyway, enough of this crap!

191
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,385
It's the Eastern
Federation we've got

192
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,954
to start worrying
about now, all right?

193
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,123
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>After their ruler,</i>
<i>the Shrine Priestess</i>

194
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,559
<i>came to power, they became</i>
<i>the third‐largest country</i>

195
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,628
<i>in the world</i>
<i>in less than 50 years.</i>

196
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,797
<i>No one knows how great</i>
<i>a threat they truly pose.</i>

197
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:51,898
<i>Also troubling</i>

198
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,135
<i>is their mysterious</i>
<i>blood‐destruction ability.</i>

199
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,238
<i>Have you thought</i>
<i>of some sort of plan</i>

200
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,139
<i>to deal with that?</i>

201
00:08:59,139 --> 00:08:59,740
Sora:
I'm on it.

202
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,274
But first, if we're gonna
fight together,

203
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,010
it's crucial that we be on
better terms with each other.

204
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,213
We need to strengthen
our bonds as friends.

205
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,918
And the hands down
best way to do that...

206
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,454
I'm not gonna take a bath
with you, so forget it.

207
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,789
( groans )

208
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,158
But how did you
figure out my plan?

209
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,360
Give me a break, did
that idiot seriously forget

210
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,029
that he gave me
all his memories?

211
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,965
Too bad we walked
all this way.

212
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,634
Kurami, it is very important
to have a good rapport

213
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,503
with the people you'll
be teaming up with.

214
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,604
Are you freaking kidding me?!

215
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:31,638
Yes, that's correct.

216
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,074
In the world we came from,
a land called Japan,

217
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,843
there was a traditional ritual
for getting to know each other‐

218
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,946
hanging out while naked!

219
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,549
I haven't used the pledges
to force your will in my favor,

220
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,450
thus, my only hope is
to rely on the ways

221
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,952
of traditional culture.

222
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,621
Seems to me that
all you're relying on

223
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,890
is worldly desires
and ulterior motives.

224
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,659
Jibril, please explain
our ways to the girl.

225
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,195
Ahem, the concept
of carousing while naked

226
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,998
dates to the Japanese
civil wars when‐

227
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,002
<i>So as you can see because</i>
<i>both the ancient Romans</i>

228
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,671
<i>and the modern Japanese</i>
<i>shared this unique concept</i>

229
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,672
<i>of a public bath...</i>

230
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,140
the comics became
an unlikely hit,

231
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,109
and its popularity
grew nationwide.

232
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,745
Do you understand
now, Kurami?

233
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:14,715
I'm not even sure what
we're talking about anymore.

234
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,116
Don't worry about it.

235
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,719
I'll just go ahead and
refuse for you, all right?

236
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,753
What? Uh‐

237
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,788
This is what Kurami
is really trying to say.

238
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,123
She doesn't want
to take a bath

239
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,126
because she's self‐conscious
about her tiny boobies.

240
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,060
Oh, my God!

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,062
Fiel:
<i>Oh, it's fine, Kurami.</i>

242
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,798
Don't worry, a woman's worth
is not determined by such

243
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,834
itty, bitty trivial things.

244
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,168
Fine, I'll get in the bath!

245
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,970
<i>If I do that then you'll get</i>
<i>off my back, right?</i>

246
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,139
Sora:
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

247
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,242
( yells )
Don't we have any shampoo

248
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,211
that isn't so weird
and degrading to use?

249
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,347
<i>( struggling )</i>

250
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,985
Kurami, what were you
so worried about?

251
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,920
<i>Your figure's just fine.</i>

252
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,222
You wouldn't know
'cause I wear baggy clothes.

253
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,191
Master, did you predict

254
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,126
that something
like this would happen?

255
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:00,827
But of course.

256
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,829
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Fiel I mean, M'lady Fiel,</i>

257
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,998
<i>is the magic you're using</i>
<i>on Kurami an illusion</i>

258
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,467
or did she actually
grow some tatas

259
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,434
in the last 20 minutes?

260
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,403
Kurami, he figured
it out.

261
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,506
I think it's rude to be
using magic like this

262
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,141
when we're supposed to be
bearing our true selves.

263
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,242
Oh...

264
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,045
But you said something
about an alteration yourself.

265
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,313
Sora:
<i>How gracious of you to ask.</i>

266
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:24,050
( clears throat )
Is it possible to
turn me into a girl?

267
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,986
Then I too would be able
to bond with you ladies

268
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,853
without worrying about‐

269
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,821
Hey, what are you doing?!

270
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,023
Why, I sure can!
Stop it!

271
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,558
Well, lets get cracking!

272
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,058
Fiel:
<i>But it's permanent.</i>

273
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,860
<i>so I won't be able</i>
<i>to turn you back.</i>

274
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,729
<i>Is that okay?</i>

275
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,598
Unacceptable.

276
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:40,366
Woman:
<i>Well, they certainly seem</i>
<i>energetic, don't they?</i>

277
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,604
<i>And it's delightful to think</i>
<i>that there's still some Imanity</i>

278
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:47,974
<i>foolish enough to challenge us,</i>
<i>wouldn't you agree, Ino?</i>

279
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,110
Ino:
Wholeheartedly, My Lady.

280
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,314
Woman:
We shall soon see how well their
brash demeanor serves them.

281
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,985
You two have
but one responsibility

282
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,789
<i>I hope you are</i>
<i>well‐prepared, Izuna.</i>

283
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,931
Hey, Sora!

284
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,266
We didn't even get
a chance to talk today.

285
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,202
Ugh, where the heck
did he disappear to now?

286
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,106
Sora? Huh?

287
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,480
Wow, so your strategy
is to read books in the dark?

288
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,815
Super awesome plan.

289
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,652
Honestly, this is Shiro's
area of expertise.

290
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:32,686
It's pretty beyond me.

291
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm just here
to keep her company.

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,190
So in the meantime,
I'm just reviewing today's bath.

293
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,993
( gasps )
If you're expecting me
to get all flustered like

294
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,295
that Steph weirdo,
it's not gonna happen!

295
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,163
Sora:
<i>Too late, You're blushing.</i>

296
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>And you've assumed</i>
<i>the stance of a Steph.</i>

297
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,903
You came to ask me if I think
we can win or not, didn't you?

298
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,906
Yes, I suppose I did.

299
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,708
<i>I've reviewed</i>
<i>your memories closely,</i>

300
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,341
<i>and from what I've seen,</i>

301
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,378
<i>all your victories have been</i>
<i>extremely close calls.</i>

302
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,146
<i>Like I said earlier,</i>
<i>this time,</i>

303
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,182
<i>you're fighting</i>
<i>the Eastern Federation.</i>

304
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:06,219
<i>You can't rely on chance.</i>
<i>One misstep and you're doomed.</i>

305
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,222
I don't think that you can
win the same way again.

306
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,125
Okay, so I'll just have
to avoid making any missteps.

307
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,259
Can you honestly be sure

308
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,228
that you won't make
a single mistake?

309
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,464
( laughs )
No, that's impossible.

310
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,302
If it were just me,
I'd screw up for sure, but, see,

311
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,370
Blank is a whole
different matter.

312
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,287
Huh?

313
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,107
Sora:
<i>If I make a mistake,</i>
<i>Shiro pulls through.</i>

314
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,744
That way, the two of us
safeguard each other.

315
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:31,678
Oh.

316
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,179
What's the matter?

317
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,949
Don't you want to be friends
with me anymore, Kurami?

318
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,985
That's not it at all,
but if they find out about us,

319
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,721
and something bad
happens to you,

320
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,623
then I'd never
forgive myself.

321
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,257
As long as we stick together,

322
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,359
you don't have
to worry about that.

323
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:46,860
Huh?

324
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,028
If I ever make a mistake,

325
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,164
I know that you'll
be there to help me out.

326
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,367
Kurami, it would be perfect
if you were always by my side,

327
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,302
looking out for any mistake
I might make.

328
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,306
Then I'd never have to worry
about losing the person I love.

329
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,843
( sighs )

330
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:07,213
That thing you said just now,

331
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,650
did you get that
from my memories?

332
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,551
Maybe.

333
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:13,019
Anyway, the point you're trying
to make is that I wouldn't be

334
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,788
doubting you so much
if I could see

335
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,857
your sister's memories
along with yours.

336
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,091
I get it.

337
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,228
You've really found
your wings, haven't you?

338
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,329
Hmm?

339
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,634
Hey, Shiro, they say anyone
can change their fate.

340
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,870
I wonder if that's true.

341
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,304
( gasps )

342
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,773
It's a little cheesy
and all,

343
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,708
but I think the
sentiment is nice.

344
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,442
You should be proud
of yourself.

345
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,410
Sh‐sh‐shut up!

346
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,046
It must be hard to have
such a talented sister.

347
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,982
You've got your pride
to think of.

348
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,484
Don't let it get
you down, Big Bro.

349
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,019
Get out of here already!

350
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,288
If you stay in Elkia too long,
people will talk.

351
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,490
Tomorrow's the day,
isn't it?

352
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,958
Huh?

353
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:55,461
I want you to know
I'll be rooting for humanity.

354
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,631
Of course you will.

355
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,566
You're human, too, you dummy.

356
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,242
Here he comes!

357
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,377
Man:
<i>You've got some nerve, asshole!</i>

358
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,014
Man:
<i>Bastards like</i>
<i>you don't deserve the crown!</i>

359
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,716
Man:
<i>Let's kick his ass!</i>

360
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,483
( giggles )

361
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,085
W‐what?

362
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,521
Steph:
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>we're just leaving</i>

363
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:22,523
<i>through the</i>
<i>front gate like this.</i>

364
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:23,790
You two must be insane!

365
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,659
Can't you see
the people are rioting?

366
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,328
Sora:
<i>Oh, I can see it.</i>
<i>I started it, after all.</i>

367
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,231
Steph:
Uh, what do
you mean by that?

368
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,934
Well, looks like they made room
for us, so no worries.

369
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,502
Let's head off, shall we?

370
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,838
First stop‐
to visit Izuna's house!

371
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:38,805
Let's go!

372
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,742
Steph:
<i>Why are you ignoring me?!</i>

373
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,243
( crowd shouting angrily )

374
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,691
Welcome, we have been
expecting you.

375
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,227
<i>Ino:</i>
<i>Now then, while the game</i>
<i>is being prepared,</i>

376
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,530
<i>we ask that you</i>
<i>please wait here.</i>

377
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,567
Okay, but don't forget
to let the audience in.

378
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,473
You're still feeling up
to this, right, Shiro?

379
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,175
All green here.

380
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,877
And how about
you, Jibril?

381
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,344
I am an ultimate weapon.

382
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,581
How I feel has no relevance
to the situation.

383
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,483
Simply say the word and I will
most graciously give you my all.

384
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,753
( gags )
I don't feel too good.

385
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,956
Oh, by the way, Steph,
remember that game we played

386
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,792
<i>where I threw rocks</i>
<i>at those birds?</i>

387
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,127
Well, you still owe me
something for losing that one.

388
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,529
( sighs )

389
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,664
Hey, Jibril,
can you keep the Warbeasts

390
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,633
from hearing what we're talking
about for a little while?

391
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,635
Jibril:
<i>Certainly.</i>

392
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,605
I can surround you and Dolly
in a spirit barrier

393
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,107
to keep the sound
from getting out.

394
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,142
All righty then, Steph.

395
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:53,079
I'm going to cast
a very special spell on you.

396
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,782
Oh, no, I've got a
bad feeling about this.

397
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,552
<i>( crowd cheering )</i>

398
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,156
( crowd murmuring )

399
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:13,033
Now everyone, please take a seat
in your designated booth.

400
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,605
( whimpers )

401
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,109
Before we begin today,
allow me to review the contents

402
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,645
of each party's pledge.

403
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:27,313
<i>Ino:</i>
<i>The Eastern Federation</i>
<i>bets everything it owns</i>

404
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,216
<i>on the Lucia continent.</i>

405
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,787
<i>And the kingdom of Elkia</i>
<i>bets its race piece.</i>

406
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:36,623
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>all the rights of Imanity,</i>

407
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,092
<i>their territory,</i>
<i>and everything they possess</i>

408
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,460
<i>is on the line.</i>

409
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,029
<i>The game designated</i>
<i>by the Eastern Federation</i>

410
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,931
<i>is between our chosen</i>
<i>representative</i>

411
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,000
<i>and the two rulers</i>
<i>of Elkia,</i>

412
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,735
<i>along with</i>
<i>their two attendants.</i>

413
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,905
<i>The game will be conducted</i>
<i>with these five players.</i>

414
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,841
Should the Eastern Federation
win, as is our custom,

415
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,011
it will demand that all
memories regarding the contents

416
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:00,113
of this game be forgotten
by the members

417
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,048
of the opposing party.

418
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,617
This includes all
of the players

419
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:07,053
as well as all Imanity
viewing the game.

420
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,022
Also, the rules will not
be explained

421
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,456
until the game has begun.

422
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,593
So then, once you
hear the rules

423
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,728
and decide you do not
want to participate,

424
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,097
the match will become
null and void

425
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,565
and your memories
of it wiped.

426
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,702
Are you absolutely certain
you want to proceed?

427
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,937
Oh, yeah, sure,
it all sounds great.

428
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,007
But there are two things
I want to make clear first.

429
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,809
One‐ if we decide
to default,

430
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,711
all we lose are
the memories of the game.

431
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,446
If your true goal was to create
some impossible game

432
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,916
so that you can wipe
us clean of our memories,

433
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,483
you better give it up now.

434
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,418
Hmm...

435
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,121
<i>And two‐ if we catch</i>
<i>you cheating during the game,</i>

436
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,156
<i>it's grounds for</i>
<i>an immediate loss.</i>

437
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,158
<i>Well, that's one</i>
<i>of the ten pledges,</i>

438
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,160
<i>so I'm sure I don't have</i>
<i>to remind you,</i>

439
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,761
<i>but I'll be watching.</i>

440
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,430
Very well! I will interpret
that as an agreement

441
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,799
and ask that you
state the pledge.

442
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,569
All:
Aschente!

443
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,304
Aschente. Thank you.

444
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,015
Let's do this, Izuna.

445
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,483
( sighs )

446
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:18,959
Hmm...

447
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,528
I won't lose to losers.
Thank you.

448
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,964
Hey, there, Izuna...

449
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,298
Yes, what now, please?

450
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:29,069
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>When's the last time you really</i>
<i>had fun playing a game?</i>

451
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,137
Huh?

452
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,140
Now then, are all
of you ready to begin?

453
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,010
Okay, Shiro,
don't let go of my hand.

454
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,512
You neither.

455
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:42,448
Sora:
All right,
let's start this game up!

456
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,219
( whimpers )

457
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,392
( chuckles )

458
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>I sense the presence</i>
<i>of magic.</i>

459
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,465
<i>Ino:</i>
<i>Kurami Zell?</i>
<i>What's she doing here?</i>

460
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,234
<i>And there's someone else.</i>

461
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,938
( laughs )
Aw, you're trying to
pretend you didn't notice.

462
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,841
But I saw your ears move
when you felt my magic.

463
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:10,577
Kurami:
<i>Fiel, it doesn't</i>
<i>look like we'll be able</i>

464
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,713
<i>to interfere with</i>
<i>the game from here.</i>

465
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,581
Fiel:
<i>Yes, it's okay.</i>
<i>I'm aware.</i>

466
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,316
<i>What's more important</i>
<i>is the fact</i>

467
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,384
<i>that we're watching</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

468
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,453
Kurami:
<i>Right, so the</i>
<i>Eastern Federation</i>

469
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,423
<i>can't use any</i>
<i>obvious cheats.</i>

470
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,528
<i>Sora... I hope you</i>
<i>know what you're doing.</i>

471
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:29,530
Ino: <i>So he's</i>
<i>sharing information</i>

472
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,699
<i>with the Elves,</i>
<i>then, little shit.</i>

473
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,569
<i>You think you're quite</i>
<i>clever, don't you, boy?</i>

474
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,437
<i>But you're nothing</i>
<i>more than a fool</i>

475
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,106
<i>if you think the Warbeasts</i>
<i>would allow you</i>

476
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,342
<i>to beat us</i>
<i>at our own game.</i>

477
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,347
Are you sure we're really
going to be okay?

478
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,315
I have a feeling
we might not win this one.

479
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,651
Come on, Steph,

480
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,653
do you need me to repeat
what I told you earlier?

481
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:55,221
Don't you remember why I said
I needed to start that riot?

482
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,858
Could you please not answer my
question with another question?!

483
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,693
Sora:
<i>I need the people</i>
<i>of Elkia to be angry</i>

484
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,562
<i>because I don't want</i>
<i>an audience who's sure</i>

485
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,996
<i>that we can win this thing.</i>

486
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:05,231
<i>The way it is now,</i>
<i>everyone is watching us</i>

487
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,667
<i>as hard as they can,</i>

488
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,469
<i>making sure we don't</i>
<i>lose on purpose.</i>

489
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,172
<i>As a result, it's harder</i>
<i>for the Eastern Federation</i>

490
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,607
<i>to use obvious cheats.</i>

491
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,308
<i>There's no more</i>
<i>trusted observer</i>

492
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,410
<i>than someone</i>
<i>who suspects you.</i>

493
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,080
How very crafty
of you, master.

494
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,182
Sora:
<i>I'm sure they're</i>
<i>gonna try to use</i>

495
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:23,016
<i>as many tricks as they can,</i>

496
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,919
<i>and with their Warbeast</i>
<i>abilities at their disposal,</i>

497
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,655
<i>we're gonna need an observant</i>
<i>audience to watch our backs.</i>

498
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,558
Victory will depend
on how quickly we can react

499
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,459
to the expected
and unexpected

500
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,262
and how we can use both
to our advantage.

501
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,664
( gasps )

502
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,169
Uh, Jesus Christ!

503
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,572
Steph:
Where in the world are we?

504
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,610
Well, I've never seen anything
quite like this before.

505
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,378
It's so loud and colorful.

506
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,580
Master, where are you...

507
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,417
Oh, dear, Master,
what's wrong with you?

508
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,186
( weakly )
We're all doomed.

509
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,422
This is impossible.

510
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,490
Sorry, Imanity's finished.

511
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,528
Are you friggin' serious,
after all that smack talk?!

512
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,196
I'm sorry, I didn't expect it
to be set in Tokyo!

513
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,231
I can't do anything here!

514
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,833
It's our home
and we're the away team!

515
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,536
We can't help you, I'm sorry.
Please handle this on your own.

516
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,504
We can't do it.
Try to understand, I'm so sorry.

517
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:18,171
<i>Please forgive us!</i>

518
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,906
Steph:
<i>What the hell?</i>

519
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,933
Sora:
<i>No doubt in my mind!</i>
<i>I believe in you, Shiro!</i>

520
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,001
<i>You can do it!</i>
