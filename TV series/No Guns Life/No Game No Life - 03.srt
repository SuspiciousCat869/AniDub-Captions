1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,804
Man:
<i>Your attention, everyone.</i>

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,607
Having won all of her games
thus far in the tournament,

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,175
Kurami Zell
awaits her next opponent.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,444
Is there anyone left
who is up to the challenge?

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,180
Stephanie:
Sora, wait,
you can't be serious.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,616
You're gonna crash
the coronation?

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,984
Hey, I just scored
a new life in this world.

8
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,220
I can't lose my place
to live that quickly.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,455
Stephanie:
Yeah, but‐

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,859
Now then, I think it's time
for me to become king

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,529
and take back
our lost territory!

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

13
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,292
If there are no other
challengers,

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,795
I shall proceed with the former
King's final wish

15
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,165
and crown Kurami Zell
as our new ruler.

16
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,735
<i>Should anyone wish to protest,</i>
<i>speak now‐</i>

17
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,269
Sora:
<i>Objection!</i>

18
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,337
( crowd gasps )

19
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,074
You heard me!
( annunciated ) Objection!

20
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,042
( chuckles )

21
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:24,878
So, are you saying
that you request

22
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,112
to be her next challenger?

23
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:26,880
Yep.

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,481
( crowd gasps )

25
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,617
Despite your loss, you're still
desperate enough to win

26
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,253
that you're sending
your butler after me?

27
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,121
In case you hadn't noticed,
Little Princess,

28
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,923
this isn't a playground.

29
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,125
Yeah, and it's not the place
to hand over the throne

30
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,028
to some con artist either,
especially one

31
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,964
who's getting help
from another country.

32
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,099
( all murmur )

33
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,234
Sora:
Well, Shiro?
Shiro:
There's one.

34
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,304
Anyone else
hiding their ears?
Nope.

35
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:55,475
Kurami:
<i>That strange device,</i>
<i>they used it before.</i>

36
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,644
And just what
do you mean by that?

37
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,515
Oh, come on now, let's say,
for example, if the crown

38
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,584
was given to someone
in cahoots with the Elves,

39
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,687
Elkia would be pretty much
screwed, right guys?

40
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,054
( all murmur )

41
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,490
What exactly
is the meaning of this?

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,826
So what, is this
your pathetic attempt

43
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:13,660
at accusing me
of cheating?

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,330
Calm down. I clearly
said "for example."

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,867
Or maybe it actually rings
a bell for you, huh?

46
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,604
Fine then, since
you've made your objection,

47
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,907
I suppose I'll have
to humor you with a game,
is what you want?

48
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,109
Yay! Thanks, Madam.
I'd really appreciate that.

49
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,410
But, but Miss‐

50
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,445
One thing,
if we're playing poker again,

51
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,481
maybe this time, you should ask
your friend to leave.

52
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,652
I'm sorry to have
to do this, but...

53
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,854
There's an elf here!
What the hell's going on?!

54
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,190
So these two witches
were working together?!

55
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,191
Nothing to say?

56
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,829
The pretty swindler's gonna
abandon her partner in crime?

57
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,896
How cruel.

58
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,464
I get it.

59
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,534
So you've teamed up
with some random elf

60
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,503
to try to make me out
to be an enemy of Imanity,
is that it?

61
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,740
(chuckles)
Pretty good deflection,
I must admit.

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,877
Perhaps it's best you left.
Elves have no place here.

63
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,648
There.
You satisfied?

64
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,750
Sure am.
Ready to play now?

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,019
As you're likely aware
as stated by the pledges,

66
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,888
I get to decide the game.

67
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:15,722
But no need to worry.

68
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,891
I'll choose a game
where cheating is impossible.

69
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,460
Pledge number five,
the challenged party

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,597
has the right to decide
the content of the game, huh?

71
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,265
Dang, no poker this time?

72
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,833
Well, since
I'm such a nice guy,

73
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,069
I won't bother asking
about your reasons.

74
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,104
Say cheese!

75
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,638
Hmm.

76
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,640
Wow, you're not really
photogenic.

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,910
If you smiled once in a while,
you'd be a lot cuter.

78
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,313
We'll hold the game
in another venue.

79
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,216
I'll call for you
once it's prepared.

80
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,986
Stephanie:
Wait, you're telling me
she used magic to beat me?!

81
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,421
Hey, will you keep it down
a little bit?

82
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,223
That's right,
Shiro and I both noticed

83
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,058
when we saw your game
at the tavern.

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,393
Don't you mean
I noticed?

85
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,161
Don't sweat
the small stuff, Sis.

86
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,530
So that's what
it does then,

87
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,131
that special secret tool
of yours

88
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,533
is for detecting magic,
isn't it?

89
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,468
So how'd they do it?
What kind of magic
did that Elf use?

90
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,170
No idea, sugar pants.

91
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,371
( yelps )

92
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,107
Magic's amazing, isn't it?

93
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,475
If you could change cards
when they're face‐down,

94
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,877
we could never prove it.

95
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,445
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Under normal circumstances,</i>

96
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,848
<i>there's essentially</i>
<i>no way to beat her.</i>

97
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,684
Shiro:
Why do you think we didn't
challenge her before?

98
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,988
Look, Steph, I'll break it down
as simply as I can for you.

99
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,491
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>First of all, this round‐robin</i>
<i>style tournament to become king</i>

100
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,661
<i>is pretty jacked up</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

101
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,996
<i>Let's say a country partners</i>
<i>up with an Imanity</i>

102
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,632
<i>with the promise</i>
<i>of becoming king.</i>

103
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,767
<i>From there on, they can</i>
<i>manipulate the games.</i>

104
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,235
<i>They'll play against</i>
<i>other Imanities</i>

105
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,404
<i>who also can't detect magic,</i>
<i>so it's a guaranteed win.</i>

106
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,906
<i>Now that they've got</i>
<i>a puppet king,</i>

107
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,108
<i>they can pretty much do</i>
<i>whatever the heck</i>

108
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,243
<i>they want with Elkia.</i>

109
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:43,877
<i>The plan's so simple,</i>

110
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,714
<i>even a baby</i>
<i>could've dreamt it up.</i>

111
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,251
But then, guess what the other
countries start thinking.

112
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,319
So what do you think
we should do now?

113
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,857
Kurami:
There's nothing to worry about.
He's just another Imanity.

114
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,125
Even if he's probably getting
help from another race,

115
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,426
so am I.

116
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,163
It's not like
I didn't expect this.

117
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:06,299
Kurami, do you really think
you'll be able to handle

118
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,801
playing the games
without me?

119
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,738
Kurami:
(scoffs)
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

120
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,707
Stephanie:
So you really think
it's possible that Kurami

121
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,542
has convinced herself
that we're getting help

122
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,710
from another race?

123
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,580
Sora:
Yeah, by now
she probably realizes

124
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,181
that Elkia is caught
in a diplomatic war

125
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,349
between other nations.
Steph:
Then we're in luck.

126
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,351
She can't use magic again
since she'll think

127
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,854
other races will be watching,
ah‐ha!

128
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,289
So she'll have to play fair
and square,

129
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,125
and it'll be impossible
for her to cheat using magic!

130
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,561
(groan)
It's all sunshine
and flowers in your head!

131
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,663
Just crush my optimism,
why don't you?

132
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,431
I'm sure they expected it.

133
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,966
Another country
was bound to intervene.

134
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,768
But I'll bet this time,
they'll use some spell

135
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,403
or mind trick
we can't detect.

136
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,305
If we can't even spot
their regular tricks,

137
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,573
then we're totally doomed.

138
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,742
They'll lay out a game
that looks fair on the surface

139
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,444
so it doesn't seem
completely hopeless.

140
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,780
But they won't use
their magic directly on us,

141
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,616
like screwing with
our vision or memories,

142
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,183
because it'll be too obvious.

143
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:57,651
In other words,

144
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,853
it won't be completely
impossible to win.

145
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,288
So is that supposed
to make me feel better?

146
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,390
As long as there
is some path to victory,

147
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,325
no matter how small...

148
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,129
Then you can bet your sweet
fanny that Blank won't lose.

149
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,230
There you go.

150
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,533
( chokes )
Hmm?

151
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,737
Kurami:
<i>Let me be honest with you guys.</i>

152
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,905
<i>The only reason I struck</i>
<i>a deal with the Elves</i>

153
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,542
<i>was to secure a place</i>
<i>for Imanity to live</i>

154
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,143
<i>after I've won the tournament.</i>

155
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,812
Once we've acquired
a fair amount of territory,

156
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,913
I'll cut ties
with the Elves for good.

157
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,315
Sora:
Oh, jeez.
Shiro:
Oh, jeez.

158
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,083
I know she's dumb,

159
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,586
but you didn't have
to say it out loud, Sis.

160
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,954
So you know,
we might be spies,

161
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,557
and yet you're still
telling us your plan‐ cuckoo!

162
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,626
Think about it,
the only way for us to survive

163
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,695
is to win the right
to live under the protection

164
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,164
of a powerful nation,
give up on games,

165
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,732
and close off our borders.

166
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,035
There's no other choice,
right, Little Princess?

167
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,838
You of all people
should understand that.

168
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,839
Well, I‐

169
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,576
Kurami:
<i>What's more, Elven Gard</i>
<i>currently comprises</i>

170
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,410
<i>the largest nation</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

171
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,146
<i>and not a single race has been</i>
<i>able to defeat their magic.</i>

172
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,215
<i>It's impossible</i>
<i>for you to beat me,</i>

173
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,451
<i>so it's in your best interest</i>
<i>just to withdraw from the game.</i>

174
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,387
I swear to all Imanity
that I won't let

175
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,389
the Elves make me
their puppet.

176
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,757
Sora...

177
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,626
Okay, not a bad plan.

178
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,495
We live quietly under
another nation's wing.

179
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,230
Sounds pretty promising.

180
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,764
Doesn't it?

181
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,265
That's why you should withdraw‐

182
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,568
But I refuse!

183
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,004
You know one of the things
Blank loves best?

184
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,872
Both:
Telling people "no"
and shutting them down

185
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,708
when they think
they've already run the game,

186
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,744
then telling them
they can go screw themselves!

187
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,380
Number four
on our list of things

188
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,949
we always wanted
to say someday!

189
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:39,052
Sweet, we did it!
Yeah, we're so awesome.

190
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,889
It appears that reasoning
with you is a waste of time.

191
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:46,259
Then just as you wish,
I will make you yield by force.

192
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,162
<i>It's your funeral.</i>

193
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,899
But, Sora, why not?
Why what?

194
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,168
That plan she was
just talking about,

195
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:55,936
it kind of makes sense

196
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,904
given the desperate
situation we're in.

197
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,607
(sighs)
Steph, look, don't you think
it's about time

198
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,309
you learned to stop being
so trusting of people?

199
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,111
For one,
what proof do we have

200
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,013
that anything she said
is even true?

201
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,883
Second, if she's so confident
that she can win,

202
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,519
then why did she ask us
to withdraw?

203
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,021
And third, even
if anything she said was true,

204
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,523
I could be a spy
from another country,

205
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:19,292
and anyone dumb enough to spill
their plan shouldn't be ruling.

206
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,696
Okay, fourth, if we play along
and she does any digging on us,

207
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,666
we're totally screwed,
<i>comprende?</i>

208
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,333
Wow, you really
put a lot of thought

209
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,869
into that speech,
didn't you?

210
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:33,039
(sighs)
Look, those are just details.

211
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,909
Don't sell humanity short.

212
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,811
We're better than that.

213
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,789
Chess?

214
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,657
That's right,
but this isn't

215
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,025
your normal game of chess.

216
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,027
<i>Each piece</i>
<i>has a will of its own.</i>

217
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,763
<i>Give them orders,</i>
<i>and they'll move.</i>

218
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,633
<i>Think of them</i>
<i>as your own personal army.</i>

219
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,267
( chuckles )

220
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,005
So that's how this works.
Shiro, what's the plan?

221
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:09,710
Chess is no different
than a game of tic‐tac‐toe.

222
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,013
So, like, it's cool
if we rotate mid‐game right?

223
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,915
Sora‐
I'm not trying
to be difficult,

224
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,117
but the two of us count
as a single player.

225
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,553
Plus you seem to be pretty
familiar with this game already

226
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,689
whereas we don't
have a clue. Cheese!

227
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,390
Kurami:
<i>They'll never figure this out.</i>

228
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,226
You may do whatever you wish.

229
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,095
But why? Do you think
I'm going to lose?

230
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,097
Hey,
don't take it personally.

231
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:35,437
Hell would freeze over before
you ever lost a game of chess.

232
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:38,371
<i>But this isn't</i>
<i>the game you're used to.</i>

233
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,908
And don't forget, combined,
we're a single player.

234
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,577
Blank is both of us.

235
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:47,347
You're right, I know.
I'll be careful.

236
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,816
Let's go.
Right.

237
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,952
Finished
with your little chat?

238
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,187
<i>I'll let you make</i>
<i>the first move.</i>

239
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,660
And the game
is officially underway.

240
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,862
All:
Aschente!

241
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,004
Kurami...

242
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,743
D‐2 to D‐4.

243
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,883
Sora:
<i>Chess favors</i>
<i>the first player.</i>

244
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,985
<i>If both players</i>
<i>always pick their best moves,</i>

245
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,921
<i>then the first player</i>
<i>has a higher chance of winning.</i>

246
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,792
There's no way she's
not aware of that fact.
What the‐
it moved by itself.

247
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,695
G‐7, advance.

248
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,004
Stephanie:
But it moved three spaces!
That isn't fair!

249
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,672
Kurami:
<i>Weren't you listening?</i>

250
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,808
In this game,
the pieces have wills

251
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,210
entirely of their own.
( chuckles )

252
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,211
Now I get it.

253
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,514
The players' traits
affect their moves,

254
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:57,383
stuff like charisma and one's
potential leadership skills.

255
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,652
You're a quick learner.

256
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,988
It's the perfect game to decide
the next king, don't you think?

257
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,891
Knight, please
move to C‐3.

258
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,329
Now F7, forward.

259
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,034
Just "forward"?
That's kind of vague.

260
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,035
What kind of move's
that supposed to be?

261
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,703
Just shut up and watch.

262
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,072
Shiro:
<i>E‐2 to E‐4.</i>

263
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,709
F‐5, forward
to take her piece.

264
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,578
Sora: Let's not forget,
F‐5, forward
to take her piece.

265
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,713
once Shiro's deep into a game,

266
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,814
<i>her concentration</i>
<i>is unbreakable.</i>

267
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,650
<i>her concentration</i>
<i>is unbreakable.</i>
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>Knight take H‐3.</i>

268
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,852
<i>That's how</i>
<i>even my little sister</i>

269
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,354
<i>has the power</i>
<i>to defeat a god.</i>

270
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,422
Queen to H‐5.

271
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,560
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>Check.</i>

272
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,261
Wow, Shiro's amazing!

273
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,597
Even with Kurami
sidestepping the rules,

274
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,231
Shiro's totally
destroying her.

275
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,233
It's not that amazing
when you think about it.

276
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,402
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Take a game of shogi,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

277
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,404
<i>It's entirely possible</i>
<i>for a top player</i>

278
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,173
<i>to defeat their opponent</i>
<i>using nothing</i>

279
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,175
<i>but their King and Pawns.</i>

280
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,377
<i>Simply bypassing</i>
<i>a few rules isn't enough</i>

281
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,312
<i>to defeat a true master.</i>

282
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,815
F‐2, move to F‐4.

283
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,449
Sora:
<i>However...</i>

284
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,186
Shiro:
<i>F‐2, move to F‐4.</i>

285
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,055
Wait, why isn't it moving?

286
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,657
I knew this would happen.

287
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,158
Mind filling me in?

288
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,528
What's different
about this chess game

289
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,297
<i>is that sometimes,</i>
<i>the pieces won't move.</i>

290
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,031
Steph:
<i>What?</i>

291
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,533
Sora:
<i>No soldier would willingly</i>

292
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,667
<i>put themselves in a situation</i>

293
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,235
<i>that would result</i>
<i>in their death.</i>

294
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,937
<i>They are either need</i>
<i>a fantastic leader</i>

295
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,472
<i>or extraordinarily</i>
<i>high morale.</i>

296
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,074
Steph:
<i>But that means‐</i>

297
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,943
Sora:
<i>Correct, she's incapable</i>

298
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,112
<i>of sacrificing</i>
<i>any of her pieces.</i>

299
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,183
Kurami:
<i>Better make your move.</i>

300
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,553
Otherwise,
you're going to run out of time.

301
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,123
Now, knight, take H‐7.

302
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:50,964
A‐2, move to A‐3.

303
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,201
Bishop, forward.

304
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,370
Hurry and take out
the opponent's knight.

305
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,844
And Knight, take H‐5.

306
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,915
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>D‐4 to D‐5.</i>

307
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,652
( chuckles )

308
00:14:11,652 --> 00:14:13,554
Shiro:
<i>(weakly)</i>
<i>A‐3...</i>

309
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,025
Bishop...

310
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,696
I'm... sorry...

311
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,230
Shiro.

312
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,701
Sora, I can't do it.

313
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,603
<i>( crying )</i>

314
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,441
I'm really, really sorry.

315
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,887
Sora? Shiro?

316
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,824
Sora?

317
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,859
( inhales deeply )

318
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:58,264
Attention, all forces!

319
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,268
As your King, I hereby declare,
those who fight bravely...

320
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,872
(inhales)
will be heroes
and win the right to get it on

321
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,440
with any woman they like!

322
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,177
Also, all you soldiers fighting
on the front line, if we win,

323
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,780
you will be relieved
of any further military duties.

324
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,182
<i>I'll make sure that you're</i>
<i>exempt from paying taxes,</i>

325
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,085
and you'll be handsomely
compensated by your country!

326
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,756
Therefore, fellow virgins,
you must not die!

327
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,857
(wave crashes)

328
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,926
<i>And to all of you</i>
<i>who have family</i>

329
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,460
<i>and other loved ones</i>
<i>back home,</i>

330
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,564
<i>I promise you will</i>
<i>all come back alive!</i>

331
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,067
( all shout )

332
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,072
But wait, you can't really
promise them that!

333
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,207
Thanks to you,

334
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,210
I realized this game
wasn't real chess.

335
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,312
<i>We gotta think of it</i>
<i>as a strategy game.</i>

336
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,082
I'll take it from here,
but if I start losing it,

337
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,851
feel free to jump in, okay?

338
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:56,189
Now watch, 'cause games like
this are totally my specialty.

339
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,191
Attention,
Pawn Squad Six!

340
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,960
The enemy's moving
from the front line!

341
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,162
Strike first
and cut them off!

342
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,699
He can't do that!

343
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:06,967
Now cavalry squad two,

344
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,102
<i>the pawns made an opening,</i>
<i>so move in!</i>

345
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,270
King and queen, listen up!

346
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,338
Hurry and move your asses
to the front line!

347
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,141
Kurami:
Hey, wait a minute,
it's supposed to be my turn!

348
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,242
Sorry, but in a real war,

349
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,312
what fool waits
for their enemy's turn?

350
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,916
Pawn Squad, advance
and form a defensive wall!

351
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,449
Ha, see that?

352
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,051
Just a couple
of cowardly monarchs

353
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,554
<i>hiding themselves</i>
<i>behind their own soldiers.</i>

354
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,523
<i>What kind of ruler</i>
<i>lets their men die</i>

355
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,692
<i>on the front line while</i>
<i>they sit behind and watch?!</i>

356
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:32,893
Kurami:
<i>Ignore him!</i>

357
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,661
Listen, soldiers,
listen, friends,

358
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,498
this battle decides the outcome
of Elkia, of humanity!

359
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,301
<i>The city represents the final</i>
<i>bastion for our people,</i>

360
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,437
<i>and the fate of everyone</i>
<i>now rests in your hands!</i>

361
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,972
Open your eyes!

362
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,841
Do you honestly want
to risk your lives

363
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,076
and your people's future
by handing over the crown

364
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,945
to some shifty charlatan
like her?!

365
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:55,481
But if we come together and win,
then she will be your queen,

366
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,384
this girl who mere moments ago
gathered all of her courage

367
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,654
in her little heart
to march you towards victory,

368
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,756
this girl, who is crying
on the inside

369
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:06,426
because you wrongly accused her
of being a merciless tyrant!

370
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,663
<i>And you bastards</i>
<i>call yourselves men?!</i>

371
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:11,197
( all shout )

372
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,433
What is this?
Where'd this power come from?

373
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,637
Proud knights, bishops,
and rooks, now is your chance!

374
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,672
<i>Prove to me that you live up</i>
<i>to your rank.</i>

375
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:22,643
Give the pawns support
and crush the enemy's defenses!

376
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,045
This can't be happening.
It's impossible.

377
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,379
Should be, right?

378
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,081
<i>I figured</i>
<i>you're using Elf magic</i>

379
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,383
<i>to force the morale</i>
<i>of your troops higher.</i>

380
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,952
It would be easy
to just claim

381
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:33,987
you have more charisma
than we do.

382
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:34,555
Who wouldn't?

383
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,523
It's not like anyone
can prove it.

384
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,125
Unfortunately, you made
one giant mistake.

385
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,561
And what was that?
Throughout all of history,

386
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,463
<i>the wisest of kings know</i>
<i>that an army will not obey</i>

387
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,031
<i>oppressive or tyrannical rule.</i>

388
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,134
<i>People will only fight for what</i>
<i>they believe is truly right,</i>

389
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:50,270
<i>and in this world,</i>
<i>there is only one thing</i>

390
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,105
<i>that is absolutely,</i>
<i>truly right!</i>

391
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,940
What is he talking about?

392
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,275
The one eternal truth,

393
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,646
the one virtue to rule
the whole world is cuteness!

394
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,181
Cute is the world!

395
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,383
Our instincts and desires
are driven by it!

396
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,086
And for it,
we'll give everything!

397
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,055
Sorry, but that's just
the way us men are!

398
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,525
But that's... ridiculous!

399
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,362
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>I still don't know</i>
<i>which race is helping them,</i>

400
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,865
<i>so if I do this,</i>
<i>they might find me out.</i>

401
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,466
But I have no choice.

402
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,574
Now, king,
move forward to E‐6!

403
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,892
What the heck just happened
to that piece?

404
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,598
Sora:
<i>This is bad.</i>

405
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,834
Everyone, retreat!
All forces, pull back!

406
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:56,002
<i>The enemy's using</i>
<i>brainwashing magic!</i>

407
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,203
Kurami:
<i>He knows.</i>

408
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,039
Can someone explain
this to me, please?

409
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,574
Sora:
Don't let the opponent
touch you.
Kurami:

410
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,743
<i>Get the hell outta there!</i>
<i>They don't know</i>
<i>how I'm doing it.</i>

411
00:19:02,743 --> 00:19:03,910
<i>(laughs)</i>

412
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,481
<i>As long as they can prove</i>
<i>that I'm cheating, then I win.</i>

413
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,152
Now, all forces advance!

414
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:13,920
Sora: <i>Oh, crap!</i>

415
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,221
<i>crap, crap, crap, crap.</i>

416
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,623
<i>I've royally screwed</i>
<i>this one up.</i>

417
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,491
<i>I thought she had only</i>
<i>one cheat up her sleeve</i>

418
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,561
<i>and disregarded</i>
<i>any other possibilities.</i>

419
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,228
<i>I can't believe I made</i>
<i>the same mistake</i>

420
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,630
<i>I was just lecturing</i>
<i>Steph about!</i>

421
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,132
<i>What, were the stakes not high</i>
<i>enough for me or something?!</i>

422
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,734
I'm better than this!

423
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,602
(panting)

424
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,970
Sora?

425
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,539
Off with the enemy King's head.

426
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,575
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>Finish him, my Queen.</i>

427
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,512
<i>And that's... checkmate.</i>

428
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,383
Queen, wait!

429
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,187
Wha‐ Sora!

430
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:50,957
Oh, my Queen.

431
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,959
I beg you,
put down your sword.

432
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,662
To me, you're...

433
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,263
<i>...beautiful!</i>

434
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,866
All:
Say what?!

435
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,768
My Queen, my dear love,

436
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,704
please search
deep within your heart.

437
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,438
Do you truly find
any value

438
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,440
in that so‐called
King's service?

439
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,442
<i>She brainwashes her soldiers,</i>

440
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,245
<i>abusing and using them</i>
<i>like expendable tools.</i>

441
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,881
<i>Then she forces you</i>
<i>to lead the assault,</i>

442
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,416
<i>unworthy of your sword.</i>

443
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,852
I beg you to reconsider this.

444
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,521
Please think of your people,

445
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,957
<i>think of the kingdom</i>
<i>that you've sworn to protect.</i>

446
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,567
( laughs )

447
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,669
When it comes to dating games,
there's nobody,

448
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,005
and I mean nobody out there
that's better than me.

449
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:39,973
Way to go!

450
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,441
Looks like we've got
their Queen!

451
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,076
He figured a way out!

452
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,110
Not yet.

453
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,030
Huh?

454
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,613
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>The enemy's</i>
<i>using some kind of magic</i>

455
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,449
<i>that lets them brainwash others</i>
<i>just by touching them.</i>

456
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,284
<i>Stealing one piece</i>
<i>from their side and adding it</i>

457
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,954
to our ranks won't be enough
to change anything.

458
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:54,821
It won't?

459
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,223
Sora:
<i>All right,</i>
<i>if a virgin like you</i>

460
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:58,491
<i>can sweet‐talk a chess piece,</i>

461
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,627
<i>surely you can find</i>
<i>a way out of this mess.</i>

462
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:01,695
<i>I caught her off‐guard.</i>

463
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,130
<i>Maybe if we wait,</i>
<i>she'll make a sloppy mistake.</i>

464
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,932
<i>No,</i>
<i>that might even be worse.</i>

465
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,268
<i>Maybe I should hurry</i>
<i>and make the next move.</i>

466
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,703
<i>Damn it, what should I do?!</i>

467
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,337
<i>I royally screwed</i>
<i>the pooch on this one.</i>

468
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,473
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>am I gonna fix this?!</i>

469
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,876
Sora.

470
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:17,678
Shiro?

471
00:21:18,912 --> 00:21:20,947
The two of us are Blank.

472
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,684
We'll... be... fine.

473
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:28,589
Kurami:
<i>Stay strong.</i>
<i>Don't back down.</i>

474
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,791
Now, knight,
I want you to advance

475
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,526
and eliminate
that traitor Queen!

476
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,860
Both:
That's it!

477
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,898
What's wrong?
Come on, move it!

478
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,982
( gasps )
Sora:
<i>Jackpot!</i>

479
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,518
<i>This is how we're gonna win.</i>

480
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,886
Shiro, you focus
on commanding the army.

481
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,923
Keep them moving
so we don't get brainwashed.

482
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:05,626
Piece... of... cake!

483
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:07,227
You finally have a plan?

484
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,896
Listen up, Steph,
you don't always

485
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,699
have to lift your sword
to fight a battle, understand?

486
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:13,800
Huh?

487
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,537
There's always
more than one way...

488
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,005
...to win a game!

489
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:24,811
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

490
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,432
Sora:
<i>(wheezing)</i>
<i>Must I talk like this</i>

491
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,568
<i>if I'm going to be king?</i>
