1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,582
Shiro:
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:18,318
<i>a little girl was sent</i>
<i>to an institution</i>

3
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>before she was one year old</i>

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,388
<i>because of her</i>
<i>super intelligence.</i>

5
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:24,525
<i>She would learn</i>
<i>many new things there</i>

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,393
<i>like how to walk</i>
<i>and how to speak.</i>

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:35,135
<i>It was then that she was</i>
<i>introduced to games as well.</i>

8
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:39,272
<i>She was made to play many games</i>
<i>they called intelligence tests,</i>

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,942
<i>but they were so boring</i>
<i>that she didn't enjoy them</i>

10
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,545
<i>no matter</i>
<i>who she played with.</i>

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,981
<i>And then after two years</i>
<i>had passed,</i>

12
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,550
<i>she was reunited</i>
<i>with a woman</i>

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,653
<i>whom she was told</i>
<i>was her mother...</i>

14
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:56,356
<i>as well is a boy who was</i>
<i>seven years older than her.</i>

15
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>The boy told The adults</i>
<i>whatever they wanted to hear</i>

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,763
<i>and grinned at everyone</i>
<i>with a fake, empty smile.</i>

17
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>The girl said to him,</i>
<i>the first words she had spoken</i>

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,234
<i>in a long, long time...</i>

19
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,572
You seem so empty.

20
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:24,450
Sora:
( chuckles )
So, you want to play a game?

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,134
Who's Sora?

22
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,737
Blank...

23
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,407
Blank does not..

24
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,143
Blank does not...

25
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,812
( whimpering )

26
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,585
<i>( screams )</i>

27
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,226
Oh, dear, you must've
had a really bad dream.

28
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,294
I'll bring you a glass
of warm milk.

29
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,631
Does that sound okay?
No, no!

30
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,100
He was with me!
He's always been with me!

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,368
That's why‐

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,341
Shiro.

33
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,612
Shiro!

34
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,156
It's cold.

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,526
Master? That's
where you were.

36
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,228
Dolly was panicking and said
that you ran off somewhere,

37
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,731
so I was wondering
what could have happened.

38
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,566
Jibril.

39
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,034
Yes, can I help you
with something?

40
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,637
Tell me the names
of your masters.

41
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,472
Huh? Is this some
sort of game?

42
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,774
I don't know
why you would‐

43
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,175
Answer me!

44
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,079
You are my
only master.

45
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,682
Then who was it
that made me your master?

46
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,617
Jibril:
<i>Well, it was you,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

47
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,554
Shiro:
<i>But... Then who told Stephanie</i>
<i>to fall in love with them?</i>

48
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,289
Jibril:
<i>It was you, Mistress Shiro.</i>

49
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,659
Shiro:
<i>Who found out about the</i>
<i>Eastern Federation's games?</i>

50
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,460
Jibril:
<i>You, Mistress Shiro,</i>
<i>with the help</i>

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,930
<i>of what Dolly's grandfather</i>
<i>left behind.</i>

52
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,733
It was all you.

53
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,335
I was charmed by your
unparalleled brilliance

54
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,837
right from the beginning.

55
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:26,707
That's why I decided
to obey you, Master.

56
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,609
Obey me?

57
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,410
Yes.

58
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,147
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>Only you, Mistress Shiro,</i>
<i>Queen of Elkia,</i>

59
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,982
and representative of Imanity.

60
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,755
Steph:
So she's saying that there
was somebody else besides her?

61
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,324
Jibril:
<i>But there's no sign</i>
<i>of this somebody.</i>

62
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,427
I expanded my range of inquiry
to the entire city

63
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,596
in addition to the castle
to no avail.

64
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,498
Yeah, no one in the
protest demonstration

65
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,301
seems to know anything
about him either.

66
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,738
Yes, I was afraid of that.

67
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,341
It seems as though master
must have played a game

68
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,644
<i>with someone</i>
<i>unbeknownst to us.</i>

69
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:06,947
<i>She then lost and had</i>
<i>her memories altered.</i>

70
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,250
Steph:
<i>That's impossible,</i>
<i>there's no one who could‐</i>

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,385
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>The Eastern Federation.</i>

72
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,622
Jibril:
<i>Yes, they are</i>
<i>capable of that.</i>

73
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,528
Master?

74
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,263
Let's play a game.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,865
Uh...

76
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,568
<i>( door opens )</i>

77
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,570
A game?

78
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,372
Yes, we can just bet
the false memories

79
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,075
that have been implanted
inside you, okay, Miss?

80
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,610
False memories?

81
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,279
And I know it's very rude
to ask of you,

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,582
<i>but would you please lose?</i>

83
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,086
All right then,
that's a check.

84
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,088
Shiro:
<i>False memories.</i>

85
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,592
<i>But they...</i>
<i>seem so real.</i>

86
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,327
<i>Are they true or not?</i>

87
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,698
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>they're disappearing?</i>

88
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,635
( crying )

89
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,339
Shiro...

90
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,342
They say anyone
can change their fate.

91
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,512
Wonder if that's true.

92
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,080
Shiro:
<i>They're all...</i>

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,317
<i>all disappearing.</i>

94
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,553
Sora:
If someone decides
they want to fly,

95
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,888
will they suddenly
sprout wings?

96
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,592
I don't think so.
You can't change what you are.

97
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,493
You can just change
how you do things.

98
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,495
Sora?

99
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,565
You have to make
your own way.

100
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,201
You have to create a way to fly
even while you stay the same.

101
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,703
That's how you survive.

102
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,372
Let's think of
something together, okay,

103
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,041
a way to give you wings.

104
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,709
No need to hurry.

105
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,411
Shiro:
<i>They're all...</i>

106
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,447
<i>fake memories...</i>

107
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,384
<i>all of them, lies.</i>

108
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,522
<i>If they disappear,</i>
<i>I'll feel...</i>

109
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,027
( mouthing words )

110
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,932
"You're... Blank"?

111
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,402
Master?

112
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,339
Shiro:
<i>Blank does not‐</i>

113
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,441
<i>Blank doesn't‐</i>

114
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>Blank does not‐</i>

115
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,713
Blank does not lose!

116
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,465
Jibril:
<i>Why... did you win,</i>
<i>Mistress Shiro?</i>

117
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,703
He's real!
Sora is real!

118
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,338
I know!
I know he's real!

119
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,306
Shiro...

120
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,641
Master, please
calm down.

121
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,676
He's real!
He is real!

122
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,877
Jibril:
<i>Just slow down, Master.</i>

123
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,547
<i>Try to think through</i>
<i>this logically.</i>

124
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,582
Steph:
You're right.

125
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,117
I mean, it absolutely
does make more sense

126
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,386
to think he doesn't exist,
but somehow I feel in my heart

127
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,655
that he really does.

128
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,724
But Dolly, he doesn't.

129
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,594
Besides, I couldn't
imagine you losing.

130
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,896
So it must be
something else.

131
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,698
Oh, Steph.

132
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,465
Then where
is he?

133
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,200
Yeah, he's gotta
be here somewhere!

134
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,302
There must be some reason
why this happened,

135
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,138
some reason
why we can't remember.

136
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,574
Jibril:
<i>Come now, you're</i>
<i>being ridiculous,</i>

137
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,608
This doesn't
make sense.

138
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,176
Shiro:
<i>Hey, guys?</i>

139
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,512
<i>What did we do yesterday?</i>

140
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,580
Uh... yesterday?

141
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,715
I was busy dealing
with the demonstrations.

142
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,551
After that, you played a game
in the throne room.

143
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,821
That was the day
before yesterday, the 19th.

144
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,489
Let me rephrase my question.

145
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,725
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>where you were two nights ago?</i>

146
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,493
Okay, let's see,
now think,

147
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,663
what was I doing
the night before last?

148
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,532
Well, um, I‐ huh?

149
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,367
I can't remember.

150
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,969
Right, none of us can.

151
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,104
Huh...?

152
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,973
Now let me see.

153
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:54,841
Mmm!

154
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,910
Well, this is... different.

155
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,145
Well, Steph,
do you like this or not?

156
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,016
Excuse me, how am I supposed
to respond to that, exactly?

157
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,218
You don't like it?

158
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,054
Even though I made you
fall in love with me?

159
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,122
Not really.

160
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,824
So you're saying that
someone other than you

161
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,993
must have told you to fall
in love with them, right?

162
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,329
Yes, it was my brother Sora
who told her that.

163
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,432
Okay, but didn't
you already decide

164
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,001
that he existed
without this test?

165
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,569
Yeah, that's right,
so why did you

166
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,838
just totally grope me
if you already knew that?

167
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,641
I, uh... wanted to be sure.

168
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,010
Thanks a lot, Steph.
You were a big help.

169
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,078
Oh, sure.

170
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,582
Then let's think hard
about this.

171
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,551
If Sora actually exists
somewhere,

172
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,653
then how could he
have disappeared?

173
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,987
He wasn't just taken away.

174
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,223
Our memories of both him
and the last day and a half

175
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,559
have all vanished, too.

176
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,460
A large‐scale magic spell
could conceivably do

177
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,896
something like that,
but it would've left

178
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,833
some traces of being cast.

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,536
What if it was a game?

180
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,504
A game?

181
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,541
What if the rules are altering
our perception of reality?

182
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,109
It's possible
because of the pledges.

183
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,680
Hmm, if the game involved
Imanity's representative,

184
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,582
then I suppose it's possible
that the rules

185
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,651
would be able to affect
the entire race,

186
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,586
but it shouldn't work on Jibril,
should it?

187
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,756
No, because Sora's
my master now,

188
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,058
he should be
my representative, too.

189
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,927
We can assume I'm under
the same effects as well.

190
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,030
Okay, I guess that makes sense,
but if that's the case,

191
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,733
then what kind of game
are we talking about?

192
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,635
I don't know.

193
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,807
But I know what...
Sora said to me.

194
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,978
You know
that I believe in you.

195
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:42,015
Shiro, never forget
the two of us are always one.

196
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,886
Sora would never leave me
all by myself.

197
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,554
So...

198
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,924
Sora: <i>( weakly )</i>
<i>Shiro, where are you?</i>

199
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,360
<i>You're still there,</i>
<i>right, Shiro?</i>

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,562
Sora?

201
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,897
Steph and Jibril:
Huh?

202
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,102
Sora:
<i>Would you just hold</i>
<i>on to me somewhere,</i>

203
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,737
<i>anywhere that I can still feel?</i>

204
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,206
<i>I'm losing my mind in here.</i>

205
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,143
Sora!

206
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,617
Shiro?

207
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,886
Shiro:
<i>It's time to use every last</i>
<i>brain cell I've got.</i>

208
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,922
<i>What's really going on here?</i>

209
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,824
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>Sora trusted me with this.</i>

210
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:27,694
<i>I've got to try and use</i>
<i>all the memories I still have.</i>

211
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,034
<i>Sora said that we're</i>
<i>always together,</i>

212
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,704
<i>so he must be here somewhere.</i>

213
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,240
<i>And he said that the game</i>
<i>is always won</i>

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,142
<i>before it even begins.</i>

215
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,178
<i>He was trying</i>
<i>to prepare me for this.</i>

216
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,979
( gasps )

217
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:54,354
<i>He told me the two of us</i>
<i>are not like comic book heroes.</i>

218
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:58,358
<i>No, I've got to</i>
<i>think harder! Harder!</i>

219
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,929
<i>He said he was going to get</i>
<i>the last piece we needed.</i>

220
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,131
<i>Get the piece we needed?</i>

221
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,401
<i>Then this game is to get us</i>
<i>something we need</i>

222
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,971
<i>before we can face</i>
<i>the Eastern Federation.</i>

223
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,439
<i>A tool? A strategy?</i>

224
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,610
<i>An observer. An Elf?</i>

225
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>He's going to get an Elf,</i>
<i>but how?</i>

226
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,017
<i>Challenge Elven Gard?</i>
<i>Kurami?</i>

227
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,487
<i>No, Kurami</i>
<i>doesn't believe in Sora.</i>

228
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,790
<i>She'd never agree to help us.</i>

229
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,795
( gasps )

230
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,697
What if the game...

231
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,033
was to steal each other's being?

232
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,439
Shiro! Shiro!

233
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,181
A game to steal
each other's existence?

234
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,883
That's right.

235
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,021
These 32 stones collectively
make up your existence.

236
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,188
They're individually numbered

237
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,990
and ranked
in order of importance.

238
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,893
Their priority is assigned
to them by your subconscious.

239
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,063
<i>So in other words neither of us</i>
<i>can consciously know</i>

240
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,232
<i>which of these stones</i>
<i>constitutes which part</i>

241
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,135
<i>of ourselves until our opponent</i>
<i>has taken it away.</i>

242
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,937
<i>What importance</i>
<i>does your subconscious place</i>

243
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,739
<i>on that elf next to you?</i>

244
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:22,308
<i>Or your arms, legs, nerves,</i>
<i>or memories, for that matter?</i>

245
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,445
In the end, your very
existence is taken

246
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,081
and no one will even realize
that you're there.

247
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,116
In other words,
you'll disappear.

248
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,785
Kurami:
Are you serious?

249
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:32,853
Uh‐huh.

250
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,722
Pledge number five,
the challenged party

251
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,124
has the right to decide
the rules of the game.

252
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,460
If you don't like it,
the game is off.

253
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,195
What do you say?

254
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,864
Kurami‐

255
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,266
Fiel, you realize
this man is saying

256
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,468
that he's willing to bet
Imanity's race piece?

257
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,671
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>We can't simply</i>
<i>ignore that.</i>

258
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,438
( chuckles )

259
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,275
Look, honestly, I was sort
of hoping that we'd be able

260
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,243
to possibly reconcile
after what happened.

261
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,146
Sora:
<i>Oh, we can reconcile</i>
<i>but to do that,</i>

262
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,183
first you gotta trust me
and give me that elf.

263
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,785
You know that's not
gonna happen.

264
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,553
I guess you're right.

265
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,854
What exactly
are you betting?

266
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,123
Let's say the winner
gets the right to make

267
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,058
two demands of the loser.

268
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,159
One could, for example,

269
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,796
make the results
of the game eternal,

270
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,164
erasing the other's
existence permanently.

271
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,100
Then they could
alter the memories

272
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,504
of the loser's partner to make
them their ally instead.

273
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:28,008
So then what you want to do here
is bet not only our partners

274
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,510
but our existence as well?

275
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,712
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

276
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,647
You are just insane.

277
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,348
( laughs )

278
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,118
Well, then, since I'm apparently
out of my mind already,

279
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,955
I'll go ahead and impose
one more important rule.

280
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,157
Sora?

281
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:45,592
Master?

282
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,427
Shiro, are you
feeling okay?!

283
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,596
Sora!

284
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:52,966
Jibril?

285
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,668
How can I
help you, Master?

286
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,271
In a game, could you steal
someone else's existence?

287
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,406
No, I don't
think you could.

288
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,843
It's only possible in a
fake world like the one

289
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,678
we used to play
word chain.

290
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,813
Shiro:
<i>What if an Elf helped you?</i>

291
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,948
An Elf?

292
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,117
Those disgusting
little forest creatures?

293
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,020
Why, during the great war,
I easily destroyed

294
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,055
one of their capital cities‐

295
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,923
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>But could you?</i>

296
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,492
I suppose
it is possible.

297
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,062
Gross and weak as they are,
those animals do have

298
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,997
some small measure
of skill when it comes

299
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,932
to constructing complicated
spells at least.

300
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,301
Then what you're saying
is that this Sora guy

301
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:31,237
managed to erase his own
existence by playing this game?

302
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:31,705
Yes.

303
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,806
But if he's been erased,

304
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,042
then wouldn't it mean the game's
over and he's already lost?

305
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,578
What else could it
mean otherwise?

306
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:40,213
Yeah, that's true,
if he won, he would exist,

307
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,016
and we wouldn't be worrying
about this in the first place.

308
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,420
Shiro:
What if it was
neither of those?

309
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,290
You think the game's
still being played now?

310
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,625
Mm‐hmm.

311
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,526
That can't be.

312
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:56,462
Jibril, see if you can detect
any magic in this room.

313
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,200
I understand, Master.

314
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,543
Shiro:
I woke up here
in this room.

315
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:12,879
Even though my brother
and I sleep somewhere else,

316
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,081
this is where I woke up.

317
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,019
Sora always said
he would never leave me alone.

318
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,324
You're right,
magic is being used here.

319
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,960
But I can't tell
from what exactly.

320
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,162
Okay, we just have
to search everywhere

321
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,132
until we can find
something! ( screams )

322
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,200
Jibril:
<i>Oh, dear, you just tripped</i>

323
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,936
<i>over literally nothing, Dolly.</i>

324
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,972
You aren't obligated
to embarrass yourself.

325
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,242
How'd that happen?
Something was there.

326
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,179
An Othello disc? Hmm.

327
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,015
That says "three"
in the Elf language.

328
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,318
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>Why are there discs</i>
<i>but no board?</i>

329
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:56,056
Shiro:
<i>Because they haven't</i>
<i>been played yet.</i>

330
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:59,526
If they're still here,
then I can play.

331
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,362
Yeah, but even
if that's the case,

332
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,164
all we have here are
two sets of three discs.

333
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,134
There isn't any way
for us to know if we're
playing black or white.

334
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,939
It's simple.
Sora said that we're one.

335
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:15,008
<i>The two of us are one player,</i>

336
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,278
<i>and I'm still participating</i>
<i>in this game.</i>

337
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,781
Sora:
<i>This rule is very important.</i>

338
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:24,117
Each of our partners
will play in the game as well.

339
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,687
If one of us can't
continue to play,

340
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,656
our partner
can play for us.

341
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,059
That's why I still
kept some memories.

342
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,229
Then can you see it,
the playing board?

343
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,463
I can't.

344
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,435
But I... know what
Sora would do next...

345
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,438
What is this?

346
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,340
You're deliberately trying
to lose, aren't you?

347
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,712
No, I've set it up so I can
still win like this.

348
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,115
Shiro:
<i>How he would lead</i>
<i>his opponent on.</i>

349
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:01,287
Hmm? What happened?
Are these were memories?

350
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,624
Does that mean you're making me
steal your memories

351
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,426
to prove that you're not using
the magic abilities

352
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,295
of another race to win games?

353
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,665
That's not such
a bad answer.

354
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:15,435
Shiro:
<i>How he would tell me</i>
<i>what he wants...</i>

355
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,850
Kurami:
Now he can't
continue the game.

356
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,552
I won then, I guess.

357
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,655
Then why is the
game still here?

358
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:39,359
Huh? What is going on?
Shouldn't the match have ended?

359
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,063
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>There's three left.</i>

360
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>What parts of Sora</i>
<i>do they represent?</i>

361
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:50,170
Shiro:
<i>How he would deceive</i>
<i>his opponent, and then...</i>

362
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,608
how he'd be able to win.

363
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,313
<i>Sora, you're amazing.</i>

364
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,149
<i>Nobody would be able</i>
<i>to figure this out.</i>

365
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,388
<i>Nobody but us.</i>

366
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,825
<i>Now I understand.</i>

367
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:15,328
<i>I know what parts of you</i>
<i>are contained in these discs.</i>

368
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,167
<i>Three,</i>
<i>the way to win this game.</i>

369
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,541
<i>Two, the absolute faith</i>
<i>you have in your little sister.</i>

370
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,577
<i>And the last one...</i>

371
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,250
<i>everything I am to you.</i>

372
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,252
Now please...

373
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,187
come back to me!

374
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:44,290
SORA!

375
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,446
Oh...

376
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:12,919
( gasps and coughs )

377
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,220
We did it.

378
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,165
Shiro...

379
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,300
Okay! You can punch me
if you want!

380
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,903
Give me your best shot!
Let me have it!

381
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,172
( Shiro whimpers )

382
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,408
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

383
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:39,079
Sora! I should
have come sooner!

384
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,448
( crying )

385
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,751
I can't believe I actually
forgot my master.

386
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,452
I'm still so confused.

387
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:50,223
Fiel:
<i>Kurami!</i>
<i>Please wake up! Kurami!</i>

388
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:53,459
Can you hear me?
Oh, say something.

389
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,697
Now then,
since I'm the victor,

390
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,832
it is time for me
to make my demands.

391
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,634
Please, please
I beg you, you can do

392
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:04,470
whatever you want with me,
just don't hurt Kurami.

393
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,008
Yeah, whatever.
Demand number one.

394
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:09,275
Please, no!

395
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,612
We keep a copy
of the memories we stole

396
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,947
from each other
and return the originals.

397
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,181
Huh?

398
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,850
( gasps )

399
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,619
Kurami.

400
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,186
Steph:
<i>Wait, what's going on?</i>

401
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:21,922
They each get to keep
the memories

402
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,023
they took from one another,

403
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:26,660
but they all get their own
memories back as well.

404
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,096
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>Now Kurami Sora know</i>
<i>everything about each other</i>

405
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,765
<i>so there's no need</i>
<i>for distrust.</i>

406
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:33,800
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>they can work together without</i>

407
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,670
<i>having to wonder about what</i>
<i>the other's motivations are.</i>

408
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,573
<i>This is the last piece</i>
<i>that he had been looking for.</i>

409
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,809
Demand number two,
I want you, Elf.

410
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,811
<i>Fiel, I'm gonna</i>
<i>reserve the right</i>

411
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:46,980
<i>to alter your memories</i>
<i>as I please.</i>

412
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,914
Wha‐

413
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,349
Don't worry.

414
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,053
It's fine, Fiel. He only
wants one thing from us.

415
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:56,189
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>If I'm not mistaken,</i>
<i>you need us to spy for you.</i>

416
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:58,024
Yeah, you got it.

417
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,594
Sounds like we're both on
the same wavelength already.

418
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,396
But spies? What does
he want us to spy on?

419
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:07,067
Mmm, oh, I'll
tell you later.

420
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,770
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>After seeing</i>
<i>what was in your head,</i>

421
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,906
<i>I changed my mind</i>
<i>about you.</i>

422
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:14,741
You can count on me.

423
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,676
( laughs )

424
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,944
Shiro:
<i>You're amazing, Sora.</i>

425
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,513
Hmm? Aren't I!

426
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,715
Tell me how proud you are
of your big brother.

427
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,249
Come on,
don't be shy now.

428
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,551
Mm‐hmm.

429
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,554
So proud of you.
You're my hero.

430
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:30,490
( laughs ) Oh, shucks,
when you put it like that,

431
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,626
it really
makes me blush!

432
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,127
Oh!

433
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,729
Master?

434
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,634
Shiro... are you
ready to do this?

435
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,835
Yeah.

436
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:46,006
I'll be standing by.
Any time is okay.

437
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,341
Fiel...

438
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,076
Kurami...

439
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,913
( all inhale deeply )

440
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:56,182
Oh, my God, I was so scared!
I'm never doing that again!

441
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,852
( all sobbing )

442
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,026
What's wrong with them?
Are they okay?

443
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,162
They like to put on
such a tough show all the time.

444
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:12,365
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>But they have</i>
<i>a sensitive side, too.</i>

445
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,364
Steph:
<i>( mechanically )</i>
<i>All your base are belong to us.</i>

446
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:51,998
Sora:
<i>Shut up!</i>

447
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,500
<i>Steph:</i>
<i>I know all the memes, yay!</i>
