1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,872
( weakly )
This is impossible.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,808
Sorry, Imanity's finished.

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,811
Are you friggin' serious,
after all that smack talk?!

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,914
I'm sorry, I didn't expect it
to be set in Tokyo!

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:14,948
I can't do anything here!

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,617
It's our home
and we're the away team!

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,219
We can't help you, I'm so sorry.
Please handle this on your own.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,020
We can't do it.
Try to understand, so sorry.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,788
Oh my, could it
really be?
We can't do it.
Try to understand, so sorry.

10
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,791
Don't tell me that this is the
world you come from, my Masters.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,561
Have fun with the Warbeasts!
I'm sure they'll be just lovely!

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,797
Ino:
<i>You're an unreasonably</i>
<i>popular man,</i>

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,100
<i>so popular in fact that girls</i>
<i>from all over the planet</i>

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,402
<i>chase after you and you alone.</i>

15
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,605
<i>However, despite</i>
<i>their advances,</i>

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,807
<i>you willingly scorn</i>
<i>them by the thousands</i>

17
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,176
<i>because your heart</i>
<i>has already been captured</i>

18
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,678
<i>by your true love.</i>

19
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,080
<i>( upbeat music playing )</i>

20
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,686
<i>But watch out,</i>
<i>anyone faced</i>

21
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,388
<i>with such an overwhelming</i>
<i>number of temptations</i>

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,192
<i>is liable to cave</i>
<i>if they're not careful.</i>

23
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,761
<i>Do you have what</i>
<i>it takes to survive</i>

24
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,496
<i>the snares of seduction</i>
<i>and live to convey</i>

25
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,432
<i>your feelings</i>
<i>to the one you love?</i>

26
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>"Living or Dead City</i>
<i>Side Story!</i>

27
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,306
<i>Love or Love Part 2!</i>

28
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:18,478
<i>Strike Her Down</i>
<i>With Your Bullet of Love!"</i>

29
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,175
Women:
<i>"Living or Dead,</i>
<i>City Side Story!</i>

30
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,411
<i>Love or Lust 2!</i>

31
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,147
<i>Shoot Her With</i>
<i>Your Bullet of Love!"</i>

32
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,584
<i>Yes!</i>

33
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,956
( Sora and Shiro shivering )

34
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,425
Ino:
<i>Check, check, hello?</i>

35
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,661
Hello, can you hear me?

36
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,396
Welcome to the world
that exists within our game.

37
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,432
<i>The match will be held</i>
<i>within the bounds</i>

38
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,669
of the virtual reality field
that you see before you.

39
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,503
Wait.

40
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,370
Yes?

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,872
Sora:
<i>Let me just confirm something.</i>

42
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,942
<i>All this here is made up?</i>
<i>It doesn't really exist, right?</i>

43
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,010
<i>Like it's just a virtual world</i>
<i>you made for your game</i>

44
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,612
<i>and that's it,</i>
<i>all just make‐believe.</i>

45
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,381
Ino:
<i>Yes, that's what</i>
<i>I just said, what of it?</i>

46
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,652
Don't scare me like that!

47
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:35,088
Screw you, man!
That got my PTSD or whatever...

48
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,757
Ino:
Why are you so upset?

49
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:40,026
Do you have some kind of issue
with the contents of this level?

50
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,161
You bet your hairy ass I do!

51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,063
Why the hell would you
use Tokyo in a game?!

52
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,599
Is this psychological warfare?!
Are you screwing with me?!

53
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,534
Ino:
<i>This is a</i>
<i>science‐fiction level,</i>

54
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,470
<i>very popular with the youth</i>
<i>of the Eastern Federation.</i>

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,673
<i>That is the only reason</i>
<i>it was chosen.</i>

56
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,009
<i>So please try to calm yourself.</i>
<i>It's only a game,</i>

57
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,045
<i>So for the most part, there is</i>
<i>nothing for you to fear.</i>

58
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,281
I guess that explains
why the sun

59
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,617
doesn't seem to be
bothering me too much.

60
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,452
( shivering )

61
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,922
Shiro, it's gonna be okay!
This isn't Tokyo!

62
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,756
It only looks like it is.

63
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,959
They just imagined
the whole thing up.

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,696
That's right,
we're inside a game, you see?

65
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,832
Just like "Persona" or
"Stein's Gate" or "Akiba Strip!"

66
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,001
See?
Not scary at all!

67
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,771
So... it's just... a game?

68
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,008
Oh...

69
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:31,878
Mm... understood.

70
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:36,282
Good, I think we're okay now.
You can start up the game.

71
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,885
( laughs )
Very well then.

72
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,322
Allow me to take this moment
to explain the rules to you.

73
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,257
<i>Please take a look</i>
<i>at the box located</i>

74
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>on the ground</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

75
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>As the NPCs rush</i>
<i>to shower you with affection,</i>

76
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,601
<i>take your weapon and shoot</i>
<i>them between the eyes.</i>

77
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,368
Sora:
<i>We gotta shoot them?</i>

78
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,672
Ino:
<i>By shooting them at times</i>
<i>and exploding them at times,</i>

79
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,440
<i>you'll make them</i>
<i>fall in love with you.</i>

80
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,474
Sora:
<i>Then what?</i>

81
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,610
Ino:
<i>They will be incapacitated</i>

82
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,078
<i>and give you their love power.</i>

83
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,982
<i>The lovey‐dovey gun</i>
<i>fires the ammo of amore,</i>

84
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,653
<i>the very essence of love power</i>
<i>that dwells within your heart.</i>

85
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,055
They're seriously calling this
the lovey‐dovey gun?

86
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,056
So lame.

87
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,525
However, if Izuna happens
to shoot one of you

88
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,494
with her lovey‐dovey gun,
you'll turn into her love slave.

89
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,429
Sora:
<i>Love slave, really?</i>

90
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,431
Ino:
<i>As more girls than</i>
<i>you can handle</i>

91
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,568
<i>turn to greet you</i>
<i>with open arms,</i>

92
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:31,071
<i>the one person</i>
<i>you truly love will not!</i>

93
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,106
The object of this game
is to use your love power

94
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,010
to convey the strength of
your undying affection for her.

95
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,345
Thus ends the explanation!

96
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,314
<i>( crowd cheers )</i>

97
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,683
So what you're saying
is I pretty much

98
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,818
have to reject
every girl I see?

99
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,687
What a rip‐off.

100
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,522
On the other hand,
Izuna wants us all to be

101
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,223
part of her little harem

102
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,526
with eyes for her only,
am I right?

103
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,561
That is precisely correct.

104
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,397
One final note,
I'm afraid magic of any kind

105
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,999
cannot be used
in the Virtual World,

106
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,467
so please be aware of that
as you strategize.

107
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,972
Well, then, do you need
a more detailed explanation
of the rules?

108
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,742
No, thanks, I think
I can figure it out from here.

109
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,377
( screams )

110
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,946
Sora:
All right,
let's give this a shot.

111
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:17,117
<i>Firing the lovey‐dovey gun</i>
<i>depletes your love power.</i>

112
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,687
<i>And when you defeat the NPCs,</i>
<i>it restores your love power.</i>

113
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,123
What you doing?
Cut it out!

114
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,026
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>If an NPC touches you,</i>
<i>your love power depletes,</i>

115
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:30,230
<i>and if it runs out, the NPCs</i>
<i>will stop approaching you.</i>

116
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,865
What's wrong?
Why'd you stop?

117
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,366
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>But this means</i>
<i>you'll run out of energy</i>

118
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,437
<i>to fire your lovey‐dovey gun</i>
<i>and become unable</i>
<i>to continue combat.</i>

119
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:41,274
<i>So what happens if you</i>
<i>shoot an ally, old man?</i>

120
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,511
That will restore all love power
to an ally who's run out.

121
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,913
You can also shoot an ally
to bring them back

122
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,783
to their senses after they've
been turned into a love slave.

123
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,652
But the one shot
will be temporarily

124
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,153
the love slave
of the shooter.

125
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,489
Ohh! Agh!

126
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,559
Oh, my Master!

127
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,528
Oh, my darling sister,
to think that such a charming,

128
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,864
precious girl was so close
to me all this time!

129
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,300
When I think how blind I was
to not notice your beauty,

130
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,970
oh, I could gouge
out my eyes.

131
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,273
No, we can't, Sora!
We're brother and sis‐

132
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,808
Ohh!

133
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,678
Oh, no, Shiro,
why are you rejecting

134
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,245
your brother's
unconditional love?!

135
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,114
So this is the mysterious
love triangle,

136
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,550
and unrequited love I read
about in my Master's books.

137
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,620
I'm not even capable
of experiencing such an emotion,

138
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,690
but I'm so happy I could die!

139
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,458
Watch it, Jibirl.
You're gonna get it later.

140
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,961
I see, so that's
how it is.

141
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,097
<i>When your a love slave,</i>
<i>it's like you become a zombie</i>

142
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,300
<i>and lose all sense of what's</i>
<i>going on in the game.</i>

143
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,467
Steph:
There you are!

144
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,604
You jerks left me
all on my own again!

145
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,706
What kind of a
person just walks off‐

146
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,808
Sora, my Prince Charming!

147
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,176
So, Steph, do you understand
all the rules so far?

148
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,579
Yeah, I understand
that love doesn't need rules...

149
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,315
Mm. Of course you don't,
that wouldn't make any sense.

150
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,417
Now put this here
and this here.

151
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,720
Okay, now pull
your index finger in.

152
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,487
That way you'll
love me forever?

153
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,423
( screams )

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,126
Oh, what is this?
I'm so beau‐ti‐ful!

155
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,195
I thought so, these love bullets
can ricochet off things.

156
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,398
This bouncing ability
is gonna be key, Shiro.

157
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,433
Leave it to me.

158
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,002
And even though
we're inside a game world,

159
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,439
our stamina hasn't
changed much from real life.

160
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,376
Keep your running
to a minimum if you can.

161
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,547
All right,
you two ready to do this?

162
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,481
Both:
Yeah!

163
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,654
Kurami:
<i>Looks like they</i>
<i>finally decided</i>

164
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,222
<i>to start playing</i>
<i>the game for real.</i>

165
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,958
<i>So can you see it, Fiel?</i>

166
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,893
Fiel:
<i>Yes, coming in</i>
<i>loud and clear.</i>

167
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:43,697
<i>The view through your eyes is</i>
<i>as perfect as always, Kurami.</i>

168
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,766
Kurami:
<i>That's good to know.</i>

169
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,168
<i>Boy, I bet the Warbeasts</i>
<i>must really hate</i>

170
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,503
<i>this kind of magic.</i>

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,540
Fiel:
<i>Yes, most definitely,</i>
<i>it's very powerful stuff.</i>

172
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,075
<i>But it's difficult</i>
<i>to maintain.</i>

173
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,679
<i>Either way, I will do my best</i>
<i>just for you, Kurami.</i>

174
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,115
Kurami:
<i>The Warbeasts,</i>
<i>their physical abilities</i>

175
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,285
<i>are so extreme,</i>
<i>they practically defy physics.</i>

176
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,354
<i>I'll be interested to see</i>
<i>how someone fights</i>

177
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,590
<i>against a race like that.</i>

178
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,026
( train whistle blows )

179
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,196
Put on a good show
for me... Sora.

180
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,536
Hey there, Izuna.

181
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:27,908
( all murmuring happily )

182
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:32,345
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>When's the last time you</i>
<i>really had fun playing a game?</i>

183
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,682
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

184
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,184
<i>( woman moan happily )</i>

185
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,628
All right, yah!

186
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,361
( squeals )

187
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,195
Sora:
<i>I knew it!</i>

188
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,199
<i>That's what makes this game</i>
<i>truly special.</i>

189
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,035
I know I can do this.

190
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,305
<i>Target NPC's cotton panties,</i>
<i>max thickness one millimeter,</i>

<i>direction 12:00,</i>
<i>firing angle 93 degrees,</i>

192
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,309
<i>300 meters per second.</i>

193
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,580
<i>Acceptable targeting error</i>
<i>within .5 millimeters.</i>

194
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,550
<i>But I think</i>
<i>I can still make it. Fire!</i>

195
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,786
Ha ha!

196
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,187
What?

197
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,557
( giggles )

198
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,665
Damn it, it didn't work!

199
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:28,068
Why?!
( growls angrily )

200
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,573
Kurami:
( sighs ) I give up.
Our race is a bunch of morons.

201
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,078
Izuna:
<i>I don't understand why you're</i>
<i>fooling around so much, please.</i>

202
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:42,282
<i>If you lose,</i>
<i>you'll bring suffering</i>
<i>to so many people, thank you.</i>

203
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,218
<i>Don't you realize</i>
<i>this is a battle?</i>

204
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,220
Yes, bra destroyed!

205
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,622
( squeals )

206
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,625
<i>Of course I've never</i>
<i>thought of it as fun.</i>

207
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,794
<i>How could I? Thanks.</i>

208
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,203
<i>Footsteps.</i>

209
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,643
<i>Is that Shiro?</i>

210
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,681
<i>She's coming this way.</i>

211
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,621
<i>All right, you're mine.</i>

212
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,932
Hmm?

213
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,706
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>Oh, shit! Please!</i>

214
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,675
<i>That's impossible.</i>

215
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,649
Huh?!

216
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,184
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

217
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,156
Sora:
<i>I'm sure you're surprised</i>
<i>right now, Izuna.</i>

218
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,591
<i>In our world,</i>
<i>we have these things</i>

219
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,326
<i>called first‐person shooters</i>
<i>where the best marksmen</i>

220
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,996
<i>in the world gather,</i>
<i>and guess what?</i>

221
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,699
<i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who holds all the records.</i>

222
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,434
<i>Shiro is.</i>

223
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,372
Shiro:
<i>Futile.</i>

224
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,209
Sora:
<i>Her terrifying</i>
<i>knack at calculations</i>

225
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,746
<i>allows her to perfectly</i>
<i>predict her enemies' movements.</i>

226
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,648
<i>Her firing intervals</i>
<i>take into account</i>

227
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:25,251
<i>not only your movement patterns</i>
<i>but your firing speed as well.</i>

228
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,354
<i>Her skills border</i>
<i>on precognition.</i>

229
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,391
<i>It seems as though your bullets</i>
<i>harmlessly pass through her,</i>

230
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,927
<i>and yet her bullets</i>
<i>relentlessly hunt you down</i>

231
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,796
<i>like guided missiles.</i>

232
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,465
Izuna:
Holy crap, please!

233
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,706
<i>I have to get out of here.</i>

234
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,582
( gasps )

235
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,952
Hi, there!

236
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,022
Welcome to your nightmare.

237
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,792
<i>It's the Flugel.</i>
<i>Jibril!</i>

238
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,395
<i>I'll blind her, thank you.</i>

239
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,499
( giggles )

240
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,902
Oh! Oh!

241
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,038
I forgot, no magic!

242
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,306
Jibril:
( screams )

243
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,508
Jibril!

244
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,442
( chuckles)

245
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,995
Izuna:
<i>I can't dodge it!</i>

246
00:12:56,677 --> 00:13:00,581
Oh, Master,
my cute little Master,

247
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,084
<i>won't you please come back</i>
<i>to me, pretty please?</i>

248
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:06,820
Okay, I get it.
I understand now.

249
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,390
She can use her clothes
as a shield.

250
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,930
( crowd murmuring )

251
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,933
Kurami:
Fiel, did you catch that?

252
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:22,869
Fiel:
<i>I sure did. It's all</i>
<i>so very exciting.</i>

253
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,371
<i>Shiro's firing skills</i>
<i>are quite amazing,</i>

254
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,541
<i>but Izuna is</i>
<i>really something else.</i>

255
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,410
Kurami:
<i>Yes, Sora was</i>
<i>completely silent,</i>

256
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,813
<i>and that shot</i>
<i>was long‐distance.</i>

257
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:36,049
<i>I can't believe she was able</i>
<i>to not only sense his attack</i>

258
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,984
<i>but dodge it as well.</i>

259
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,786
<i>It's frightening.</i>

260
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,623
Such is the unique
Warbeast ability.

261
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,090
This battle may be futile.

262
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,191
Sora:
Don't be stupid,

263
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,393
this has nothing to do
with their animal senses.

264
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,329
It's not normal.

265
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,230
You mean...

266
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,699
That's right,
no doubt about it.

267
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,569
Fiel:
<i>A cheat code.</i>
<i>They're up to something.</i>

268
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,203
<i>Be careful out there, guys.</i>

269
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,473
Kurami:
<i>I got it. A cheat</i>
<i>that can't be proven.</i>

270
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:04,578
<i>The whole Warbeast sixth‐sense</i>
<i>thing is just a ruse.</i>

271
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,512
Ino:
<i>I should've known.</i>

272
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,181
<i>They're familiar</i>
<i>with this game after all,</i>

273
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:13,486
<i>possibly more so than we are.</i>
<i>But no matter.</i>

274
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:17,457
<i>Izuna, they're hiding</i>
<i>in the corridor below you.</i>

275
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,960
<i>Shiro is exhausted</i>
<i>and can't run.</i>

276
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,228
<i>Use this chance</i>
<i>to take them out now!</i>

277
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,098
You don't need
to tell me twice, please.

278
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,107
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

279
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,216
<i>( all panting )</i>

280
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,486
Sora:
Jeez, looks like were gonna
have to be on the defensive

281
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,588
for a while now.

282
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,222
I'm counting on you.

283
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,224
Since my plans to finish
this early are dashed,

284
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,993
we're gonna have to wing it.

285
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,161
<i>Wing it?</i>
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

286
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,530
<i>We're trying to play</i>
<i>a fair match</i>

287
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,233
<i>against superpower cheaters who</i>
<i>know this game inside and out.</i>

288
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,168
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>We're freakin' screwed.</i>

289
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,539
Aha, your luck
just ran out, Sora!

290
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,508
I'm gonna get you back
for all you've done to me

291
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,509
and Mistress Izuna, too!

292
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,076
( grunting )

293
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,346
Agh! Oh, Jibril,
how could you do this?

294
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,516
Bringing her might have been
a mistake after all.

295
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:18,919
I'm never letting you
out of my sight again!

296
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,522
<i>( Izuna panting )</i>

297
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,924
<i>( rapid heartbeat )</i>

298
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,533
<i>I'm smiling.</i>

299
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,903
<i>And my heart's pounding.</i>
<i>It almost hurts my ears.</i>

300
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:40,674
When's the last time you really
had fun playing a game?

301
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,479
Shut up, please!

302
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,816
Mistress Shiro, what's our
next course of action?

303
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,218
Jibril, shut up
for a second.

304
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,689
Master, perhaps
this is impossible,

305
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,758
even for Mistress Shiro.

306
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:58,992
No, she can do it.

307
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,027
If there's something
I can't handle in a game,

308
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,295
Shiro's got my back.

309
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:06,466
That's always been true,
and it always will be.

310
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,601
Shiro:
<i>Sora?</i>

311
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,539
Do you... believe in me?

312
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,975
Yeah.

313
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,644
Has your big brother
ever doubted you before?

314
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,947
Shiro:
<i>Then, Sora...</i>

315
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,749
<i>this time...</i>

316
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,386
it's up to you, okay?

317
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:28,989
Up to me?

318
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,425
Oh, shi‐ ( grunts )

319
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,399
Shiro!

320
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,469
( yelps )

321
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:49,342
<i>Shiro.</i>

322
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,123
Jibril:
<i>The game's as good</i>
<i>as over, isn't it?</i>

323
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,959
<i>Why did Shiro protect you</i>
<i>back there, Master?</i>

324
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,529
<i>I don't understand her logic.</i>

325
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,065
Yeah, well, I do,
so don't worry about it.

326
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,668
It's not that Shiro
couldn't find the answer.

327
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,771
What she did back there
was the answer.

328
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,239
<i>It was blank.</i>

329
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,441
<i>In other words, me and her,</i>
<i>everything,</i>

330
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,443
<i>including Shiro joining</i>
<i>the enemy,</i>

331
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:26,680
<i>is part of Blank's plan.</i>

332
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,649
The only thing left now
is for me to complete

333
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,351
her magic formula
and lead us all the way

334
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,386
to the victory we deserve.

335
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,557
That's right,
isn't it, Shiro?

336
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:37,924
Jibril.

337
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:38,424
Huh?

338
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,995
Fight Izuna
to buy me some time.

339
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,631
Of course, whatever
you say, Master.

340
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:48,535
However, if I end up
destroying her in the process,

341
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:51,204
that won't be a problem, right?

342
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,673
You know, I should
probably warn you,

343
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:55,208
but those are famous
last words right there.

344
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,878
What?! Fine then.

345
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,313
I'll just go
defeat her normally.

346
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,388
Well, that makes
things easier.

347
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,160
Where did she go?
She's gone!

348
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,667
Here, little puppy,
come to mama.

349
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,537
I'm experiencing
a good deal of déjà vu.

350
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,439
The last time I challenged
the Eastern Federation and lost,

351
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,175
were you my opponent,
by chance?

352
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>Well, I suppose</i>
<i>it doesn't matter anyway.</i>

353
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:35,048
I'm so curious to see
just how many tricks

354
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,217
you know how to do,
little doggie.

355
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:39,653
Let's have some fun,
shall we?

356
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,254
Feel free to throw everything
you've got at me,

357
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,189
<i>and go ahead</i>
<i>and embarrass yourself</i>

358
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,626
<i>to your fuzzy</i>
<i>little heart's content.</i>

359
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,300
( grunting )

360
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,374
( panting )

361
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,475
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>No, come on, Sora!</i>

362
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,178
<i>Going to a different area</i>
<i>isn't gonna help.</i>

363
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,881
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>am I supposed to do, Shiro?!</i>

364
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,823
<i>( panting )</i>

365
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,426
I need to run
to the roof.

366
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,596
No, she's planned
for that.

367
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,633
Either way, she'll catch
up to me soon, huh?

368
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,870
<i>Huh? Wait,</i>
<i>something's not right.</i>

369
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,507
<i>Why isn't Shiro running</i>
<i>to catch up with me?</i>

370
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,641
<i>If she were trying harder,</i>

371
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,243
<i>she'd have plenty</i>
<i>of chances to beat me.</i>

372
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,848
Keep your running
to a minimum if you can.

373
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,687
<i>Oh, yeah, I did say that,</i>
<i>didn't I?</i>

374
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,021
( chuckles )

375
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,658
If I get this wrong,
I'm gonna have hell to pay.

376
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,527
Right, Shiro?

377
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,872
Okay, sis, your big brother's
just about had it.

378
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:10,410
This is a rough game for a guy
who never leaves his room.

379
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,251
Come on, buddy,
pull it together.

380
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:21,655
You absolutely
cannot mess this up.

381
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,759
( shouts )

382
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,965
<i>Shiro, if there's one thing</i>
<i>I know you'd never expect,</i>

383
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,734
<i>it's this!</i>

384
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,435
Yah!

385
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,911
I mean,
that's totally insane, right?

386
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,312
Gotcha!

387
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,920
Sora, I love you!

388
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,456
Yeah, I love you too, Sis.

389
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,860
Izuna, do it now!

390
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,263
Izuna:
<i>I thought they'd keep me</i>
<i>waiting forever, please.</i>

391
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,765
( gasps )

392
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,875
This is why you saved
your strength

393
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,477
and didn't run after me,
isn't that right, Shiro?

394
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,513
Sora, I love you.

395
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,583
Ino:
<i>Impossible!</i>
<i>Sora just shot her.</i>

396
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,318
<i>She couldn't be able</i>
<i>to think rationally yet.</i>

397
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,419
Huh?

398
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,489
<i>Her panties,</i>
<i>they're gone!</i>

399
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,124
There's no way!

400
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,459
<i>Was it really only</i>
<i>her panties that got hit?</i>

401
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,462
<i>She's not under</i>
<i>a lovey‐dovey spell?!</i>

402
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,931
You finally figured
it out, huh?

403
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,301
<i>All this time,</i>
<i>Shiro was never on your side.</i>

404
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,136
<i>She never got hit.</i>

405
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,639
Izuna:
<i>She let the shot hit</i>
<i>a button or something</i>

406
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,108
<i>and pretended</i>
<i>to be under my control.</i>

407
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:52,378
<i>They tricked me. Still,</i>
<i>that doesn't change anything.</i>

408
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:54,815
Ha!

409
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:02,789
Sora:
<i>When's the last time you really</i>
<i>had fun playing a game?</i>

410
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,572
This is fun!
Thank you!

411
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:53,499
Sora:
<i>We're almost there.</i>
<i>Give Blank everything you got!</i>

412
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,968
All:
<i>Okay!</i>
