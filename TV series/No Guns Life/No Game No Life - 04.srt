1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,721
Kurami:
What is this?
What have you done to him?

2
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,256
Sora:
King, oh, foolish King,
to be so cruel

3
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,693
as to give your servant
the order to slay his own queen?

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,931
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>And now you tremble with rage</i>
<i>with not a word or explanation</i>

5
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,533
<i>to your loyal followers?</i>

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,267
<i>My Queen...</i>

7
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,369
I cannot ask you...

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,938
or the knights
who lowered their swords

9
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:39,105
out of love for you

10
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,876
to take their weapons
and wield them against
their comrades.

11
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,378
But it is now clear‐

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,249
your beloved King
has been struck by madness!

13
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,117
<i>I believe</i>
<i>that you are the only one</i>

14
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,819
<i>who can lead your people now.</i>

15
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,157
<i>Alas, the King is mad!</i>
<i>He must be brought to justice!</i>

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,797
My Queen, the decision
is in your hands.

17
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,638
Excellent choice, my Queen,
my brave, honorable Queen!

18
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,207
<i>You and your righteous warriors</i>
<i>saw the truth</i>

19
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,476
<i>through the enemy's</i>
<i>nefarious illusions.</i>

20
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,247
<i>Now rise against your oppressor</i>
<i>and usher in peace!</i>

21
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,784
Stephanie:
Wait a minute, is this...

22
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,285
Shiro:
A revolt.

23
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,221
The appearance of a
third force, rebellion.

24
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,157
Then Sora planned all this?

25
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,459
( chuckles )
I told you...

26
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,863
I'd win without having to fight.

27
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,466
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

28
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,994
Stephanie:
Win without having to fight?

29
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,362
King:
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

30
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,498
The one who inherits
the throne must have

31
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,234
a special sort of wisdom,
my dear Stephanie.

32
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,236
I believe it will take
a creative approach

33
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,906
to save Elkia
from its current plight.

34
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,007
Yeah, but‐

35
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,208
King:
As you know,

36
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,977
we Imanity are
the weakest race in Disboard.

37
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,614
<i>And that's why we must find</i>
<i>our own unique way</i>

38
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,482
<i>of facing those</i>
<i>who are stronger than us.</i>

39
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,418
<i>We must be clever.</i>

40
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,054
<i>Well, that's what</i>
<i>your grandpa thinks anyway.</i>

41
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,689
I understand.

42
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,525
King:
<i>Surely there's</i>
<i>someone out there</i>

43
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,793
<i>with the wisdom</i>
<i>to save Elkia,</i>

44
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,195
<i>Some brave soul who knows</i>
<i>how to turn</i>

45
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,332
<i>their weakness into strength.</i>

46
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,366
Steph:
<i>Could it be?</i>

47
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,069
Sora:
Hear me out.
We do not seek bloodshed.

48
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,504
We seek what
all men seek‐

49
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,173
peace and the right
to live our lives freely.

50
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,777
All forces assist
the Red Queen's men now.

51
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:08,148
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>Good, surround them.</i>
<i>Don't let a single man fall.</i>

52
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,585
Why, you spineless traitors.

53
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,687
Stephanie:
<i>The red pieces</i>
<i>are protecting them.</i>

54
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,524
Yep, To the black pieces,
it's like a protest.

55
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:20,594
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Will they be able to kill</i>
<i>their former comrades?</i>

56
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,764
Kurami:
I can't believe this.
They beat my Elf magic?

57
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,132
What race could possibly
be helping the cheat?

58
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,201
There's no way I can let
someone like him

59
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,369
take over this country.

60
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:33,206
Hey, Crazy King Lady,
didn't you know?

61
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,008
You still have
some options here.

62
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,443
In real war, the battle
doesn't always have to end

63
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,312
with the king being killed,

64
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,982
but you know you're not
coming out on top.

65
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,650
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Surrender.</i>

66
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,719
Oh...

67
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,355
<i>Stephanie:</i>
<i>This is how you win</i>
<i>without fighting.</i>

68
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:51,925
Sora.

69
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,360
Kurami:
( laughing )

70
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,235
Surrender?
( laughs )

71
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,204
I won't let you get away
with this.

72
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,239
I earned this country.

73
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,008
And it will belong to me.

74
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:12,879
All forces, sacrifice your lives
to slay the enemy king!

75
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,949
<i>Go forth and destroy</i>
<i>every last traitor.</i>

76
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,450
<i>March!</i>

77
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:25,325
Sora, we backed her
too far into a corner.

78
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,193
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>She's lost it.</i>

79
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,462
Sora:
<i>Yeah. I know.</i>

80
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,164
Stephanie:
This is worse than before.

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,167
There's no such thing as
a peaceful solution after all.

82
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,902
Sora:
That's why I did it.

83
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,338
Huh?
( gasps )

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,541
Sora...

85
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,244
Sora:
<i>Oppression, rule by fear,</i>
<i>dictatorships.</i>

86
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,479
<i>People never learn.</i>

87
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,583
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Throughout history,</i>
<i>for whatever reason,</i>

88
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,186
<i>the lives of tyrants always</i>
<i>seem to end the same way‐</i>

89
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,557
<i>assassination at the hands</i>
<i>of someone close to them.</i>

90
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,492
<i>It happens without fail.</i>

91
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,567
Sorry about that.

92
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,303
I guess our world just isn't
as friendly as yours is.

93
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,105
<i>When it comes to war</i>
<i>and murder,</i>

94
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,876
<i>I'm afraid we have way more</i>
<i>experience than you do.</i>

95
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:22,649
Man:
And the victory goes
to the challenger, Team Blank!

96
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,887
King:
<i>Your dear old grandpa believes</i>
<i>with all his heart</i>

97
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,556
<i>that someone will rise</i>
<i>to the challenge,</i>

98
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,858
<i>someone who understands</i>
<i>true strength</i>

99
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,961
<i>through their limitations</i>
<i>and knows how to use</i>

100
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,631
<i>the strengths of others</i>
<i>to their advantage.</i>

101
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,833
<i>This person will</i>
<i>come to be the hope</i>

102
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,636
and the potential
of Imanity.

103
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,606
Potential?
( laughs )

104
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,942
<i>Oh, I knew that dress</i>
<i>would suit you, my dear.</i>

105
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,011
( giggles )

106
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,081
So did I pull it off?

107
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:55,682
Uh‐‐

108
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,351
I mean, this is
the kind of strategy

109
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,921
your grandpa believed in,
isn't it?

110
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,022
More or less.

111
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,124
I think the old man
was onto something,

112
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,792
so I hope I did him justice.

113
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,663
And now no one will call him
a fool, I hope.

114
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,066
Thank you!

115
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,369
Thank you so much!
This means everything to me.

116
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,404
Sora, Shiro...

117
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,074
( crying )

118
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,275
There, there, Steph.

119
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,477
What kind of trick
did you use?

120
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,079
Trick?
Don't play dumb.

121
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,549
You may be clever,
but there's no way that Imanity

122
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,416
could beat Elf magic unaided.

123
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,819
Why, thank you,
I am quite clever, aren't I?

124
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,188
You should be glad.
Huh?

125
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,158
To be perfectly honest,
I didn't think that your idea

126
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,193
of getting the Elves to rule
alongside Imanity

127
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,462
Then why did you‐
was such a bad one, really.

128
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,732
Because your attitude
towards Imanity is crap.

129
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,968
<i>Doesn't the idea that</i>
<i>we can't survive without</i>

130
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,004
<i>Elves' protection seem a bit</i>
<i>self‐deprecating to you?</i>

131
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,006
Hold on‐
You can't see that the Imanity

132
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,741
have their own way
of doing things.

133
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,177
That's why you lost.

134
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,613
<i>You were so stuck up on</i>
<i>the idea that we had</i>

135
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,848
<i>some imaginary spell going on,</i>

136
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,918
<i>that you couldn't see</i>
<i>our merits for what they were.</i>

137
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,689
Stop saying things like that.

138
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:12,225
Humans can't defeat magic.
It's just not possible.

139
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,528
Sora:
<i>If that's what you think,</i>
<i>that's fine.</i>

140
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,531
<i>I guess you just can't see</i>
<i>your own potential.</i>

141
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,733
But listen‐
it doesn't matter

142
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,603
<i>whether we're up against</i>
<i>elves or gods.</i>

143
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:25,839
<i>Blank never loses a fight.</i>

144
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,943
You got that?
Don't underestimate humanity.

145
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,417
Huh?

146
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,520
( sobbing )

147
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,355
Whoa! Aw, shit.

148
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,926
Do you have any idea how much
trouble I went through

149
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,294
to get the elves
to help me, do you?!

150
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,632
Wait, uh, look‐
It was really,
really tough!

151
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:55,636
( sobs )
I didn't underestimate anyone!

152
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,604
I was serious!
Sora, look what you did.

153
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,774
This is my fault?!
You made her cry.

154
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,976
Shiro:
<i>Look, I know you're still a</i>
<i>virgin and all,</i>

155
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,611
<i>but can't you even</i>
<i>talk to girls?</i>

156
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,848
Sora:
What?! Come on!
( chuckles )

157
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:11,017
Man:
<i>Now, this gentleman standing</i>
<i>before us, Sora,</i>

158
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,054
is the new winner
of the tournament for the crown.

159
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:19,259
Before I go on, is there anyone
to challenge him?

160
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,294
Very well, then in accordance
with the final wish

161
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,731
of our former king,
I crown Sora the new
King of Elkia!

162
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,200
Sora:
Hold it!
Man:
What the‐ this again?

163
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,769
It's not Sora.
It's Blank.

164
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:31,572
The both of us are Blank
together, you see?

165
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,140
So you got two Kings.

166
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,410
Man:
Unfortunately,
I'm afraid that won't do.

167
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,312
The 10 pledges
require us to specify

168
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,216
a designated representative,
a single representative.

169
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,285
Then we'll split it up,
I guess.

170
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,687
I'll be the king in name only‐

171
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,122
Shiro:
Objection! If you become king
by yourself,

172
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,824
then you're gonna
make a harem.

173
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:54,094
You won't need
me anymore.
Sora:
A harem?

174
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,831
What are they even
talking about?

175
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:01,401
If it's going to be name only,
I will be the king.

176
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,037
It's all same, isn't it?

177
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,106
All right then, fine,
I'll start over‐

178
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,008
Sora:
<i>Objection!</i>

179
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,843
Now, now, wait a second,
Dear Sister.

180
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,546
It's rare for you to make
a joke like that.

181
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,814
Are pigs about to fly?

182
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,849
Watch out.
I mean it.

183
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,150
Very well then,

184
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,553
I guess we'll just have to
play a game, won't we?

185
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:20,887
Both:
Better prepare yourself,

186
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,724
'cause there's no way
I'll lose.

187
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,767
( weakly )
Just one more round.

188
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,636
( weakly )
Okay...

189
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,805
Admit defeat already,
would you?

190
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:43,710
You're the big dummy
who said two wins in a row.

191
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,478
What's wrong
with there being

192
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,548
more than one king
anyway, huh?

193
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:52,452
Shiro:
Sora, hold on and take a look
at this, pledge number seven.

194
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,387
<i>"Conflicts between groups</i>
<i>will be conducted</i>

195
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:58,024
<i>by an appointed representative</i>
<i>with absolute authority."</i>

196
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,895
We were both representatives,
so we both have authority?

197
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,332
<i>( both groan )</i>

198
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,270
Okay, that's a hell of a lot
longer than it needed to.
Yep.

199
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,105
It's your fault for not paying
more attention

200
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,306
to the rules
in the first place.

201
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,810
Shiro:
<i>You're turning red.</i>
Sora:
<i>Duh, she's</i>

202
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,145
Shiro: It's 'cause
I took her panties.
Stephanie:

203
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,748
Why are you making me
wear this stuff?

204
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,917
Because we're all wearing
fantasy costumes.

205
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,920
I'm totally digging the 2‐D
effects on her skirt right now.

206
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,789
What does that even mean?!

207
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,858
Anyway, you guys need
to do your job, okay?

208
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,628
Since we haven't had
a king for so long,

209
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,630
our domestic affairs
are a mess.

210
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,567
You handle the internal stuff.
I'm trying to do a no‐item run.

211
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,269
Would you quit using traps?
It works better this way.

212
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,871
This won't do at all.

213
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,107
Unfortunately,
due to the decline of Elkia,

214
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,643
rumors have been spreading
that some of the ministers

215
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,411
are collaborating
with other nations.

216
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,847
As the new king, you need
to make sure that they don't‐

217
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,217
That's all?
Easy solution.

218
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,853
In line with the pledges,
we'll play rock‐paper‐scissors,

219
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,454
and you're gonna
lose on purpose.

220
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,157
I'm scissors.
You're paper.

221
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,193
Whoever loses will be forbidden
from presenting false reports

222
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,563
<i>or arbitrary messages</i>
<i>from here on out.</i>

223
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,364
<i>Do you understand?</i>

224
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,234
We're taking advantage
of the wording in the pledges.

225
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,269
Now there won't be
any more spies.

226
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,371
All right, let's go.

227
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,740
All:
Aschente!

228
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,943
As you can see,
with things being how they are,

229
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,845
our region is in dire need
of provisions.

230
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,180
Right, yeah, okay,
in that case,

231
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,349
here's what you're gonna
need to do.
Yes, sir?

232
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:33,654
Let's see, we'll introduce
crop‐rotation‐based agriculture.

233
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,455
You'll have one field with...

234
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,124
Wheat, root crops, barley,
and room for pastures.

235
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,493
Sora:
<i>You'll rotate the crops</i>
<i>in that order.</i>

236
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,395
Counselor:
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

237
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,797
Treasury... bonds?

238
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,465
I'll give you
the details later.

239
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,268
You'll issue these bonds
and make the banks buy them.

240
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,170
That'll make a budget
Uh, yes, sir.

241
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,274
<i>Now we just sit back for a few</i>
<i>turns and see how things go.</i>

242
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,279
Stephanie:
Uh, just who are you two, anyway?

243
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,447
You handled all those
problems so easily.

244
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,784
Sora:
Steph, I'm the type
of player who does

245
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,019
all the boring stuff
at once when I play "Civ."

246
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,154
<i>thing I downloaded a ton</i>
<i>of reference texts</i>

247
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,256
<i>while studying for quiz games.</i>

248
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,292
That's not fair, Sora.
You're cheating.

249
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,295
Don't call me a cheater,
not when we're in a world

250
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,230
<i>where cheating means</i>
<i>manipulating</i>

251
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,464
<i>the playing field</i>
<i>with magic.</i>

252
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,200
It looks like
they're ready.

253
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,738
All right,
I guess this is it.

254
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:27,007
Man:
<i>It's beginning.</i>

255
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,442
Wait a minute,
are you really wearing that?

256
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,479
<i>Why not? Gotta be comfortable</i>
<i>to do my job, don't I?</i>

257
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,515
Shiro:
<i>Sora?</i>

258
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,883
Hmm, if you're ready...

259
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,820
then let's do this.

260
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,490
( all murmuring )

261
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,739
Sora:
Uh...
( clears throat )

262
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,541
( high‐pitched )
Hidey‐ho!

263
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,175
Sora, you're freaking out.

264
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,612
Sora:
<i>Shut up, I'm just as scared</i>
<i>of crowds you are.</i>

265
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,014
I'm just better at faking it.

266
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,518
Huh?

267
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:22,162
My beloved citizens,
no, my fellow humans,

268
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,064
<i>we Imanity live</i>
<i>in a world</i>

269
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>where war is forbidden,</i>
<i>and yet despite this fact,</i>

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,536
<i>we have managed to lose</i>
<i>almost all of our lands</i>

271
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,072
<i>to our neighboring nations,</i>
<i>save Elkia,</i>

272
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,540
<i>our final stronghold.</i>

273
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,644
<i>So I ask you now, is it because</i>
<i>our last king failed us?</i>

274
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,246
<i>Because we are the lowest</i>
<i>ranked of all the races?</i>

275
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,215
<i>Because we can't use magic?</i>

276
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,751
<i>Because we are fated</i>
<i>to die helpless?</i>

277
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,188
Not a chance.
No way!

278
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:51,157
<i>In the ancient war,</i>
<i>the gods, the elves,</i>

279
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,026
<i>the Warbeasts,</i>
<i>and all the other races</i>

280
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,460
<i>battled against each other,</i>

281
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,329
<i>and we not only fought</i>
<i>amongst them,</i>

282
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,799
<i>we lived to survive</i>
<i>to this day!</i>

283
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,601
<i>Do you ever ask yourself</i>
<i>how was it</i>

284
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,770
<i>that this whole continent</i>
<i>was once ruled by humans?</i>

285
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,307
<i>Is it because we are a race</i>
<i>that specialized in violence?</i>

286
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,342
<i>We can't use magic</i>
<i>like the elves.</i>

287
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,912
<i>We're not physically strong</i>
<i>like the Warbeasts.</i>

288
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,480
<i>Nor do we have the longevity</i>
<i>of the Flugel.</i>

289
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,884
<i>So then what made us able</i>
<i>to conquer this land?</i>

290
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:20,020
<i>We must've been warriors,</i>
<i>right?</i>

291
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,889
Nay, my brethren,
we were able to survive

292
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,925
and to fight...

293
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,661
because we are weak.

294
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:31,598
<i>In every era and every place,</i>
<i>the strong sharpen their fangs</i>

295
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,000
<i>while the weak</i>
<i>sharpen their intellect.</i>

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,136
<i>Then why are we in</i>
<i>such danger now?</i>

297
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,071
<i>It's because the ten pledges</i>
<i>have broken</i>

298
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,006
<i>the banks of the strong</i>
<i>and they have learned</i>

299
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,242
<i>to sharpen their minds</i>
<i>just as we had to</i>

300
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,544
<i>out of necessity.</i>

301
00:15:43,544 --> 00:15:46,379
<i>Now the wisdom,</i>
<i>the strategies that we the weak</i>

302
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,983
once monopolized, the power
to beat all the odds,

303
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,818
the strong have gained
them all!

304
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,320
That's what brought us
to this state.

305
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,993
Now answer me this‐

306
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,196
what makes you bow
your heads like that?

307
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:07,000
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>Why do you bow your heads?!</i>

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,235
You should be proud
to be weak!

309
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,472
<i>We are the weak,</i>
<i>just as we have always been.</i>

310
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,409
<i>Don't you see?</i>
<i>Nothing has changed at all!</i>

311
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,513
<i>True, the stronger races</i>
<i>may imitate our weapons,</i>

312
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,982
<i>but they will never</i>
<i>master them.</i>

313
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:22,883
Why, you ask?

314
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,017
Because at the heart
of our strength lies

315
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:28,855
a fearful anxiety
born of our most
humiliating weaknesses.

316
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,858
<i>This fear has given us</i>
<i>the insight to not only escape</i>

317
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,360
from magic but
to learn its secrets.

318
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,797
It has given us the wisdom
of experience

319
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:40,233
because we must predict
the future to survive!

320
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:43,436
I say it once more‐
be proud to be weak!

321
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,040
We are the noble weak
who have throughout history

322
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,109
torn out the throats
of those fools

323
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,645
who sit idly by
and boast of their strength.

324
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:56,016
I hereby declare
as Elkia's 205th king‐

325
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,383
And its queen, too...

326
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,521
Both:
That we will rule
this kingdom together.

327
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,294
It's here.

328
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,598
Each leader of each race
is given their own jewel,

329
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:12,999
<i>the race piece.</i>

330
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,268
We hereby declare
we'll live as the weak,

331
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:18,872
protect our weak brethren,
and we will use our wisdom

332
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,407
to make the strong
bow before us!

333
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:26,146
We are as we once were
and as we will always be.

334
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,415
Hear this, my people,
you are part of a long legacy,

335
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,418
the wisest of the races,
one that could become anything

336
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,822
because we came into
this world with nothing!

337
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,224
( crowd cheers )

338
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,595
Now let's begin this game.

339
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,597
You've suffered enough,
haven't you?

340
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,199
You've endured enough
humiliation, right?

341
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,970
It all ends now.
Are you ready, Imanity?

342
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,573
As of this moment,
my country, Elkia,

343
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:57,443
will officially
be declaring war
on the rest of the world.

344
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,814
What?!
Let's show them
what we're made of!

345
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,148
We'll take back our land...

346
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,017
Both:
And everything else, too!

347
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:07,453
( crowd cheers )

348
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,088
Steph:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

349
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,692
What in the world do you think
you're doing?!
( screams )

350
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:14,127
Oh, my God,
would you relax already?

351
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,629
You're acting all crazy.

352
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:17,964
How can I be calm
at a time like this?

353
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,199
Declaring war,
are you two trying

354
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,534
to destroy this country
or something?!

355
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,402
Could you please
at least try to think

356
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:25,305
before you open
your pretty mouth?

357
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,173
How are the other nations
going to view the fact

358
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,842
that we took out the elves?

359
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:32,012
They'll think were backed by
someone really powerful, see?

360
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,747
Yeah, but still‐

361
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:37,984
Which means until they know
who that mysterious race is...

362
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,853
They won't be able
to attack us.

363
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:43,223
Yep, everybody's gonna start
suspecting everybody else,

364
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,658
and they'll all end up
doing nothing.

365
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,594
That's why we took the risk
of declaring war.

366
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,530
And in the meantime,
we'll be able to shore up

367
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,164
the homefront at our leisure.

368
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,265
Cool, huh?

369
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:58,839
Stephanie:
<i>They put that much</i>
<i>thought into it.</i>

370
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,241
<i>Blank.</i>

371
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,345
<i>Maybe those two</i>
<i>really can do it.</i>

372
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,754
Sora:
<i>So we've gone from our tiny</i>
<i>bedroom to a crappy inn</i>

373
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:16,790
<i>to Steph's room</i>
<i>and now the royal chambers.</i>

374
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,325
This one's gonna be
the hardest relax in.

375
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,362
The Flugel.
Huh?

376
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,297
Sora:
<i>"Possessing great longevity</i>

377
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,567
<i>and superior</i>
<i>magical capability,</i>

378
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,502
<i>this angelic race lives</i>
<i>on the giant</i>

379
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,904
<i>floating Phantasma</i>
<i>Avant Heim."</i>

380
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,774
"Their insatiable thirst
for knowledge compels them

381
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:37,778
to challenge others for books
from all over the world."

382
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:40,814
I bet we could get one of those
guys to come over to our side.

383
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:43,650
<i>We've got knowledge</i>
<i>from another world, after all.</i>

384
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,924
Wh‐what was that?

385
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,196
Sora...

386
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,199
( laughs )
Well, well.

387
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,702
Looks like things are starting
to get fun, huh?

388
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,570
It's that kid
who thinks he's God.

389
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,072
Oh, please, I don't just
think that I'm God.

390
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,574
I am God, silly.

391
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,210
And you should call me Tet,
remember?

392
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:15,048
( both scream )
Not again!

393
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,983
How do you like it?
My world, I mean.

394
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,919
Are you enjoying it so far?

395
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,622
Sure, I like your style, kid.

396
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,790
<i>Might be nice if the God</i>
<i>from our world</i>

397
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,527
was as hands‐on as you.
Yeah?

398
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:30,263
But our enemies can use magic,
something we can't do at all.

399
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,133
Our only remaining
territory is one city.

400
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,801
Our situation
is appallingly bad,

401
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,737
and to protect
the name of Blank,

402
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,106
we can't lose a single game,
that's the world we're in.

403
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,441
What do you think?

404
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,444
It's great.
Isn't it?

405
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,413
Well, awesome,
I guess it was
a good idea to bring

406
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,183
the two of you here
after all, but know this‐

407
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,385
I don't favor
any individual race.

408
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,755
I'm usually
not so hands‐on myself.

409
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,658
Although...
remember what I said.

410
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:00,994
Everything in this world
is decided by games.

411
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,796
I see.

412
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:05,566
In other words, even the title
of One True God

413
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,900
is decided by a game.

414
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,401
You got it.

415
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,906
<i>Tet:</i>
<i>That's why I set it up so that</i>
<i>there were exactly 16 races.</i>

416
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:16,309
Sora:
<i>Each side on a</i>
<i>chess board has 16 pieces.</i>

417
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,278
<i>So I guess defeating</i>
<i>all the races</i>

418
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,547
<i>gives you the right</i>
<i>to challenge God, huh?</i>

419
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,583
Tet:
<i>I love the way</i>
<i>your brain works.</i>

420
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,751
You guys catch on to how things
work here so quick,

421
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,353
it's hard to believe you came
from another world.

422
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,189
Sora:
<i>Why, thank you, God‐dude.</i>

423
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,357
But, hey, careful
what you wish for.

424
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,527
Don't forget
that it's Blank's policy

425
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,662
to be number one
in whatever game we play.

426
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,932
And that attitude is exactly
why I was certain that you

427
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:42,168
wouldn't be able to resist
the temptation to challenge me.

428
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:44,337
Now wait a minute,
you do recall

429
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,306
that you lost to us
once already, right?

430
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:50,376
I do, and that's why
I won't lose next time.

431
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,780
( laughs )
Hey, God‐kid‐

432
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,183
You can call me Tet.
Okay, Tet.

433
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,752
You'd never
lost before, had you?

434
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,723
The God of Play was so very,
very upset at his first loss,

435
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:06,459
he just had to bring us
here, am I wrong?

436
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,197
Interesting.
What makes you think that?

437
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,398
'Cause I get it.

438
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:14,400
I know where you're
coming from, bro.

439
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,169
You see,
Blank doesn't lose.

440
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:20,406
But we've lost to each other
more times than I can count.

441
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,409
You're not allowed
to quit while you're ahead.

442
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,248
( laughs )

443
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:31,952
Oh, boy, was I ever right
to choose you two crazy kids.

444
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:35,088
That's right, I don't want you
dropping out of the game,

445
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:36,590
and I do want a rematch.

446
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,825
Are you disappointed that's the
reason I brought you here?

447
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,127
No way,
I'm actually relieved

448
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,097
it's not some lame‐ass reason
like saving humanity

449
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,231
or something
along those lines.

450
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:48,468
Well, I'm gonna
head back then. Bye‐bye!

451
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,704
Hey, Tet!
Hmm?

452
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,006
Thanks a lot for dragging us
into this world.

453
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:56,543
Like, I think this
is where we really belong.

454
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,212
Thanks a bunch.
We owe you.

455
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:00,547
( laughs )

456
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:04,785
All:
See you around.
Next time, on the chessboard.

457
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,827
Wait, so that's Tet?

458
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:14,528
( both sigh )

459
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:17,097
Steph:
<i>Sora, Shiro!</i>

460
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,565
Hey, don't
tell me that kid

461
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,266
was actually
the One True God!

462
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,235
Yeah, why you ask?

463
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,403
Are you serious?

464
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,171
You said you'd
beat him in a game.

465
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,173
Are you freakin' crazy?!
Forget about it, Steph.

466
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,575
<i>Just get us down from here.</i>

467
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,612
Tet:
<i>Now that we've gotten all the</i>
<i>particulars out of the way,</i>

468
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:35,048
<i>Please allow me to begin</i>
<i>this tale properly.</i>

469
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:36,717
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

470
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:38,852
Sora:
<i>We'll start by</i>
<i>conquering the world,</i>

471
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:43,023
and then our goal is to
beat God at his own game.

472
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:45,792
Tet:
Now it's time for
an amazing story,

473
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,128
one I promise
you've never heard before.

474
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,663
( laughs )

475
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:51,932
Steph:
<i>We sure had fun</i>
<i>last night, didn't we?</i>

476
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,901
Sora:
<i>Oh, yeah, playing games</i>
<i>is the best thing ever.</i>
