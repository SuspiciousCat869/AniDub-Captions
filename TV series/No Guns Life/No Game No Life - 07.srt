1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,004
( both yelping )

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,540
I could not hate
baths any more.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,975
Hey, Shiro, how am I
supposed to wash you

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,110
if you keep squirming?

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,077
Come on, sis,

6
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,913
after all the craziness
that went down today,

7
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,981
<i>I'd say a bath</i>
<i>is definitely in order.</i>

8
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,117
<i>Just go with it.</i>

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,886
I hate taking baths 'cause
it makes my hair stiff.

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:23,557
If that's the case, why don't
you try some of my shampoo?

11
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,993
( screams )
W‐where'd the hell'd
you come from, Jibril?!

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,262
Suffering from tired,
dried‐out hair?

13
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,497
Get soft, silky,
flowing tresses

14
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:34,334
with Flugel's very own
Spirit Water Blend.

15
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:38,271
And as a bonus, I,
Jibril, your new slave,

16
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,341
<i>will even throw in a free</i>
<i>back scrubbing for my Masters.</i>

17
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,977
Let me explore
those hot alien bodies.

18
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:44,945
Shiro, watch out!

19
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,213
Her very existence
is 18 and over!

20
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,015
Jibril, wait.

21
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,350
Oh!

22
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,286
You just sit there
and watch, naughty girl.

23
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,688
What? That's not fair.

24
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,223
The stupid steam's covering up
all the good stuff.

25
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,726
Look at that, already bossing
her around like a pro.

26
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,595
You've really made
your big brother proud,

27
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,564
<i>learning to crack the whip</i>
<i>at such a young age.</i>

28
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,431
I really hate the fact
that I'm starting

29
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,802
to get used
to this crap.

30
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,364
Steph:
<i>Uh, what in</i>
<i>the world is this?</i>

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,366
I prepared it for my Masters.

32
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,402
I do believe in your country
they call a kitchen.

33
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,572
Um, excuse me, Steve‐

34
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,172
It's Steph!

35
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,473
My name is Stephanie Dola.

36
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,708
Well, "Dola" is ugly,

37
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,342
and I don't care
for you much anyway,

38
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,679
so I'm going to call you
something easier to remember

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,580
like Dolly.

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,614
UGH! Dolly?!

41
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,949
By the way, I received
a message from Sora.

42
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,218
"Looks like there's plenty
of sugar and butter here,

43
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,320
so feel free to bake
whatever you want."

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,689
Message ends.

45
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,356
Steph:
<i>Really?</i>

46
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,359
Oh, think of all the desserts
I can make with this.

47
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,662
Ohh! Hold on, that's just
their backhanded way

48
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,363
of getting me to bake
goodies for them.

49
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,266
Why do they always try to take
advantage of poor little me?

50
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,402
But if it weren't for you,
we would have lost.

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,770
Thanks a lot, Steph.

52
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,371
( squeals )
I'm on it!

53
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,641
So this is how the lowly
Imanity experience

54
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,910
that strange feeling
called love, isn't it?

55
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,477
Huh? Love?

56
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,246
No, no, no, you're wrong!

57
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,715
I believe you were ordered
to fall in love,

58
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,417
not stay in love...
so what's the deal, Dolly?

59
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,353
Why do you still seem to be
so affected by it, hmm?

60
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,088
At first, I thought
you were useless,

61
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,291
but your clownish behavior
is actually quite amusing.

62
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,331
<i>( leaves rustle )</i>

63
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,100
Greetings, Kurami,
I'm finally back.

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,036
You wanted some
information, right?

65
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,371
Or was it food?
Wait, I know.

66
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,541
How about me?
( laughs )

67
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:04,310
Thanks, but I'll take
my clothes first.

68
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,981
Mm, this is great.

69
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,984
We had that poor girl you beat
in the tournament to thank.

70
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,754
Ever since she started enacting
the new King's policies,

71
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,457
the quality of life in Elkia
has really started to improve.

72
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,727
Whatever.
Little Princess. Hmph.

73
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,663
She's just the puppet
of a puppet,

74
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,831
and as shameless as her
grandfather was foolish.

75
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,633
I know you feel guilty
for trying to cheat her

76
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,969
out of the kingdom,
and I know you've been working

77
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,605
on an apology when you didn't
think I was watching.

78
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,507
You're so adorable, Kurami.

79
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,576
Hey, how'd you‐
I mean, more importantly,

80
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,578
don't you have
any intel to report?

81
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,746
Oh, well, this and that.

82
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,882
It seems that the new King
has somehow acquired a Flugel

83
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,618
as a personal slave
and he's really interested

84
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,587
in the Eastern Federation.

85
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,054
I think that's about it.

86
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,623
All of that's true?

87
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:55,028
Okay, maybe I got a little
carried away, but remember,

88
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,663
it's for the sake of Imanity.

89
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,833
It definitely has nothing
to do with being in love.

90
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,935
( menacing voice )
Now then, dear Jibril,

91
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,938
tell me what you know about
the Eastern Federation,

92
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,608
the sexy animal‐girl paradise
we're about to conquer.

93
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,376
Well, I guess this country's
pretty much done for.

94
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,045
As you wish, my King.

95
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,915
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>The various Warbeast clans</i>

96
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,850
<i>were embroiled in the civil war</i>
<i>for many years,</i>

97
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,719
<i>mostly due</i>
<i>to physical differences,</i>

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,688
<i>but the shrine priestess</i>
<i>put an end to the battles</i>

99
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,089
<i>in less than half a century.</i>

100
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,326
<i>The clans unified</i>
<i>into a massive naval empire</i>

101
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,929
<i>and became the world's</i>
<i>third‐largest country,</i>

102
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,196
<i>the Eastern Federation.</i>

103
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,600
Sora:
<i>So, a land of cat girls,</i>
<i>dog girls, fox girls,</i>

104
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,236
<i>rabbit girls, and all other</i>
<i>kinds of animal girls,</i>

105
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,971
<i>and they'll all be mine.</i>

106
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,140
All right,
we must conquer them at once.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,175
( normal voice )
But to do that,
we'll need to utilize

108
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,210
all that precious knowledge
you've been collecting

109
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,547
<i>over the last millennia.</i>

110
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,783
I am sorry, master,
I doubt that would do much good.

111
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,118
Unfortunately, I can think
of no path to victory

112
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,455
when it comes to facing
the Eastern Federation.

113
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,691
Jibril,
you don't mean that.

114
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,860
You're saying
Blank can't win?

115
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,861
Not quite.

116
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,096
What I mean is
I won't be of much help

117
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,665
in forming
your strategy.

118
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,633
There was once
a time where I, too,

119
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,936
fought the Eastern
Federation... and lost.

120
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,171
( all gasp )

121
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,906
Kurami:
That settles it.

122
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,009
I knew Elkia
had another nation's support.

123
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:16,977
It must be the Warbeasts.

124
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,780
Okay, then, so what
you think is going on?

125
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,815
You of all
people should know.

126
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,851
<i>Kurami:</i>
<i>On at least four occasions,</i>
<i>Elven Gard challenged</i>

127
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>the Eastern Federation,</i>
<i>and lost each time.</i>

128
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,224
Fiel:
<i>Hmm... we might have won</i>
<i>if the players weren't</i>

129
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,827
<i>those senile elders,</i>
<i>but okay.</i>

130
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,797
The point is,
when I faced Blank, I lost,

131
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,066
and that means they were able
to overcome your Elven magic,

132
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,768
and that Flugel was next.

133
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,337
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>they must be using</i>

134
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,206
<i>some sort of</i>
<i>Warbeast sorcery</i>

135
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,441
<i>that even an Elf</i>
<i>couldn't detect.</i>

136
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,977
Are you sure?

137
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,513
That's gotta
be it.

138
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,814
There's no way
Imanity could beat

139
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,950
a higher race
by itself.

140
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,753
Sora:
<i>Don't underestimate humanity.</i>

141
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,224
He's got some nerve.

142
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,659
( sighs )

143
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,529
So you and the Elves both got
your asses handed to you?

144
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:11,598
What the hell kind of game
did you play anyway?

145
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,666
When setting the rules,

146
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,935
one of the Federation's
conditions is that the loser

147
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,803
has their memories
of the game erased.

148
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,505
Now do you understand
what I mean?

149
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:21,307
Yeah, I get it,
it's impossible.

150
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,976
What you mean
it's impossible?

151
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,045
Sora: <i>If they wipe your memories</i>
<i>when you lose</i>

152
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,147
<i>and you have no recollection</i>
<i>of the game,</i>

153
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,749
<i>how are you gonna adapt</i>
<i>your strategy</i>

154
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,216
<i>the next time</i>
<i>you challenge them?</i>

155
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,853
<i>To top it off, they can also</i>
<i>read your mind?</i>

156
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,988
<i>How are we supposed to beat</i>
<i>a race like that?</i>

157
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,123
Shiro:
<i>Don't be such a Steph, Steph.</i>

158
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,092
<i>It's pretty obvious.</i>

159
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:39,693
( growls )

160
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,662
Huh? No, wait a second.

161
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,963
It doesn't add up.

162
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:43,864
What doesn't?

163
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,567
Since trying to beat
the Warbeasts is so pointless,

164
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,636
their enemies should eventually
stop trying, right?

165
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,172
It would be less painful
that way for everyone.

166
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,741
That, dear sis, is why
you suck at strategy games

167
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,043
despite being
a little smarter than me.

168
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,479
They've got some kind
of slam‐dunk method

169
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,314
of beating Flugel
and even Elves.

170
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,817
Why don't they pretend
like they're vulnerable instead?

171
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,386
Then they'd lure the enemy in,
give them a healthy beat down,

172
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,921
and snatch their land easy.

173
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,490
That play style
is just... mean.

174
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,792
Appalled!

175
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,160
Shiro:
<i>There is something</i>
<i>weird about it, though.</i>

176
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,763
<i>How could they have expanded</i>
<i>their country so much</i>

177
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,764
<i>in just half a century?</i>

178
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,633
Sora:
<i>See? I told you</i>
<i>it's strange!</i>

179
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,367
Master, wait,
I just thought of something.

180
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,537
I think I might be able
to explain how that happened.

181
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,507
Oh, really now?
Let's hear it.

182
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,942
I saw something
in here somewhere.

183
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:32,478
Only one country has challenged
the Eastern Federation

184
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,914
in the last ten years.

185
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,783
Only one?
Who's dumb enough to do that?

186
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,919
Why don't I just show you?
It'll be faster.

187
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,622
Come along, Dolly,
you're going with us.

188
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,789
All right then, masters.

189
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,025
Hold on tight
and don't let go.

190
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,695
Now then,
if everyone is ready.

191
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,234
( screams )

192
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,870
( surprised grunting )

193
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,377
Wha‐what's going on?!

194
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,479
Wow, it's so nice
and clear today.

195
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,215
J‐Jibril, what the heck
did you just do?!

196
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,217
Ever hear of teleporting?

197
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,353
Right, I keep forgetting.

198
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,355
I'm living
in a fantasy world now.

199
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,357
So how far can
you teleport?

200
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,092
I can travel as far
as I can see

201
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,628
and to any location
I've visited before.

202
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,196
Both:
So a zoom spell.

203
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,999
How was poor little Imanity
able to survive in a war

204
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,334
against a whole race
full of monsters like her?

205
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,337
That's been the most perplexing
mystery in all our history.

206
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,708
Oh, I remember it like
it was just yesterday.

207
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,143
<i>The Dragonia, Giganto,</i>
<i>and Old Deus</i>

208
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,814
<i>all storming the battlefield,</i>
<i>50 Flugel desperately fighting</i>

209
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,716
<i>to sever a single</i>
<i>Dragon's head,</i>

210
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,119
<i>and then 200 of our finest</i>
<i>facing a god in vain!</i>

211
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,388
Why, I can almost smell
the blood.

212
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,289
( all groan )

213
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,691
Ah, yes,
the good old days.

214
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,793
Have a look over
there, master.

215
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,260
Sora:
<i>What I'm looking at here?</i>

216
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,731
<i>Some ugly high‐rise crapping up</i>
<i>the fantasy landscape?</i>

217
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,865
Shiro:
<i>It's huge.</i>

218
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,702
Steph:
<i>Oh, that's the Eastern</i>
<i>Federation's Elkian embassy.</i>

219
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,671
Well, that kind of seems
like overkill, do you think?

220
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,073
Actually, that used to be
the Elkian palace,

221
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,110
but the Eastern Federation
did a bit of remodeling.

222
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,178
Ah! Hey,
hold on!

223
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,280
So that place
used to be your palace?

224
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,215
Why do they have it?

225
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,684
All starting
to make sense now, Master?

226
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,753
In the last ten years,
only one country

227
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,522
has challenged the Federation.

228
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,690
Uh‐huh, and
blew it, too.

229
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,327
Yeah. The
challenger was Elkia.

230
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,100
Shiro:
You hanging in there, Sora?

231
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,638
Sora:
Yeah, sorry, just wallowing
in despair, that's all.

232
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:38,271
UWAH!

233
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,406
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Even the Elves gave up</i>
<i>after four losses,</i>

234
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,009
<i>but Elkia challenged</i>
<i>these guys eight times</i>

235
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,845
and bet half its kingdom?

236
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,047
I'm starting to think that
old King really was an idiot.

237
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,382
Hey, what was that?
Weren't you the one
that kept claiming

238
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,618
that he was right despite
what everyone else said?

239
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:55,055
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>And thanks to his recklessness,</i>
<i>your territory got cut in half.</i>

240
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,957
<i>You expect me to defend that?</i>

241
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,926
Can you just imagine
all the industry and farming

242
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,696
we could have if the country
still had all that land?

243
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,998
Man, he was as hopeless
as you are.

244
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,499
<i>Did he just suck</i>
<i>at getting lucky</i>

245
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,270
<i>thinking if he kept</i>
<i>trying that eventually</i>
<i>he might somehow win?</i>

246
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,238
Okay, maybe it's true

247
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,207
that my grandfather
wasn't good at games,

248
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,843
but he wasn't stupid enough
to risk the three million lives

249
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,580
under his care unless
he had a good reason.

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,614
The people came first!

251
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:24,718
Unlike the two of you,
he was kind and loving
and reasonable at least.

252
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, excuse me
for being cruel and awful.

253
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,389
Heh. Besides, if throwing
away half your shit

254
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:33,994
qualifies you as reasonable,
that I'm happier being a jerk.

255
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,630
Eh, Maybe you're right
and he was a good king,

256
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,799
But just a good king
for a bunch of whiners

257
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,634
that won't take things
into their own hands.

258
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,803
That's more likely.

259
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,505
<i>Useless friggin' humans,</i>

260
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,273
<i>completely hopeless,</i>
<i>every last one of them.</i>

261
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,242
Huh?

262
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,515
You can go ahead and mock me,
I don't care.

263
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:58,451
But don't insult my grandfather
or what he believed in.

264
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,490
Hey, Steph,
wait, come back!

265
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,127
Too far, way too far.

266
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,564
After finding out about this
ridiculous state of affairs,

267
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,365
how else should I react?

268
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,970
Hmm?

269
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,340
They're yummy.

270
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,313
( impressed ) Damn.

271
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,150
<i>They</i> are <i>good.</i>

272
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:41,427
Steph:
<i>Um, Granddaddy,</i>
<i>what's this key for?</i>

273
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,764
Well, sweetie,
it opens the lock to something

274
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,699
I've stored away
that's very important.

275
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,167
Oooh! I've heard
about that!

276
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,735
So it's for
your secret man books

277
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:49,936
that you can't show
to other people?

278
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,972
No, no, my dear,
that's something else.

279
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:56,777
( stammers ) This key,
this is a key of hope.

280
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,244
Hope, huh?

281
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,647
Maybe someday,
it will belong to you.

282
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,048
What do I do with it,
Granddaddy?

283
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:05,451
Grandfather:
<i>I want you to find someone</i>
<i>very special to give it to,</i>

284
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,622
<i>someone to whom</i>
<i>you can entrust our kingdom,</i>

285
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,392
<i>someone who can carry</i>
<i>the weight of Imanity's future.</i>

286
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,765
Like hell I'm ever giving this
to that stupid‐

287
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,366
Hey, there, you got a second?

288
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:22,903
( screams )

289
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,638
What the heck
are you doing here?!

290
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,773
Dolly, I highly recommend

291
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,809
you return
to the library immediately.

292
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,576
What's going on now?

293
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,011
Though I came here
on my own,

294
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,179
I feel your presence
would benefit my Master.

295
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,348
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>However, I won't force you.</i>

296
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,883
Huh?

297
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,855
This is so ridiculous.
Like they even care about me.

298
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:44,324
( groans softly )

299
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,064
Fine! I'll go!

300
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,710
Jibril:
<i>Master, no matter</i>
<i>how hard you look, I doubt</i>

301
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,013
<i>you'll find evidence to justify</i>
<i>the King's foolish actions.</i>

302
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,815
No, that's not
what I'm looking for.

303
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,817
Something about this
is bugging me, though.

304
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,385
You wouldn't happen to be
looking for clues

305
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,454
to help Dolly feel better,
now would you?

306
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,990
Look, I'm just reviewing
all the info so I don't make

307
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,160
the same mistake on my
animal‐girl‐kingdom conquest.

308
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,228
So anyway,
why'd the former king

309
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,730
challenge the
Federation eight times?

310
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>A reasonable man responsible</i>
<i>for three million people</i>

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,503
<i>wouldn't just rush</i>
<i>into defeat again and again.</i>

312
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:32,839
Right here, isn't this the first
place he offered up as a wager?

313
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,241
That's an omatite mine,
isn't it?

314
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,143
Sora:
Even though it's
a valuable metal,

315
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,513
Imanity doesn't have
the technology to refine it,

316
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:40,714
so it's worthless to us.

317
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,449
Then here's the second bet,
then the third bet,

318
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:47,954
the fourth bet, and
finally the eighth, here.

319
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,490
Up till the very last game
when he bet the castle,

320
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,026
looks like he didn't wager
anything of value.

321
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,597
Come on, I know we had
a reason for it, but why?

322
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,230
Master?

323
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,400
Why wipe challengers' memories
when it only discourages them?

324
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,103
Why did Elven Gard
challenge them four times?

325
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,472
Why did the former king‐
no, wait.

326
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,276
Maybe he stopped at eight
'cause maybe by the eighth time,

327
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,079
he actually achieved his goal.

328
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,816
There is no written proof,
but what if the last King

329
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:18,018
didn't lose his memories
after all?

330
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,955
Master, please don't take
this as being rude,

331
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,424
but from what I've seen,
not all Imanity act

332
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,127
with the same forethought
and attention as you.

333
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,862
Not all, but I'm sure
some of them do,

334
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,365
and most of the time,
they're probably misunderstood.

335
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:36,202
Now is the new King, it's my
duty to try and understand them.

336
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,439
I know what you're thinking‐
how can I possibly believe

337
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,342
that an inferior race like
humanity actually has a chance?

338
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,977
No, I wasn't thinking
that at all.

339
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,212
The answer's
simple, really.

340
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:49,382
If you want to know the truth,
I don't believe in humanity.

341
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:53,286
Humans are lowly
and stupid creatures,

342
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,156
every single last one of them,
including me.

343
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,091
They're all crap.

344
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,126
It doesn't matter
what planet they're from,

345
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,995
this one or my old one.

346
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,098
Not a damn thing's
changed a bit.

347
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,703
I...

348
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,271
I've heard enough.

349
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,708
However, I believe
in humanity's potential.

350
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,977
( gasps )

351
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,980
If you need proof,
it's right here.

352
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,016
This little human
is the real deal.

353
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,051
She's a shining example
of our potential,

354
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,187
our strength,
our hope, and our dreams

355
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,490
that reach even
beyond the gods.

356
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,859
I remember the
first day we met.

357
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,261
It was almost
eight years ago.

358
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>she was only three.</i>

359
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,799
<i>The first time</i>
<i>she heard my name,</i>

360
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,134
<i>guess what her response was.</i>

361
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:45,338
You seem so empty.

362
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,977
Sora:
<i>First off, she knew</i>
<i>that my name meant sky,</i>

363
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,646
<i>and then she noticed</i>
<i>that I was smiling</i>

364
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,615
<i>just 'cause everyone else</i>
<i>in the room was.</i>

365
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,417
<i>A double entendre</i>
<i>at three years old.</i>

366
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,020
I was so pumped.
This was it.

367
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,089
I found someone
who was worth something.

368
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,358
Also... ( sighs )

369
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,895
I wanted to be like her
or at least try.

370
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,864
<i>You know,</i>
<i>back in our old world,</i>

371
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>humans can fly through the sky</i>

372
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,934
<i>and even travel</i>
<i>amongst the stars.</i>

373
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,069
Jibril:
<i>Sorry, but that's</i>
<i>kind of hard to believe.</i>

374
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,305
Sora:
<i>Yeah, no kidding,</i>
<i>even humanity itself doubted</i>

375
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,341
any of that was possible,
but someone

376
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,712
eventually pulled it off,
the real deal, pulled it off.

377
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,181
That's why it's up to us
to ensure that the potential

378
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,183
of the misunderstood
gets realized

379
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,553
before it all goes to waste.

380
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:35,856
And that's the reason why I need
to start believing in him.

381
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,158
The former king was right.

382
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,371
Sora...

383
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,678
Huh?

384
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,783
I have something that I...

385
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,751
want to give you.

386
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,891
There's no doubt.

387
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:11,992
It's his porn.

388
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,426
I knew it!

389
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,262
But my dear Master, which door
do you think it goes to?

390
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,065
People usually stash
their porn in their own room.

391
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,433
So then,
it's this one.

392
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,803
Actually, sis and I
found it a long time ago.

393
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:23,403
Peace.

394
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,037
Huh?

395
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,674
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Remember when I said</i>
<i>this bed was lopsided</i>
<i>and hard to sleep on?</i>

396
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>That was just the start</i>
<i>of the puzzle.</i>

397
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,879
<i>With a little messing around</i>
<i>here and there...</i>

398
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:40,521
<i>Ah, there you go, one secret</i>
<i>room coming right up.</i>

399
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:43,256
I give up.
I don't know anything.

400
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,195
( gasps ) Hmm.

401
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,135
( all gasp )

402
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,121
Grandfather:
<i>I leave this in hopes</i>
<i>that you will not be</i>

403
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,557
<i>Imanity's last king</i>

404
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,593
<i>but rather</i>
<i>the one who restores it.</i>

405
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:22,162
<i>I admit,</i>
<i>I am not a wise king.</i>

406
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,098
<i>In fact, I fully expect</i>
<i>to be remembered</i>

407
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>as one of the most foolish.</i>

408
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,269
<i>But that is of no matter.</i>

409
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,305
<i>I take up this pen</i>
<i>for the future King,</i>

410
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,341
<i>the one who will one day</i>
<i>bring us to glory.</i>

411
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,244
<i>All I can do is trust that</i>
<i>the story of my pathetic</i>

412
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,380
<i>and seemingly</i>
<i>hopeless struggles...</i>

413
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,182
Steph: ( overlapping )
Will someday assist you

414
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,318
in your quest
as our next king.

415
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:46,920
Sora:
<i>I knew it.</i>

416
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,691
The old king didn't have
his memories erased after all.

417
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,126
Unlike the Elves,
the Warbeasts knew

418
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,795
Imanity didn't stand
a chance to win

419
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,897
and looked down on them
as easy prey.

420
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,132
They didn't erase his memories
because they wanted him

421
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,301
to keep trying.

422
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,504
Shiro:
<i>Was that some way</i>
<i>to lure him in?</i>

423
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:05,606
Sora:
They purposefully
went easy on him

424
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,909
to make him think he could
beat them the next time.

425
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,878
<i>But still, the king knew that,</i>
<i>and he challenged them anyway</i>

426
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,881
<i>hoping to figure out</i>
<i>how their game worked.</i>

427
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,250
<i>He deliberately gave them</i>
<i>useless land</i>

428
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,252
<i>that he'd eventually</i>
<i>try to take back.</i>

429
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,688
So then if he played
so many times,

430
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,324
why didn't he reveal the secrets
of the game to anyone?

431
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,660
They probably made him
take a pledge,

432
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,864
like he couldn't tell people
as long as he lived.

433
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,232
So it was all
for nothing?

434
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,734
Not quite.

435
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,738
Once he died, the pledge
no longer applied.

436
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,606
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>He bet eight times,</i>

437
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,775
<i>but then he found a loophole</i>
<i>in the pledges,</i>

438
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:45,546
<i>then entrusted that information</i>
<i>to the next king.</i>

439
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:48,148
<i>Humanity's greatest gambler.</i>

440
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,617
Shiro:
<i>That's why he set up</i>
<i>a gambling tournament</i>

441
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,987
<i>to find the next ruler,</i>
<i>even if it ousted Steph.</i>

442
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,858
Sora:
<i>Your former King,</i>
<i>he made a bet.</i>

443
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:58,725
<i>He bet that a human,</i>

444
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,861
<i>someone from</i>
<i>the lowest‐ranked race,</i>

445
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:03,830
<i>would rise up and crush</i>
<i>all the other races.</i>

446
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,767
Grandfather:
<i>The possibility rests</i>
<i>ever so close to naught.</i>

447
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:10,637
<i>However...</i>
<i>it still remains.</i>

448
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,340
Sora:
<i>Steph...</i>

449
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,610
He just pretended
to be a fool,

450
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,279
lost the bets
but kept trying.

451
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,381
In reality,
he was a great man

452
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:24,350
trying to save Imanity
up until his death.

453
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:30,190
<i>This is his trust</i>
<i>in our people.</i>

454
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,392
You know what, Steph?
Your old Gramps‐

455
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,228
no, sorry,
I mean the former king...

456
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,197
( chuckles )

457
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:40,300
he really was
a great man after all.

458
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,403
Granddaddy!

459
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:47,307
( crying ) Granddaddy!

460
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,713
Well, it sure is one hell
of a task he threw at us.

461
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:56,883
Don't worry, Sora,
you and I can do it.

462
00:21:56,883 --> 00:22:02,022
See, Jibril? Not all
humans are so bad.

463
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,157
What do you think?

464
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,859
You ready for this?

465
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,466
Jibril:
<i>Yes, ready indeed, Master.</i>

466
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,998
Sora and Shiro:
<i>Eastern Federation,</i>
<i>your head's gonna look</i>

467
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,935
<i>mighty nice on the end</i>
<i>of this pike.</i>
