1
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,078
And the first piece
makes its move.

2
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,446
What'll you do next?

3
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,081
Man: <i>Query‐</i>
<i>Do you, "A,"</i>

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,450
<i>desire the destruction</i>
<i>of Imanity?</i>

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,887
<i>Or "B," have you finally</i>
<i>decided to take action?</i>

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,190
Now, now, don't you dummies know
that eavesdropping on people

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,559
isn't very polite?

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,460
Man: <i>Query‐</i>
<i>an event fluctuation</i>

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,597
<i>was detected just before</i>
<i>the new king was crowned.</i>

10
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>We assume this heralds</i>
<i>your intent to join the battle.</i>

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,137
Oh, you fallen gods
are a serious buzzkill.

12
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,039
You guys still think
you're so hot.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,041
Well, listen,
Mr. High and Mighty,

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,677
Old Deus‐ First Order
of The Exceed‐

15
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,746
I'm not on anyone's side.

16
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,650
<i>So you can just keep playing</i>
<i>your same boring games,</i>

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,652
<i>but they're coming.</i>

18
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,388
<i>They're coming all the way</i>
<i>to your front door.</i>

19
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,059
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

20
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,296
Steph:
<i>After seeing the way</i>
<i>those two rallied the people</i>

21
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,598
<i>of Elkia to their cause,</i>

22
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,133
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>they were our saviors.</i>

23
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,434
<i>Well, not anymore.</i>

24
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,737
<i>They just delegate</i>
<i>all their kingly duties</i>

25
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,139
<i>to me and the ministers</i>
<i>and then spend the whole day</i>

26
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>sitting around playing games!</i>

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,680
Today's the day.

28
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,118
Today's the day
I end this once and for all!

29
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,320
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

30
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,381
Hyah! Hmm!

31
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,149
( both groaning )
Sora:
My eyes!

32
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,819
Okay, you slackers,
time to get out of bed

33
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,020
and do your job as king.

34
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,589
( sighs ) Damn it!

35
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,857
I made sure this room
was hidden from the vile rays

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,225
of the morning sun!

37
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,860
It's after noon,
you dope.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,896
36 o'clock is too early.

39
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,564
Is that watch even real?

40
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,934
<i>Ugh, you tossed my precious</i>
<i>books all over the place.</i>

41
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,870
Yeah, put them back in your
grandpa's room for me, okay?

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,038
( yawns )

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,208
Sora, as the new king,
that room is supposed
to be yours.

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,643
It's been that way
for many generations,

45
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,713
so you can't just decide
to move out of it on a whim.

46
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,817
Yeah, but the bed's lopsided.
It's hard to sleep in.

47
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,785
The floor is for champs.

48
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,321
Oh, no, you are not
going back to sleep!

49
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,256
I find it really embarrassing
to think that

50
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,858
you're the new king
who's been entrusted

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,893
with the lives
of over 3 million Imanity.

52
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,564
I'm embarrassing, am I?
Sorry to be a disappointment.

53
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,232
You're entitled
to your own opinion,

54
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,534
but hear this‐

55
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:57,237
Not in this world or any other
will Blank do any real work!

56
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,438
Don't underestimate‐

57
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,674
Both:
The will of Humanity!

58
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,142
If that's the will of humanity,

59
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,344
then we're better off
going extinct.

60
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,646
That's it.

61
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:09,049
My patience for your shenanigans
has finally run out.

62
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,017
Sora, I challenge you to a duel!

63
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,686
Oh...

64
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,055
so you want to play
a game with me, huh?

65
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,890
Sure about that?

66
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,492
Yes, that's right,
I would.

67
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,528
Okay, so pledge number five‐

68
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,130
It says here that since
we're the challenged party,

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,932
we get to set the rules
of the game.

70
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:26,933
Still in?

71
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,901
( hesitantly )
Yes.

72
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,637
B‐but as one of the greatest
minds in human history,

73
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,438
I'm sure you would never
choose a game

74
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,876
where you have an advantage
over little old me.

75
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,012
All right, fine, pick whatever
game you think you're good at.

76
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,647
And what are we playing for?

77
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:46,286
If I win, then you have
to become a decent person!

78
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,924
( groans )

79
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,059
Holy crap, if the
ten pledges are absolute

80
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,495
then they can even grant
crazy wishes like that.

81
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,298
In that case, Steph,
instead of making me respectable

82
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
just make me, like,
totally satisfied IRL.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,767
I‐R‐what?

84
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,504
Why do I need to be respectable
if I can be content?

85
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,638
Go ahead, challenge me.

86
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll do everything
I can to lose!

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,408
( shouts )

88
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,977
Sora, you're not allowed
to lose to anyone but me.

89
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,078
Wait, darling sister,

90
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,548
would you stand between
your brother and true happiness?

91
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,216
Blank can't lose a game,

92
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,919
no matter how painful
the cost may be.

93
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,888
( groans )

94
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,924
But it's impossible for me
to lose to Steph

95
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:24,925
in an honest game.

96
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,926
Whatever!

97
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,960
All right!
Whoa! Yes?

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,995
I'll bet on the tiny,
ridiculous, remote chance,

99
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,398
that somehow against the will
of the universe, you'll win.

100
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,700
( laughs )

101
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,802
Wow, you've really
gone and done it now.

102
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,438
In that case
the game I pick is...

103
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,642
Shiro:
<i>Blackjack?</i>

104
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,477
Okay, I'll be the dealer,
and you'll be the player.

105
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,179
Is that all right, Sora?

106
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:46,813
groans )

107
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,249
Well, at least try
to be interested!

108
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,050
( yawns )

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,552
At least try
to look awake!

110
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,888
Now look here, you, blackjack
is 100% a game of chance.

111
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,623
All your cheating
and dirty little tricks

112
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,258
won't help you this time,
understand?

113
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,459
Come on!
Say it with me.

114
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,827
Aschente!

115
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,295
Aschente.

116
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,964
Steph:
<i>You fell right into my trap.</i>

117
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,466
<i>A game of chance?</i>
<i>Or so I'd have you think.</i>

118
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,635
<i>'Cause that's not</i>
<i>how I'm going to play.</i>

119
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,870
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

120
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,672
<i>I've learned that</i>
<i>you can cheat</i>

121
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,473
<i>as long as your opponent</i>
<i>doesn't find out.</i>

122
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,341
<i>I've been practicing</i>
<i>this trick in secret</i>

123
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,944
<i>and I'm gonna use it to knock</i>
<i>your skinny butt down a peg!</i>

124
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,714
Dearest granddaughter,
the weak must use their wisdom

125
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,116
to kick all
the skinny butts they can.

126
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,486
Such is the hope
of all humanity.

127
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,389
Steph:
<i>Thank you, grandfather for</i>
<i>believing in our potential.</i>

128
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,324
<i>And thank you, Sora,</i>
<i>for teaching me</i>

129
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,959
<i>how to beat you with it!</i>

130
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,127
Hit me...

131
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,764
Stand.

132
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,036
Well, I've got 21.

133
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,505
19 here.

134
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,710
<i>( giggles )</i>
<i>I'm just getting started.</i>

135
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,483
( sighs )

136
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,385
Well, it's time
for the final round.

137
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,887
Best of luck!

138
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,524
I think we know who's
going to be winning, though.

139
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,058
Blackjack is one
of the rare games

140
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,794
where the player has an
advantage over the dealer.

141
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,462
What's that supposed to mean?

142
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,364
Sora:
<i>The dealer has</i>
<i>to draw another card</i>

143
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,066
<i>whenever he's below 17,</i>

144
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,969
<i>so he has a high chance</i>
<i>of going to bust.</i>

145
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,705
But you haven't had
that happen even once.

146
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,574
That's some pretty
impressive luck.

147
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:24,545
I'll stand this turn.

148
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,012
Steph:
<i>Has he just given up?</i>

149
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,848
<i>He didn't even look</i>
<i>at the cards.</i>

150
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,984
Well, looks like
the game is over.

151
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,519
Yep, sure is.

152
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,089
( gasps )

153
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,490
In a natural blackjack,

154
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,160
you get back 2.5 times
what you bet.

155
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,495
That means I win.
Yay.

156
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,398
But I had humanity
on my side.

157
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,200
Grandfather:
<i>Stephanie, my dear girl‐</i>

158
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,769
Grandfather!

159
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,437
Don't you know
if your opponent is a human,
you're just screwed,

160
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,639
( echoes ) just screwed...

161
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,107
Hold on! What?!

162
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,043
Oh, what a hollow victory.
I didn't think of that!

163
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,980
Truly content people are just
an urban legend anyway.

164
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,115
I refuse to accept this!
How did I lose?

165
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,283
You must have been cheating.

166
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,751
And what's that
supposed to mean?

167
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,953
I thought you said that
blackjack was a game

168
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,021
of pure chance?

169
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,590
( grunts )

170
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,558
I used card counting.

171
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:12,759
Card counting?

172
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,427
I don't think I know
what that is.

173
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,229
Sora: <i>You think</i>
<i>of the cards as numbers</i>

174
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,430
<i>and count them</i>
<i>in your head.</i>

175
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,165
<i>Cards between</i>
<i>two and six are +1,</i>

176
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,701
<i>ten and above are ‐1,</i>

177
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,435
<i>and seven through nine</i>
<i>are 0.</i>

178
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,504
<i>Easy peasy.</i>

179
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,305
<i>So you just count</i>
<i>the number of cards</i>

180
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,373
<i>that have been played so far</i>
<i>to mathematically find</i>

181
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,744
<i>the numerical probability</i>
<i>for what will be played next.</i>

182
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,814
So you used math in a game?

183
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:38,151
I didn't know that
was even humanly possible.

184
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,621
Wait just one second!
Isn't that cheating?

185
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,222
No, cheating refers to
techniques

186
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,558
like the forced shuffle
you were doing.

187
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,927
You knew from the start?

188
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,995
Yep, and it made counting
that much easier.

189
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,265
Oh, impossible, he not only
saw through my tricks,

190
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,100
he used them to defeat me?!

191
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,301
Ow!

192
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,437
Hey, there,
where you off to?

193
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,505
Oh, just back to work.

194
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,074
Remember all of those radical
policies you proposed yesterday?

195
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,809
I kind of have to meet
with the nobles

196
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,878
who oppose them now,
and they're angry.

197
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,781
Huh? That took longer
than I thought.

198
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,216
<i>I guess I'll go act like</i>
<i>a king for once, then.</i>

199
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,451
Huh?

200
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,819
( scoffs )

201
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,990
This is outrageous!
You'll pay for this!

202
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,492
Don't think you can humiliate
the nobles and get away with it.

203
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,394
That's former nobles
from now on.

204
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:21,962
Preposterous.

205
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,397
<i>Your titles, your land,</i>
<i>money, holdings,</i>

206
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,099
<i>all property</i>
<i>of the state now.</i>

207
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,969
Well, given how quickly
I changed things up,

208
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,271
people were bound to throw
a hissy fit sooner or later.

209
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,575
Frankly, I'm surprised
that it took as long as it did.

210
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,976
I know you
didn't like them,

211
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,011
but you didn't have
to be so mean about it.

212
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,747
I'd worked so hard to keep them
under control peacefully.

213
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,816
Huh? Kept them
under control?

214
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,951
I used data from the
experiments we'd conducted

215
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,219
on the royal family's lands.

216
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,954
Then I distributed
the commercial rights

217
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,290
to all the noble factions
that backed my family.

218
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,626
<i>Utilizing the success</i>
<i>we gained from doing that,</i>

219
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,427
<i>we were able to keep</i>
<i>the other major</i>

220
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,361
<i>political factions in check.</i>

221
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,931
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>we could quietly break down</i>

222
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,633
<i>the smaller groups,</i>
<i>thus whittling away</i>

223
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,901
<i>our opponents' power base.</i>

224
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,169
If you hadn't just
humiliated those guys,

225
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,706
we'd likely could have
had a bloodless victory

226
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,574
over the entire opposition!

227
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,275
Uh, what's wrong
with you two?

228
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,044
I didn't think
this was even possible,

229
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,714
but, Steph, you are actually
not a humongous idiot.

230
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:16,049
You mean you thought
I was stupid this whole time?

231
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,152
But that can't be right.
You are a Steph, aren't you?

232
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,153
Is it my imagination,

233
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,589
or did you just use my name
as a derogatory term?

234
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,424
Shut up, Steph,
you're just a Steph.

235
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,892
My God!
You two are terrible!

236
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,895
That is possibly the most
unfair insult in history!

237
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,697
In fact, I graduated
top of my class

238
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,432
at the most prestigious
academy in the country,

239
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,701
<i>and I have connections</i>
<i>with every major family</i>

240
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,203
through my former classmates.

241
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,941
She graduated
from high school already
and has lots of friends.

242
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:44,845
You know, she's like an entitled
rich little princess literally.

243
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,147
Shiro:
<i>And she has big boobies, too.</i>

244
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,782
Sora? Shiro?

245
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,818
We didn't decide did we,
what we were gonna make you do

246
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,054
for losing that game
of blackjack?

247
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,422
You're really gonna
get it now, Steph.

248
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,324
<i>No mercy.</i>

249
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,095
Wait! No!!

250
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,475
Th‐there are
t‐too many people here.

251
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,043
( gasps )
Ahh!

252
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,379
Sh‐Shiro, don't let go
of my hand no matter what!

253
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,947
You... you made me, Sora.

254
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,383
It was your idea
to come to town, Sora.

255
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,184
What's going on?

256
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,153
We got something
we need to do. Uh...

257
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,458
Wait, why is everyone
looking at us funny?

258
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,728
That's because...

259
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,129
you made me wear this crap!

260
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,398
Of course
they're going to stare!

261
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,555
Woof.

262
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,267
Couldn't you have come up
with a more dignified
demand than this?

263
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,903
Okay, Steph, now shake.

264
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,938
Oh, my God,
I can't disobey.

265
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,707
That's the rule, Steph.

266
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,542
In accordance
with the law of the pledges,

267
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,744
you are officially
our dog for the day.

268
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:51,745
( groans )

269
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,981
Now your outfit is weird...

270
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,218
<i>but they seem more scared</i>
<i>than anything else.</i>

271
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,185
I'll tell you why.

272
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,854
It's because the king
of Elkia is walking around

273
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,657
with someone dressed
as a Warbeast on a leash.

274
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,225
( gasps ) Wait!

275
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,662
<i>You say you're dressed</i>
<i>like a Warbeast?</i>

276
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,330
"Exceed rank number 14.

277
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,932
Their territory,
the Eastern Federation,

278
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,534
is one of the largest.

279
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,169
They possess superior senses
and physical abilities,

280
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,904
as well as a sixth sense
that allows them

281
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,840
to read people's minds!"

282
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,441
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>the Eastern Federation</i>

283
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:25,846
is an Eden composed entirely
of hot girls with animal ears!

284
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,914
No, there are men
and old people, too.

285
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,017
Okay! Time to conquer
the beasts of Paradise!

286
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,653
We're going after
the animal girls!

287
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:33,920
Ready, let's go!

288
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,889
Wait! They're one of the three
biggest countries

289
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,123
in the world!

290
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,065
Silence!

291
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:39,760
You and your false ears
shall not stand between me

292
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,495
and the joy of authentic
animal‐eared goddesses!

293
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,497
The Eden I've only dreamt of

294
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,333
awaits its true master!

295
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,016
Hmm?

296
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,637
Sora, before
you do that...

297
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,938
Oh, that's right.

298
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,473
Onward we go.

299
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,307
Lead the way.

300
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,389
Right.

301
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,241
Wait a sec.

302
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:56,728
( chokes )

303
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,311
I'm tied up?

304
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,981
Son of a bitch.

305
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,384
( sighs )

306
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,087
I can't believe we didn't find
a single thing anywhere.

307
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,855
This kingdom is weird.

308
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,256
I know, right?

309
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,561
This looks good,
but it tastes like dookie.

310
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,297
I think there's a shortage
of things like sugar,

311
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,364
salt, and butter.

312
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,200
Is that why Steph's
cookies were so good,

313
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,803
because they have better
ingredients at the castle?

314
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:23,604
Mm.

315
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,840
I finally found you!

316
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,575
Oh, hey, Steph.
Where you been?

317
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,644
What do you mean?
Uh, huh?

318
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,279
You left me tied to a lamppost
in the middle of town.

319
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,381
You're saying you just
conveniently forgot?

320
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,650
Sorry about that, Steph.

321
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,317
Now sit.

322
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,051
( pants )

323
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,921
You asked for forgiveness
and then you make me sit.

324
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,089
This is so wrong!

325
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,457
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

326
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,527
<i>I've got to do something</i>
<i>about these two.</i>

327
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,228
<i>But if I'm going to stand</i>
<i>any chance</i>

328
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,329
<i>of beating them in a game,</i>

329
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,565
<i>it has to be a game</i>
<i>based on pure luck,</i>

330
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,267
<i>one where they can't calculate</i>
<i>their way into winning.</i>

331
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,536
<i>I've got it.</i>

332
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,370
<i>I demand one more match!</i>

333
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,530
Now stand.

334
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,473
Hmm, okay, what do you want
from me now, Steph?

335
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,442
The same thing
you wanted this morning

336
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:05,245
that I didn't understand‐
The IRL.

337
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,581
Oh, Steph,
I knew you would‐ ( groans )

338
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:10,450
I will be happy to except
on behalf of Blank.

339
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,720
If you lose, you have
to do one thing I tell you to.

340
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,557
Sis, please,
my manhood needs this.

341
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:17,423
That's fine with me.

342
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,460
We'll compete to see
whether the next person

343
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,897
<i>to go down that alley</i>
<i>is a man or a woman!</i>

344
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,566
Best out of ten wins.

345
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,201
Aschente!
Aschente!

346
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,937
This doesn't
make sense!

347
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,673
Did you really think
it'd be random?

348
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:36,209
People usually have reasons
for going into town, you know.

349
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,210
Huh?

350
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,846
What Shiro did is assessed
the male‐to‐female ratio

351
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,015
by applying data
on time‐based variables‐

352
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,117
occupations, and employment
rate for this area

353
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,520
to the general trends that
we've observed in the past.

354
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:46,987
I rule.

355
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,422
Do you always take
this stuff so seriously?

356
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:52,626
But, of course, because
when it comes to games‐

357
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,427
Both:
We're always serious.

358
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,831
It's time to pay up, Steph.

359
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,834
<i>I think I'll take</i>
<i>your underwear.</i>

360
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:03,504
( sobs )

361
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:04,270
That's it isn't it?

362
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,508
I really am ruined
forever now, aren't I?

363
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,710
Hey, Shiro,
this is actually starting

364
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,477
to get really
depressing and sad.

365
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,179
I'm just 11 years old.

366
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,081
I'm a kid,
so I don't understand.

367
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,983
You seem like
you're in a bad mood.

368
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,219
might want to go easy
on Steph from now on.

369
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,187
Whatever.

370
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,389
I'll have you know,
I'm just getting started.

371
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,259
As far as my skills go,
you haven't seen anything yet.

372
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,995
On the contrary, I think
we've both seen plenty.

373
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,831
( gasps )
You'll regret that one!

374
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:32,432
Aschente!

375
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,116
( whimpers )

376
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,420
( wails )

377
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,989
( shudders )

378
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,860
( groans )

379
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,494
( laughs )

380
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:05,331
One‐ one more,
I want to play one more game!

381
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,967
You don't have much
left to lose.

382
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,068
( giggles )

383
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,871
A temporary defeat
is, uh, trivial

384
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,606
so long as it leads
to ultimate victory!

385
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,908
Hey, you know,
I'm starting to understand

386
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,210
why Elkia ended
up in such a bad state.

387
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,480
This time it'll be pure,
100% chance!

388
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,083
<i>How many seconds until</i>
<i>those birds fly away?</i>

389
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,851
( sighs )

390
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,687
Fine, I'll let you
bet first.

391
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,523
Aschente.
What's your bet?

392
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,457
Huh? A‐aschente.

393
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,795
Uh, let's see,
I bet 30 seconds.

394
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:38,765
Then I'll take...
three seconds!

395
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,601
Hey, that's against
the rules!

396
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:44,170
I don't believe you stated
any rules, right?

397
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,674
Steph, just give
it up, already.

398
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,575
Why?

399
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,475
Huh?

400
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,112
What did I ever do
to deserve this?

401
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,348
All I want
is to help people

402
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,017
for the sake of Elkia.

403
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,886
Why can't luck be on
my side even once?

404
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:00,954
Steph...

405
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,388
( sighs )

406
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,995
'Cause nothing's decided
by chance alone.

407
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,096
Huh?

408
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,633
Rules, statistics,
emotional states,

409
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,168
<i>any number of invisible</i>
<i>factors can can combine</i>

410
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,404
<i>to produce an unpredictable</i>
<i>but inevitable result.</i>

411
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,675
<i>So the victor's decided</i>
<i>before the game even begins.</i>

412
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,376
Luck isn't a thing.

413
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,845
For example,
what's the probability

414
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,381
<i>of drawing the ace of spades</i>
<i>from a deck with no jokers?</i>

415
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,551
Steph:
<i>It's one in 52, isn't it?</i>

416
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,588
Sora:
<i>Normally, yes. But what</i>
<i>if it's a brand‐new deck?</i>

417
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,422
<i>The position of the cards</i>
<i>in a new deck</i>

418
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,691
<i>are typically identical.</i>

419
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,425
<i>So that means</i>
<i>If you take out the jokers</i>

420
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,362
<i>and draw the card</i>
<i>at the very bottom...</i>

421
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:45,799
it's the ace of spades
almost 100% of the time.

422
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,967
Uh, hold on!

423
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,869
Oh, that's right,
I didn't say a word

424
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,004
about it being
a new deck, did I?

425
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,574
Rather... you didn't ask.

426
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,475
<i>You see, being in the know</i>
<i>gives you the power</i>

427
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,210
<i>to turn the probability</i>
<i>of winning</i>

428
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,413
<i>from 1.92% to 100%.</i>

429
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,316
<i>The more knowledgeable party</i>
<i>will be the inevitable victor.</i>

430
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:06,687
<i>This is why the Imanity</i>
<i>keep losing over and over</i>

431
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,823
and why we're at a loss
for what to do next.

432
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,457
Uh, explain.

433
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,594
We don't have
enough information.

434
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,562
Before we can invade
the animal‐girl kingdom

435
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,231
we have to know something
about them, anything,

436
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,833
<i>though preferably</i>
<i>their weakness.</i>

437
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,267
<i>We've heard that they have</i>
<i>a sharp sixth sense</i>

438
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,336
<i>but that's not too much</i>
<i>to go off of.</i>

439
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,571
Shiro:
<i>They can read minds.</i>

440
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,073
Sora:
<i>If that's true,</i>
<i>then nothing we come up with</i>

441
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,308
<i>is gonna work against them.</i>

442
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:30,076
<i>It won't even</i>
<i>be a real game.</i>

443
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,044
I've read every
book and paper

444
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,478
in the palace
and found nothing.

445
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,381
And there's not a
single bookstore or
library in this town.

446
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,150
Do these people even care?

447
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,385
Do they want to lose
forever?

448
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,622
<i>Has he been looking</i>
<i>for information</i>

449
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:44,891
<i>about this world ever since</i>
<i>he was coronated?</i>

450
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:45,526
You know what they say,

451
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:49,429
only an idiot starts
a fight he can't win.

452
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,832
True, but we have
to do something

453
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:53,700
or we'll never get anywhere!

454
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,235
<i>Even if it means</i>
<i>sacrificing ourselves,</i>

455
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,370
<i>we have to keep</i>
<i>fighting for Elkia</i>

456
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,740
before it's too late.

457
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,610
One more screw‐up,
and this kingdom is finished.

458
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,512
I know you're proud
of this country,

459
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,781
but it's still on
the verge of destruction.

460
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,283
Don't forget that.

461
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,185
Steph: <i>All that time,</i>

462
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,154
<i>they weren't fooling</i>
<i>around after all.</i>

463
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,689
<i>Rather, they were</i>
<i>shouldering the fate</i>

464
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,692
<i>of 3 million</i>
<i>Imanity and I...</i>

465
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:23,296
I didn't‐ I didn't
even realize it.

466
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,365
Sora: <i>You know,</i>
<i>all things considered,</i>

467
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,432
<i>you really did a good job</i>

468
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,169
<i>of keeping things in check.</i>
<i>so far, Steph.</i>

469
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,339
I was wondering why there
was so little resistance

470
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,441
to all those radical
reforms of ours.

471
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,711
You really had those
noblemen in line.

472
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,980
Shiro:
<i>Good job being</i>
<i>smart, Steph.</i>

473
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,115
Sora:
<i>What you said</i>
<i>seriously helped us out.</i>

474
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,217
So thanks for that.

475
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,388
Sora... Shiro?

476
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,590
Please, don't cry.

477
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,758
Let's all keep working
hard together, right?

478
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:52,726
Okay, Steph?

479
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,395
That's all I want.
That's all I want!

480
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,963
( howls and yelps )

481
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,866
That's nice,
but we're still
backed in a corner here,

482
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:04,137
and we don't have the key
to the one exit I can find.

483
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,407
What the?
It's dark already?

484
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,412
Shiro:
<i>Wow!</i>

485
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,516
Sora:
<i>Awesome.</i>

486
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,718
Both:
<i>Laputa really exists.</i>

487
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,453
Oh, that's the kingdom
of Avant Heim.

488
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,355
It's one of our
world's Phantasmas.

489
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,924
You mean, the
second‐ranked Exceed?

490
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:27,360
<i>How the hell am I supposed</i>
<i>to play a game with that?</i>

491
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,129
Sora, do you think‐

492
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:29,763
Yeah.

493
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,765
The best thing would be
for us to get one

494
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,935
of those Flugel up there
and bring them over to our side.

495
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,237
But how are we gonna get to 'em?

496
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,573
Both:
Ba *se

497
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,442
It's not falling.

498
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,378
I guess it's gonna take
more than magic words.

499
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,713
If you're looking
for a Flugel,

500
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,515
there's one that lives
near here.

501
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:49,270
Huh?

502
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,417
About five years ago,
it showed up at the doors

503
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,587
of the Elkia national library.

504
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,488
It defeated my grandfather
in a game

505
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,058
and won the library
and everything in it.

506
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:58,659
Funny, huh?

507
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,227
Oh, you had
a library, huh?

508
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:04,531
You bet your knowledge away?!
Are your heads full of shit?!

509
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,599
That's humanity's only weapon!

510
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,167
Steph, sit.
Down, girl.

511
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,702
( whimpers )

512
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,098
Stay.

513
00:21:10,098 --> 00:21:13,439
No, please, wait!
People are staring at me!

514
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,811
Sora:
<i>Exceed rank six,</i>
<i>the Flugel,</i>

515
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,646
<i>They were the soldiers</i>
<i>on the front lines,</i>

516
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,983
<i>created during the ancient</i>
<i>war to kill the gods.</i>

517
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,487
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>there was one so close.</i>

518
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,989
Wait, Sora,
are you two sure

519
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,758
you really want to challenge
a monster like that?

520
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,760
Sora: <i>The only way we're</i>
<i>going to stand a chance</i>

521
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,862
<i>of saving this place</i>
<i>is if we can get a hold</i>

522
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,964
<i>of the knowledge</i>
<i>this god‐killer has.</i>

523
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,766
Shiro:
<i>You don't have to come</i>
<i>if you don't want to.</i>

524
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,635
Steph:
<i>Of course</i>
<i>I want to come.</i>

525
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,236
Steph, from what I hear

526
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:47,073
the Flugel supposedly only
played one game, and that's it.

527
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,542
Is that really
the case?

528
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,844
Yes, according
to the records.

529
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,079
Perfect.

530
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,481
Well, looks like
this is it.

531
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,318
Time to start
conquering the world.

532
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,744
All:
Whoa...

533
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,547
Shiro:
<i>Neato.</i>

534
00:23:05,586 --> 00:23:10,390
Now then, where's this cute
little angel of ours?

535
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:17,998
( whimpers )

536
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,109
( chuckles )

537
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,212
That's not the kind of angel
I was expecting.

538
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,515
<i>That's an angel of death.</i>

539
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,787
<i>Excusez‐moi,</i>
you wee little <i>personas.</i>

540
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:43,857
I'm afraid mi library
is no sus library.

541
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,291
( all groan )

542
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,093
Both:
Whoa...

543
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,562
<i>That ruined it.</i>

544
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,263
( giggles )

545
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,798
Flugel:
<i>Woe is to Steph.</i>

546
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:54,500
<i>Death should not</i>
<i>have taken thee so young.</i>
