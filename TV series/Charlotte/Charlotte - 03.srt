1
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,756
Sorry, but I overslept this morning and ran out of time.

2
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:09,436
So it's omelet rice again.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,984
Y‐You know, I don't need to bring lunch anymore.

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,138
Oh? Really? Why is that?

5
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,831
Well, most of the guys don't bring their own lunches.

6
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:19,630
They all go to the cafeteria.

7
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,844
I'm going to be eating with them from now on.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,595
Too bad. I like to make your lunch.

9
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:29,389
But, since I made it today, I
want you to take it with you!

10
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,553
Uh, sure.

11
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:41,851
There’s no way I'd be able to eat omelet rice
with a message written on it in a classroom.

12
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:18,966
Oh, good morning.

13
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,379
Yeah, good morning.

14
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,617
You seem fairly spiritless today.

15
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:26,149
No, this is about how low my spirit is all the time.

16
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:27,375
Especially mornings.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,314
Tell you what: at lunch today,

18
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:33,816
I'm gonna buy you the limited edition beef tongue
curry, guaranteed to lift your spirits right up.

19
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,429
Will you make it there in time to get a limited edition?

20
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:39,155
With my ability for speed, it'll be a piece of cake.

21
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,583
Ah, that's right.

22
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,698
Hello, I've been waiting for you. Here you go.

23
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:05,788
Right now, I think it would be better
if we got you straight to the hospital.

24
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,836
Oh, I'm used to this. It happens all the time.

25
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,696
I'm sorry to make you worry about me.

26
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,113
His ability is way too half‐assed.

27
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,539
Ahhh! A flood of spices.
This is how curry should be!

28
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,682
Delicious!

29
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:26,066
I'm glad it exceeds your expectations.

30
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:29,489
Curry is something that should be spicy, after all.

31
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:33,636
It's medium spicy, but is that
the right level of spice for you?

32
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:36,094
The beef tongue melts in your mouth. It's the best!

33
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,742
You must really love curry.

34
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,290
I'd actually forgotten how much.

35
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,976
OK. I understand.

36
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,047
Our comrade is coming again.

37
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:49,952
We should head to the student council room.

38
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,753
Why does that guy always show up soaking wet?

39
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:06,225
He can't use his special ability unless he
gets soaking wet while fully clothed first.

40
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,325
What a cumbersome, half‐assed ability.

41
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,851
The ability is channeling.

42
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:19,185
What is "channeling"?

43
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:20,780
Spiritualism.

44
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:23,839
Allowing dead individuals to possess them like shamans.

45
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,759
Someone who can really use that as a
special ability and not just a fraud?

46
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:29,370
That’s pretty amazing.

47
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:33,497
One more: pyrokinesis.

48
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,990
I can't believe this person has two abilities.

49
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,516
I'd like to get moving and grab
this one as quickly as possible.

50
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,072
Wait, this is an ordinary road.

51
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,215
And is that supposed to mean something?

52
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,794
It means they're on the move.

53
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,469
In the middle of a weekday?

54
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,283
Are they ditching school or something?

55
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,015
But this road is troubling.

56
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,618
It'd be much better if it wasn't a
narrow alley that's not very popular.

57
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,457
So, what’s the big deal?

58
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,920
Oh, well, we should head out there anyway.

59
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:08,690
Huh? This is the place?

60
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:09,492
Yes.

61
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:18,990
What's the matter?

62
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,522
It looks like that person must have been
pretty desperate when they passed through here.

63
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:24,446
How's that?

64
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,776
This side of the box has no dust on it.

65
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,673
In other words, whoever it was ran
through here and bumped into this box.

66
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,212
What you're saying is that you
think this person was being chased.

67
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,091
Sounds like there was an incident.

68
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,172
Another troublesome...

69
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:39,029
For now we'll keep moving forward.

70
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:43,878
Two new sets of footprints.

71
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:47,314
One of them has a short stride and
the other one is quite a bit longer.

72
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:50,812
This totally indicates a girl being chased by an adult.

73
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:51,970
We have to hurry.

74
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:05,686
Oh, that thing earlier?

75
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,378
What was it?

76
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:10,114
They were filming something where
an idol was being chased by a big guy.

77
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,059
An idol?

78
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,488
Let's see...

79
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,781
Right, it was Yusa Nishimori.

80
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:16,385
I've heard that name before.

81
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,393
Me too.

82
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:19,755
Yusarin?!

83
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,479
Oh, yeah. It's the idol that Ayumi likes.

84
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:24,017
So you know her?

85
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:28,323
She's the unbelievable lead vocalist for the band
How‐Low‐Hello and an upcoming gorgeous super idol

86
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:31,038
that sings and dances like no
one I've ever seen in my life!

87
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,876
I can't tell you what a big turnoff that is. Stop!

88
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,085
Her career started in the sixth
grade when she won the grand prize

89
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,194
in the 14th reader‐model audition
for the magazine Petit Banana

90
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,255
and debuted as their exclusive model!

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,665
Then she landed a job as a regular
member of the "Movement Morning!" show

92
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,213
but quit two years later to focus on school.

93
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,914
She restarted her career in show biz after...

94
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,795
Hold it. Let's get back to the point.

95
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:57,830
So that girl caused some issue with her
special ability and became a fugitive, am I wrong?

96
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:00,620
You really don't have to say that for us to know it.

97
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,478
Her agency is Sea Rex Productions.

98
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,328
Wouldn't it be quicker if we just called them?

99
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:08,558
We're talking show biz here.
They're not gonna tell us anything.

100
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,802
Then what should we do?

101
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:12,762
Let's see.

102
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,047
A suspicious target. I'll chase him!

103
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:23,388
Tomori!

104
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:25,331
Otosaka, use your ability!

105
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,631
I'm the one who actually feels the pain,

106
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:42,560
so I'd rather you not use this tactic from now on.

107
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:44,504
This is why we get compensation.

108
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:45,260
What?

109
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:48,568
That hurt.

110
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:51,349
Damn it, what would you have done if the camcorder broke?

111
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:52,595
That's your issue?

112
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,754
Wake up, bastard.

113
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,796
Who the hell are you?

114
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,153
No, who the hell are you?

115
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,050
Tell us what we wanna know and
we'll call an ambulance for you.

116
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:06,809
You realize you're headed straight to death right now?

117
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,626
I was just offered a job, all right?

118
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,674
What kind?

119
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,936
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

120
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:16,710
Is it something you're willing
to lose your life to protect?

121
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,782
I'm looking for Yusa Nishimori.

122
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:24,550
And who asked you to do that?

123
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,538
Taiyo TV.

124
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,296
Right. What was their name?

125
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,430
I don't know the person's name.

126
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,128
And that's the truth.

127
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,231
Great, understood.

128
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:38,081
I'd already called for an
ambulance before you talked.

129
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:47,809
Hey. What the hell are you guys?

130
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:52,842
Just some people looking for a woman named Yusa Nishimori.

131
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,622
Her nickname is Yusarin!

132
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,937
Why are you looking?

133
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,884
I don't exactly know the reason why,

134
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,120
but it's a fact that she's being
chased, so we thought we'd help her out.

135
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,699
You guys know Yusa?

136
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,781
I'm a huge fan!

137
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:05,651
Would you stop interrupting?

138
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:09,230
I was watching you. How the hell did you defeat that guy?

139
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,517
We did it using special abilities.

140
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:14,620
Probably a lot like the ability Nishimori has.

141
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:17,303
How do you know about that?

142
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:20,884
If you just trust us, I believe
we can help save her from harm.

143
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,215
I see.

144
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,644
I'm gonna need to see some proof.

145
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,557
Show me that you have the same power that she does.

146
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:31,201
It's not exactly the same power, but...

147
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,074
What the...?

148
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,177
Here.

149
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,898
Now do you believe what I'm saying?

150
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:40,469
Yeah. Come on, I'll take you to her.

151
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,167
Though it's a bit confusing.

152
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,644
What do you mean by that?

153
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:47,005
Things got slightly complicated.

154
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:49,345
I want you guys to see for yourselves.

155
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,234
So this is a nightclub.

156
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,700
You really don't have to film all this, do ya?

157
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:05,010
This way. And don’t lag behind.

158
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:06,603
Hey, I'm back.

159
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:09,072
So how is everything outside today?

160
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,678
Ohh! It actually is the real Yusarin!

161
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,040
I have all the How‐Low‐Hello CDs.

162
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,127
Big turnoff!

163
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,515
Thanks so much, that's wonderful.

164
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,102
It really is the girl I saw on TV.

165
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,213
Hey, what is with those guys?

166
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,789
They're just like Misa and have
special abilities that they can use.

167
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:32,615
Wait a minute, I thought her name
was Yusa, but it's actually Misa?

168
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,955
That's the part that makes this complicated.

169
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,594
What are you doing? You sure we can trust them?

170
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:40,862
I watched them use their powers to
defeat those other guys, all right?

171
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:44,031
Is it OK if we ask her directly what's going on here?

172
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,709
If you ask something stupid, you're
not getting out of here in one piece.

173
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,336
Why you gotta be so scary?

174
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,839
Tomori, be really careful here.

175
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:52,947
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,805
It's very nice to meet you. I'm Tomori.

177
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:59,877
I'm Yusa Nishimori, nicknamed
Yusarin. It's very nice to meet you.

178
00:10:59,902 --> 00:11:02,025
So she calls herself Yusarin?

179
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:05,033
This is the first time in my life I've met a real idol.

180
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:08,619
You're so unbelievably cute, you almost look like a doll.

181
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,702
I want to get as close to you as she is.

182
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:11,416
Hey, back off!

183
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:15,146
Now, now. So first off, could
you please tell me your actual name?

184
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,761
It's Yusa Kurobane.

185
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,694
Yeah? Well, I wasn't asking you!

186
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,265
Your real name sounds more like a stage name.

187
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,979
Yes. I hear that a lot.

188
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:27,225
But Kurobane means "black feathers,"
and it's not really suitable for an idol,

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,282
so they renamed me Nishimori.

190
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:30,339
That makes sense.

191
00:11:30,364 --> 00:11:33,831
Now, there are some occasions
when you are not Yusa Kurobane.

192
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,807
Are you aware of that fact?

193
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:38,117
No, she's not, so how do you know about it?

194
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:39,746
I wasn't asking you, bastard.

195
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:40,506
What was that?

196
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:42,557
So, was I right about that, Kurobane?

197
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,893
That's exactly it. I guess you can call it sleepwalking.

198
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:48,195
I've been falling asleep without realizing it,

199
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,208
and then when I wake up, I'm somewhere
else, with no idea how I got there.

200
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:57,214
The doctors who examined me said there's a
chance that I have a multiple personality disorder.

201
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,421
Oh, they did, huh?

202
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,788
Well, it's not schizophrenia, so
you don't have to worry about that.

203
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:12,331
She has her own special ability just like the three of us.

204
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,720
Her power is to allow a dead person to possess her body.

205
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,157
Seriously?

206
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:22,379
I believe that the ability is calling forth this
Misa girl that you guys were talking about earlier.

207
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,331
Misa?

208
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:24,514
Is something the matter?

209
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:25,515
Don't ask anything.

210
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,404
Is it someone she knew?

211
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,706
Yeah, she was Yusa's older sister.

212
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,678
She died six months ago in an accident.

213
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,226
You bastard.

214
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:40,527
Don't go blabbing on about things
to some stranger you just met!

215
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,253
Can I assume that you're Misa?

216
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,776
It's so annoying how cramped it is with all of you here!

217
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,832
She’s totally changed.

218
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,681
Whoa, that's really impressive.

219
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:01,978
Calm down, Misa! You're gonna burn us all to death!

220
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,939
I suppose that wouldn't be good.

221
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,410
I'm very surprised.

222
00:13:12,664 --> 00:13:16,957
It seems she can't call forth the spirit
on her own and that Misa is in control.

223
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:18,719
So you got a problem with that?

224
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:21,243
Another ability that's somehow half‐assed.

225
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:24,780
That means she has an unparalleled
ability to be possessed.

226
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:28,902
And Misa, who possesses Yusa, has pyrokinetic ability.

227
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:30,164
Yeah.

228
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,815
So, what is your relationship with these two?

229
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:36,863
They're my friends from back when I
was alive and still causing trouble.

230
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:40,170
Do you have any idea why your
little sister is being chased?

231
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,868
Yeah. 'Cause of this.

232
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,081
Yusa accidentally brought this home from some shoot.

233
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:49,296
It belongs to one of the bigger‐name
producers at the TV station.

234
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:52,360
And she accidentally read a text that was sent to it.

235
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:55,700
Stealing company money, organized crime connections.

236
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:59,069
Stuff that would get the guy
arrested if it was taken to the cops.

237
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:01,017
Did you guys think to turn the power off?

238
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,954
Yeah. But it was on until yesterday.

239
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:08,825
Then they probably already know that you're
hiding somewhere in this area from the GPS.

240
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,023
Even if you gave the phone back now, you wouldn't be safe.

241
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:14,363
And, if you gave it to the police,

242
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:19,545
it would look like Kurobane sold out the producer
and could keep her from working in show biz.

243
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:22,296
OK, I'll burn it down, station and all.

244
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,780
Are you stupid? You do that, and your
little sister will end up in prison!

245
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,161
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?

246
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:31,965
Do you really want to do something that
will land her a stint in juvenile hall?

247
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,351
That would make absolutely no sense.

248
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:38,501
Now please calm down. You want to save your sister, right?

249
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:40,662
Yes, of course.

250
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:44,745
Then we should help each other turn the
tables on this guy and threaten him instead.

251
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,610
Can we win?

252
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,904
I'm really good at creating wonderfully devious
plans for threatening others, so you can trust me.

253
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,698
You've got spunk.

254
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:57,916
All right then, I'll do whatever you say.

255
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,051
I'd like the both of you to help as well.

256
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:02,750
Of course we will, if Misa says so.

257
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,757
Oh my, I didn't fall asleep again just now, did I?

258
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,567
You must be really tired, that's all, it's all right.

259
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:13,051
Why don't you have some roasted marshmallows and relax?

260
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:16,511
Oh! The marshmallows turned into freshly roasted ones.

261
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,285
This is unbearable.

262
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,301
I have no clue how I should approach Yusarin from now on.

263
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:26,372
Every picture I had in my head about her has been blown.

264
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:27,793
You're a scary guy.

265
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:30,563
First we should head to a shop that sells work clothes.

266
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:31,583
What for?

267
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,041
You two are going to need a set of fireproof clothing.

268
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:45,177
It's me.

269
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,337
So you finally showed up.

270
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:01,802
Realize that you couldn't escape?

271
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:05,720
I really don't know the reason
why I'm being chased so much.

272
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,641
Did I do something wrong?

273
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:09,538
Give me back my phone!

274
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,101
Is this the one?

275
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:12,004
Yeah.

276
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,730
Even if I return it to you
now, am I, like, still in trouble?

277
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:19,802
Whatever happens, there's no future
for you in this industry anymore.

278
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:21,985
There's no more future for me?

279
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:26,323
Bastard! The one who has no future is you!

280
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:33,221
I think I'll take out one more!

281
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,824
What the... What the hell's going on?

282
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,852
You probably thought that you had me cornered tonight,

283
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:47,010
but you didn't realize that it was
me that had you cornered all along.

284
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,804
You really are senseless, you know?

285
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,642
What the hell are you?

286
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,785
I mean, are you really Yusa Nishimori?

287
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,911
Of course, I'm Yusa Nishimori, the real Yusarin, who else?

288
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:03,958
And in order to ensure my success, I'm willing
to kill anyone who gets in my way, like them!

289
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,903
Uh huh, that hurts!

290
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:10,829
This is getting boring. I'll get rid of them all at once.

291
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,241
W‐Wait, wait, wait. Just a minute. Hold on, please.

292
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:17,526
Like I'm gonna wait!

293
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,827
What the hell is going on here?

294
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:32,176
I can bury you in the shadows
at any point I want, understand?

295
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:35,280
I get it, I give up. Please, don't hurt me.

296
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,805
I'll give this back to you.

297
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:39,710
But there is no next time.

298
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,161
I'll eradicate you in a heartbeat.

299
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,164
Thank you very much for all your help.

300
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,394
No, you helped us.

301
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:59,780
He believed that everything that happened
tonight was done by Yusa all on her own.

302
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,620
That producer will never dare to go up against her again.

303
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:07,430
No, I'm afraid everything is not completely settled yet.

304
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,599
And so I'd like you to transfer into Hoshinoumi Academy

305
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:16,469
and do everything you do alongside us from now on.

306
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:17,889
Why would she do that?

307
00:18:17,914 --> 00:18:19,690
Just like how I explained earlier.

308
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:23,231
If she gets caught by the scientists,
her days as a guinea pig will begin

309
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:26,544
and she will never be able to
return to a normal life, understand?

310
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:30,026
The condo next to our academy will be the safest place

311
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:34,044
for Kurobane to continue to grow and
live something of a normal existence.

312
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:38,163
That's a life‐saving story for Yusa.

313
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,385
We'll do that.

314
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:40,544
Hold on!

315
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,288
Then, well...

316
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:47,023
If Yusa's powers disappear, does that
also mean we'll never see Misa again?

317
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:49,642
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to ask.

318
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,326
Well, I suppose that will happen,
but she's already dead, isn't she?

319
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:56,345
Isn't it amazing that you were able to see her at all?

320
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,264
But...

321
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,399
Sho, it's just like she says.

322
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:01,353
In reality, she's not here.

323
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:05,155
It's time to say goodbye and let her go.

324
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:11,961
Then at least let me tell her how I truly feel about her.

325
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:21,555
Well, uh... How do I put this?

326
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,739
Now is when I can't think of what I should say?

327
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,333
Huh? Sho? Did you used to have the hots for me?

328
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:34,055
That's right.

329
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,770
I really loved you, Misa.

330
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:40,067
It's embarrassing to say... but I was in love

331
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,569
and you passed away before I could tell you.

332
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,124
We had a motorcycle accident
while we were riding together.

333
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:50,933
I was OK, but I was the one that killed you.

334
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,275
It's my fault.

335
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:56,121
I see. It's all right.

336
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:59,994
I made you harbor such immense feelings inside,

337
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,400
but I was the one that looked for dangerous thrills.

338
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,120
I reaped what I sowed.

339
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,836
Don't cry, that's not like you at all.

340
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:13,576
Sho, forget about me.

341
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:16,728
And starting tomorrow, live your own life.

342
00:20:17,553 --> 00:20:20,059
And don't keep dragging the dead into it.

343
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,394
Otherwise, your life will get screwed up
and you won't be happy in the future, OK?

344
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,180
Jeez, you really are a troublesome boy.

345
00:20:31,284 --> 00:20:32,045
Sho.

346
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,172
All right, Misa.

347
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:38,278
I'll walk my own path that you're not a part of.

348
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,151
I'll sever my feelings for you.

349
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:42,960
And that's how I'll live on.

350
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,737
Good. And I hope that both of
you live very long and happy lives.

351
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,944
Yeah.

352
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,333
Sure.

353
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,682
See ya! And thanks for everything.

354
00:20:53,856 --> 00:20:56,749
'Cause it was absolutely great!

355
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,240
It was a really long day.

356
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,415
I'm exhausted.

357
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,021
You are so late!

358
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:10,648
If you're going to be this late, I
told you that I wanted you to call!

359
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:13,838
How about you? What are you doing up at this hour?

360
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:15,808
Eating dinner together as a family

361
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,592
is a rule that's been passed down
the Otosaka house for generations.

362
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:23,294
Sorry, I was busy again today
doing work for the student council.

363
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,116
When you say that to me, I can't say anything back.

364
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:29,679
So tell me, what is it you made for dinner tonight?

365
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:33,179
I made a very satisfying spaghetti with meat sauce.

366
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:41,409
Oh! It's How‐Low‐Hello again!

367
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:53,111
Wow, it really is the same person that I met today.

368
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,649
Huh? Who exactly are you talking about?

369
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,345
You know, Yusa Nishimori, the actual person.

370
00:21:58,378 --> 00:22:01,973
You mean the real one? So you've
actually gotten to meet Yusarin?

371
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:02,759
Oh, crap!

372
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,584
But they didn't tell me to stay quiet about this.

373
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:07,192
So I guess I can tell her.

374
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,635
She's transferring into my academy tomorrow.

375
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,350
What? Oh, that makes me so jealous!

376
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,331
Do you think that maybe I'll be able to meet her soon?

377
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,989
Well, I guess that certainly is a possibility.

378
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,391
Oh, wow.

379
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,293
Let's start by cleaning up your nosebleed.

380
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:26,314
It's just something that's so amazing!

381
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:29,983
Come on, you're getting way too excited about this.
