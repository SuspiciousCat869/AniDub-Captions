1
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:11,501
Good morning.

2
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,699
Good morning, sleepy head!

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,779
Here, I made some French toast for you.

4
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,724
It's red!

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,581
Since you won't be needing lunches for school anymore,

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,167
I decided to put more effort into your breakfast.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,472
Put more effort, huh?

8
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:30,861
Looks like that's nothing more than adding pizza sauce.

9
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,416
Time to eat!

10
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:38,025
The sugar from the pizza sauce mixed
with the sugar in the French toast!

11
00:00:38,676 --> 00:00:40,468
What's wrong? Does it taste weird?

12
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,303
Oh, no, it's fine.

13
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,160
Seems like I'm not feeling too well.

14
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:46,072
Aww, did you catch a cold?

15
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:48,549
Maybe you should stay home from school today.

16
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:51,922
It's not that bad. I'm sorry that I'm making you worry.

17
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,159
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?

18
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:55,310
I'm totally fine!

19
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,547
Thank you for the meal.

20
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:03,549
You really do look pale.

21
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:05,525
You should be taking the day off today.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,145
No, no, there's nothing wrong, I promise.

23
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:12,218
I need to find a place to bury that pizza sauce.

24
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,964
I got some amazing news.

25
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:49,679
Yusa Nishimori is transferring into our school!

26
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,088
You mean the Yusarin?

27
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:51,889
No way.

28
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,888
This isn't a big art school or anything.

29
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:56,435
If she's the real thing, I'll be so happy.

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,269
As expected, everyone is getting pumped.

31
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,039
There's going to be a riot when she actually shows up.

32
00:03:02,452 --> 00:03:04,991
Just thinking about it's really got me on edge.

33
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,243
Quiet.

34
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,680
You there, sit down.

35
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:09,402
Seriously?

36
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:10,117
Over here.

37
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:17,484
Now, this transfer student will
be your classmate starting today.

38
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,730
Introduce yourself.

39
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,669
I'm Yusa Kurobane, known as Yusarin.

40
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:24,518
Quiet! I said be quiet!

41
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,590
You there, sit down. And you there, stop dancing!

42
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,615
Even in a place like this, she calls herself Yusarin?

43
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,051
So her real name is Kurobane?

44
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:36,512
How could you not even know that much?

45
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:44,475
I may not be able to attend every day
because work can keep me pretty busy,

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,062
but when I'm here, I look forward to
enjoying high school life with all of you.

47
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:49,958
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

48
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:57,372
Yusarin! Yusarin!

49
00:03:57,397 --> 00:03:58,842
Sit down and shut up!

50
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:00,515
Oh, brother.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,465
Kurobane, you sit there. That's your seat now.

52
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,568
It's nice to see you again.

53
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:13,690
Same. I'm sure I'll trouble you a
lot, but I'll try to be a good neighbor.

54
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:15,405
It's very nice to see you, too.

55
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,691
What's with her? She's so rude.

56
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:18,905
So not friendly.

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,418
Why did you transfer here?

58
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,418
Oh, I preordered your new single.

59
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,751
Me too. It's such a great song.

60
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,657
I always watch Movement Morning!

61
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,116
Me too, me too.

62
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,441
Will you please be my friend? What's your email?

63
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:34,527
You bastard, what do you think
you're doing? Don't try to cut us out.

64
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,004
I'm not doing any such thing.

65
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:38,931
Now, now, both of you, be nice to each other.

66
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:41,458
Ahh! Is she gonna do what I think she is?

67
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:42,689
Huh? Do what?

68
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:48,332
I cast a spell on you, I cast a spell on you.

69
00:04:48,626 --> 00:04:51,591
Now we can all make up and be friends too!

70
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,544
There it is!

71
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,972
Yusarin's Magic Spell, series
number 13, the spell for making up!

72
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:01,173
There, now don't you two feel better?

73
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,221
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

74
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,117
All good, I was wrong.

75
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,332
What is that so‐called Magic Spell series?

76
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:14,337
Yusa was once a regular cast member of the hit morning
information show Movement Morning!, or "Move‐Mo."

77
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,956
After the day's fortunes, she'd send out various spells,

78
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:19,896
particularly towards the viewers
who had bad luck that day.

79
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,739
And just how many episodes of this are there?

80
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,991
There are 64.

81
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:26,745
But two of them actually overlap, so there are really...

82
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,707
Big turnoff.

83
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:33,118
Hello. Will he be appearing before us again?

84
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,071
Yes.

85
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,364
Oh, thank you.

86
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:37,663
Oh, hey, watch it!

87
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:41,290
Kurobane, I'd like you to come
with us to the student council room.

88
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,242
Hey, Student Council President, that's not cool.

89
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,806
Let's get going.

90
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:48,814
Right.

91
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:55,112
Yusa, that Magic Spell you did earlier, series number 13,

92
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,929
the spell for making up, it was fantastic!

93
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,465
Wow! I can't believe you know so much about it.

94
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,918
Yes! I checked out the show religiously
for the entire time you were a part of it.

95
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,490
Wow! Thank you very much.

96
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,726
You're such a fan boy. Get over it, already.

97
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,554
I have a question.

98
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,372
What are we going to do in here, exactly?

99
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,340
A comrade will arrive soon.

100
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:21,553
However, we should probably
get you mentally prepared for him.

101
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:23,846
His unusual appearance might shock you.

102
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,026
Now, don't be afraid.

103
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,448
He's one of us. He will never do harm to you.

104
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:49,205
The ability is telekinesis.

105
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,717
Um, can someone tell me what just happened?

106
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,749
Someone with a special ability is in this general area,

107
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,487
and the power he has is telekinesis.

108
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:03,493
That guy found you in exactly the same manner.

109
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,769
What? That's amazing!

110
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,445
I'm going to do my best. All right!

111
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:12,991
You know, you can get possessed
by spirits and have pyrokinesis.

112
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:14,518
You're even more amazing.

113
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,177
Looks like another school.

114
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:19,160
I think it's Kannai Academy.

115
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:20,455
Yeah, bingo!

116
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,669
Uh, what is?

117
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:25,082
This is the sports paper from last week.

118
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:27,495
I've had my eye on this guy for a while.

119
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,614
Wow! He pitched three perfect games in a row.

120
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,590
"With sharp knuckleballs, no doubt this super
high school level pitcher will join the pro league."

121
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,137
The next day, I went and watched them practice.

122
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,693
Everyone should look at this.

123
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,724
Here we go.

124
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:50,684
Strike!

125
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,031
That's one heck of a curveball.

126
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,296
He's like major league caliber.

127
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,825
It gets even better.

128
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,243
Watch some footage where we get a
closeup of the pitcher's throwing hand.

129
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,402
There. Take a look.

130
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,806
See something strange?

131
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:05,482
Like what?

132
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,799
He's gripping it like a fastball, one that goes straight.

133
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:13,698
Knuckleballs are supposed to move irregularly
by stopping the ball rotation as much as possible.

134
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:19,493
The basic knuckleball is thrown by putting your
index and middle fingers against the ball like this.

135
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:24,652
How you grip a fastball makes it spin and it doesn't
allow it to wobble around like a knuckleball does.

136
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,042
You sure know a lot.

137
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,207
I get it now.

138
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:31,144
He's using telekinesis to move the ball
around after he's thrown it, isn't he?

139
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:31,819
Yes.

140
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:34,581
Wow! That's amazing, right?

141
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:36,470
Does she get any of this?

142
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:40,475
It will be bad if we can't get ahold
of him before the national championship.

143
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:42,184
Let's head there right now.

144
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:44,087
Well, what about class?

145
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:48,119
It's all right. No matter how we act, as
long as we're a part of the student council,

146
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:51,585
there can be no demerits towards
our grades or our school reports.

147
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,205
Is that so?

148
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,466
We're from the Hoshinoumi Academy Student Council.

149
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:59,371
We're practicing right now. What is it you guys want?

150
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,619
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:01,998
Yusa Nishimori?!

152
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:05,975
Could you just ignore her for the moment
and listen to what I have to say, please?

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,754
What is it?

154
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,228
I'm not beating around the bush here.

155
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,172
Do you use telekinesis to control
your knuckleballs after you throw them?

156
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:17,292
Telekinesis? As in supernatural abilities?

157
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,260
Are you insane? Of course I don't.

158
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,442
Are you from some occult research
club instead of the student council?

159
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,885
All right, wise guy, listen closely.

160
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,845
That power of yours is like a disease
that's only around during your adolescence.

161
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:31,304
Even if you were aiming to be a pro,

162
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,678
by the time you reach it, it will be long gone.

163
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,511
Not only that, but if someone notices you have powers,

164
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:38,837
you'll be captured.

165
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,583
Then you can kiss baseball goodbye for good.

166
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,475
So from here on, don't use that
special ability of yours, understand?

167
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,514
And who would capture me, exactly?

168
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:51,586
Scientists who are experimenting on
people with abilities just like you.

169
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,345
You expect me to believe something that crazy?

170
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,728
All right, fine.

171
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,809
Do me a big favor and don't look away.

172
00:09:58,912 --> 00:09:59,547
What?

173
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,816
So, do you believe me now?

174
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:07,515
You really are a sore loser, aren't you?

175
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:09,785
I say that we roast this chump.

176
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:11,832
Hey!

177
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:12,851
What?

178
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,660
Oh, uh, my bad.

179
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,630
This isn't the time to be showing off.

180
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:22,452
Ohh! Yusarin's spit. No, this is Misa's saliva.

181
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,222
I don't know how I should react.

182
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,241
Turnoff!

183
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:27,495
Back to business.

184
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,828
So, how are we gonna resolve this?

185
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,980
I know. How about a game of baseball?

186
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:39,773
It'll be our baseball team versus your baseball team.

187
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,654
And if we win, you have to do whatever we say.

188
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,700
All right, then.

189
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:48,617
And if we win, I don't see you ever again.

190
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,188
Deal.

191
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:53,442
But still, you'll never become
a professional baseball player.

192
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:56,482
I don't understand what drives you to play. What is it?

193
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,275
I want to go to the national championship, that's all.

194
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,117
Understood.

195
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:05,902
Next Sunday at 3 p. m. at our
school courtyard. How about it?

196
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,930
I don't have any problems with that.

197
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:13,700
What's wrong, Arifumi?

198
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:20,570
So someone that can hit that
knuckleball exists on our baseball team?

199
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,554
We'll be using our abilities, so it will be just fine.

200
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,154
And what kind of powers does the team have?

201
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,075
They don't.

202
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:31,432
They have several people with potential
but no one's developed a special ability yet.

203
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,583
Then how do we pull this off?

204
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,963
We'll be there to support them.

205
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:40,882
You mean we're all a part of this?

206
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,685
We won't win otherwise.

207
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:46,189
Besides, if it's on our school
courtyard, it won't turn into a riot.

208
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,023
That was the appropriate move.

209
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,356
I'm getting fired up now.

210
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:52,554
Don't you burn anything.

211
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,227
Bow.

212
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:04,584
Have a good game.

213
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:08,910
Our opposing team has girls in it, huh?

214
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,368
No way they can hit your pitches.

215
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,225
What's the point of this game, anyway?

216
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,336
It's all about the future, Takato.

217
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,708
I see, all right. Let's do this then.

218
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,677
If you lose, I'm smacking all your asses, with this bat.

219
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,652
Win!

220
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:27,706
Yeah!

221
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,135
Smacking asses with a bat?

222
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:31,833
What is she, an old woman?

223
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,548
Play ball!

224
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:40,893
Yes.

225
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:45,352
They must have the worst batters on the
planetif they can't even hit one of our balls.

226
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:46,582
Is that so?

227
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,844
I'm doing you a favor being out there.

228
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,352
What kind of talk is that?

229
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:52,590
It's the truth.

230
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:54,715
Screw you, I'm outta here!

231
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,159
That won't do. Please keep pitching.

232
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,890
Then think before you open your big mouth!

233
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:01,737
Kurobane, please go ahead.

234
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,077
OK.

235
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,458
I cast a spell for thee, I cast it, don't you see?

236
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:11,532
Now that you are nice and calm, please smile for me!

237
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,778
It's from Magic Spells series
number 9, the spell for calming down!

238
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,381
Yep. Now everything's gonna be A‐OK.

239
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,447
Knock it off!

240
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,224
Strike! Batter out.

241
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:37,566
That knuckleball's insane. No way we're ever gonna hit it.

242
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,740
Just go ahead and smack me, I don't care.

243
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:43,754
You know, it's pretty amazing the
catcher manages to catch pitches like that.

244
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,673
Guess that means that he's super high school level, too.

245
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,379
There's no way we can win this.

246
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:55,085
We just need one run.

247
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,303
If the two of us can score one run,

248
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,494
we can win, as long as we protect that lead.

249
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,573
Here goes!

250
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,192
Not good. So they went after Yusa after all.

251
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:14,951
Misa, on the other hand, has athletic reflexes.

252
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,992
Damn, why is Yusa so weak?

253
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:21,184
I see.

254
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,248
She can make the right decision,
but she can't physically keep up.

255
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,129
Strike! Batter out.

256
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:31,655
Out!

257
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,810
Ball four!

258
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,270
Not looking good.

259
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:01,523
Out!

260
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:04,103
Safe!

261
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:06,222
This is a total crisis.

262
00:15:06,768 --> 00:15:08,642
We should use abilities as well.

263
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:10,727
Specifically...?

264
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,282
You need to take over the opponents' batters.

265
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,845
What I want you to do is make the last two of
them listless so they barely swing their bats.

266
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:19,710
Throw outside of the strike zone.

267
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,202
Just be careful to not throw a wild pitch.

268
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,408
Yeah, got it.

269
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,377
All right now, I'm counting on you.

270
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:27,388
Play ball!

271
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:32,277
Never thought I'd use my powers for something like this.

272
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,292
Strike!

273
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:38,864
Huh? What the...?

274
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:39,947
What's the matter?

275
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,179
Strike two!

276
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:46,362
Hey, are you all right?

277
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,608
Yeah, totally fine.

278
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,949
It's two outs with the next guy.

279
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:57,937
Arifumi, if you want to be that thorough
in winning this thing, we have to go all out!

280
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:00,580
Catcher!

281
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:06,763
Safe!

282
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:09,622
Takato.

283
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:12,328
Wait, what the hell happened?

284
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,407
I didn't think that far ahead.

285
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:15,995
Did he steal home base?

286
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,693
Damn, damn, damn!

287
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:20,126
Guess we ain't winnin' this one.

288
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,556
Strike! Batter out!

289
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,159
Just make sure that you hit the ball when you bunt.

290
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:29,936
Then use your ability to run past
first base, and don't forget to touch it.

291
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,317
Are you sure that they'll see me make it there?

292
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,198
I'll record the evidence with a super‐high‐speed camera.

293
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:36,277
Understood.

294
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:44,325
Strike!

295
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,746
Strike two!

296
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,785
If I screw up the next one, I'm out.

297
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,958
Here it comes, four‐eyes.

298
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:00,252
Yes!

299
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:07,188
He touched first base, it's plain as day.

300
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,900
Come on now, it's safe. Call safe!

301
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:12,852
Safe!

302
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,047
What the heck happened?

303
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,261
That was great. We won't let it go to waste.

304
00:17:18,464 --> 00:17:19,991
I need a pinch runner!

305
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,402
Yusa's weak, but I'll use my
own game sense to hit the ball.

306
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,100
All right!

307
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,194
That's the way. It was awesome!

308
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,671
It's your turn to bat now, so what are you going to do?

309
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:42,137
A sacrifice bunt, and once it succeeds,
one base hit will get us a walk‐off.

310
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:45,106
Huh? I can't hit like that with my ability.

311
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,067
How about you go face things head on once in a while?

312
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:51,977
Show me the fiend that cheats on tests.

313
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,371
Please hit it!

314
00:18:10,706 --> 00:18:11,484
First base!

315
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:13,039
They're just a bunch of amateurs!

316
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,206
Out!

317
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,849
I have to face this crap head on?

318
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,301
Lead! Lead!

319
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,098
Strike!

320
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,056
Strike two!

321
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:28,763
Damn!

322
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:37,467
Foul ball!

323
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,816
I finally hit it.

324
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:43,371
Foul!

325
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,171
Foul!

326
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,052
Foul!

327
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:50,611
His timing is inching closer.

328
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,595
I'll move it a bit more on this one.

329
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,709
Crap! It's all over.

330
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,407
It's not over. Move it. He fumbled!

331
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:11,800
Safe!

332
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,004
We can do this. I have the game sense!

333
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,109
Takato, home!

334
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,133
Safe! That's the game!

335
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,371
Did you see that? I ruled!

336
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:40,310
That was amazing, Yusarin!

337
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,176
So did we win?

338
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,454
Yes, by the skin of our teeth.

339
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:46,692
We won. That's awesome.

340
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:48,438
All right!

341
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:53,467
Wait, why am I getting so happy about something like this?

342
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:57,709
We were victorious.

343
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,249
Please never use that ability again, ever.

344
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,409
I'm just an ordinary pitcher.

345
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,513
But Takato, the catcher, is different.

346
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,282
He's a catcher that really
deserves to be in the spotlight.

347
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:14,997
The two of us have played together for a long time.

348
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,234
He knew that the baseball team at our school was weak.

349
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:21,742
But still he chose to pair up with me.

350
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:27,009
I just wanted to take him to nationals,
even if it meant using this power.

351
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:31,101
The nationals, that big stage
where even pros would notice him.

352
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:35,505
So instead of personal gain, you were
using your ability for your friendship.

353
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,640
That's right.

354
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:40,055
We won the game today because
we cheated with our abilities.

355
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:42,933
But you've been cheating while pitching for quite a while.

356
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:46,397
But there are people who will notice him out there,

357
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,230
even if you don't cheat,

358
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:52,190
and it doesn't matter if it's in
college or in the business leagues.

359
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,689
You can keep watch over him as his best friend.

360
00:20:56,358 --> 00:21:01,062
Someday he'll shine out there and you'll
point to him and say, "That is my closest friend."

361
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,602
I'm sure of it. It'll be all right.

362
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:06,838
I know.

363
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:13,484
As a small experiment, can you try taking over his body?

364
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:15,064
Uh‐huh. What for?

365
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,095
Like I said, it's an experiment.

366
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,492
You don't say that to your test subject.

367
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:22,097
He's the test subject, so don't worry.

368
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:24,312
Whatever.

369
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:33,811
Whoa! What the...?

370
00:21:34,065 --> 00:21:35,744
Thank you for indulging me.

371
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,415
No, it wasn't anything much. Did you figure something out?

372
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:41,605
I'm not sure for now.

373
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,589
Just going to see how things go for a while.

374
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,781
I beg you, just this once, can I
have dinner without pizza sauce?

375
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:52,670
I'm back!

376
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:55,043
A secret recipe of the Otosaka house.

377
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:57,078
A cream stew full of broccoli!

378
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:58,459
It's red!

379
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:01,585
But cream stew is supposed to be white, isn't it?

380
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,269
That is what makes it a secret family recipe.

381
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,226
Just as I thought.

382
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,305
What do I believe in, you ask?

383
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,551
I have to believe in myself, of course.

384
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:11,764
The power to believe...

385
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,765
Oh! It's a new commercial from Yusarin.

386
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,870
And it's How‐Low‐Hello's new song.

387
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:21,003
That reminds me, did Yusarin really
transfer to your school, Big Brother?

388
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:22,235
Yeah.

389
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:27,485
That is just... so incredibly amazing!
