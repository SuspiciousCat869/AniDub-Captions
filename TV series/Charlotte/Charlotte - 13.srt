1
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:54,800
What's the purpose of your visit?

2
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,762
Well, um...

3
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:59,118
Sightseeing.

4
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,179
Very well then. Enjoy your stay.

5
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:10,889
Please, sir, the list.

6
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,614
I need to find someone with a search ability first.

7
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,069
Guess I'll ask their leader.

8
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,364
It's got to be this one.

9
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,663
Now, what kind of ability will he have?

10
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,647
This guy?

11
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,406
Let's see now.

12
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:01,429
If you move, you get roasted.

13
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:03,062
You the leader?

14
00:03:03,613 --> 00:03:04,953
Who are you?

15
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:06,808
Hang on.

16
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,759
An ability wielder, just like you.

17
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,799
Huh? How come I can't read his mind?

18
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,648
One sec.

19
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,013
How come I can't read his mind?

20
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:18,920
He stole my ability?

21
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,353
Oh, let's see. That's right.

22
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,975
This really is a useful ability.

23
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,674
I got a question.

24
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:30,016
How are you locating other ability wielders? Tell me!

25
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,516
Don’t think, don't think! Don't think!

26
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:37,485
Angelo? Cool. Guess I'll be paying him a visit next.

27
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,505
Thanks a lot, buddy.

28
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:44,272
Damn you to...

29
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,208
You crashed my ride. Not cool, man. Let me out of here!

30
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,067
What?

31
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,895
Are you Angelo?

32
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:08,372
Who are you? What do you want from me?

33
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,836
Your ability is an illness, OK?

34
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,141
You don't have to use it anymore.

35
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,350
Impossible.

36
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,322
Good to know. You just have to look at the map.

37
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,084
Amazing.

38
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,787
His ability to find wielders is perfect.

39
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:55,481
Earlier this morning, the UN announced
that the Democratic Revolutionary Army...

40
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,155
That hurt!

41
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:03,378
The UN Chairman, Brian Jackson, reported that

42
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,743
a young man suspected to be the ringleader

43
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:08,461
and several others have been apprehended unhurt...

44
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:10,148
Well what is to come, he has a...

45
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,618
I guess my work really is paying off.

46
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,680
I hope there will be a quick, peaceful resolution.

47
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:18,853
It looks like there are other places
that are gathering ability wielders.

48
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,793
It's... It's the One‐Eyed Grim Reaper!

49
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,796
Jeez, that's an embarrassing nickname.

50
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,374
Couldn't they have come up with
something cooler? I mean, come on!

51
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,113
What was that image?

52
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:57,098
Weird.

53
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:08,724
I guess I'm able to learn what the
plundered ability is without knowing it now.

54
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,861
I've plundered all the abilities of yet another country.

55
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:13,870
And guess what?

56
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:16,627
I understand every single language in the world now.

57
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,362
And if I decide I don't want to,

58
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,671
I never need to sleep again.

59
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,021
Oh, that's amazing.

60
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,987
But don't overexert yourself too much.

61
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:27,863
No. I have to hit the next country ASAP.

62
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:29,085
Time's precious.

63
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,267
You're right. I know this is rough,

64
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,371
but I'm counting on you to finish
this before you lose your powers.

65
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:36,229
Yeah.

66
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,132
This one makes illnesses worse?

67
00:06:55,024 --> 00:06:56,873
They’re all clumped together again.

68
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,805
How can they do that to children?

69
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:08,614
Huh? That clump only has one glimmer.

70
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:10,400
What does that mean?

71
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,205
What the...? No images are popping up.

72
00:07:23,255 --> 00:07:25,168
What kind of a facility is this?

73
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,080
Carriers?

74
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,881
Aha. So that's what this means.

75
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,841
I get it. They've been infected, but
their abilities haven't broken out yet,

76
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,547
so they're just carriers.

77
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:41,418
Darn it, I can't plunder what isn't there.

78
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:43,339
What should I do?

79
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,846
Yes, these special abilities are indeed a disease.

80
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:51,239
So before particles are spread all over Earth again,

81
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,007
we need to vaccinate every person in the world.

82
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,810
That's right. If it's an illness,

83
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,295
I can make it worse, and the ability should break out.

84
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:01,164
Wouldn't that make it plunderable?

85
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:12,963
All right, that went well.

86
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:16,143
I'll have to plunder from all carriers from now on, too.

87
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:19,833
Otherwise new wielders could pop
up right after I leave a country.

88
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,217
Shoot until you're out of ammo!

89
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,802
Gracias. Is much better.

90
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:04,454
So there's even someone with an ability to heal.

91
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:08,706
I'm sorry. Even if you're using your ability for good,

92
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,285
I can't allow you to keep it.

93
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,056
This hand...

94
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,028
If I put it up to my eye, then...

95
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:29,596
I can have full sight and use my time leap again.

96
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,675
I might even be able to save Kumagami.

97
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,883
No way. I didn't plunder
abilities for something like that.

98
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:47,526
From now on, I will not allow
for acts that break human reason.

99
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,827
I'll rid this world of abilities.

100
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,264
And that is my only purpose now.

101
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:02,799
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

102
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,203
Shut up! Shut up!

103
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,164
Hey, are you all right, man?

104
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,578
Are you the enemy?

105
00:10:31,228 --> 00:10:35,037
Don't play dumb. Are you my enemy or not?!

106
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:43,139
Please don't kill me!

107
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,615
That's right. Calm down. Calm down.

108
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,337
I shouldn't kill anyone.

109
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:59,947
They have announced that they have captured
Mayor Hassan Muscle of their capital city.

110
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,725
So I'm going there tomorrow.

111
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:05,717
I should sleep, if only for a little while.

112
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,679
It'll be good for me.

113
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,132
According to government reports...

114
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,362
It is necessary to rest one's body

115
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,933
every so often.

116
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,845
The government has announced this morning

117
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,871
that the leader of the coup d'état, Mohsen bin Yazid,

118
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,363
has just agreed to an unconditional surrender.

119
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,441
The ongoing battle continued within the capital city...

120
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:30,884
What?

121
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:32,900
...against just syndicate comprise primarily children.

122
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,108
What the hell's going on?

123
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:37,002
But due to a skirmish yesterday
instigated by a mysterious individual,

124
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:37,581
What?

125
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:39,080
...it seems they have suffered major damages.

126
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,850
Did I make this happen?

127
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:46,005
This isn’t good.

128
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,246
My memory’s starting to get muddled.

129
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,225
I shouldn't sleep after all.

130
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:01,491
What in the world am I doing here?

131
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,928
Why am I in a battlefield?

132
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,389
What is this?

133
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:22,884
That's right.

134
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,024
I made a promise...

135
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:29,103
that I would plunder every last ability in the world

136
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,076
and then come back to her.

137
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,781
Back to her?

138
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,462
Who was she?

139
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,240
I'm sure she was someone very dear to me.

140
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:42,303
But I can't remember.

141
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:03,465
I see. Someone with the
explosion ability will show up there.

142
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,808
You must be the Reaper I keep hearing about.

143
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,284
All right, I will take you with me, then!

144
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:12,324
Revolu...

145
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:16,567
Damn it!

146
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:19,543
That ability of yours only brings death and misfortune.

147
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:38,466
One‐Eyed?

148
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,664
Could you be the Reaper?

149
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:45,216
Yeah. The big, bad reaper!

150
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,479
Friendly neighborhood Reaper here.

151
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:15,752
This is too tough, man.

152
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,621
I don't wanna do this.

153
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:22,141
Who the hell made this plan, and why do I have to do it?

154
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:25,876
I've practically visited every corner of the damn world.

155
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:28,403
That's enough, isn't it?

156
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:32,009
I'm so tired of doing this crap day in and day out.

157
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,828
Someone please take over for me.

158
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,600
I know what I can do.

159
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,673
I could just take over the world with my powers.

160
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,447
It would be easy.

161
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:49,755
I'm a god!

162
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,728
Everyone will fall in line!

163
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,995
Do as I say!

164
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,284
Huh? What the hell is this?

165
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:06,438
Filthy garbage!

166
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:19,898
What’s going on?

167
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:23,531
Why do I feel angry at myself for kicking this thing?

168
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,211
I don't get it.

169
00:15:26,184 --> 00:15:29,371
I'm crying. What the hell is happening to me?

170
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,498
What's up with this?

171
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,633
I still need to keep doing my best.

172
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:57,592
It's the Reaper!

173
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,683
Gimme that!

174
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,453
Why won't any of it hit?

175
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:29,553
Is that kid some kind of demon?!

176
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,779
Worse. He's the One‐Eyed Grim Reaper!

177
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,999
We can't win.

178
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,293
Out of my way!

179
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:42,376
Say goodbye to the boogieman.

180
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:48,099
You're kidding me! That was an RPG.

181
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:54,375
You saved us.

182
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,117
Thank you so much.

183
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:56,215
We appreciate it.

184
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,231
It's close to here.

185
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,193
I did it!

186
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:48,271
I finally got the One‐Eyed Reaper! Ha!

187
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,761
You shouldn't pick on the weak, you bully!

188
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,675
Are you freakin' kiddin' me?

189
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:58,928
Do you have any idea who that is, kid?

190
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,126
No clue, but still, I won't let you hurt him!

191
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,813
That guy has a huge bounty on his head.

192
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:07,666
If I nab him, I get paid a king's ransom.

193
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:09,119
Yeah, but it's still wrong!

194
00:19:41,474 --> 00:18:12,812
All right, little girl, if you
want some pain, I'll deliver.

195
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,439
Do whatever you want. I will not stand aside, ever!

196
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:24,657
What the...?

197
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,417
Of all things.

198
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,914
The very last ability wielder in the whole world

199
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,081
had the power of courage in her.

200
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:38,594
But that kind of reckless valor
will get you killed someday.

201
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:44,360
Just go home now.

202
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:49,551
You shouldn't...

203
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,645
You still have plenty of courage without the power.

204
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:53,976
Run along now.

205
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,303
OK, but I'll go call for help.

206
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,750
I'll be back just as soon as I can.

207
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:05,466
It's over.

208
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:07,246
I promised.

209
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,419
I need to get back.

210
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:11,437
It's all over.

211
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:13,624
So I need to get back.

212
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:16,678
I accomplished everything.

213
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,778
So I need to get back.

214
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:22,031
Get back... to where?

215
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,235
I need to get back.

216
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:37,075
I must have made...

217
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:39,062
a promise.

218
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,902
Lap of luxury, here I come!

219
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:49,248
What is that?

220
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:53,852
Yu!

221
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:21,261
Took you long enough.

222
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:30,626
Thanks for all the hard work.

223
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,993
And for keeping the promise we made.

224
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,271
Your life is not in danger,

225
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:44,831
but you should take some time to rest properly.

226
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,218
OK.

227
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,337
Oh, by the way, miss, who are you?

228
00:20:58,406 --> 00:20:59,986
So that's how things roll.

229
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:02,360
Of course it's understandable.

230
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,806
Since you plundered thousands,

231
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:06,666
tens of thousands of abilities,

232
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:09,175
the stress caused to your brain must be staggering.

233
00:21:10,162 --> 00:21:12,235
It's a blessing that you can even talk.

234
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:18,495
My name's Tomori and I am your lover.

235
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:22,254
A lover? But I don't even recognize you.

236
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:25,543
That hurts, a lot more than I expected.

237
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:28,743
I'm so sorry. Did I make you sad just now?

238
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,143
Yeah, a little bit.

239
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:34,977
Because we were classmates and
worked together in the student council.

240
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,030
And before you left, you
promised me that we would be lovers.

241
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:43,895
Sorry, I don't remember any of that.

242
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,464
These flash cards,

243
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,116
I made them for you,

244
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,477
so you held onto them until the very end.

245
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,013
Did they come in handy?

246
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,786
So, these were a gift? You made these?

247
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:57,632
Yes.

248
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,340
While I was traveling,

249
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:03,853
they were like a good luck charm.

250
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,513
This was the one thing I couldn't part with.

251
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:11,171
Even though it's so tattered and half torn.

252
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:16,151
It means a lot. Thanks for that.

253
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,436
If you were able to come back like this because of it,

254
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,883
I couldn't be any happier.

255
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,641
Did I make you sad again?

256
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,488
No. I'm just happy.

257
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:29,321
That's all.

258
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:33,438
I'm not sure I get it, but please don't cry.

259
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:35,638
That's impossible.

260
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:42,858
Yu Otosaka, I'm so glad you're back!

261
00:22:57,606 --> 00:23:02,025
This is a camcorder that I kept recording
things I didn't want for the longest time.

262
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,518
But from now on, I will keep recording all of you.

263
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:09,301
I will record lots and lots of happy, everyday life.

264
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:15,472
That way, we can leave behind
lots and lots of happy memories.

265
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:16,959
Sounds good to me.

266
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:17,525
Yep.

267
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:20,212
Oh, can I be a part of the memories, too?!

268
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:21,963
Of course.

269
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,463
Not sure what to say right now.

270
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:27,216
Then just be honest.

271
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:32,554
I'm looking forward to the future.

272
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,981
Yay! Let's make it a good one!

273
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:36,887
I'm so there!

274
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:44,228
From now on, we'll make sure our
lives are filled with fun and happiness.
