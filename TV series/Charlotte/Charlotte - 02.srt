1
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:14,126
I'm gonna go.

2
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:15,135
Wait a minute!

3
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:17,690
You're forgetting something!

4
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:18,809
Your lunch!

5
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:20,999
What's the menu today?

6
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:22,943
It's omelet rice, your favorite.

7
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:24,959
That again?!

8
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:27,803
Th‐Thanks. Now don't you be late, OK?

9
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,986
I won't.

10
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,579
Please excuse me.

11
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:07,890
Welcome to our academy.

12
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:20,161
So every single student here has some special ability?

13
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:26,260
No. Some have the possibility of having
one, and some show signs of developing one.

14
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,359
You transfer them here just for that?

15
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:31,922
A long time ago, people who had
special abilities like we have

16
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:36,489
could end up as guinea pigs for misguided
and sometimes cruel neuroscientists.

17
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,531
If you got caught, your life was basically over.

18
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,927
Hah! You're exaggerating.

19
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,911
I'm actually talking about my big brother.

20
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,400
To protect those with abilities, a
certain individual created the current system,

21
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,987
though not in time to save my big brother.

22
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:58,706
So why did you get me into this student
council and tell me I should use my powers?

23
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,698
The student council here is
entrusted with a special mission,

24
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:07,656
and that is to seek out those with special abilities who
are on the loose like you were, and either protect them

25
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:10,179
or threaten them to never use their powers.

26
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,988
Why would I do something like that?

27
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,266
In return, you will be paid appropriately.

28
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,896
Isn't Ayumi having to do her
best to make decent meals every day

29
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:21,294
because you can't even afford to buy proper food?

30
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:27,066
My name is Yu Otosaka.

31
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:29,344
I came here from Hinomori High School.

32
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,360
Nice to meet you all.

33
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:34,701
So cute!

34
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,873
Hey. She's a first‐year, but
she's student council president?

35
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:57,490
Right. In this academy, the student
council president is not determined by grade.

36
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:01,896
It goes to someone who's active and has a
sense of duty as someone with a special ability.

37
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:03,435
I see.

38
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:11,235
This is exactly the same thing as last night's dinner.

39
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,235
Say, Otosaka, what are you going to do about lunch today?

40
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,232
Well, I don't have anything.

41
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,614
Then let's go to the cafeteria together.

42
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,090
I'll show you where it is.

43
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,518
That would be a big help.

44
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:25,514
You're not going to invite her?

45
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,823
I can ask her to come along if you like.

46
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:30,855
Nah. No thanks.

47
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,791
Doesn't seem to be any open seats.

48
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:39,593
Then how about we buy some sandwiches
and go back to the classroom to eat?

49
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,972
Well, it's pretty crowded over there, too.

50
00:04:42,423 --> 00:04:44,306
Just leave that part to me.

51
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:46,536
Here's where I can show off my ability.

52
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,344
Is it OK for you to do that?

53
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:49,750
Don't worry, it's fine.

54
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:52,061
I'll go in from the blind spot on the camera.

55
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:58,212
Though, since I'll be going by too quickly,
what kind of breads I grab will all depend on luck.

56
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,535
Huh? Hey.

57
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:26,910
What was that?

58
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,323
An explosion?

59
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:29,505
Sorry to make you wait.

60
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:34,212
Oh, I got a rather great result this time.

61
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:35,308
A cutlet sandwich.

62
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:35,928
What?

63
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,964
You call that a great result with all those wounds on you?

64
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:43,932
I do wear armor under my uniform so
the wounds are never very deep, you know.

65
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:46,813
But you're bleeding from your head!

66
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:51,237
You know, you're a pretty
dangerous guy, despite how you look.

67
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,705
What do you mean by that?

68
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,983
Wait, you have nothing but cutlet sandwiches here.

69
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,737
It's teleportation, you know.

70
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,330
You think I had time to pick and choose what I wanted?

71
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:02,700
And every single one of them is smushed.

72
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:04,208
That's teleportation.

73
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:10,061
You think I can fine‐tune how forcefully I
grab merchandise when I'm moving that fast?

74
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,490
His ability really is half‐assed.

75
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,676
She doesn't have any female friends, even
though she's the student council president?

76
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:23,328
Her special ability is to become completely
invisible to one person she chooses.

77
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:27,447
Which means that everyone other
than that person can see her.

78
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:31,081
That imperfection is what caused
the situation she's in right now.

79
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:34,298
Even if she had a valid reason,

80
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:39,394
what would people around her think after
seeing her use her ability to take violent actions?

81
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,456
On top of that, the surveillance cameras
show nothing but an ordinary fight.

82
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:50,112
As she kept doing things like that,
obviously people eventually came to hate her.

83
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:55,699
But apparently her personality wasn't
like that until she got into middle school.

84
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:56,910
Huh?

85
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:59,291
Oh. She's walking over here.

86
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:02,140
A helper will soon be showing up.

87
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:03,458
What the hell?

88
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:05,987
That means, everyone gather at the student council room.

89
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,471
Huh? How did you figure that?

90
00:07:24,456 --> 00:07:27,269
What in the world is about to begin here?

91
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:36,024
Who is this guy?

92
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:49,475
Thoughtography... right here.

93
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:50,729
Huh?

94
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,323
Who was that?

95
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,918
A comrade who tells us the location and power
of someone who possesses a special ability.

96
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:02,323
Nanba High School, We'll go stake it out.

97
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:03,993
Come on, we're leaving early.

98
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:04,794
To do what?

99
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,060
Some investigation, of course.

100
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,993
Even though we're not with the police?

101
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:14,530
If the police you mention find this person
before we do, that person's life is all but over.

102
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,586
Seriously?

103
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,444
Start asking around.

104
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,111
Right!

105
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,230
Come on, now. Let's get started.

106
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,349
What is it I should be doing?

107
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:29,347
Basically, ask whether anything
strange has been going on lately.

108
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:33,228
Also, since the ability has been
determined to be thoughtography,

109
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:36,607
it might be good to ask about
any rumors that involve photographs.

110
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:38,369
Good luck.

111
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:40,933
What am I doing?

112
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,877
Those two are nothing more than a couple of lunatics.

113
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,978
There was someone acting suspicious.

114
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:54,373
I want you to take over his body
and look through all of his belongings.

115
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:55,700
For what purpose?

116
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,072
To protect the one with special abilities.

117
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:05,121
Oh, fine. Which guy is it?

118
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:07,112
Damn it, you took so long, I've lost him.

119
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:08,074
Follow me!

120
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:14,176
That's the guy.

121
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:18,342
Hurry!

122
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:21,271
Damn it. Why do I have to do something like this?

123
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,309
Huh? Hey.

124
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,452
Whaaaa!

125
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,532
What's this? Whoa!

126
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,390
Hey, what are you doing with that?

127
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,281
Pictures of a female student.

128
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:44,019
She's rather pretty.

129
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,582
Next up, well, a girl in her lingerie.

130
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,618
This is thoughtography?

131
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,830
You sure use it for something stupid.

132
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:55,289
Did you take either of these pictures?

133
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:56,965
No, no. I bought them.

134
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,592
Then who did you buy them from?

135
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:03,973
Look, I don't intend on leaking any of
what you tell me to a third party, OK?

136
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,042
Please just tell me the truth.

137
00:10:06,836 --> 00:10:08,415
If you don't tell us now,

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,526
I'll tell the girl in this photograph that
this was in your possession and that you took it.

139
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,890
Udou... in class 2‐E.

140
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:19,834
Thank you very much. OK, we're going in.

141
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:22,008
We're gonna go capture Udou from 2‐E.

142
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:22,593
Right!

143
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:24,609
Huh?

144
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,514
Can you tell me if Udou has gone home yet?

145
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,062
Huh? No, Udou is...

146
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:34,522
Captain, if I may excuse myself.

147
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,435
Yeah. Good work today.

148
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,216
Wow, this is a surprise.

149
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:46,558
Who are you? Where did you come from?

150
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:50,686
Who would have thought that the culprit who takes lewd,

151
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:54,028
perverted photographs like this
with his thoughtography ability

152
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,322
and sells them off to his classmates

153
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,814
is also the school's archery team captain?

154
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,726
Photograph? Thoughtography?

155
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,167
I don't know what you mean.

156
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:07,675
Forget it. One of your customers gave you up.

157
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:11,460
Oh, yeah, we took a really
good look inside your locker, too.

158
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:16,844
A ton of photos came falling out so I recorded
them all on this video camera as evidence.

159
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,153
I can easily open something
like a locker inside a clubhouse.

160
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,927
Why would you do such a thing?

161
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:28,411
Because I can make money with it, of course.

162
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,895
This involves your family's finances?

163
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:35,039
Your parents wouldn't be happy with
you making money like this, you know.

164
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:37,581
They're sick, OK? There's nothing else I can do!

165
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,758
I projected you in your underwear
here. It includes your face.

166
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:48,550
If you don't want this photo distributed
everywhere, you'll forget this ever happened.

167
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,755
That's all thoughtography takes? I'm impressed.

168
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,390
But, um, no one would ever need that.

169
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,247
No matter who looks at you, you're attractive.

170
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,418
Seriously? I got a compliment!

171
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,704
All right!

172
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:04,323
Yeah, so hurry up and get outta here.

173
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,379
Nice work.

174
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:12,776
The photo is...

175
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:14,300
gone? It's right here.

176
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:17,291
But wait, how did you...?

177
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,219
Oh, man!

178
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:20,799
That's checkmate.

179
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:22,584
Just give up, OK?

180
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:27,488
Pretend like none of this ever happened.

181
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,535
You're the worst kind of person, you know that?

182
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,682
So how much martial arts spirit you possess means nothing!

183
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:57,483
Just so you know, we really don't plan on
handing you over to the police or anything like that.

184
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,141
However, if you keep using those powers,
your life will be completely ruined.

185
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:06,813
Do you want to become an experimental
subject dissected by scientists?

186
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:07,765
Dissected?

187
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,369
So this is a warning.

188
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,643
Those powers will disappear once
your body is finished with adolescence.

189
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:18,334
As for money, earn some by
working legitimate part‐time jobs.

190
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,640
We took care of that successfully.

191
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,069
Indeed, we did.

192
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:35,223
Tell me, you guys always do things like this?

193
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:35,921
Yes.

194
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:40,156
So that no one with special
abilities ends up like my big brother.

195
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,267
I see.

196
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:46,431
So what is it, exactly, that actually happened to
your big brother after he got caught by the scientists?

197
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:49,927
It's not like I'm hiding him or anything.

198
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,602
How about we visit tomorrow?

199
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:53,793
Huh? Visit where?

200
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,927
Where my big brother is now.

201
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,476
OK, are you ready to go?

202
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,842
Yeah. What about you?

203
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,143
I'm going to take a pass this time.

204
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:06,556
Take care.

205
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:09,714
You haven't eaten lunch yet, have you?

206
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:10,634
No.

207
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:13,658
Then let's buy station‐specific lunches at the kiosk!

208
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,610
I want this one!

209
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:19,231
A beef‐tongue bento box lunch
that warms up when you pull a string!

210
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:21,081
This is totally amazing!

211
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,581
Yeah, I know all about them.

212
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,817
I can't believe it, this is so embarrassing.

213
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:34,294
How can she eat like that in a situation like this?

214
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:37,937
It's bad manners, no matter how you look at it.

215
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,342
What's wrong? Aren't you gonna
eat the sandwich you bought?

216
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,425
Ahhhhh...

217
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:52,504
My big brother was the first to have a special ability.

218
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:57,607
I'd just passed the middle school entrance
exams for a national university magnet school.

219
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,400
I did it, Mom!

220
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:02,599
I did it! I got accepted!

221
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,035
You really did do your best now.

222
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:08,279
That means you could end up
being a doctor, or even a minister.

223
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:09,017
Yup!

224
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,676
Big Brother, look at this. I got accepted.

225
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,470
Seriously? Unlike me, you're completely amazing, you know?

226
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,371
No, you're much more amazing than me, Big Brother.

227
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:24,953
I heard that some of the record companies
are starting to notice what a great band you have.

228
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:29,931
Since we're poor, I want to hurry up and land myself
a major record deal so I can live on my own.

229
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,905
Hey, did you ever listen to that CD I lent you?

230
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,945
It would get in the way of my studies, so no, I haven't.

231
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,715
Your entrance exams are over now so listen to it.

232
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,931
I want to create sounds just like it and soar to the top.

233
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:44,625
I'm not really interested in rock music and stuff.

234
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,130
It's different. Zhiend is not rock music, it's post‐rock.

235
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,125
You said that before, too.

236
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,630
Like, I don't understand what you mean at all.

237
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:56,199
As it turned out, I wasn't able to enter that school.

238
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,135
I have something important to say.

239
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,880
I've decided to enter you both in a boarding school

240
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:07,362
so that each of you has the chance
to develop your special talents.

241
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:07,964
Huh?

242
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:11,227
What do you mean? I was just
about to sign to a record label.

243
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm sorry, but can't you put
that off for just a little while?

244
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,719
I don't get any of this!

245
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:21,584
If I can support myself, that will
take the pressure off our money situation!

246
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:26,136
It's actually the reverse. We'll be better
off financially if you guys go to this school...

247
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,668
What do you mean, the reverse?

248
00:16:27,693 --> 00:16:29,692
In the first place, Nao is good at studying,

249
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,700
but I'm just an idiot who only
knows how to play the guitar!

250
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,470
I think that's exactly what they acknowledged you for.

251
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,899
Then is that place a specialized school for music?

252
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:39,994
What's up with us both going together?

253
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:47,469
That day, we saw my mother grovel on the
ground and beg for the first time in our lives.

254
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:52,323
My mother, who raised us for
the longest time, all by herself.

255
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:57,343
It looked like a fairly normal school,
and I immediately made a few friends.

256
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:03,304
However, every day after classes were over,
I was forced to take something like a physical exam.

257
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:08,286
We were supposedly in the same school,
but I couldn't see my brother at all.

258
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,786
Every time I tried to go and look for him,
my friends would always stop me from doing so.

259
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:19,136
What I didn't know was that my brother
had been turned into an experimental subject.

260
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,109
My brother's special ability was
to make air vibrate to his will.

261
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:30,332
He used that ability during a live performance
to change the sound of his guitar in unusual ways.

262
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,974
That's how they found him.

263
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:37,507
Scientists believed that my brother's ability
could be harnessed to disrupt communications

264
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,261
or even jack the airwaves if focused correctly.

265
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:44,653
A year later, I was finally allowed to see my brother,

266
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,646
but he was no longer the big brother I remembered.

267
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,241
He couldn't even recognize that I was his little sister.

268
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,946
His memories were gone.

269
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,189
The classmates that had been
keeping me away from my brother

270
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:00,887
were placed around me by the
scientists to pretend to be my friends.

271
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:06,235
The reason they were examining me every day
was because, if one sibling has an ability,

272
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:08,790
chances are that the other one will, too.

273
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:11,282
And that was the only reason.

274
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:15,483
I swore that I wouldn't trust anyone ever again.

275
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:18,673
I snuck out of that school.

276
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:24,170
What happened after you left there?

277
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:28,806
I met the one person I could truly trust,
and that's how I'm here now.

278
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:30,337
That person is...?

279
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,209
Oh. We're getting off here.

280
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,785
I'm Nao Tomori. I'm here to see my brother.

281
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,689
So her first name is "Nao."

282
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,943
He's in room 12. Go ahead.

283
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:49,562
Think it would be OK if I took him outside?

284
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,502
As long as you keep to our grounds, no problem.

285
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:53,867
Thank you so much.

286
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:56,859
This way.

287
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:00,731
He's here.

288
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,619
Hmm?

289
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:17,037
Guess the painkillers have worn off again.

290
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:18,630
Your brother.

291
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,787
What in the world is he doing?

292
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:21,978
He's composing.

293
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:25,875
My brother thinks that he's actually playing a guitar.

294
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,382
All of those grunts and groans you hear
is him singing the main melody.

295
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:32,819
Oh!

296
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,709
Oh, man. He ruined another comforter.

297
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:41,363
Would you like to go outside?

298
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:44,114
It's the time of day when you see the best scenery.

299
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:53,538
It's amazing.

300
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,229
Isn't it, though?

301
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:01,070
Yeah.

302
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,999
But an environment this special,
how in the world did you pull it off?

303
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:08,043
It's all thanks to the one person I can trust.

304
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,337
He transferred my brother to the hospital
in this beautiful place free of charge.

305
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:17,027
There's actually someone out there that generous?

306
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:22,559
He shows no interest at all.

307
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:26,604
But maybe someday someone will come up
with a miracle drug that can cure this.

308
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:30,009
Nobody is doing research on
how to save patients like this.

309
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:31,366
Well, why not?

310
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:36,300
For the scientists, people that
have abilities are just like batteries.

311
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:40,291
If one runs out of power, they
can just experiment with another.

312
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:44,367
There's no incentive for them to help
the test subjects that end up like this.

313
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:45,731
I'm stunned.

314
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,842
We don't know whether or not something
will happen to us tomorrow, either.

315
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:51,634
Now you're just talking crazy.

316
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:54,629
How about you choose your words carefully?

317
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,383
Sorry.

318
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,630
Well then, let's go back.

319
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,991
You're really having a hard
time with all this, aren't you?

320
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,419
You're sympathizing?

321
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:08,919
Well, stop that. You're nothing but a dishonest cheater.

322
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:11,395
She's right.

323
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,877
This is unlike me.

324
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:15,758
I'm home.

325
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:21,379
I didn't think the student council
would be something that keeps me this busy.

326
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,760
Nothing I can do about it.

327
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:23,300
Huh?

328
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:26,038
Big Brother, you're part of the student council?

329
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,732
You mean I didn't tell you?

330
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,839
This is the first I'm hearing it!

331
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:34,708
In that case, you need to eat some of my special
rolling vegetable curry to renew your energy.

332
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:42,716
If I have a special ability, there is the
possibility that Ayumi will have one, too.

333
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,438
If I were to be captured, Ayumi
could end up just like Tomori.

334
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,575
It's done!

335
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:51,347
It looks great.

336
00:21:51,373 --> 00:21:52,849
I hope you really like it.

337
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,119
So sweet!

338
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:59,353
Uh, well, um, can it be that the
secret ingredient of this curry is...

339
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,442
Pizza sauce: The secret ingredient of our household!

340
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:09,773
Oh, man, this tastes no different
from all the omelet rice she's made.

341
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:13,043
Wow!

342
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,478
I guess it's your daily routine,
but hurry up and go to sleep.

343
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:21,361
I was able to see a comet today, so I'm
deeply moved and can go to sleep totally excited!

344
00:22:21,386 --> 00:22:22,941
That's pretty skillful of you.

345
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,385
But the comet that I really want
to see is a completely different one.

346
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:26,925
Oh?

347
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,572
A comet with a really long orbit!

348
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,111
What is that?

349
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:34,881
It's a comet that swings by us
only once every few centuries!

350
00:22:35,778 --> 00:22:37,719
They have comets like that, huh?
