1
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:04,817
So what is it you do on your days off?

2
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:06,634
How about some tea later today?

3
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:11,195
And it's really cute.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,592
Yusarin, you should go too!

5
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,513
Sure, that sounds good to me.

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:17,085
Aww, come on, how long are they gonna keep this up?

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,490
Can you blame them? Yusarin is a pop idol.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,325
This was bound to happen soon.

9
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,180
Huh? What's going on?

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,513
I think I might know, but it's
probably better if you don't.

11
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:18,851
First, for Rika!

12
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,239
Next, for Yuriko!

13
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,602
Group beating? Not cool.

14
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,538
Though I guess it's expected when she
does stuff like that without thinking.

15
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,156
So, uh, are you all right?

16
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:44,252
You were watching the whole time.

17
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,618
You tell me.

18
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:51,676
Oh. Our comrade is going to appear.

19
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,887
Oh, my gosh, what happened to you?

20
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,514
I just got beaten by a mob.

21
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,355
Are you all right? Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

22
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,029
I'm used to it, I'll be fine.

23
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,477
So, who are we going to pummel?

24
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:09,890
I'm not going. Too much of a hassle.

25
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,763
You're so boring.

26
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:20,067
The ability is... floating on air.

27
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,359
All right, we got this! Check it out!

28
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,883
A flying humanoid is found in Japan as well?

29
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:29,788
Are they saying that this black shadow is that person?

30
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:33,320
For the moment, it's only a
scoop in a small occult magazine.

31
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:36,979
But if we leave this alone, it will turn into a huge deal.

32
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:37,916
Let's go.

33
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,392
Where to?

34
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,695
Here, in the middle of the mountains.

35
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,347
This is just a hunch, but I think that's
where our target is practicing how to fly.

36
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:50,007
If we stake out that location,
they're bound to appear at some point.

37
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,435
Just how long of a stakeout are you thinking?

38
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:54,690
No clue. Until they show up.

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,863
Don't make Yusarin say something like that!

40
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,320
We could be in for a long haul,

41
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:01,812
so we should probably stock up at the supermarket first.

42
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:02,772
Seriously?

43
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:05,637
Um, can you go back to being sweet Yusa, please?

44
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,634
I don't like your tone, four‐eyes.

45
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,894
Give me one good reason why I should take orders from you!

46
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,562
'Cause you always end up like this.

47
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,204
Some team we've got. Just my luck.

48
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,791
All right, you guys, let's get going.

49
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:22,299
So is there a reason you're getting so much corn?

50
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:25,145
Because you can't have a barbecue without roasted corn.

51
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,117
Barbecue?

52
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,544
If you do that, they'll know that we're all out there.

53
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:32,616
True, but who's to say this person
won't decide to approach us on their own?

54
00:05:18,407 --> 00:04:32,611
True, but who's to say this person
won't decide to approach us on their own?

55
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:32,576
True, but who's to say this person
won't decide to approach us on their own?

56
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:35,299
Huh? Yeah, like that'll happen.

57
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:37,317
What else?

58
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,047
Steak meat, spare ribs, sausages.

59
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,886
OK, so now you're thinking only about meat.

60
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:44,879
Yeah, because meat is good.

61
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,498
Watch and learn.

62
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,986
Oh, shishito?

63
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,532
The spice gives a nice accent to flavors.

64
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:55,597
Fine, we'll get them, but they
better not touch my meat, OK?

65
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:58,873
Those two have been getting along
rather well lately, haven't they?

66
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:01,016
Hey, do you think they could be dating?

67
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,788
It hasn't been long since they first
met, so I don't think it's gone that far.

68
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,823
But they are a couple that's pleasant to watch.

69
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:11,204
Yeah. I think they're well‐suited for each other.

70
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:18,858
All alone with Yusarin! I'm so glad I'm alive!

71
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:26,451
All right, boys, you two get to
carry the tent and the barbecue grill.

72
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,663
Kurobane and I will carry all the food to the campsite.

73
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,917
Tent? You mean we're spending the night?

74
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:35,631
I told you, we're going to stay on
stakeout until our target shows up.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,153
Excuse me. I didn't bring a change of clothes, so, um...

76
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:41,232
You won't die if you wear the same thing.

77
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:43,510
Now let's go.

78
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,292
All right, we're here.

79
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,538
We should set up the tents before dark.

80
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,348
Right.

81
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,958
Careful. It's dangerous over there.

82
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,837
What is this?

83
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,249
The remnants of a well.

84
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:23,503
Why didn't you say anything about it earlier?

85
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,614
Well, if you fell, that would have been funny in a way.

86
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,397
Don't make jokes about life‐or‐death situations.

87
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:31,659
Why don't we set it up further that way?

88
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,524
Good call.

89
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:36,516
Don't worry. I'll plug up the big hole
just as soon as we're done setting up.

90
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,901
Sorry, there's a student council camp,

91
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,642
so I don't think I'll make it home tonight.

92
00:06:41,675 --> 00:06:44,495
You can't come home? It's awfully sudden.

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,627
That's right. That's why I'm sorry.

94
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,460
Are you all right?

95
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:50,825
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. No worries.

96
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:51,611
Later.

97
00:06:51,731 --> 00:06:52,508
Roger that.

98
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:58,512
This could be useful.

99
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,956
Don't use me as a lighter. I am not a camping kit.

100
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,058
What are you thinking?

101
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:08,470
This makes us stand out way too much.

102
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,399
Roasted corn is so delicious!

103
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:15,623
OK, come on, everyone, eat up.

104
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,170
I guess she can have this.

105
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:20,512
What just...?

106
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,643
Here, have some roasted corn, Yusa!

107
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:24,667
Thank you so much!

108
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,611
Oh, my! Tasty!

109
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,096
I know, right?

110
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,911
When it comes to roasted corn, I'm your girl.

111
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,847
We'll have meat soon!

112
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,363
Mmm. Eat vegetables, too.

113
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,379
Spare ribs are so good!

114
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:41,540
The wieners are super juicy when you crunch into them!

115
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:42,935
Don't have just meat.

116
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,254
Sandwich some vegetables in the middle when you eat.

117
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:47,984
Oh! This meat is so delicious.

118
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,406
This sauce is the best!

119
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:53,468
And in the end, I'm the only one eating any vegetables.

120
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,682
So you only eat meat, too, just like my big sister.

121
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,445
Oh, is that so?

122
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:00,899
Yes, she was a very finicky eater.

123
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:06,318
She was? Hey, I'd be interested to know
what kind of person your big sister was to you.

124
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:07,936
Well, let's see.

125
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:12,275
Big sister and I have basically
polar opposite personalities.

126
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,047
She was such a tomboy that no boy in
the neighborhood could win against her.

127
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:18,754
But to me, she was a very kind big sister.

128
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,515
And I loved her exactly the way she was.

129
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,387
No matter what, I always tagged along behind her.

130
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,466
Oh! Sorry, I'm talking too much.

131
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:30,548
When it comes to my sister, I get so carried away.

132
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:34,504
No. I kind of understand how you feel, actually.

133
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,848
There are way too many enemies.

134
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,592
I think I'm in really big trouble.

135
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:45,029
Don't you worry, leave everything to the mighty Taka...

136
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:47,235
I don't need your stupid help!

137
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,973
That was my moment to shine!

138
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,997
You guys are completely
forgetting the reason why we're here.

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,521
Hold on... where?

140
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:10,969
Is there something wrong?

141
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,096
Well, um... no, nothing.

142
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,668
So, uh, what is that music?

143
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:17,644
You listen to it day in and day out.

144
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,317
This? It's a band called Zhiend.

145
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:23,635
Never heard of them.

146
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:25,371
My brother loved them.

147
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,863
Are you sure you're OK?

148
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:30,524
Yeah.

149
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,802
Mind if I listen to that for a bit?

150
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:46,874
Why...

151
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:50,252
I think I've felt this before.

152
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:54,758
How is it?

153
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:58,139
It's kind of strange.

154
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:01,819
I feel like I'm standing all alone in a vast, open space.

155
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,422
Ha‐ha! You understand it, don't you?

156
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:06,200
You are so on point.

157
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:10,966
The music Zhiend creates is incredibly
vast and downlight lonely‐feeling.

158
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:13,640
I believe it's because the vocalist,

159
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,696
who also composes the songs, is completely blind.

160
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:20,698
Her words paint scenery extending as far as you can go.

161
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,905
For now, I'm only recording this poor, misguided cheater,

162
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:28,588
but my dream is to film a Zhiend music video.

163
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:33,751
She's never had this expression before.

164
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:37,053
Of course, filming a documentary would be OK, too.

165
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,266
Yeah. Don’t film poor old me.

166
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,172
Just go ahead and film them if you want.

167
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:44,569
Don’t worry, I'm never gonna film you again, I promise.

168
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,811
Keep it. I'm giving it to you.

169
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,479
No way. I'd feel bad about it.

170
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:55,439
I have quite a bit saved up thanks to a few of our jobs.

171
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,312
I can just buy a new one, so don't worry about it.

172
00:10:58,727 --> 00:10:59,451
I see.

173
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,538
Then I'll take it.

174
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:02,608
Good.

175
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,774
Two will keep watch at a time.

176
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:09,346
We'll take shifts all the way until morning.

177
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,115
The boys will sleep four hours,
then switch places with us.

178
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,308
Hey, Otosaka. It's our turn now.

179
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:28,626
Hey, time to switch.

180
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:31,380
Oh, it's that time already?

181
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:35,187
This again. Who was that person?

182
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:43,098
Whoa! A trout! I caught a rainbow trout!

183
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:47,152
Damn it. I'll catch one bigger than
that. Trout, trout, come to me now!

184
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,534
I'm not going to lose either.

185
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,502
All right, got one!

186
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,422
Oh, wow, rainbow trout is tasty.

187
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,245
Yusarin, this one is cooked perfectly.

188
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,507
I'm not Yusarin!

189
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,816
But I guess I'll let her enjoy it.

190
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,393
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to eat it, Takajo?

191
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,291
I'm sure. It's all yours.

192
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,415
Whoa, so delicious!

193
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,376
Things like this are nice every so often.

194
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,075
Yes!

195
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:25,027
Is it me, or does she just want to play?

196
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:28,156
So, um, are we spending the night again?

197
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,014
Yes. Is there a problem with that?

198
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,338
I was thinking I'd like to take a bath today.

199
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,474
That's fine. I have one all ready.

200
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,045
Come on, I'll show you.

201
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:43,926
How nice.

202
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:45,316
Here's a towel and some soap.

203
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,078
You've got some nerve.

204
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:50,974
You set this up and just assumed I would jump right in.

205
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,585
I'll keep an eye out in case
the boys decide to try peeping. OK?

206
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,517
You said there was a bath all ready?

207
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,065
It's only for girls.

208
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:03,938
You boys can clean yourselves down at the river.

209
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,603
I can't bathe in the water that Yusarin has bathed in?!

210
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:07,414
Turnoff!

211
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,496
You don't look that ripped when you have clothes on.

212
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:19,012
Because of my ability, I had to train my body.

213
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:22,424
Regardless of how much armor
I would wear under my uniform,

214
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,687
I had to build a body that wouldn’t
get too injured when I teleported.

215
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,179
You did all that just so you
could properly use your ability?

216
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,774
Yes. But I doubt that I'll be the only one who does that.

217
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,615
What do you mean by that?

218
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:40,780
In the future, you may face a challenge that's beyond
your expectations and that forces you to make a change.

219
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,095
You never know.

220
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:47,498
Yeah. Because taking someone over
for only five seconds is so useful.

221
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,064
It's because you haven't...

222
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,286
Just forget I said anything.

223
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:55,096
What? Come on, now. You got me curious.

224
00:13:55,238 --> 00:13:59,666
With an attractive face like that, you
might have some issues dealing with the ladies.

225
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:02,191
Of course, just saying that gets under my skin.

226
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,794
You're telling me.

227
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:08,193
I was just dumped by an intelligent
and beautiful girl thanks to this ability.

228
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,510
A wise choice.

229
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:14,471
I think we should focus on love and romance
only after we are freed of these abilities.

230
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:17,422
How old do we need to be for them to be gone?

231
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,636
It should happen by the time we graduate high school.

232
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,009
Two more years. That's a long time.

233
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,093
Yes. For us, it is a very long time.

234
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:29,530
You know what? This is way too cold.

235
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:35,165
Ah, this feels good.

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,172
We'll sleep using the same rotation as yesterday.

237
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,656
Tomorrow is Monday, right?

238
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:45,489
Are we gonna go to school from here?

239
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:46,980
Haven't you been listening?

240
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,917
We're staking out until they show up.

241
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:50,329
This is ridiculous.

242
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,155
It feels like we're all trying
to live out here or something.

243
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,988
That's exactly what I'm after.

244
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:59,605
Besides, it's not like ditching class
will affect our school reports at all.

245
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,994
Even so, I'd like to go home at some point.

246
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,692
I have a younger sister.

247
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,359
Yes, I already know that.

248
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,803
Then I'll promise to be back in the morning.

249
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,954
Just let me go home.

250
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:13,653
I can't. If I allow that for you,
everyone else will say the same thing.

251
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,471
Besides, I think it'll be all right.

252
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,290
What will?

253
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:21,615
I'm sure everything will be squared away by tomorrow.

254
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,759
Man, I'm really sick of corn.

255
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,433
Excuse me.

256
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,425
What do you guys think you're doing all the way out here?

257
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,385
Someone really showed up. Is this the guy?

258
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,274
Well, we all met after running away from our homes.

259
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,313
We hit it off pretty well so we
decided to set up camp together.

260
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:44,415
Another obvious lie.

261
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,931
I take it, since you're camping,
that you intend to stay here.

262
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:50,455
Yes. We’re planning to stay here forever.

263
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:52,433
It's not like people will find us here.

264
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,370
Really? Well, I found you.

265
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,822
And I'm sure your parents are worried as well.

266
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,424
If you're thinking of calling the police,
you should know that they'll arrest you, too.

267
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,892
What for?

268
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:04,107
Simple. It's private property.

269
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:11,364
And then there's this. That’s you, isn't it?

270
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,721
What is that, a magazine?

271
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,428
A scoop article on you practicing flight.

272
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,170
You're joking.

273
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:21,717
It's too easy to get caught if
you practiced in public mountains.

274
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:25,661
But this place is private and conveniently
close to the boundary of Tokyo.

275
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:30,352
Normally, you'd be fine, but we
camped out and showed no sign of leaving.

276
00:16:30,663 --> 00:16:33,630
You got restless and decided to try and scare us off.

277
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,550
Once we were gone, you could
practice flying again in peace.

278
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,947
If you really believe that, you must be insane.

279
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:42,685
I'll call the police for you.

280
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:46,296
You're not very sane either if
you're coming out here all by yourself.

281
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,208
I came to pick some chestnuts.

282
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,518
There aren't any chestnuts this time of year.

283
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:55,192
And you can't deny that you were out
here because I already captured you on film.

284
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:56,618
How very sad for you.

285
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,468
You little brat! Give it to me now!

286
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:02,087
Yes!

287
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,730
You used the well to trap him?

288
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:10,213
Of course. If you fall into a hole that you
don't know the bottom of, you use your ability.

289
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:15,093
I put some hay at the bottom, just in case I was wrong.

290
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,654
But thanks to you, I have some
amazing footage for a scoop.

291
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:21,583
She set a trap out here and didn't even tell us about it?

292
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:23,568
She is just like the devil.

293
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,034
Give me the camera!

294
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:29,843
Otosaka, take over his body!

295
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,233
Then I'll defeat him using my teleport ability.

296
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,622
No way. That hurts every time I do it.

297
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,582
Damn it!

298
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:37,805
Thanks a lot.

299
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:40,986
He's escaping.

300
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:42,312
And so fast.

301
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:43,708
I have no choice.

302
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,015
I'm so high up!

303
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:04,847
I have to control it for now.

304
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,030
Stop... stop... stop!

305
00:18:07,217 --> 00:18:09,954
Stop!

306
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:15,458
You took such a reckless risk there.

307
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:19,163
I should have just taken him over
immediately instead of complaining.

308
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,543
What is this?

309
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,368
What just happened?

310
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:28,186
Well, a bruise or a broken bone for one.

311
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,599
You're pretty lucky.

312
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,416
My camcorder is fine, too.

313
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,345
It's a good thing you survived.

314
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:36,890
What the hell? Who are you guys?

315
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,454
We all have special abilities like you.

316
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:44,490
But these abilities are kind of like diseases
that only show up during adolescence.

317
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:45,601
They'll disappear,

318
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:50,117
but if someone finds out about you,
you'll turn into a guinea pig for scientists.

319
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:51,697
You don't want that, do you?

320
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:56,227
And what would happen if your ability
disappeared while you were flying?

321
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,894
You would fall to your death.

322
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:00,704
Is this something to risk your life over?

323
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,356
Misa, if you would, please.

324
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:04,753
Of course.

325
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,555
I see.

326
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:11,735
I thought that this power to fly
was something granted just to me.

327
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,545
But I guess there are others, too.

328
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:15,164
What a bummer.

329
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,561
I wanted to fry freely someday.

330
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,445
I even had a dream of becoming "Sky‐high Saito,"

331
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,120
the biggest star in Hollywood.

332
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,112
What a corny name?!

333
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,088
I understand the feeling,

334
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:28,348
but for the sake of your life and future,

335
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,301
please don't use your ability anymore.

336
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,436
I got it.

337
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,452
Thank you so much.

338
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:37,032
That ended peacefully.

339
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,167
Phew! That took so long.

340
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,342
Yeah. That's totally how I feel.

341
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:44,999
I'm back.

342
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,808
I didn't think the student
council was something this busy.

343
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,419
I can't help it.

344
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,205
I know you're very competent,

345
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:55,094
but are you being pulled all over the place?

346
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,356
It's really nothing that extravagant.

347
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,380
Well then, in honor of my big
brother and all of his hard work,

348
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:02,872
I have prepared a feast!

349
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:05,705
Chanpon noodles with lots of vegetables!

350
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:09,251
It's not red. This is... doable!

351
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:10,648
It's time to dig in.

352
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:11,467
It's time to eat.

353
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,635
At last!

354
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:17,059
So, how is it?

355
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,702
Delicious! So delicious it makes me cry!

356
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:23,646
Actually, I wanted to use the
pizza sauce as a secret ingredient,

357
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,519
but I only have a tiny bit left.

358
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:29,188
If you can make food that's
this delicious without pizza sauce,

359
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:31,293
can't you leave it out of all the other food, too?

360
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:35,854
The Otosaka pizza sauce secret recipe
needs to be handed down to the last generation.

361
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:38,616
But when I was about to go to the supermarket,

362
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,402
the security guard stopped me.

363
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,973
I couldn't buy the ingredients for it.

364
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,579
Nice security!

365
00:20:44,604 --> 00:20:47,540
This is the first thing that's made
me feel happy about moving here.

366
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:49,997
But this is delicious all on its own,

367
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:52,473
so you really don't need any secret ingredients.

368
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:55,061
If you say so. That saves me a lot.

369
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,260
Yes. I succeeded in getting rid of
that pizza sauce once and for all!

370
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,776
You really aren't feeling well, are you?

371
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:05,385
No, no. I'm totally fine now.

372
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:10,242
By the way, I had so many stories that I wanted
you to hear while you were gone, Big Brother.

373
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,792
Yeah? What stories?

374
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,529
For starters, I was suddenly asked out by
one of the boys in my class the other day.

375
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:17,998
What? And what did you do?

376
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:19,983
Oh, you know.

377
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,324
Oh, don't give me that.

378
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:24,277
I politely declined the offer.

379
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:28,817
Oh, man, that could have been a pivotal
moment that would have changed your entire life.

380
00:21:28,928 --> 00:21:30,943
Aww. What do you mean, Big Brother?

381
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:33,268
Do you want me to have a boyfriend or something?

382
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:35,974
It depends on the guy.

383
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,853
It's gonna have to be someone better than my big brother.

384
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,075
Someone like that is a rarity.

385
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,041
You're right.

386
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:46,504
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,580
You might have a cold or something.

388
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:52,493
A fever. How is your appetite?

389
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:56,169
It's OK. I can finish eating all of this, no problem.

390
00:21:56,538 --> 00:22:00,208
37.8°. You totally have a cold.

391
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:02,760
After your body is warmed up from your bath,

392
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,537
you need to crawl right into your bed.

393
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:06,299
Right. Roger that.

394
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,524
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,222
Can you fall asleep like this?

396
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,738
I'll be all right. Don't you worry.

397
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:15,699
OK. Sleep tight, Ayumi.

398
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:16,968
Good night.

399
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,802
Good night. Sweet dreams.

400
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:28,810
Well, if she stays put, she should be all right.
