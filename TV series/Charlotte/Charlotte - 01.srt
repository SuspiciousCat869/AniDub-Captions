1
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,697
Since I was little, I've had a question in my mind.

2
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:23,799
Why am I only myself, and not someone else?

3
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:29,909
I'm aware that "I think, therefore I am"
are the words of a great ancient philosopher,

4
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,605
but when I thought, I thought about someone else,

5
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,120
that perhaps the other person was myself, too.

6
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,181
"Think about others." When I did
that, I turned into someone else.

7
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,823
But for no more than five seconds.

8
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:12,798
Furthermore, for the duration, my body completely
loses consciousness and just collapsed wherever I stood.

9
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,761
I often found myself injured in some way.

10
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:19,595
And I could only possess someone
that was within my line of sight,

11
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,872
So, I couldn't use it for lewd things.

12
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,422
I mostly possessed people who pissed me off,

13
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:27,021
picked a fight with a stranger, and returned to myself.

14
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,353
That kind of retaliation was all I could use this for.

15
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,965
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

16
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:49,276
But finally, I came up with an brilliant idea
that can take full advantage of my special ability.

17
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:52,608
Hmm. You have five minutes left.

18
00:01:59,507 --> 00:02:02,459
I could possess one smart person in class after another,

19
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,939
memorize their answers, and fill
in my answers after returning...

20
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:22,303
Of course, I was planning on
attending a very prestigious high school.

21
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:27,962
However, unlike a normal test, I don't know
who is intelligent during an entrance exam...

22
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,473
And so I snuck into top‐rated cram schools,

23
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,977
one after another, pretending to be
one of the students attending there.

24
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:41,662
Which students applied to which schools
and which subjects were they best at?

25
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,691
I researched all of that thoroughly.

26
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:49,339
I found one student after another
vying to enter the same school I was.

27
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:51,447
That I could possess and take answers from.

28
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,042
And I was admitted to an elite high school.

29
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,746
Now a word from the representative for new students.

30
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,891
Yu Otosaka, please come on.

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,383
Yes!

32
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:04,517
So that means he's the very top of the class!

33
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:05,991
And he's good-looking, too!

34
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:17,905
Today, for us new students, you have
organized a grand ceremony to welcome us here,

35
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,740
and we are deeply grateful.

36
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,418
Wrapped in the warm rays of the spring sunshine,

37
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:26,040
we are now able to be a part of the
well-established ranks of Hinomori High School.

38
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:27,982
He is really good-looking, isn't it?

39
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,374
Yeah, he might even be your type.

40
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:35,245
My type, huh? Well, I think you
think he might be your type, too!

41
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:40,760
On behalf of all of us, thank you for the opportunity.

42
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:01,315
This again...

43
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,718
This is happening more and more often.

44
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,587
Not only am I at the top of the class academically,

45
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,396
I'm one of the more attractive.

46
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:10,443
It's impossible to not be popular.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,725
Sheesh! I'll just hurry them all on home.

48
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,134
I'm sorry for calling you over all the way out here!

49
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:20,558
Don't worry about it. So what did you want from me?

50
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,503
I, um... I'm fine starting as just friends.

51
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,210
But can you maybe think about dating me, please?

52
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:32,868
The thing is, in order to keep
my grades up at where they are now,

53
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,538
I have to shave time from sleep to keep studying.

54
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:39,551
I don't have the luxury of relationships. So... I'm sorry.

55
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:45,305
Of course that's a pack of
lies. I don't study at all, ever.

56
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:52,067
Oh, I see, I understand. I'm sorry for
calling you out like this so suddenly!

57
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:57,484
There's no way I would ever
choose a plain, normal girl like you.

58
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,956
The one I'm after...

59
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,089
You mean you didn't watch that
TV special last night? Huh‐uh.

60
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,946
...is the madonna of this school, of course.

61
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,905
Yumi Shirayanagi.

62
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,786
I will make... you mine!

63
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,096
I know I'll definitely get a chance.

64
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:21,394
It all lies in how I use the five
seconds, which are the limits of my ability!

65
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:22,518
It was so hard to get up!

66
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:25,810
That's it!

67
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:27,955
So then I... ‐Huh?

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,475
Mitchon, what's the matter?

69
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,578
Did you see that? She almost got run over.

70
00:05:54,222 --> 00:05:55,690
Looks like the airbag saved him.

71
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm so glad...

72
00:05:58,134 --> 00:06:00,738
That was close, but that went according to plan...

73
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:02,538
Oh, Yumi!

74
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,087
Are you all right?

75
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,910
Yeah, that was really a close one.

76
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:12,532
Yumi, you were about to be run over by a truck.
Otosaka from class one ran out and saved you.

77
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,548
Really? Is that true?

78
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,992
Yeah. Are you hurt at all?

79
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:21,072
Let's go to the nurse. Can you walk?

80
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:23,988
Yes...

81
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,631
Well, guess I'll go home.

82
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,414
Please wait a minute!

83
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:31,845
U-Um...

84
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,398
Um, you see, the two of us,

85
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:39,318
we're just about to walk over to our favorite
restaurant to eat our favorite pancakes together.

86
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,294
Would you like to come with us?

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,458
Sorry, I think I'm gonna pass. It's
better to keep this among friends?

88
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,947
But you just put yourself in
danger in order to save my life.

89
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,485
I'd like to properly repay that, and I'd
like to talk with you a little while longer...

90
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,135
Whoa, I have a phone call. Who is it?

91
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,536
Huh? Then, I'll go home right away.

92
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,913
Mitchon, what's the matter?

93
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:07,268
My big brother suddenly came back from Kyoto,

94
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,969
and he apparently ordered
top‐end sushi for the whole family.

95
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:12,970
So, I'm leaving the rest to you two! Bye!

96
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:17,224
That was an obvious farce, but a
nice assist nonetheless, Mitchon!

97
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:23,244
Enjoy your meal.

98
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,514
Wait a sec, there's a special way to eat this.

99
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,276
Oh?

100
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:31,800
Just copy me.

101
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:35,823
If you do this, the syrup gets across to the entire thing.

102
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:39,608
Then, stack them up, cut them up, and try a bite of it.

103
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:52,749
Amazing! Just by changing how you eat
it, it gets this delicious? I never realize!

104
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:58,131
It's delicious every single time.

105
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:00,728
Oh, um...

106
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,618
The song they're playing right now is Haro-haro, isn't it?

107
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,513
Huh? Haro-haro?

108
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:11,305
You look like you've never heard of them. I
thought every boy our age knew them really well.

109
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,506
So that's what's popular nowadays?

110
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:20,777
Otosaka, can we walk home together after
school or go out to eat like this again sometime?

111
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,983
Hmm... Sure, I guess. Why not?

112
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,209
I'm so glad...

113
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,194
I shouldn't do this out loud.

114
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:45,958
I'll hurry on over.

115
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:51,751
Yu Otosaka from class 1-1, please report
immediately to the student council room. I repeat...

116
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:52,571
What's this?

117
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:56,877
Yu Otosaka from class 1-1, please report
immediately to the student council room.

118
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,783
I'm Student Council President Omura.

119
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:05,938
What is it you want with me? I'm making someone
wait, so I'm hoping you can make this quick.

120
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,669
That is completely up to you.

121
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:12,485
This is an exact copy of your answer sheet
to the aptitude test you took the other day.

122
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:14,491
You managed a perfect score.

123
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,824
The same test has been placed right there.

124
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:20,206
Right here and now, try to get a perfect score again.

125
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,134
Huh?

126
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,215
Why do I have to take it again?

127
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,737
You've been accused of possibly cheating on the exam.

128
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:30,806
If you score 90% or above, you're
innocent. If not, you're guilty.

129
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,418
This is ridiculous. I'm leaving now.

130
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:37,186
Regarding this, we have the support of
both the principal and the vice‐principal.

131
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,678
If you leave now, you will be expelled from school.

132
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:43,008
E-Expelled?!

133
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,854
Now, please begin.

134
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,809
All of the answers are right there.

135
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:57,809
I'll just possess him and find
out what they are. It's the only way.

136
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,198
He's making a fool of me!

137
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,710
What in the world just happened?

138
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:13,797
I don't know. It seemed like you
were just tearing whatever that was up.

139
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,862
We got enough.

140
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:22,604
I'm Tomori, student council
president. Of another school, though.

141
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:25,516
So, I've been recording you since you got here.

142
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,993
Please take a look at the video I just recorded.

143
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:29,688
And take a note of the time.

144
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,358
You were not looking at Omura the
moment he ripped up the answer sheet.

145
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,392
Yet, you said he ripped it up.

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,249
Isn't that a bit strange?

147
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,130
I'll show you others.

148
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:43,594
You have a special ability to possess other people.

149
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,688
Using that, you cheat on every exam.

150
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,665
Isn't that right?

151
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:53,038
T-That's not true! It's a sleeping disease!

152
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:56,665
I suddenly get tremendously sleepy,
and can't fight that urge to nod off!

153
00:10:57,137 --> 00:11:01,086
You really are troublesome.
I'll show you this, then. Look.

154
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:03,898
A copy of a recent medical exam.

155
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:07,748
According to this, you have no disease.

156
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,509
Now, please solve the problems on the test.

157
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,565
I can't deal with this! Leave me alone!

158
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:24,313
There he goes. She even foresaw
that things would end up this way.

159
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:28,701
Huh? Well then. Everything from here on is my job.

160
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,570
Start running! Right now!

161
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,152
Dammit!

162
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,712
Are you injured?

163
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,474
No, I'm fine, but what's wrong with him?

164
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:21,995
What?

165
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,321
What the hell is going on here?!

166
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,001
What the hell? What did you just do?

167
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:25,756
That was teleportation.

168
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,293
Teleportation?

169
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:31,567
Yes. Just like it sounds, I
instantly move to another location.

170
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,005
Only I can't stop where I want.

171
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:38,663
Thanks to my special ability, I don't
know how many times I've been hospitalized.

172
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,720
What a half‐assed ability.

173
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:44,421
So, anyway, what are you planning on doing with me now?

174
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,745
We are having you transferred over to our school.

175
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,034
Transfer?!

176
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:56,965
In this world, there are many people who
possess special powers, You're not the only one.

177
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,726
What?

178
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:02,725
But those powers are somewhat like an illness
caught during adolescence and will disappear in due time.

179
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:08,399
Until it goes away, you will attend
classes at the Hoshinoumi Academy with us.

180
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,058
Huh?!

181
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,345
I already have permission from those
that have parental authority over you.

182
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,933
You mean all this is...? Is real.

183
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,406
I gotta say, you seem like you'd
be popular from just your good looks.

184
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:22,992
Did you really need to play the
genius by cheating as much as possible?

185
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:25,139
That's the real question here, isn't it?

186
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:29,348
But, thanks to that, you were able to get
close to that female student you were targeting.

187
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,238
Damn you!

188
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,989
What the...? She disappeared?

189
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:48,346
That is her special ability.

190
00:14:48,592 --> 00:14:50,015
It can't be.

191
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,998
How can you just become invisible?

192
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:58,062
Actually, to me it looks like you simply
stood there and let her punch you in the face.

193
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:01,408
No way. I was the only one that couldn't see her?

194
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,177
Right.

195
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:06,357
Her ability is to hide from
visual recognition from one target.

196
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,103
Every other human can see her as normal.

197
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,175
Another half‐assed ability.

198
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:16,318
By the way, you will be expected to
serve on our student council as well.

199
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,031
Huh?

200
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:20,755
Your ability is useful, so I'd
like for you to cooperate with us.

201
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,307
To do what?

202
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:26,814
To threaten those that abuse their
powers for no good, just like you have.

203
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:30,728
Because that is the kind of existence we are.

204
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm home.

205
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,881
Oh, hi! Welcome back home, Big Brother.

206
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:40,333
Wow! What's wrong with your face?

207
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:44,409
Oh, well, I, um, had an accident in gym class?

208
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:48,376
Oh, right, we got an amazing phone
call from our uncle while you were gone.

209
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:50,986
He said that you and I were
immediately going to be transferred

210
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:55,400
over to Hoshinoumi Academy's middle school
and high school as scholarship students.

211
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,603
Is that really true, Big Brother?

212
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,429
Are you serious?

213
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:00,897
Yes, it's true.

214
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,737
Yay! This will be great for the house budget!

215
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:07,769
And uncle is sending us lots of
tasty food so that we can celebrate.

216
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,636
But this means that you have to transfer schools.

217
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:13,036
You're gonna have to say goodbye to all your friends.

218
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:16,570
Yeah, but we can use smart phones
to video‐chat with one another,

219
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:19,118
so it's not going to be all that big a deal.

220
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:20,709
I see.

221
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,864
Tonight's dinner is gonna be... ta‐da!

222
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,825
Omelet rice: Your favorite dish, Big Brother Yu.

223
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,473
This again?

224
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:33,468
I've told her a million times,
it was only when I was little.

225
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,673
Congratulations to us. All right now, let's eat.

226
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,258
So sweet!

227
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,072
Using this pizza sauce as the secret ingredient

228
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:47,223
must have been fitting for my
tongue when I was just a little child.

229
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:50,581
How is it? Is it tasty? Yeah, it's tasty.

230
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:51,935
Wow, really?

231
00:16:52,268 --> 00:16:55,919
It's the first time I've wanted
to eat Mom's omelet rice in a while.

232
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:57,727
Our mom, huh?

233
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,758
Why would I even care about someone like that?

234
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:02,473
Are you still upset?

235
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,099
Yeah, of course I am.

236
00:17:04,243 --> 00:17:07,563
She selfishly divorced and
shoved custody over to our uncle.

237
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:12,354
I don't understand much of it, but I
really wish you could be more forgiving.

238
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,317
We don't have parents anymore.

239
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,556
Our only family is you and me.

240
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,620
I see.

241
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:22,143
But do you want to know what I sometimes think?

242
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:25,714
That there is one more family member out there somewhere.

243
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:28,007
You and I are the only siblings we have.

244
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,372
Are you seeing someone in your dreams?

245
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,823
Hmm, you're right.

246
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:36,212
But... it's a really weird feeling,
as if it was actually true.

247
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,664
It's totally a dream.

248
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,949
Hey, we've got to be up really early to move.

249
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,315
You should go get some sleep.

250
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:49,869
Oh, can't I have just a bit more time, please?

251
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,196
Ayu, you really love stars, don't you?

252
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,619
You can see way off into the distance,
where people will never reach, you know.

253
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:01,016
I just think that, well, that it's an amazing thing.

254
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,485
You know, if you keep talking only about
the stars at school, you'll end up isolated.

255
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,268
Really? Why is that?

256
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:11,972
In my experience, a better strategy
is to try and liven up the conversation,

257
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:15,026
by talking about movies and TV shows instead of the stars.

258
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,772
Experience? Strategy?

259
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,719
It's OK if you don't get it. Go to sleep soon.

260
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,071
Roger that.

261
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:38,332
Whoa!

262
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,559
Wow!

263
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:45,551
This is an amazingly huge room!

264
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:49,596
Will you and I really be able to
use all this space alone, Big Brother?

265
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:52,607
Uh, yeah. Thank you for your hard work.

266
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,451
I may not be much, but please allow me to help.

267
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,497
Hey, just let the moving company guys do it, OK?

268
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:01,387
Well, I thought that I could at least be a little bit of help.

269
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,720
But I shouldn't?

270
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:04,557
Don't take their jobs away from them.

271
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:07,409
Oh, what an amazing way to look at this.

272
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,101
I never would have thought of that.

273
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,365
So, what was going on with you the other day?

274
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,235
That's something I can't say.

275
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:20,195
Anyway, I'm going to have to transfer
over to Hoshinoumi Academy immediately.

276
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,275
Huh? I can't tell you why.

277
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,154
It's kind of complicated. I'm sorry.

278
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,855
Until this ability goes away,

279
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,163
I can't be authorized to travel to an area unsupervised.

280
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,609
If you could come out there to see me
once in a while, that would be great.

281
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,186
Yeah, but that's just so far away.

282
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:41,435
Maybe you can come here every so often and see me instead?

283
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,729
'Fraid not. I'm really sorry,
but I can't come on my own anymore.

284
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,848
But why?

285
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:49,237
I'm not allowed to tell you that.

286
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,935
I'm forced to not mention
anything about any of this to others.

287
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,429
There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.

288
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,507
I'm very grateful for what you've done.

289
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,374
That feeling will never leave me.

290
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:04,890
However, the fact is that you and I aren't dating yet,

291
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,136
so for me to chase you in a one‐sided way like that

292
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,326
would make me feel like some kind of stalker.

293
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:12,294
I really do feel bad about that.

294
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:15,257
But I can't come see you on my own.

295
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,868
I understand.

296
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:21,432
From now on, let us walk our own separate ways.

297
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:22,618
What? But that means...?

298
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,339
I will never forget the feeling I have towards you.

299
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:28,877
You saved my life that day,
and I will forever be grateful.

300
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:30,274
And that is all.

301
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:31,488
This can't...

302
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:35,214
Thank you very much for saving me like you did.

303
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,175
I really do appreciate it.

304
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,907
But this is where I bid you a fond farewell.

305
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,510
Best of luck to you.

306
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:46,931
I got dumped!?

307
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,383
Me?

308
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:52,954
Hello?

309
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:56,177
Excuse me, I let myself in.

310
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,126
Why are you suddenly here?

311
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,779
It's tough with just two of you.

312
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,555
We came here to help out.

313
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,128
Oh, hi.

314
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:07,238
Are all of you from the same
high school as my big brother?

315
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:09,402
Yes. We're in the student council.

316
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,632
My name is Takajo and this is Tomori.

317
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:16,466
Since it's after school now, we thought
we should stop by and see if we could help.

318
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:17,935
You shouldn't have bothered.

319
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,800
Can we help you out, please?

320
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,284
Of course, we'd love to have your help.

321
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:23,487
Hmm.

322
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:26,109
Yeah, petty cunning.

323
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,479
So let's split up and get things done.

324
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:29,563
Right!

325
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:32,193
Thank you so much.

326
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:41,990
Huh? This must be that tasty food our uncle sent
to congratulate us that Ayumi was talking about.

327
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,472
Whaaa...?

328
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:49,515
It's all instant ramen?!

329
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,389
I'll pretend I never saw this.

330
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:55,516
Ayumi, can I show you a magic trick?

331
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,595
Oh. Yeah, Tomori. I'd love to see one.

332
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,667
Now, stay right there. I'll be back in just a second.

333
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,238
OK. What?

334
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:06,590
Huh?

335
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,483
That was amazing!

336
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:13,551
Even more amazing than the people who are on TV.

337
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:15,884
Did you enjoy that?

338
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:17,840
Don't use her ability to mess around.

339
00:22:17,865 --> 00:22:19,951
You wowed her out of her senses.

340
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:22,076
If you're going to play, you have to go home.

341
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:25,337
All right, fine. Your big brother is scary.

342
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,879
Well, at least I appreciate you helping us.

343
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:32,551
I guess it's time for us to excuse ourselves.

344
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,763
You're going home?

345
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,818
But I'm going to make dinner and
I'd love it if you two would stay.

346
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,548
We don't have enough dishes.

347
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,413
Right, if he says so. Oh!

348
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,088
It's all right, 'cause we'll meet again.

349
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:46,982
Hmm.

350
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:55,008
Oh! "How‐Low‐Hello."

351
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,493
So it is a fad after all.

352
00:22:57,518 --> 00:23:01,351
Ah, that's right! Yusa Nishimori, Yusarin.

353
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,172
I think she's so cute.

354
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,789
That something like this sells
is a sign of the apocalypse.

355
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,718
You know what, Big Brother?

356
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:16,312
My new school is literally right next to yours,
so I think that we should walk together.

357
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:18,618
People might think I have a thing for my sister.

358
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,949
A thing for me? You brought me a present?

359
00:23:20,974 --> 00:23:21,956
What? No.

360
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:24,284
Hoshinoumi, sea of stars.

361
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:26,974
What an absolutely wonderful name for a school.

362
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:31,744
Yeah. It's a name that sounds like
it was created with only you in mind.

363
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:39,166
Hey.

364
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,450
That night, I had a dream.

365
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm sure it was because of
Ayumi's far‐fetched announcement.

366
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:56,129
But... who was that?
