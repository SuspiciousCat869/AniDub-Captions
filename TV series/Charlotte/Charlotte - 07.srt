1
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,178
Doctor!

2
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:14,098
Doctor!

3
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,278
How are you feeling?

4
00:00:24,794 --> 00:00:27,047
Ayumi. My little sister!

5
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:29,967
I'm terribly sorry. She didn't make it.

6
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,596
I'm Detective Someda.

7
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:40,269
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:44,358
I'd like to work with you so we can
figure out what really happened at the school.

9
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:46,882
I heard that you were at the scene...

10
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:52,745
Are you all right?

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,538
I'm sure this has been rough for you.

12
00:00:56,094 --> 00:01:00,010
But for her sake, you have to keep moving
forward with your life, you understand?

13
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,518
There are many things in this world that time solves.

14
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,629
But it won't solve everything.

15
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,515
Did I do...

16
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,783
even one thing for her?

17
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:34,203
Was I able... to repay her?

18
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,291
No. I didn't repay her at all.

19
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:41,730
Nothing.

20
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,952
I never thought she could be gone this quickly.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,241
It just didn't seem possible.

22
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:55,115
Even if I wanted to repay, I couldn't.

23
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,288
I'll never get another chance.

24
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,214
Was there anything left?

25
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,603
The love letters just keep pouring in.

26
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,953
In your dreams, maybe. Be honest.

27
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:15,584
The last piece of fan mail you
got was from your mother, wasn't it?

28
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,764
Actually, she sent hate mail.

29
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,283
Accepting enrollment at Shinkou Seminars now.

30
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,232
Let's move on.

31
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,116
The flavor of instant noodles...

32
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,577
Uh, yuzu pepper!

33
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,413
What's?

34
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:26,499
Correct!

35
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,694
The entire question was this:

36
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:32,954
We were in studios,

37
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:37,207
what is the best ingredient that can be added
to enhance this incredible flavor to be its best?

38
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,512
Otosaka!

39
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:45,127
Otosaka, if you haven't eaten yet,
would you like to have dinner with us?

40
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:48,595
I brought some. It's my special homemade cream stew.

41
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,561
Come on, you can't turn down something like that.

42
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,387
I don't want any.

43
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:59,191
Well, what should we do?

44
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:00,345
Let's look again.

45
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:04,266
Darn it, I think he went back already.

46
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,611
It was going to be mine!

47
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:14,000
Now Yusarin's cream stew is ruined!

48
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,098
You creeper!

49
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,891
Look, I'll have Yusa make you as much as you want.

50
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,308
All you have to do is break the door with your ability.

51
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:24,332
I can break fortified glass,
sure, but this door is too thick.

52
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:28,249
Due to security reasons, it's made
a lot sturdier than normal condos.

53
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,622
You're so damn useless.

54
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,678
Even if I burn the door, nothing will come of it.

55
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:39,104
I don't know what to do in this situation.

56
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,742
I get what he must be feeling now.

57
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,128
Hell, I know it a lot better than most people.

58
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:47,240
What?

59
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:50,597
OK, so what happened here, exactly?

60
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,843
It seems that he needs a bit more time to heal.

61
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:57,623
I see. Then let's come back again later.

62
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,023
Excuse me.

63
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,309
Sorry to barge in without permission.

64
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:24,172
It's me, Shirayanagi.

65
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,157
Is he all right?

66
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,760
Yes. He seems OK to me.

67
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,966
All right, I'll leave him to you, then.

68
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:44,842
Who is it?

69
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,345
You saved me from a truck when we were classmates once.

70
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:51,432
So?

71
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,517
I heard that you haven't been to school ever since...

72
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,176
About your little sister, I'm terribly sorry.

73
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,096
I'm in no position to say this, but...

74
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,569
is there anything I can do?

75
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,261
No.

76
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,404
Anything is fine.

77
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:11,227
Please, Otosaka, I just want
to help you, if you'll let me.

78
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,576
Help me?

79
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:15,330
What makes you think that I need any help?

80
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,989
I'm totally fine.

81
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:18,600
There's no way that's true.

82
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:21,648
I mean, you've been eating nothing but instant noodles.

83
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,450
I like them, so it's OK.

84
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:27,617
Well, then... how about those pancakes we had together?

85
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:28,911
We could get them again.

86
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,568
Pancakes?

87
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,419
When did we eat that?

88
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:33,966
The day you saved me.

89
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,272
Instant noodles or pancakes.

90
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,494
Aren't they about the same nutrition‐wise?

91
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,129
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

92
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:46,734
But we could still go outside.

93
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,012
Right.

94
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,171
I'm glad.

95
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:53,782
Can you get me more instant noodles while you're out?

96
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,437
You’re running an errand for me, aren’t you?

97
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:00,127
Instant noodles. I don't care what kind.

98
00:08:00,152 --> 00:08:02,818
No, no. Otosaka, you're coming with me.

99
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,018
I don't feel like it.

100
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,153
I'll pay you back later, OK?

101
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,304
I won't go unless you do.

102
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,652
You won't go unless I go, huh?

103
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:14,335
Shirayanagi, was it?

104
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,240
Are you my legal guardian now?

105
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:19,549
No, I don't mean it like that at all.

106
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,617
But I am concerned for you right now.

107
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:23,823
So you won't do it?

108
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:24,855
No, I won't!

109
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:29,323
Look, Otosaka, it's important that you get outside a bit.

110
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:32,565
If you stay cooped up, you'll only drive yourself insane.

111
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,216
Like mentally ill?

112
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,287
Yes.

113
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:38,779
There's no chance of that at all.

114
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,549
I told you, I'm totally fine.

115
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:44,092
If you were, you wouldn't be living like this.

116
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,552
It just proves that you're depressed.

117
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,782
Who do you think you are?!

118
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,340
I never asked you to come here!

119
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:10,648
If you're not going to run errands for me, you can leave.

120
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:12,513
OK, I'll go.

121
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,291
I shouldn't have come here. I'm sorry.

122
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:28,927
I better stock up again.

123
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,988
I guess they're here to capture me by force.

124
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:42,210
Shirayanagi may have been acting because she was asked to,

125
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,115
which means it's time to make my exit.

126
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,524
I'll be out for a while.

127
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,848
If I have this much,

128
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:15,570
I'm sure I can live for a while without going back home.

129
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:24,202
I need to go somewhere far away so
that soggy freak show can't locate me.

130
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,980
This might be far enough for now.

131
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,905
I'm sick of noodles, so I guess I'll have some pizza.

132
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,638
What do you know? I gave them the slip.

133
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:14,948
Excuse me.

134
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:22,107
Your pizza and a salad.

135
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:26,843
Salad? Must be a free item. I'll pass.

136
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,003
So damn boring.

137
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,214
How many days has it been?

138
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,714
Nothing has gone on for this long.

139
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:47,868
I'm sure they won't find me.

140
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,614
I guess.

141
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,852
I'll go out for just a little bit.

142
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:20,988
Can I have that?

143
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,051
Sure thing.

144
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,083
It's good.

145
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:33,464
It's been a while since I had something sweet.

146
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,059
Watch your left. Your left!

147
00:12:36,084 --> 00:12:36,607
I got it!

148
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:38,676
Kick ass!

149
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:41,850
Never seen a game like that.

150
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,196
Now, this is fun!

151
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,729
Die! Die!

152
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,479
I'll kill every single one of you who gets in my way!

153
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,481
Die! I want you to die!

154
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,320
Eat my lead and like it!

155
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,312
Take this! Boo‐yah!

156
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,145
You've been playing for hours.

157
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:47,455
Get outta the way!

158
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:54,833
The hell. What'd you say? Trying to pick a fight?

159
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:57,770
What's up?

160
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:00,829
This punk hit me with trash and told me to move.

161
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,956
Who do you think you are, kid?

162
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:05,752
Just a normal, law‐abiding citizen.

163
00:14:05,842 --> 00:14:09,307
A law‐abiding citizen that assaults people with trash?

164
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,831
Yeah, it looked good on you.

165
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:12,133
Don’t mock us!

166
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:13,569
Take him outside.

167
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,873
Just remember, you asked for this.

168
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:24,056
Ready for some pain, hot‐shot?

169
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:28,106
You think you can beat me? Bring it.

170
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,848
I'll make sure you can't play games for a while.

171
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:39,841
You bastard! What do you think you're doing?

172
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,667
What the hell, I thought I punched this guy!

173
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:43,555
What's wrong?

174
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,747
You guys have a falling out? Kiss and make up.

175
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:08,234
What is this? What the hell is going on?

176
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,267
I still have one more left.

177
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,939
No, stop, stop!

178
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:31,503
Now you know how strong I am.

179
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:35,769
Next time you go against me, I won't hesitate to kill you.

180
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:36,404
Got it?

181
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:51,245
Yo. How's it going?

182
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:54,141
You're the punk that beat Gondo's gang all by himself?

183
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:58,189
Maybe. It's not like I stopped
to ask their names, you know.

184
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:01,532
Well, I'm Hosoyamada. Remember that.

185
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,429
I give it five seconds before I forget all about you.

186
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:07,048
You've got some balls, kid.

187
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,897
You should really learn some respect.

188
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:11,013
Give him his first lesson, boys.

189
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:16,837
What the hell are you doing?

190
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,881
It wasn't me!

191
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,765
You don't need this eye, right?

192
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:36,923
If I take it, you can call yourself something
cool like "One‐Eyed‐Hoso‐whatever."

193
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,542
You don't seem excited.

194
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,905
What's wrong, don't like the name?

195
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,741
Better choose!

196
00:16:45,324 --> 00:16:48,368
Fine! I give! Mercy!

197
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,306
The Hosoyamada lost?

198
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:53,512
Impossible.

199
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:10,521
Nobody can win against me.

200
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,577
Real fights are tons more fun than a stupid game.

201
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:30,858
What is this thing?

202
00:17:31,424 --> 00:17:33,001
Something important to you?

203
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,771
So that's how it is.

204
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,102
Hey wait... When did... when did you...?

205
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,284
The whole time.

206
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:10,856
The whole time?

207
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:20,069
It can't be.

208
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,228
If you keep following this path,

209
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:25,156
you'll lose your humanity and never get it back again.

210
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:26,730
That's why I stopped you.

211
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,568
Did somebody send you?

212
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,502
No. I'm on a leave of absence for now.

213
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:33,867
This is personal.

214
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,875
How so?

215
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,440
I feel responsible for this as well.

216
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,607
When you get down to it,

217
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,294
I might have made a bad call concerning Ayumi.

218
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:47,302
Maybe I should have quarantined her immediately.

219
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,842
At least then she would have been safe.

220
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,888
That's why I've decided to stick
with you until this is through

221
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,896
and you're back to normal.

222
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,387
This is none of your business! You owe me for that stuff!

223
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:04,141
Do you want to be done with your life?

224
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,427
Do you want to stop being human?

225
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:09,514
Then...

226
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,109
what am I supposed to do?

227
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:17,153
A fresh change of clothes would be a nice start.

228
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,947
But let's get some food for now.

229
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:24,710
A good meal is the foundation
of a healthy mood and lifestyle.

230
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,671
There's nothing wrong with what I've been eating.

231
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,431
Right, a diet of pizza and sweat
soy sauce mochi is so healthy.

232
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:34,010
It'll calm you down, at least.

233
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,986
What are you saying I should eat?

234
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,446
You just leave it to me.

235
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,961
I'll get it for you right away.

236
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,781
Hey, it's me.

237
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:42,615
Yes.

238
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,258
Thank you very much.

239
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,885
I didn't say for you to set something up for me!

240
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,166
Just take one bite.

241
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,563
After that, I swear we will have
nothing to do with each other again.

242
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,348
Just one bite, huh?

243
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,699
Then you'll leave me alone forever?

244
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:59,905
Yes, I promise.

245
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:01,675
Fine.

246
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:03,278
Good, then let's go.

247
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,302
That promise is absolute?

248
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,278
Right.

249
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:10,126
Takajo?

250
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,046
Yes. His family home.

251
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,395
Is this an ambush or something?

252
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,630
Nobody is here so you can relax.

253
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,086
Watch some TV or something.

254
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:21,856
What are you making me eat?

255
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:24,150
That's a surprise for you to see when it's finished.

256
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,222
I didn't know she was allergic.

257
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:27,035
Are you stupid?

258
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,752
It was a poison mushroom, idiot!

259
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,717
It grew naturally, out of the
ground. It couldn't be poison.

260
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,151
Here, it's done!

261
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:46,366
Here you go.

262
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,646
It's the same taste.

263
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,337
Glad I did it justice.

264
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,432
How?

265
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:05,054
Your mother left behind a big notebook full of recipes.

266
00:21:05,816 --> 00:21:07,634
I took the liberty of borrowing it.

267
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:12,110
The page with the omelet rice was the
only one with a big, flowery circle on it.

268
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:16,291
I have a feeling it was your
favorite food when you were a kid.

269
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,021
After your mother was no longer around,

270
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,392
I think Ayumi saw that and tried to
recreate the taste to make you happy.

271
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,066
So that was...

272
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:34,284
the last omelet rice.

273
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:38,959
Damn it.

274
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,451
It's sweet and it tastes so horrible.

275
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:43,819
Why am I eating it?

276
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:47,660
It's not healthy for you to scarf it down like that.

277
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,754
Just eat slowly and savor it.

278
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,708
OK.

279
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,299
Here. Have some tea.

280
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,370
And take this, too.

281
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:01,878
Hey, Tomori.

282
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:02,722
Yes?

283
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,810
What the hell am I supposed to do with myself now?

284
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:09,675
Well, you could always return to
the student council and help us out.

285
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:11,477
But that's not possible.

286
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:14,477
We promised we would never have
anything to do with each other.

287
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,977
Huh? What the heck are you talking about?

288
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:20,196
You said that's what would happen after I ate this.

289
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:24,452
Yeah, if you ate one bite, but you
scarfed it down like a hungry stray.

290
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:27,341
"Oh, wow, he must really wanna stay with me!"

291
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:30,188
That's what I kept thinking, at least.

292
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,775
Of course you did.

293
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:36,958
All right.

294
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,721
Student council it is.

295
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:40,689
I'm glad to hear it.
