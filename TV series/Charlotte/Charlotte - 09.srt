1
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:12,775
What is up with me? Why can't I just pick one?!

2
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:19,633
All right, I'll be going now, Ayumi.

3
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, hey, good morning.

4
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,671
Oh, right. Good morning.

5
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,100
Let's get going.

6
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,092
Over here.

7
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,461
We could get crepes, if you like.

8
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,731
Why are we going so early? The gig is tonight.

9
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,802
I wanna buy some of the band merch.

10
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:24,607
You can't do that after it's over?

11
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,694
Sure, but most of the popular stuff will be gone by then.

12
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,575
Guess that's how it goes.

13
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:32,458
I pegged you as a pretty hardcore fan girl.

14
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:35,161
I can't believe you didn't wanna meet Sala yesterday.

15
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,597
I don't have any desire to buy
t‐shirts, hoodies, or stuff like that.

16
00:02:39,823 --> 00:02:43,482
I want... their functional and
tricked‐out smartphone case.

17
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,507
It's got an internal battery and a
high‐quality linear PCM recorder.

18
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,372
OK, I get it. It sounds awesome.

19
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:51,920
But you don't want one.

20
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,580
If I did, we'd have a matching pair. You cool with that?

21
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,111
Oh, you're right.

22
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,921
Please make sure to not buy one.

23
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:02,604
Well, that was blunt. I don't know how to take it.

24
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,231
The line is huge.

25
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,144
Then we shouldn't waste time.

26
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,509
The line's over here!

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,487
Come on, let's go get in line.

28
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:12,228
But I'm not buying anything.

29
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,910
But you're still here with me.

30
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:17,093
I don't want to stand there with
no one to talk to. That's boring.

31
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:22,024
When we first met, I was sure she hated me.

32
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:24,723
But now... inviting me to gigs,

33
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,112
hanging out together.

34
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:27,308
I hope they don't sell out.

35
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,834
Why are we getting all friendly?

36
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,419
What's the matter?

37
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,879
Nothing. I was impressed by the line.

38
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,755
Well, yeah, they're loved the world over.

39
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:45,977
This venue is way too small for a band of their caliber.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,465
She really is an amazing person.

41
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,576
I got my case!

42
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,155
Look, isn't it epic? Check out the cool logo on the back.

43
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,586
Zhiend is such a figurative art.

44
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,641
Uh... yeah, that's for sure. It's awesome.

45
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,880
I know, right?

46
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,427
In the end, you are a fan girl.

47
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:08,737
It's so cool!

48
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:29,683
It's starting.

49
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:39,888
Lying before me.

50
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:47,021
Scene painted in green.

51
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,846
I was never found.

52
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:59,101
And I played hide and seek.

53
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,450
There remains a little scar.

54
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,374
On your face still facing down

55
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:07,235
to the ground.

56
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:09,191
You hold yourself.

57
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:13,389
And crouch like you've been wounded.

58
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:20,071
I adored the days When we just
want more things with no means.

59
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:25,263
Oh I adored when you were always just there for me

60
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,600
by my side.

61
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,355
What's this strange feeling I'm getting?

62
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:37,458
Next up, we have a special world première,

63
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,942
a song written just for you, Japan!

64
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:41,974
"Trigger"!

65
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:48,522
Come now heading to the oblivion.

66
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,379
To the darkness sink me.

67
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:53,537
Future is lonely as it seems to be.

68
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,554
And I am reaching from there.

69
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,125
I know this song... but this is my first time hearing it!

70
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:09,482
My mind is clear now

71
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:13,101
I feel like I can do anything.

72
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,347
When I want to do it, yeah.

73
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:19,546
I feel I'm notorious.

74
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:22,839
Do you know what you can handle?

75
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,144
Do you know me?

76
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:28,906
Spinning round and around going back and forth.

77
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:32,755
Will be here as an angel that's fallen deep.

78
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:36,160
See, there's the dark side waiting for me.

79
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,985
Never end forever.

80
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:42,172
Out on the rim no need to breathe...

81
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,460
What's the matter, Big Brother? You scared me!

82
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:56,615
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:59,258
I guess Zhiend's new song really got to me.

84
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,903
They're a pretty amazing band.

85
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,347
Their songs are just so powerful.

86
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,895
They stick, no matter what happens.

87
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:08,891
What about you?

88
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,907
How‐Low‐Hello was How‐Low‐Hello. Awesome as always.

89
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,018
It is time for dinner in D Block.

90
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,968
Oh, perfect timing. I'm starving!

91
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,705
It's this old man again.

92
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,078
Why is he here all the time?

93
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,602
Nothing beats classical.

94
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:35,544
There is no stagnation, like a mathematical formula.

95
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,624
That girl, is she your sister?

96
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,449
Yeah.

97
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:43,701
I see. I pity you, kid.

98
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,749
So there's a researcher that feels that way towards us?

99
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,765
Why are you here every day?

100
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:52,765
To get away for a bit.

101
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,697
As a researcher, my hypotheses
are often seen as extraordinary.

102
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,523
I come to lose myself in thought.

103
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,896
I see.

104
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,479
Are you familiar with the Ptolemaic theory, young man?

105
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:06,971
Well, I've heard of it, at least.

106
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,448
It's an extraordinary view by today's standards,

107
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,559
but back then it was the normal view.

108
00:08:13,418 --> 00:08:15,086
But reality was different.

109
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:19,044
What do you think happened to the
first person with a different view?

110
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:19,964
Dunno.

111
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,282
He was treated as a nonconformist

112
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,689
and was shunned by every one of his peers.

113
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,745
Just like I am now.

114
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:27,880
I see.

115
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,190
All right, we're gonna have curry today!

116
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,270
Yeah. Chockfull of chemicals that boost abilities again.

117
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:40,384
It'll taste like crappy medicine.

118
00:08:40,516 --> 00:08:45,816
Yeah, maybe, but I still think its tastiness will
make people happy and forget about all that stuff.

119
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,904
I wish Big Brother Shun was here, too.

120
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,681
It would be great to eat with him.

121
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,626
His unusual ability made him stand out way too much.

122
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:54,747
He just couldn't.

123
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,247
What was his ability again?

124
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,906
Traveling through time, or time leap.

125
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,088
That is so amazing!

126
00:09:02,414 --> 00:09:06,146
They decided his power was way too
strong so they're keeping him imprisoned.

127
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:10,297
Poor Big Brother Shun.

128
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:11,797
Yeah, you're right.

129
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:14,809
So we shouldn't talk about this ever again, understand?

130
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,872
Thank you for the food!

131
00:09:20,815 --> 00:09:22,920
Tastes like medicine as usual.

132
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:27,632
They think that my ability is merely
taking over someone's body for five seconds,

133
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:28,949
but there's more to it.

134
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,465
If they'd caught on to what my true ability is,

135
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,812
I'm sure they'd have taken my freedom away from me,

136
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,248
just like my big brother.

137
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,026
But if I keep getting tested like this,

138
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,827
they're bound to find out eventually.

139
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,935
Been a while. Stay still and quiet.

140
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:46,436
Kumagami, did something happen?

141
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,563
I've finally tracked down someone with telepathy.

142
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,205
What? Are you for real?

143
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,030
Yeah.

144
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,383
They can send and receive.

145
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:56,668
Amazing.

146
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,454
But they've already been caught, right?

147
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:00,883
Exactly.

148
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,327
First, you need to take over the
guy with the pompadour to your right.

149
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,652
I found him. His ability is pulverize,

150
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,430
but his power is limited.

151
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:10,675
Got it.

152
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:15,794
Good one.

153
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,030
Was that part of the trick?

154
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:20,341
Next is the location of the one with telepathy. Take this.

155
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,522
Just make sure to time it right.

156
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,395
You're the only hope we have now, understand?

157
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,032
If you fail, they will dispose of you,

158
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:30,206
and then they'll come for us.

159
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,802
Yeah. I know that.

160
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:39,803
Oh, man, is Kumagami really wasting
his time with that idiot right now?

161
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:42,695
Oh, you jealous, Shichino?

162
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,290
You know that's not it.

163
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:46,767
We've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

164
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,933
A situation like this is about the only thing

165
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,902
that will make his little brother serious.

166
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:54,255
No, man, he's just overly attached to his little sister.

167
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:57,628
He cares for his siblings. All we can do now is trust him.

168
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:01,472
I just wonder what our odds are of
actually winning this little gamble.

169
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,924
If it ain't 100%, I want no part of it.

170
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,868
There can't be any mistakes.

171
00:11:06,337 --> 00:11:10,121
Does that mean you're actually gonna
use your power to contribute to us somehow?

172
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:14,265
We've done our part and managed to find
someone with telepathy for the team, you know.

173
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:17,829
Like I've told you, I'm just waiting
for the perfect moment, OK?

174
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,788
So, it's never gonna happen then?

175
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:20,861
You piss me off.

176
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
Less chitchat, more eating.

177
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:26,662
Damn it. I hope this world changes.

178
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,043
I can't take it.

179
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:31,130
It's time now. Pack up.

180
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:35,059
Well, so much for smelling the air outside.

181
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,507
Excuse me.

182
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:40,404
Hey, you. Did you accept something from someone?

183
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,332
Not a thing.

184
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:46,976
Then you're fine.

185
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:49,706
I don't get it.

186
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,405
Why do they treat him differently?

187
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,619
He do something bad?

188
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,627
He's not as powerful as big brother,

189
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:57,332
but he has an ability that is pretty amazing.

190
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,971
All the plans for saving our brother are in place.

191
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,686
The only question now is when to go through with it.

192
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:17,308
That ends today's program.

193
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:21,982
All test subjects other than those called
over must return to their rooms immediately.

194
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,355
Cool. Guess we'll go back.

195
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,332
Oh, I nearly forgot. They called me over!

196
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,990
They what? Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

197
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:31,699
Go back, kid.

198
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,368
Wait!

199
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:36,677
This is absurd. My sister doesn't have abilities.

200
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,106
Why is she being called over?

201
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:39,971
Big Brother Yu!

202
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,306
Ayumi! An earthquake?

203
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,576
We have shut D Block down.

204
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:52,940
Please remain where you are until you receive...

205
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,326
What the hell's going on?

206
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,022
I repeat. We have shut...

207
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,047
I have a really bad feeling about this.

208
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,707
Come on, let me outta here! Hey!

209
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:04,704
Damn it!

210
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,093
It's you. What just happened?

211
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,807
Do you know where Ayumi is?

212
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,864
Your sister's dormant power was
prematurely forced into the open.

213
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,958
Her ability was collapse.

214
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,075
They shut D Block down because half of
it caved in when her ability was set free.

215
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,170
Is she OK?

216
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,210
She's fine.

217
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:42,591
But due to the unstable nature of her power,
they have her restrained at the moment.

218
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,131
Just like my big brother.

219
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:48,178
No. After they dissect her, they’ll get rid of her body.

220
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,131
You don't have time to stand here!

221
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,670
You can save her if you use the
true ability you've been hiding.

222
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:00,718
Plunder: The most powerful of abilities.

223
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:01,757
How do you know?

224
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:03,969
You don't have time for me to explain.

225
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,184
He's right. Just go.

226
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:10,892
All right.

227
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,003
And now they will dispose of me as well.

228
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,190
I'm going up against someone with telepathy.

229
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,310
Gotta be mindless, mindless, mindless!

230
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:31,847
Who is it?

231
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,712
That was in my head?

232
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:35,792
It's gotta be him, the telepath.

233
00:14:35,882 --> 00:14:37,196
What do you want with me?

234
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,522
I gotta see his face.

235
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:41,189
What about my face?

236
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,800
It's fine. I'm done here already.

237
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,233
What do you mean?

238
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,987
Hey, stop!

239
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:52,193
Excuse me, sir.

240
00:14:57,674 --> 00:15:01,572
So, uh, I don't need to erase this guy's memory, do I?

241
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:03,874
I hope that's the case...

242
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,051
What's going on?

243
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:08,297
Let me out! Let me out!

244
00:15:08,322 --> 00:15:09,583
Shutting down B Block!

245
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,710
I repeat: There is an emergency situation in D Block.

246
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,796
All employees arrange yourselves according...

247
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,659
Damn it! What's going on out there?

248
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,517
I don't care who it is, just tell me!

249
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,683
That voice. I can figure out the direction, too.

250
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:27,302
Big Brother, can you hear me? It's Yu!

251
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,525
Yu? You've taken that kind of power now?

252
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,554
If they find out, you're done for.

253
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,452
I didn't have a choice. They're about to dissect Ayumi!

254
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,055
Ayumi! What's she have?

255
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,904
An ability strong enough to destroy this place.

256
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:42,317
Her too, huh?

257
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,415
I'll save you, Big Brother,

258
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,296
so do your time leap and change this world for us.

259
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:49,573
How the hell are you gonna pull that off?

260
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:52,296
Damn, I just need light in my eyes.

261
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:54,947
What?

262
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,566
What's wrong?

263
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,882
Shichino.

264
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:04,842
Damn it.

265
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:08,159
Why do I have to do this for
a sister‐complex guy like you?

266
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,097
What the hell...

267
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,541
No time to explain!

268
00:16:11,093 --> 00:16:12,797
Take my power of permeation.

269
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:14,345
You sure?

270
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,017
I'm telling you, we don't have any time left.

271
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:20,739
I understand.

272
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:25,576
Don't make me regret this, OK?

273
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,899
I'm sorry, but I know my brother will change this world!

274
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,748
What the crap. What's going on here?

275
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,294
I'm so tired!

276
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,113
What's happening?

277
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,335
I got Shichino's ability too.

278
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,637
I'll be right there. Hold on!

279
00:16:58,724 --> 00:16:59,470
Finally!

280
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,098
Wish I could stay, Yu.

281
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,107
But I really don't have any time to waste.

282
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,674
I know. I'm leaving the rest up to you, Big Brother.

283
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,579
Yeah. For the future.

284
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:21,373
No, for every one of us.

285
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,726
I'm gonna change the world!

286
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:29,726
Kill him!

287
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,540
What is it with you and screaming?

288
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,104
Where are we?

289
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,385
A hospital. You collapsed during Zhiend's gig.

290
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:43,787
Do you remember that?

291
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:45,766
That's right.

292
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:47,390
Ayumi's gone.

293
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:50,091
Did you have a bad dream or something?

294
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:51,465
Dream?

295
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,266
Was what I saw really a dream?

296
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,493
No.

297
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:02,033
In the past, Ayumi had said that she felt
like we had one more member in our family.

298
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:04,644
It's best if you don't get up yet.

299
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,859
I think I might have a big brother.

300
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,081
In fact, I'm almost sure of it.

301
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,938
What?

302
00:18:10,477 --> 00:18:12,605
Oh. So you remember now.

303
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:20,340
Who are you?

304
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,093
I find people with special abilities.

305
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,216
Does this help at all?

306
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:26,256
Water boy!

307
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,440
You're pretty handsome when you're dry.

308
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,726
You were there, too, in my dream.

309
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,614
But this is the first time you've seen me like this.

310
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,725
Kumagami, you know all about my brother, don't you?

311
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,209
Yeah, I do.

312
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:42,297
Please, tell me everything!

313
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,684
Calm down. That's what I came here to do.

314
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,636
Come with me quietly,

315
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,803
and I swear all the questions you have will be answered.

316
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:54,482
After that, you'll rescue that sister of yours.

317
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,824
What did you say?

318
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,768
You're going to save your sister's life, simple as that,

319
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,077
Yu Otosaka.

320
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,674
But how can I save someone who's already dead?!

321
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:04,754
Remember your brother?

322
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,452
If you do, then you already
know what Shunsuke's ability is.

323
00:19:09,944 --> 00:19:10,809
Understood.

324
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,041
Just to clarify here, you mean the Shunsuke?

325
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,405
That's right.

326
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,509
Wait, you're kidding me. You're his little brother?

327
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,357
But you look nothing alike.

328
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:23,677
Does that really matter?

329
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,074
So, uh, can I go see him as well?

330
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,828
It's been a hot minute.

331
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,312
How do you know him?

332
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,033
He's the one that guided my path,

333
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,962
after my big brother became the way he is.

334
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:37,795
I met the one person I could truly trust,

335
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,216
and that's how I'm here now.

336
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,575
So she was talking about Shunsuke.

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,988
That's fine. Follow me.

338
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,115
Thank you very much.

339
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:03,776
We have to walk from here.

340
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:21,777
This is so cool!

341
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,235
Money is no object here.

342
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:28,139
What is this?

343
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,084
It's kind of an ability research center.

344
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,687
Didn't that start this mess in the first place?

345
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:34,806
Not so.

346
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,190
Stop yapping and follow me.

347
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,423
Incredible! Can I record this?

348
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,706
No, of course not.

349
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,515
Nuts!

350
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,627
Overkill much?

351
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:50,899
This is the last safe place we have.

352
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,200
So close. He's so close to me.

353
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:18,656
Been a while, little bro.

354
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:21,708
I brought him.

355
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,335
Yeah, thank you.

356
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:24,930
That's him?

357
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,160
For real?

358
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:30,522
He still hasn't remembered?

359
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:34,832
It seems like he still hasn't regained
all the memories that Maedomari erased.

360
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,038
I see.

361
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,488
Erased memories? What do you mean?

362
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:42,099
That voice must be Nao. It's been a while, hasn't it?

363
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:45,551
Yes. I still walk down the path you set for me.

364
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,956
It really changed my life.

365
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:49,269
You've been helping out quite a bit.

366
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,603
I'm proud of you.

367
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,238
Thank you very much.

368
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,341
What the...?

369
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,857
How about you, little bro?

370
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,093
You just gonna stand there and gawk?

371
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:00,450
This is our melodramatic reunion.

372
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,561
At least give me a hug.

373
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:02,418
No, thanks.

374
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,672
Still confused.

375
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:05,712
Lots of questions.

376
00:22:06,082 --> 00:22:07,485
Well, that's a bit lonely.

377
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,901
Though I'm probably reaping what I've sown.

378
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,009
Guess I should tell the whole story.

379
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,319
Right, Pooh?

380
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,152
Yeah.

381
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,771
Pooh?!

382
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:18,098
Relax.

383
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,932
The story of my time leap's going
to take quite some time to tell.

384
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,289
I'm in for the long haul.

385
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:28,289
Just what is he going to tell us?
