1
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,692
It... hurts.

2
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:35,573
Of course it hurts.

3
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:37,716
It's only been two days since the surgery.

4
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:39,089
Two days?

5
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:39,922
That’s right.

6
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,755
Why can't I move?

7
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,160
Like I know. Ask the doctor.

8
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:20,829
Hey, are you feeling any better?

9
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:22,091
Medoki?

10
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,392
I'm glad. Just like we planned.

11
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,056
We were able to prevent a collapse.

12
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:29,000
We didn't plan anything. We're just dealing with it.

13
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:32,408
If that was the case, you would have
done more than just give him a shot.

14
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,575
I'm not a doctor.

15
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,110
Um, what happened to me?

16
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,751
How did I end up here like this?

17
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,331
Tomori.

18
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:42,942
Is Tomori all right?

19
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,513
She's fine.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,268
She's also here in this hospital.

21
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,160
Yeah, thanks to Kumagami.

22
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:49,389
I see.

23
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:53,977
I'm glad. And how is he doing?

24
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:57,917
Huh? It can't be.

25
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:00,076
Yes.

26
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:04,779
It wouldn't have happened if you weren't
so damn busy trying to save your own ass.

27
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:06,241
You have no room to complain.

28
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:10,954
You were the one who said we should bet everything
on his ability to time‐leap, did you forget that?

29
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,224
Kumagami is...

30
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:18,470
Those guys must have decided that they didn't
need your time leap to get what they wanted.

31
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:22,975
Collapse was the biggest threat to them
so they tried to use hostages as shields.

32
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,570
Both sides miscalculated.

33
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,348
It's all my fault.

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,133
You shouldn't blame yourself.

35
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:31,962
Hey.

36
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:35,692
Are we gonna have to deal with this stuff all the time?

37
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,343
Not from those two, at least.

38
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,167
We erased their memories using Maedomari's ability.

39
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,239
But there's no telling when you might be targeted next.

40
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,421
All in all, I'm just glad you woke up.

41
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,513
We’ve been taking turns watching you.

42
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:53,290
Hey, uh, it's time now.

43
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:54,592
Right.

44
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:57,377
Hold on. I have one more question.

45
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,433
What is it?

46
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,479
Why isn't my brother here?

47
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:02,882
Really? Are you that stupid?!

48
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,042
You need to calm down.

49
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,122
What does he mean?

50
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:05,772
Let go!

51
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,939
He means that, for your big brother,

52
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,809
Kumagami was his best friend in the world.

53
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,821
Yes, come in.

54
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,749
Hey, Big Brother.

55
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:28,836
Oh, Ayumi.

56
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,874
It's been a while.

57
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,438
Are you sure it's OK to talk?

58
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:34,588
Yeah. As long as I stay still.

59
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,322
They said you'll never see from your right eye again.

60
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,549
Apparently, it was such a big
accident, I shouldn’t be alive.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,501
I'd rather lose one eye than my life.

62
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:44,954
But...

63
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,874
With proper rehabilitation,

64
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:49,653
they said I could live a life
that's almost the same as before.

65
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,056
It would be nice if that's the case.

66
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,986
How are things at the facility?

67
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,438
Everyone is super nice to me so it's been really great.

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,644
But Big Brother Shun has looked
heartbroken since the accident happened.

69
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,311
I'm worried about him.

70
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,239
Big brother.

71
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:10,255
Losing Ayumi was the most
painful thing that's happened to me.

72
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,342
For Shunsuke, Kumagami was someone just as special.

73
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,696
And if I had died because of the collapse,

74
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,838
what would Ayumi have gone through?

75
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,554
Yes, come in.

76
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,427
Hey there, it's been a while.

77
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:31,943
Takajo, it really does feel like it's been a while.

78
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:35,243
You look like you're in a lot
more pain than I had imagined.

79
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,244
Yeah. What a sight, huh?

80
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,182
And I come bearing gifts.

81
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,500
I think this will make you perk right up.

82
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,108
What is all this?

83
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,394
A lunch box with insulation!

84
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,568
And the contents are...

85
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,898
The smell. I know it.

86
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:58,654
That's right!

87
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:01,035
The cafeteria's beef tongue curry!

88
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:03,964
Whoa! I never thought I'd have it in this place.

89
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,821
I can even help you eat it.

90
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:06,575
Please do.

91
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,654
Say ahh!

92
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:15,795
So good! This reminds me of the days back in school.

93
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,691
Yes, this is truly the taste of our adolescence.

94
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,064
Another bite, please! Ahh!

95
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,105
There's still plenty left,

96
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,849
so just eat until you get bored of it.

97
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:33,201
By the way, how is Tomori doing?

98
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,717
Her injuries are a lot less severe than yours,

99
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,384
so they'll probably
let her out soon.

100
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,019
That's good to hear.

101
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,264
You've had a lot of hardships lately.

102
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:44,551
No kidding.

103
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,284
We're looking forward to you guys

104
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:48,367
coming back to the council once you’ve healed up.

105
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:51,326
Granted, I love holding down the fort with Yusarin,

106
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,541
but it's just not the same.

107
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,596
Yes? Come in.

108
00:06:58,193 --> 00:06:59,500
I came to visit!

109
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,573
Hey, Kurobane. What’s up?

110
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:07,184
Not much. I made this for you if you're interested.

111
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:10,041
Ah, would that be cream stew, by any chance?

112
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,446
That's amazing, you got it!

113
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,320
Yusarin's handmade cream stew!

114
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:19,072
This recipe is cherished in the Kurobane household

115
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:20,476
as a tasty source of strength.

116
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,016
It even works wonders on illnesses and injuries.

117
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:25,611
I see.

118
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,126
So that's the reason she brought me cream stew that day.

119
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,356
Thanks a lot.

120
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:33,380
Yep. Now then, open wide.

121
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,920
Well? What do you think?

122
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,356
Mmm. Great. I feel a bit more energetic already.

123
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,808
Ahh? I'm so glad.

124
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,451
Takajo can never know this happened.

125
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:54,887
Misa, you there?

126
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,107
Calling on the dead now?

127
00:08:01,477 --> 00:08:04,266
Yeah. Where do people go when they die?

128
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:08,524
Who knows? I never left this place.

129
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,318
I'm like a candle that Yusa is holding onto.

130
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:13,580
When her ability fades away,

131
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,588
my flame gets snuffed out with it,

132
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,856
just like a candle in the wind.

133
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,817
I see. In that case,

134
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:24,023
shouldn't you use all the time
you have to visit your loved ones?

135
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,372
Huh? What's all this about?

136
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,650
I almost died the other day and it made me think.

137
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,568
You could be gone at any point in time, you know.

138
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,124
You should visit your friends while you still can.

139
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:36,458
I hear ya.

140
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,824
I know I got one more chance,

141
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,159
but that doesn't make it any easier.

142
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,469
You know, I used to eat that a lot.

143
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,459
It used to be our mom's best dish.

144
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:51,014
But Yusa copied her and made it all the freakin' time.

145
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:52,983
Just like our family.

146
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,159
Unlike Yusa, I made our parents miserable,

147
00:08:56,564 --> 00:09:00,040
though you could say dying was
the worst way to be a bad daughter.

148
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,739
Then you should go see them
again, before the ability is gone.

149
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:08,913
Yeah. Well, I'll take that suggestion into consideration.

150
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,429
W-was I asleep again?!

151
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,929
No, you're all right.

152
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:17,943
If you don't mind me asking, Yusa,
what do your parents do for a living?

153
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,371
Oh, yes, they make soba noodles

154
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,618
deep in the mountains of Nagano and serve them.

155
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:26,751
I see. Then I suggest you go visit them sometime soon.

156
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,306
No, you don't have any time left, go now!

157
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:33,528
S‐Sure. I'll talk it out with my manager right away.

158
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,834
This is really gonna take some getting used to.

159
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:54,908
Fairly close to Last Supper, "Fair Supper" for short.

160
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,088
This is a show where celebrities...

161
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:59,853
She made regular appearances on a show like this?

162
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:03,114
... wouldn't be their last supper
but is a supper fairly close to it.

163
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:08,502
On today's show, I'll be introducing you
to the Fair Supper from me, Yusarin!

164
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:10,478
It's just over this hill.

165
00:10:10,724 --> 00:10:13,056
Actually, this is a soba restaurant that Yusarin...

166
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,479
She used her work to go see her parents, huh?

167
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:16,908
Nice Yusa.

168
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,233
... and she seems very happy about it.

169
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:25,223
This is the handmade soba and
wild greens tempura set‐meal.

170
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,120
First, I'll have some of the tasty soba.

171
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,978
I'll take the dipping sauce and dunk it.

172
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,415
So good!

173
00:10:37,764 --> 00:10:40,312
Next up, I'll have some mugwort tempura.

174
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,836
This is really tasty too!

175
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,240
With such a lack of vocabulary,

176
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,082
I'm surprised they chose you
to be the host of a food show.

177
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,701
Honestly, there's nothing special about the taste.

178
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:58,469
It's so plain, in fact, you
could get the same from a store.

179
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,255
Misa! What the heck are you doing?

180
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,172
But the love of my parents

181
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,783
is the secret ingredient that makes this so exquisite.

182
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,731
That's why I love this dish.

183
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,342
Nothing can ever replace it.

184
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:24,493
Thanks for the awesome meal.

185
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:28,414
You reminded me of Misa just now.

186
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,579
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,223
Yeah.

188
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,508
She was a delinquent with a bad mouth and attitude,

189
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:35,539
but she was good deep down.

190
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,025
That was a great way to repay them.

191
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,900
Uh, yes? Come in.

192
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,884
Good morning, brother!

193
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,757
Oh, hey, good morning.

194
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,662
Ta‐da!

195
00:11:51,856 --> 00:11:54,509
Happy birthday to the best brother ever!

196
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,414
Today is your 16th birthday!

197
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,936
Congrats on another trip around the sun!

198
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,285
No kidding, it is?

199
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,920
I would never forget such an important day.

200
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:08,461
So I made sure to pull out all the stops.

201
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,650
Uh... what's wrong? Don’t you want to eat it?

202
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,316
Yeah, of course.

203
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:22,497
Yeah! Then open wide for the airplane.

204
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,116
I can eat it by myself.

205
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:26,933
That's silly. You're recovering, so take it easy.

206
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:38,610
It's sweet but it's good.

207
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:39,380
Here.

208
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,441
It's the same flavor.

209
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,528
Maybe it's that ingredient Misa was talking about.

210
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:49,012
So, do you like it?

211
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:49,809
It's great.

212
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,365
I'm so happy!

213
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,413
Now next.

214
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:53,064
Tasty.

215
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,087
Next, next!

216
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,842
Guess my vocab's limited, too.

217
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,429
I probably shouldn't criticize Yusa.

218
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,320
Grats on getting all better.

219
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,988
I'm coming along, anyway.

220
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:11,614
There's a favor I'd like to ask of you.

221
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:18,461
Hey, bro.

222
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,568
I heard you'd been up here all along.

223
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,158
Could you please say something?

224
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,603
This hospital's all right.

225
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,658
You won't have to deal with the police here.

226
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:29,952
More than that. I...

227
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,271
He's just like how I was back then.

228
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:37,326
The terrorists are acting up overseas.

229
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,041
Japan will become involved shortly.

230
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:43,608
And Kumagami is no longer here either.

231
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,227
I wonder, what will happen to all of us?

232
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:00,026
It's been a while.

233
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,915
Uh‐huh. Uh, Tomori!

234
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:05,319
Oh, gee, it's nice to see you, too.

235
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,073
W‐Well, I was just surprised.

236
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:11,232
The hospital discharged me a little while ago.

237
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,296
So I thought I'd come and have a chat with you.

238
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:16,312
Have you heard anything from your big brother yet?

239
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:20,749
He said Japan will soon be involved
in the activates of overseas terrorists.

240
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:21,807
Interesting.

241
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,521
My brother's had all the life knocked out of him.

242
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,624
He's so different.

243
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:30,779
Dangerous people may keep coming after me in the future.

244
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,235
I don't want to lose anyone

245
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:35,196
or make them miserable ever again.

246
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,404
If there's something I could do
with my powers, I'd like to do it,

247
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:40,088
but I don't know how.

248
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,819
Tomori, what am I supposed to do?

249
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,059
There's only one thing I can think of.

250
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,602
All right, what is it? Please, tell me.

251
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,408
Your big brother's research facility.

252
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:05,752
The scientists there have already completed the
anti‐ability vaccine in preparation for Charlotte.

253
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:06,763
Yeah?

254
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:11,983
So then, everything ends if you can
plunder all of the abilities that exist,

255
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:15,439
as well as any new ones that might
happen to sprout up in the meantime.

256
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:17,891
Of course there are risks.

257
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:22,407
What will happen to you after gaining
thousands upon thousands of abilities?

258
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:23,804
What will happen?

259
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:28,574
You might turn into a monster that can
potentially annihilate the human race.

260
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,828
Even then, will you be able to hold on to your sanity?

261
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,780
It definitely won't be easy.

262
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,479
But it's something only you can do.

263
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,693
That is the only method I can think of
that can save all of the ability wielders.

264
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:50,619
To be honest, I wasn't planning
on having this talk with you.

265
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:55,760
But... you came back here from
the future in order to save Ayumi.

266
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,887
Then you came to rescue me and Kumagami too.

267
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,217
At first, I thought you were just a filthy cheater,

268
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,703
but I can believe in the person you've become.

269
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:07,268
That's a drastic change of opinion.

270
00:17:37,782 --> 00:16:10,708
Well, this is way too reckless
for it to be one of my tactics.

271
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,057
Forget I mentioned it.

272
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:17,510
Now, you should probably be getting some rest.

273
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,352
Later.

274
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:22,666
Hold on.

275
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:25,873
I'll try it.

276
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,856
No way, it's reckless.

277
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,250
I'm serious. Besides, I kind of owe you one.

278
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,412
And if you think it's the only way, that's all I need.

279
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,459
Your motive is a bit weak.

280
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:37,984
But what happened to us could very well happen again.

281
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,198
This time I'll be the one that saves you.

282
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,293
I promise.

283
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:44,923
Why is that?

284
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,174
Because I love you.

285
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:51,561
Huh? What are you talking about? You mean like romance?

286
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,299
Yeah, romance.

287
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:55,331
You say that with such a straight face.

288
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:58,980
I don't think there was ever a
time that you thought favorably of me.

289
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,646
I've said this before,

290
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,059
that in a different world I threw myself into despair,

291
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,886
and you were there the whole time watching over me.

292
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,649
This is just a wild guess,

293
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:12,022
but wasn't that my way of taking
responsibility for Ayumi's death?

294
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:14,530
Yes, but you still saved me.

295
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:19,652
So, how do you stumble from
that into a full‐blown romance?

296
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,700
It doesn't make any sense at all.

297
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:23,970
Right, like you need reasoning to fall in love.

298
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:27,174
You're the one who's using it as a reason, you big moron!

299
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:32,174
See? Our compatibility is absolutely the worst.

300
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,508
But I still love you.

301
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,746
You’re so strange, you know that?

302
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:37,485
Say whatever you like.

303
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:43,941
OK, fine, I'll say it. I'll be waiting, here.

304
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,850
Huh? For what?

305
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:48,222
For when you've saved the ability wielders

306
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:49,707
and finally come back to me.

307
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,120
Once you've pulled that off,
the two of us can become lovers.

308
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,630
Aren't you overestimating my abilities?

309
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,322
Think of it as incentive.

310
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:03,560
If you really manage to do this, I've no
doubt you will be irresistibly dear to me,

311
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:05,181
after such a big feat.

312
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,609
That sounds like a challenge.

313
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,682
So, has that increased your motivation?

314
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,079
Yeah, bigtime.

315
00:18:11,436 --> 00:18:12,547
Then promise me.

316
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:14,840
Swear you'll come back.

317
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:18,174
We will meet again. I know it.

318
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:19,460
Yeah.

319
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,594
I'll make sure to come back.

320
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:25,335
If you lie, you'll cut off the tip of your finger.

321
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:27,406
Pinkie promise!

322
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:29,914
That's a scary promise.

323
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:31,827
So that you'll keep your motivation up.

324
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:33,263
Sure.

325
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,221
Good. Then start with me.

326
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,260
You're going to plunder every single ability, remember?

327
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:44,006
I see. This is what the mission entails.

328
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,363
Hadn't thought of that.

329
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,030
Yep, go ahead.

330
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,299
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,680
There's really no need to apologize.

332
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:53,268
I'll finally be a regular human again.

333
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:08,594
Thank you very much.

334
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,239
Big brother, I have a plan.

335
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:18,079
I'm going to go plunder the abilities of
every wielder in the world and save them.

336
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:21,016
That's impossible. Don’t bother.

337
00:19:21,135 --> 00:19:23,976
Out of all the ability wielders,
I'm the strongest, aren't I?

338
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,733
I don't want Kumagami's sacrifice to have been a waste!

339
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,788
You're not the only one who feels that way!

340
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:31,162
Damn it. Damn it!

341
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,797
He saved me so many ways just by being at my side.

342
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,330
But I didn’t even get to say thanks to him in the end.

343
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,878
That's why I'm going.

344
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,782
So that no one who's important
to me will ever suffer again.

345
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,684
Don't you feel that way, too,
especially after losing Kumagami?

346
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:53,182
Are you serious about this?

347
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:56,529
Sure am. I've already taken Tomori's ability.

348
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,218
Taken...?

349
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,575
The wheels are already in motion.

350
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,223
and I'm not turning back.

351
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:04,950
That's some determination.

352
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,711
But how are you going to search for ability wielders?

353
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:11,124
Someone close to the syndicate's leader

354
00:20:11,513 --> 00:20:14,229
must have an ability similar to what Kumagami had.

355
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:18,389
They couldn't gather that many ability
wielders in such a short time otherwise.

356
00:20:19,238 --> 00:20:23,171
Yu, fly overseas. Leave Japan to the rest of us.

357
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:24,940
We lost Kumagami.

358
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:27,639
But we're still a powerful syndicate in our own right.

359
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,147
We'll hold them down until their abilities are gone.

360
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:32,226
If we can't do that much,

361
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,594
we couldn't possibly look him in the eye again.

362
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:37,816
Yu, you just turned 16, isn't that right?

363
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:38,506
Yeah.

364
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,467
You don't have much time left.

365
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,737
You'll have to do all this in record time.

366
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:43,871
Right.

367
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:49,403
Otosaka.

368
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:51,789
Oh, hey, guys.

369
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,328
I heard the whole story from Tomori.

370
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,566
We want you to take our powers too.

371
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:59,217
If it helps you even just a little bit, it'll be worth it.

372
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,632
Take Yusa's too.

373
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,648
Misa, you know what that means for you?

374
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:05,696
Yeah, I'm cool with it.

375
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:08,506
This is as good a spot as any for me to fade.

376
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:13,427
Come on, dude. Don’t make this harder than it has to be.

377
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,072
That's right, Otosaka. Go ahead.

378
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:21,826
All right then. If you're absolutely sure about this.

379
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:22,638
Yeah.

380
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:24,687
See ya.

381
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:27,575
Right.

382
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,232
What the...?

383
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,533
Sorry, did I doze off again?

384
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:38,295
Yusa, your big sister entrusted
me with this letter to you.

385
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:44,490
"Yusa, I've had a blast lately.

386
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:47,863
It was fun hanging out with
those guys from the student council.

387
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,116
I felt that I wanted to be with you forever.

388
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,168
But the one thing that was hardest for me, Yusa,

389
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:57,041
was that I was always right there with you,

390
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,251
yet we never really saw each other.

391
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,750
I love you more than anything.

392
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:05,069
And now I'll be a good dead person and fade out.

393
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,672
Goodbye for now.

394
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,450
From Misa."

395
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,450
My big sister was always together
with all of you, wasn't she?

396
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:17,799
Yeah. We had a lot of fun together.

397
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:18,839
Indeed.

398
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,657
In that case, I'm glad.

399
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:26,459
Otosaka, don't keep us waiting too long, OK?

400
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:27,237
Yeah.

401
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:30,359
After all, we're high‐school
buddies who suffered together.

402
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:33,240
We're friends for life. We'll be waiting here for you.

403
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:35,288
So get back to us as soon as you can.

404
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:36,662
Right.

405
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,099
Yep.

406
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,689
About frickin' time. Take this, I insist.

407
00:22:57,286 --> 00:22:59,641
It isn't much, but it's all I can do for now.

408
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:01,148
What is it?

409
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:09,500
While you're there, it should help
you get by, if only a little bit.

410
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,695
You made this in one night?

411
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,767
I know what your standardized test scores are like.

412
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:19,005
Yeah. After all, I'm just a filthy cheater, aren't I?

413
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:23,022
Fine. In return, I want you to hold onto this for me.

414
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:25,728
Sure, I understand.

415
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,427
It'll be here when you get back.

416
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:34,979
I'm uneasy. It's all so uncertain.

417
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:36,979
But I have to do this,

418
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,506
because I am the only one that can.

419
00:23:40,913 --> 00:23:42,350
Well, it's time to go.

420
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,286
Right, have a safe trip, 'K?
