1
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:12,831
Hey, Yu, Ayumi. It's been a while.

2
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:18,391
What is it?

3
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,934
Um... Who are you again?

4
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:24,506
He's our big brother.

5
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:28,117
I had to erase the memories you had of me.

6
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,467
I didn't want to, but it was necessary.

7
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,610
Necessary? I don't understand.

8
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:35,681
Well, there was a lot going on.

9
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,992
Seems like it, big bro.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,233
Uh... huh?

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:47,040
Yu, it seems that you're finally fully
aware of the true ability that you wield.

12
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:49,909
That's why I had you come here together.

13
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:52,878
I would have ended up here whether you brought us or not.

14
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:53,909
Convenient.

15
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:55,694
What do you mean by that?

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,099
It's a long story.

17
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:01,804
So you used my time leap.

18
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:03,891
Well, that was a job well done.

19
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:05,494
What's gonna happen now?

20
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,860
Can you maybe come home and live with us?

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,296
More like the reverse.

22
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,923
You can plunder any ability that you want.

23
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:14,533
You were the strongest of all ability wielders.

24
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:16,574
You even have the power of time leap.

25
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:18,974
That makes you a liability.

26
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:20,712
What are you trying to say?

27
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:24,339
There are syndicates around
that would try to use your powers.

28
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:27,268
I can't let you live in the open anymore.

29
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,501
You'll have to remain here until your powers fade.

30
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:31,391
For real?

31
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:31,979
Yeah.

32
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,796
You may already know, but we created this
research facility as a safehouse for ability wielders.

33
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,598
In other words, this is the best place that you could be.

34
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,645
Come with me.

35
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:04,011
Hmm? Look who it is. So nice of you to drop by.

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,424
Grandpa here is head of the research team.

37
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,119
Dr. Tsutsumiuchi.

38
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,238
I know.

39
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,070
He's the one that saved me back then.

40
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:13,832
And this?

41
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:19,511
A research facility that is creating a vaccine
to prevent future outbreaks of special abilities.

42
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:22,217
Vaccine? You mean we're all sick?

43
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:26,209
Yes. The special abilities are a disease.

44
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:29,551
So before particles are spread all over Earth again,

45
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,480
we need to vaccinate every person in the world.

46
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:33,988
Particles?

47
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,075
Have you ever heard of a long‐orbit
comet by the name of Charlotte?

48
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:40,648
Oh, yes! I know about it, sir.

49
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:44,062
Oh, you must really like the stars a lot, young lady.

50
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,996
That's right. Stargazing is my favorite hobby.

51
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:52,665
Charlotte's long orbit brings it by Earth every 75 years.

52
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:57,649
And when it does, an unknown particle
is showered onto our planet's surface.

53
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,276
Those who inhale the particles generate special powers

54
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,876
during the times when they are most sensitive.

55
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:07,518
The particles make their way into the cerebral nerves,

56
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:11,092
then dig up and awaken a sector
that is supposed to stay dormant.

57
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:14,115
And that is the reason we have powers?

58
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,560
For instance, 400 years ago,

59
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:20,338
we had an extremely close encounter
and many particles came down.

60
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:25,918
In Europe, some of those that inhaled the
particles became witches with special powers.

61
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,744
The people who feared the abilities conducted a witch hunt

62
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:33,801
and tens of thousands of ability
wielders were mercilessly slaughtered.

63
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:38,738
Roughly 12 years ago, that comet
barely grazed our atmosphere again.

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,098
Soon, one after another, young
people began to wield special abilities.

65
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:45,463
Yu, he's talking about us, you know.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,679
We're developing a vaccine so that
this doesn't happen again in the future.

67
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:53,869
Its production has already begun in Japan.

68
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,192
Sounds like there's nothing to worry about, then.

69
00:03:56,484 --> 00:04:00,922
No. Japan may be safe, but that doesn't mean
it's the same everywhere else in the world.

70
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:03,279
Witch hunts are still happening all over.

71
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,937
It never ends.

72
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,169
But that has nothing to do with us.

73
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,780
You can't just dismiss what's going on, Yu.

74
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,422
The ability wielders overseas have banded up.

75
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:17,966
There's always the possibility that they'll
become terrorists and interfere in world affairs.

76
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,079
Use the vaccine!

77
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,361
We can curb the number of infected that way,

78
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,679
but it doesn't do anything for the
people who already developed abilities.

79
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:27,277
Then just make a wonder drug to counter it or something.

80
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,405
Disappointing.

81
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,699
It would seem your sharp intellect
doesn't exactly run in the family, Otosaka.

82
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:37,544
Unfortunately, it takes a very
long time to create a new drug.

83
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:40,782
We don't know what's gonna happen to us from here on out.

84
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:44,592
But I promise to protect you both the best I can.

85
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:49,137
All right then, but at the very least,

86
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:51,591
I'd like Ayumi to regain her memories about you.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,003
Impossible.

88
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:54,138
Why is that?

89
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,019
I got all mine back, didn't I?

90
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,181
We don't know why you were the
only one that regained memories.

91
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:03,356
Was there a large factor somewhere
that caused it or was it just coincidence?

92
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:05,799
In either case, it's impossible for now.

93
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,219
Damn it, that's just so sad for Ayumi.

94
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:14,601
Starting today, we can make all new memories as siblings.

95
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,244
Hi, Ayumi.

96
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,149
I'm your oldest brother, Shunsuke.

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,291
It's very nice to meet you.

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,490
OK. Can I call you "Shun" for short, Big Brother?

99
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:27,188
Yeah.

100
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:28,974
Jeez, that was quick!

101
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:33,799
You won't be able to see your school friends for a while,

102
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,779
but these guys will be your new friends.

103
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,717
They're also ability wielders.

104
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:41,297
Ayumi Otosaka. It's super nice to meet you.

105
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:42,844
It's nice to meet you too.

106
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,027
You're so sweet.

107
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:47,000
Shichino, why don't you walk through a wall for starters?

108
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:49,913
Sure thing. Try not to wet yourself.

109
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:55,426
Wow! That's incredible.

110
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:58,021
The recreation room here is pretty substantial.

111
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,290
I think you'll find plenty of fun things to do.

112
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:03,437
What about music? Can I listen to How‐Low‐Hello if I want?

113
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,430
Sure can.

114
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:05,620
All right!

115
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,239
I'll be teaching you academics.

116
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,325
OK.

117
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,349
You're adorable.

118
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,428
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,095
I feel like everyone is keeping their distance from me.

120
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,800
Huh? Is everyone gone already?

121
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,506
They call this one the Bunei Invasion

122
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,506
and the second one the Koan Invasion.

123
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,173
Those are funny names.

124
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,333
In the literature...

125
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,405
Got a sister complex?

126
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,068
No, not really.

127
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,774
You look so fussy.

128
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,097
Big Brother took Ayu away from you.

129
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:41,054
Wow, Big Brother...

130
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,349
Not true. I'm just bored.

131
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:45,341
Then you wouldn't mind hanging out with me.

132
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:48,230
I want you to play for me, OK?

133
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,297
Play?

134
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,972
All right, I got a good hand.

135
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:02,724
Reach!

136
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:03,282
Ron.

137
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,417
Double‐value tiles and little three dragons.

138
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,747
All told, I have 36,000 points.

139
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,112
Crazy.

140
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:13,651
I've never seen someone bomb out in round one.

141
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,390
You really suck at this game.

142
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:17,806
Are you sure you're Shunsake's little brother?

143
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,685
Damn it, let me play one more!

144
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,566
No. I just found another one.

145
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,923
As usual, it's rather sudden.

146
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,566
Well, my power doesn't let me choose when to find them.

147
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,186
It's always quite random.

148
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,865
Believe me, I wish I could use my ability proactively.

149
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,691
It would make things so much simpler.

150
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:37,859
So, what did you find exactly?

151
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,288
An ability wielder. What else?

152
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,811
So he didn't have to be drenched in water!

153
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,613
You're going to the student council?

154
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:47,494
That's right.

155
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:49,358
Mind if I tag along this time?

156
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:50,938
Are you really that stupid?

157
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:54,057
Out of everyone here, you're in the most danger by far.

158
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,305
You can't just leave.

159
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:57,622
Oh, right, I forgot about that.

160
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,019
I wonder how Tomori's doing.

161
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,995
Wait, why am I thinking about her?

162
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:13,887
Please head over to Hoshinoumi Academy.

163
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,125
What's wrong? Is something the matter?

164
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,339
No, I'm fine.

165
00:08:28,977 --> 00:08:30,937
Hey, we were supposed to take that turn.

166
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:32,580
Furuki.

167
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:34,564
I'm sorry, Kumagami.

168
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,866
I have to take you to a different location.

169
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,080
I don't have a choice.

170
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:40,334
My family...

171
00:08:41,096 --> 00:08:43,770
They've taken my family hostage.

172
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,484
You didn't say you had a family.

173
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:49,658
If you guys had found out, I would
have had to leave the syndicate.

174
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,539
That is the rule, yes.

175
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,679
I prided myself on helping you.

176
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,417
It was my greatest honor and purpose in life.

177
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,377
Please forgive me.

178
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:04,042
Sheesh. Guess it's gonna be one of those days.

179
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,487
Over here. Follow me.

180
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:12,756
Sure.

181
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,343
Hey, I brought him!

182
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:20,192
Here goes.

183
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,324
Welcome, mighty one.

184
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,653
You certainly took your time getting here.

185
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,693
Some foreigners. Oh, brother.

186
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:36,268
He's here, OK. Give me back my family.

187
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,309
Not yet. There is one more thing we need you to do.

188
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:41,595
We'll contact you later. Now leave.

189
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,381
That's not what you promised!

190
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,373
If he ever again wants to see them alive, he'll do it.

191
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,762
You want to see them again, don't you?

192
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:49,945
This can't be.

193
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:53,051
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:53,924
It's fine.

195
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,987
Furuki, you can just think about your family.

196
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,392
Sorry!

197
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,118
It's your turn. Make sure he lives.

198
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,752
Where... am I?

199
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:29,530
My head feels woozy.

200
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,680
Looks like they injected a truth serum.

201
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:37,417
You're obviously after information.

202
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:40,957
We'd like to know about every other
psychic that you're hiding from us.

203
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,544
Hah. Do your worst.

204
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,458
I won't have any left soon.

205
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,577
I'll make sure you pay for my dentures.

206
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,572
I told them anything and everything, didn't I?

207
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,634
I'm sorry, Shunsuke.

208
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,064
Hello?

209
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:07,858
You are the one who gathered all
the psychics in this country, correct?

210
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,388
He's a foreigner.

211
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,014
So, what if I am?

212
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,507
Kumagami told me who the
strongest psychic in this country was.

213
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,150
He was very helpful.

214
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,422
Kumagami did?

215
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,271
They must have interrogated him.

216
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:21,803
Is he still alive?

217
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,263
Yes, for the moment.

218
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,705
But he's missing all of his nails and teeth.

219
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,451
What the hell!

220
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:29,523
What do you want from me?

221
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:32,094
We want Yu Otosaka.

222
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,166
That won't happen!

223
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,247
We have kidnapped a psychic by the name of Nao Tomori.

224
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:40,128
We would like him in return for both Tomori and Kumagami.

225
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:41,453
Where at?

226
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,287
Furuki will take you there.

227
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:44,160
Furuki?

228
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:47,291
I would like Yu Otosaka to come by himself.

229
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:50,617
I have heard all about you from Furuki and Kumagami.

230
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,124
We've been planning this
operation for quite some time now.

231
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:59,084
If the plans diverge, we will assume you
went to the past to try and change things

232
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,362
and we will kill Furuki's family.

233
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,213
They went that far.

234
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,721
Make a call. Furuki's cell.

235
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:14,266
Otosaka.

236
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,568
Are you all right?

237
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:16,902
Did they hurt you, too?

238
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:21,084
They threatened me. I'm sorry.

239
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,497
Just as I thought.

240
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:25,168
How long have they been threatening you?

241
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,486
Since before we started building the academy.

242
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,644
That makes it pretty tough.

243
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:33,825
If I talked, they said they would kill my family.

244
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:36,157
I thought about suicide,

245
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,801
but I couldn't leave my family behind.

246
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:42,237
So that's... that's why all this happened.

247
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,966
It's an error in my judgment.

248
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,299
There's no need for you to torment yourself.

249
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,934
I'll make sure your family's safe.

250
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:50,672
I'm really sorry.

251
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,117
So they've made it out to Japan as well?

252
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,339
How did they get their hands on Kumagami?

253
00:13:57,784 --> 00:13:59,308
They've been threatening Furuki.

254
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,856
It was my mistake. I knew he had a family from the start,

255
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:05,657
but I let him join anyway.

256
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,861
We're dealing with some evil people.

257
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:12,870
Then why don't we have your little brother time‐leap to
before Furuki started getting threatened by these jerks?

258
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,862
Because it began before the academy was even built.

259
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,815
If he goes back to that point, it could mess things up.

260
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,688
Meaning there's a possibility
our syndicate may not even exist.

261
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:24,894
They have us backed into a corner.

262
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:28,219
Then how about we just have your
little brother rescue Kumagami?

263
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,361
If we do that, Furuki's family will be sacrificed.

264
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,805
They're watching us closely. They'll know if we try it.

265
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,983
How about using an ability wielder
other than your little brother?

266
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,482
They specifically said Yu needs to go alone.

267
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,712
If we screw this up, everyone
they've captured will be killed.

268
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:45,769
There's nothing we can do then.

269
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:50,239
If your brother goes in alone like
they said, it might be our best shot.

270
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:50,890
What?

271
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,088
If we're dealing with other
ability wielders, we can plunder them.

272
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:58,944
Even if he screws up, he can just use time
leap to redo everything from this point in time.

273
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,125
That way there won't be any irregularities,

274
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,246
so they won't be able to tell that he time‐leaped.

275
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,345
We'll bet everything on him.

276
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,454
So unbecoming. What a sight.

277
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,024
Tomori's captured?

278
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,881
They took out a ton of security guards.

279
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,611
They’re obviously professionals from overseas,

280
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,198
and I'm sure that they're armed.

281
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,539
You want me to take them on by myself?

282
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:36,809
You'll be fine. I know it.

283
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:41,213
First, you'll need to plunder all their
abilities and make them drop all their weapons.

284
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,204
Can you do that?

285
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:45,099
Sure thing, if they don't shoot me first.

286
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:49,307
The enemy wants you alive. They won't do
anything that might kill you, understand?

287
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,338
Still, if you get caught,

288
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:54,287
or if they put Nao and Kumagami in harm's way,

289
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,033
use your time leap quickly and
come back to this point in time.

290
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,461
We'll try something else.

291
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:02,042
And try not to get worked up.

292
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,090
Your collapse power will trigger,

293
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,272
and then your own life will be in danger.

294
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,018
Yu, understand?

295
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,287
What's with all this?

296
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:12,700
Yu?

297
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:17,803
What is this? There's no way in
hell I can do something like that!

298
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,700
I'm not some one‐man army, all right?

299
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,525
I'm just a guy who cheated his way
through school and got caught in the act!

300
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:28,136
I'm selfish and cowardly and only think of myself!

301
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,626
All I ever wanted was to be popular
and glide through life without problems!

302
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:33,975
That's all I am.

303
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:35,761
What can I...?

304
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,292
Calm down!

305
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,181
Just focus on my heartbeat. Concentrate, Yu.

306
00:16:49,803 --> 00:16:50,888
Are you calm now?

307
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:54,254
I'm sorry, I was rushing things.

308
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,946
If you think you're in trouble,
just time‐leap back to this point.

309
00:16:58,565 --> 00:17:00,153
That's all you need to remember.

310
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,883
We still have some time. Think it over for a bit.

311
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:12,067
I gotta say, you seem like you'd
be popular from just your good looks.

312
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,488
Did you really need to play the
genius by cheating as much as possible?

313
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,833
We didn't start off that great.

314
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,387
Some investigation, of course.

315
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:23,030
My dream is to film a video for their band.

316
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,498
That's why I've decided to stick
with you until this is through

317
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:28,565
and you're back to normal.

318
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:31,414
It was the same thing with Ayumi.

319
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:34,033
You can't have something once you've lost it.

320
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,553
I will rescue Tomori.

321
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:40,257
I'm ready.

322
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,688
So you're OK with it?

323
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,989
We'll go as far as we can with you,

324
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,519
so you won't be alone.

325
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,576
If something happens, we'll rescue you.

326
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,410
OK.

327
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,029
I'm guessing you're Furuki.

328
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:55,767
Yeah.

329
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:57,743
Get in.

330
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:07,027
I brought him!

331
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:11,503
Looks like it's just these two out in the open.

332
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,919
But they're adults, not ability wielders.

333
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,713
Then, as I promised, I will let your family go free.

334
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,127
Here, catch!

335
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:24,786
That's the key to the condo.

336
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,944
The location is written on the tag.

337
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:31,425
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:34,155
This was the only thing I could do!

339
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:38,298
Let's do this.

340
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:53,650
They're not armed?

341
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:55,357
Are you satisfied now?

342
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:56,817
Where is Tomori?

343
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,111
Right below us.

344
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,871
Both of them are in the basement.

345
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,300
Let them go now and I won't hurt you!

346
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:19,896
I gotta time‐leap.

347
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,724
It's pointless.

348
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:31,082
Even your impressive powers won't let you
travel to the past with only one healthy eye.

349
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:37,725
Use collapse if you like, but your
friends in the basement won't survive it.

350
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:39,717
Damn it!

351
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:57,599
Damn it, that wasn't necessary!

352
00:19:57,624 --> 00:19:58,139
Hurry!

353
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,081
Not good. He's using collapse.

354
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,632
Why isn't he using time leap?

355
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,319
I have no idea. What do we do?

356
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:23,759
No way.

357
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,505
Why the hell are you just standing there?

358
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,989
We have to save them!

359
00:20:28,084 --> 00:20:28,735
Y‐Yeah.

360
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:32,641
How does it look?

361
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:34,871
Pretty hopeless.

362
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:37,276
But we still have to search for them.

363
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,585
Nao!

364
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,882
Kumagami! Yu!

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,279
Shunsuke, over here!

366
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:47,326
Are those the main culprits?

367
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,168
Medoki, please.

368
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,771
Right.

369
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:53,527
I found your brother!

370
00:20:55,327 --> 00:20:57,178
He blocked it with telekinesis.

371
00:20:58,622 --> 00:20:59,670
He's still alive.

372
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,773
However, they ruined one eye.

373
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,956
So that's why he couldn't time‐leap.

374
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,503
Please, take him somewhere safe for me.

375
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:09,233
Right.

376
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:14,035
I swear, if he ends up being OK but
the other two die because of all this,

377
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:15,853
I'm gonna be seriously pissed off.

378
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,012
Kumagami, Nao... where are you?

379
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:20,781
Found them! They're both here!

380
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:27,424
Over here!

381
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:32,818
Kumagami! Kumagami! You there?

382
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,798
Come on, answer me. Hey!

383
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:44,744
Kumagami.

384
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:48,038
Is that you, Shunsuke?

385
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,435
I... tried my best.

386
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,903
Kumagami! Don't you die!

387
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,665
I won't allow it. Do you hear me?

388
00:21:57,705 --> 00:21:59,721
You've gotta stay by my side forever!

389
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,454
I'm afraid that might be too tall of an order now.

390
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,827
Shut up! Don't talk like that.
You can't go off on your own.

391
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,708
You can't leave me here!

392
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:10,984
Shunsuke...

393
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:17,793
I guess the name "Pooh" was just a lie after all.

394
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:24,035
Kumagami! Kumagami!

395
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:29,312
Kumagami!
