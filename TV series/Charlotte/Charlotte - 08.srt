1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,358
OK. Time to go.

2
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:12,446
Sis.

3
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:59,218
Ah! I'm so glad you're finally back, Otosaka!

4
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:00,210
It's good to see you.

5
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:03,086
Thanks. Sorry it's been so crazy.

6
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,530
Just because he's a little handsome...

7
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:07,935
Screw that jerk... Can't believe this!

8
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:11,089
Hey, we get it. There's really
no need for you to apologize.

9
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:15,819
Absolutely. We're just glad to have
the student council back together again.

10
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:20,793
That's why I've decided to stick
with you until this is through

11
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:22,809
and you're back to normal.

12
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:25,047
I have a gift for you, Otosaka.

13
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,990
A magic spell to celebrate your return.

14
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,418
What? It can't be!

15
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:33,585
Now, everything is wonderful.

16
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,392
You just needed some time.

17
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:38,864
Now the past is in the past and you're gonna be fine!

18
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,242
There it is!

19
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:44,919
The memorable Yusarin Magic Spell series, number one!

20
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,722
It's the magic spell of... you're gonna be fine!

21
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:53,750
The very first day of her show, this infamous magic
spell idea dominated the fortune‐telling segment!

22
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,061
Enough!

23
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,585
Hey, good morning, Yusarin.

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,944
I just reserved your new single. I'm so excited!

25
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,332
I bought five copies.

26
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,301
I got six.

27
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:05,960
You poseurs.

28
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:09,528
I'm actually thankful for their annoying cheerfulness.

29
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:10,535
Who'd have thought?

30
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,361
Makes me feel like I can be myself again.

31
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:17,752
Come to think of it, I should
apologize to Shirayanagi next time.

32
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,576
I was pretty awful to her.

33
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,837
About the new single...

34
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:27,321
Ta‐da! It's the music video that comes
with the first press of my brand‐new single!

35
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,836
I wanna see it!

36
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:29,678
Knock it off!

37
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,346
Meet you in the cafeteria?

38
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:34,949
Yeah.

39
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:37,899
Here we go.

40
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:42,685
Here it is, nice and hot. Enjoy.

41
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,913
You know, you didn't have to go
through this just to welcome me back.

42
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,204
Don't read too much into it. I just had a craving for it.

43
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,807
I haven't had this limited menu for a while myself.

44
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:56,150
I can read him like an open book.

45
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:59,214
But I shall appreciate and accept his kindness for now.

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,571
I'm really glad that I can have this again.

47
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:03,646
Thanks a lot.

48
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,345
Time to dig in.

49
00:04:08,211 --> 00:04:09,780
I forgot how good it was.

50
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:13,170
Right? No matter how many
times I eat this, it never gets old.

51
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,762
We gotta go. We'll have to scarf it down.

52
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,752
That guy is gonna show up again, isn't he?

53
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:26,093
Jeez, you're slow. What is your zodiac sign again?

54
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,712
You always call when we're eating!

55
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:33,910
Well, now that everyone is here, I guess
we'll start by watching Kurobane's music video.

56
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:36,608
I don't know, I'm so embarrassed!

57
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,168
Ohh! All right!

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,487
I'll get to see it before anyone else does!

59
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,669
Don't worry, Yusa.

60
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:48,443
Even if the video sucks out loud,
someone here will still love it.

61
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,871
Thanks for listening. I really hoped you enjoyed it.

62
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,220
Well, give her some kind of feedback.

63
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:47,996
Hey.

64
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,662
Huh. It's pretty good, I guess.

65
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:54,361
Yusarin's so happy. She got a compliment from you!

66
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:57,888
Well, now I'm docking points
since you spoke in the third person.

67
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:03,880
Out of curiosity, Tomori, around
how many points do I have total?

68
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:09,464
Ten for singing, 20 for the song,
20 for the costume, 30 for the editing,

69
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:12,353
and minus‐51 for the singer being pathetic.

70
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:13,385
OK...

71
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,924
So that means she has...

72
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,363
A total of 29 points.

73
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,656
Huh? You just flunked Yusa!

74
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,379
But what would it be if you scored
it based on the music video alone?

75
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,879
Around 80 points.

76
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:24,704
Yay!

77
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:25,753
That's much better.

78
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:28,323
All right, Yusarin's so happy!

79
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,514
It just dropped down to 19 points.

80
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,310
But that score makes Yusa sound like a total idiot.

81
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,707
Well, I suppose I could judge
it from a business standpoint.

82
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:40,112
In which case, it's a perfect 100.

83
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:42,812
Really? That's pretty unusual for you.

84
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,827
All right, I'm so happy!

85
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,439
Wow, you did it, Yusarin.

86
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,304
I wanna watch it again!

87
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,892
Fine. But it's the last time.

88
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,937
Jeez, what's taking this guy so long?

89
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,667
Oh, he's not coming today.

90
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,255
Huh? Then what did you call us for?

91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,987
Calm down. It'll be worth it.

92
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:06,582
Voilà!

93
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:08,463
Let's see.

94
00:08:08,623 --> 00:08:11,011
Looks like these are tickets to a Zhiend concert.

95
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:13,311
And they're for tomorrow night's performance.

96
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:14,514
What's "The End"?

97
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,783
I thought you would have heard of them, Yusa.

98
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,839
Zhiend is the rock band Tomori likes so much.

99
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:22,394
It's post‐rock. Get it right, moron!

100
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,188
Uh, post‐rock?

101
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:25,497
Look it up on Wiki.

102
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:27,790
Now I'm even more confused.

103
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:29,997
You don't have to understand it to see them.

104
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:33,294
Look, I have two tickets to see the greatest band ever.

105
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:36,151
You're here to help me figure out what to do with them.

106
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,540
Wait, I don't get it. What else do you do with tickets?

107
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:42,135
I think she needs one of us to take the second one.

108
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,766
Otherwise it's a waste.

109
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,194
Oh, I see.

110
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,845
But I don't know about that
something‐rock. It sounds kind of bizarre.

111
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,225
Their reviews and popularity overseas are super high.

112
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:56,329
If your song was a perfect score at 100 points,

113
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:58,164
Zhiend would score a million easy.

114
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,797
Wait! You're saying their score is higher than perfect?!

115
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,274
So, do I have any volunteers?

116
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,258
I don't have much of an interest, honestly.

117
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,451
Guess you're taking one for the team, Otosaka.

118
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:11,720
Huh? Why me?

119
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:12,761
That's perfect.

120
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:14,768
I think the two of you will have a great time.

121
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:15,166
Wait!

122
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,658
You can't just decide by process of elimination.

123
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,795
I know, why don't we ask Misa?
She'll probably dig it a lot.

124
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,375
Only if I can listen to a super‐fast two‐bass at 260 BPM.

125
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:29,047
You won't get a super‐fast two‐bass at
260 BPM, so you might as well forget it.

126
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,008
Looks like it's all decided, Otosaka.

127
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,063
Enjoy the concert.

128
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:35,611
Can I afford to indulge like this?

129
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,795
It's OK every once in a while.

130
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,207
People do need breathers.

131
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,644
All right, guess I'm going.

132
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,324
Uh, excuse me.

133
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:55,609
Wonder what's going on?

134
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,793
A foreigner?

135
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,278
Why avoid me? Jeez!

136
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,695
What... was that?

137
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:11,982
It can't be.

138
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:16,244
Hey, wait. Do you... understand me?

139
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,815
Take me somewhere I can eat modern yaki, pronto.

140
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,073
Uh, I'm sorry, what did you say?

141
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:27,523
You got sand in your ears? Mo‐dern ya‐ki, now.

142
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,844
Modern yaki?

143
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,352
You gotta be kidding.

144
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:33,924
Nobody seems to know. What the
hell is with Japan these days?

145
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:35,135
Jesus!

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,897
Are you talking about okonomiyaki with noodles in it?

147
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:42,217
Yes, noodles! That's exactly what
I want. Is there a place nearby?

148
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:44,527
If you don't mind it being Hiroshima yaki,

149
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,051
you can find it in any hole‐in‐the‐wall.

150
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:47,368
Does it have noodles in it?

151
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,955
Uh, yeah.

152
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:50,449
Then let's get going!

153
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:52,148
All right, all right, I'll take you there.

154
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:53,355
Welcome.

155
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,331
One Hiroshima yaki.

156
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,648
And a medium draft beer.

157
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:57,347
Got it.

158
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,193
Not for me. I'll have oolong tea.

159
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,248
Rock on.

160
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:05,295
Oh, sorry, make that two Hiroshima yakis.

161
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,098
No problem.

162
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:08,518
Even if I go home,

163
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,161
nobody's gonna have dinner ready for me anymore.

164
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,724
I have to get used to this lifestyle.

165
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,512
Man, that hit the spot.

166
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,845
You wanna cook it yourself?

167
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,206
Oh, actually, she's blind so
would you mind cooking it for us?

168
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:35,252
Sure thing. Huh? Hold on. This woman is blind?

169
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:36,840
No way. Are you...?

170
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,776
That's right, the vocalist for Zhiend.

171
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:41,676
I'm Sala Shane.

172
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,065
I knew it.

173
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:47,842
Wow! I can't believe Sala dropped by
my filthy little okonomiyaki shop!

174
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,176
I'm so excited about the gig tomorrow.

175
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:52,482
Please, can I get an autograph on a signboard?

176
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:53,895
Sure. Love to.

177
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,776
I'm surprised she can write that without seeing.

178
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,593
You're the greatest! And here's your food!

179
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,521
Eat up and enjoy!

180
00:12:08,045 --> 00:12:09,314
Is there a problem?

181
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:12,335
The pancake's thin.

182
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,473
I told you it wasn't modern yaki.

183
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,026
There are going to be differences.

184
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,311
Oh, right. But it's still good.

185
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,425
Nothing less from Japan.

186
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:25,283
Thank you very much! Can't wait to see you rock it!

187
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,761
Sorry. I was short on cash.

188
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,570
Eh, it's whatever.

189
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:34,539
So, uh, did something bad happen to you recently?

190
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,226
The way you breathe and talk says a lot on its own.

191
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:41,806
You've been oozing out despair
from the moment we first met.

192
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,226
I don't talk about it.

193
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,847
If I had to guess, I'd say you
lost someone very close to you.

194
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,091
You're amazing.

195
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:51,765
That's exactly it.

196
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:55,702
If you don't mind, can you tell me about it?

197
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:05,584
Just the other day, I lost my little sister.

198
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:07,608
Oh, my God!

199
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,854
You've gone above and beyond for me.

200
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:13,418
The least I could do is put up
some smoke for that sister of yours.

201
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:16,418
Put up smoke? You mean burn some incense?

202
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:17,536
Yeah, incense.

203
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,981
No, you don't have to go that far.

204
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,386
Come on, I'm begging you here. Please?

205
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,554
All right, I get it. Would you please quit bowing?

206
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:32,670
Hey, I have a favor to ask you.

207
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:36,321
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

208
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,069
They're siblings that really love your band.

209
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,450
It sounds like those friends of
yours aren't just ordinary fans.

210
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:47,553
No, not really.

211
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,525
Could you hold on just a second?

212
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,041
I just realized that this is the
first time I've ever called her.

213
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,358
It feels weird.

214
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,785
Tomori here.

215
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,880
Hey, it's me, Otosaka.

216
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,841
You're calling me? That's weird.

217
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:05,894
Is something wrong?

218
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,220
OK, try not to freak out too much when I tell you this,

219
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,212
but the vocalist for Zhiend is in my house as we speak!

220
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:13,709
And?

221
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,550
Huh? What's the deal? You don't believe me?

222
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:20,215
No, I believe you. There's no reason for you to lie.

223
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,548
So, what do you want?

224
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,834
You can meet her.

225
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,707
What would be the point of that?

226
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:30,064
Oh, I don’t know. You can talk to her, interact.

227
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:32,595
Sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do that.

228
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,831
Look, I love Zhiend's music and stage presence,

229
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:39,807
so I just wanna listen to their
CDs and watch their gigs. That's all.

230
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,616
Is that really all you called me for?

231
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:44,490
I'm hanging up.

232
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:46,093
No, that's not it!

233
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,307
You're trying my patience here. What is it?

234
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,204
Thanks for waiting. The person I'd like
you to meet is still a little far from here.

235
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:56,323
When do you have to be back by?

236
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,542
Time isn't really a factor, kid. Don't worry.

237
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,534
Take me wherever you'd like to go.

238
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,979
I know we only met a few hours ago,

239
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:07,593
but what's important to you is
already important to me at this point.

240
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,577
Are you sure that it's all right?

241
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:11,443
I mean, your gig is happening tomorrow.

242
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,079
The band members and our producer
will just have to make do somehow.

243
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:18,405
That helps a lot. Thanks a bunch.

244
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,128
Oh, I have to tell her I don't need dinner.

245
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,294
Oh, damn it. I did it again.

246
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:28,890
She's not here anymore.

247
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,742
And with that heavy sigh, I've officially lost count.

248
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:36,544
Did you remind yourself of your little sister again?

249
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,628
Wow, you see through pretty much everything, don't you?

250
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,731
Hey, I need food, stat.

251
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,096
What? How is it possible you're still hungry?

252
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:54,453
That one was just lunch, silly. Now it's time for dinner.

253
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,815
OK, do you have something in mind?

254
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:00,656
After a relaxing train ride, soba is the only choice.

255
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,329
Great God in heaven!

256
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,766
Croquet Soba is the most amazing thing I've ever tasted!

257
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:11,865
Ahh! What miraculous chemistry!

258
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:14,658
I gotta pay my respects to whoever came up with this.

259
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,460
I'm so happy for you.

260
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:21,332
Hey, can I ask you one thing?

261
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,729
Yeah, of course you can.

262
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,010
Sorry if this is a delicate question,

263
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,980
but your eyes, are they 100% blind?

264
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,281
Yep. I can't see a thing.

265
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,456
But you can write autographs.

266
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,266
I'm assuming that means you weren't born blind, were you?

267
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,264
No. But I've come to think of it as my penance.

268
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:39,494
Wait, penance?

269
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,931
This is how I atone for all my sins.

270
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:46,735
Have you ever thought about
the great tragedy of life before?

271
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,855
That was an abrupt change of topic.

272
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:51,899
Life is something you only live once, right?

273
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:53,343
Of course.

274
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,359
I had dreamed of spending my life working
on stage as the front man for a band.

275
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:03,046
But my life was already beyond hope before I knew it.

276
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,696
And I couldn't grant myself that dream.

277
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,768
I was pitiful at both singing and playing guitar

278
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,624
and watched as people my age were
showered with praise for their songs.

279
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:15,291
I hated God.

280
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:18,330
OK, but aren't you living that dream right now?

281
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,945
Yes, but that's only because I was able to cheat.

282
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:21,699
How so?

283
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,779
How isn't important. The fact is that I was greedy.

284
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:29,100
There was a time when I was popular in Japan too.

285
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:33,713
A social phenomenon! A person of
the times. That kind of success.

286
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:36,277
When you're making the kind of money I was,

287
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,832
the people around you start to look at you differently,

288
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,423
and always for the worse.

289
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,317
In the end, you even become a threat to your family.

290
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,968
My little brother was once kidnapped for ransom.

291
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:49,179
That's when I walked away from the life.

292
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:54,139
After that, I decided to be the
front man for a really dull band.

293
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:58,437
Finally, I bartered my eyesight away to God,

294
00:17:58,705 --> 00:17:59,731
and that's the end.

295
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:00,937
Why to God?

296
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,286
Well, who the hell else was I gonna give it to.

297
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:07,259
Look, I don't expect you to
understand what I'm saying, but

298
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:11,235
one day, if you find yourself in a similar situation,

299
00:18:11,895 --> 00:18:13,521
make sure you handle it well.

300
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,624
It's just at the top of this hill.

301
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,084
I need you to walk a little further, OK?

302
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,354
All right.

303
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:22,354
Sorry about this.

304
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,901
I feel like a jerk, dragging you all over the place.

305
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,749
What? Give yourself some credit, kid.

306
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,685
You're a kind person. That much I'm sure of.

307
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,582
But you weren't always like this, now, were you?

308
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,242
Well, uh, never thought of it, but you're probably right.

309
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,702
Sometimes people change us for the better.

310
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:47,009
My mind instantly turned to Tomori at that thought.

311
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:49,709
So she influenced me?

312
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:53,693
You're trying my patience here. What is it?

313
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:57,076
I want your big brother to
meet with Sala for a little bit.

314
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,172
Why?

315
00:18:58,624 --> 00:18:59,679
Because he's a fan.

316
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,346
And he's been into Zhiend's music forever.

317
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:02,981
And?

318
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,076
And then something might happen if they meet.

319
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,951
Do I have to spell it out for you?

320
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:09,245
What would happen?

321
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,348
Come on. He might become sane again.

322
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,306
That would never happen, and you know it.

323
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:17,195
Maybe, but I'd still like to believe it could.

324
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,937
I guess it's not certain either way.

325
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:23,620
Go ahead and give it a shot.

326
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:24,858
Thank you.

327
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:28,447
But why do you care about my brother so much?

328
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:29,804
Well, I, uh...

329
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:31,804
That's a good point.

330
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:35,225
I've always been the kind of
person who looks out for himself.

331
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:37,194
Is something wrong?

332
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:39,210
Nothing.

333
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,146
Just a whim, I guess.

334
00:19:41,621 --> 00:19:43,956
Huh. It's still weird, but...

335
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,427
thank you very much.

336
00:19:45,713 --> 00:19:50,078
Then can you let the hospital know that Sala
and I should be there sometime this evening?

337
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,967
Sure. No problem.

338
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:57,123
I don't know what condition he's in right now.

339
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,367
You might want to steel yourself for this.

340
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:03,591
Don't worry. I can tell this is some
heavy stuff just by the sound of your voice.

341
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:12,243
Damn it, the painkillers wore off again.

342
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,981
I'm getting a very strange vibe from this guy.

343
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,633
So, do you have any idea what he's doing right now?

344
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,054
Uh, I think he's composing.

345
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:24,705
Really? This is a lot heavier than I expected.

346
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,626
He was a big fan of your band in the past.

347
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:31,165
He was about to make his debut
as a guitarist for a major label.

348
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,370
I see.

349
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:37,175
Uh, hey!

350
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,679
Looking up high.

351
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,313
Found a steel tower.

352
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:58,240
Wondering how I would feel.

353
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:03,365
If I fall down.

354
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:08,023
Was it a dream.

355
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:13,008
I saw deep red.

356
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:20,617
Chasing, for what's far ahead.

357
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,328
Always yearning.

358
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:31,091
Don't know why About the beauty I really want.

359
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:39,169
May seem to be awkward To someone's eyes.

360
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,874
Kazuki Tomori. I'm a friend of someone that you know.

361
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:50,319
Do you remember a girl named Nao, your little sister?

362
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:55,200
N... ao.

363
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:57,176
That's right, your sister!

364
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,613
Nao.

365
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,275
Ah! Thank goodness.

366
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,553
Seems like some sort of miracle just happened.

367
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:09,235
Yeah. Your song was able to reach him.

368
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,084
You seem happy from the bottom of your heart.

369
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,148
And that makes me just as happy.

370
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:16,529
Yeah.

371
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:18,402
Thanks.

372
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:24,656
Congratulations. You moved one step forward.

373
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,084
Hey, I can't thank you enough.

374
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:30,839
I'm glad I was able to spend such a
fruitful day with a brand‐new friend.

375
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,696
By the way, I managed to snag a couple
of tickets to see your gig tomorrow night.

376
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:38,084
Yeah? Then even though I won't
be able to see you out there,

377
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:39,988
I'll be sure to sing my heart out for you.

378
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,639
I'm guessing that the other ticket's
for that friend you care about?

379
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,099
I'll sing for her, too, then.

380
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:47,901
Yeah, please do.

381
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,623
So in the end,

382
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,790
Tomori, you were the one that changed me.

383
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:06,511
Hey, Otosaka speaking.

384
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:07,821
It's Tomori.

385
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,654
Do you want to hear what happened with your big brother?

386
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:12,162
I already know.

387
00:23:12,408 --> 00:23:14,662
I'm standing outside the hospital right now.

388
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:16,874
We must have just missed each other.

389
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,024
Yeah. I rushed over after the nurses
called to tell me what happened.

390
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,389
Kazuki actually recognized me.

391
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,787
It's been a long time since
I've seen my brother like that.

392
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:29,486
I'm really glad.

393
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,700
Yes. You made a wonderful decision.

394
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:35,248
I want you to know I'm grateful.

395
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:38,845
Thank you very much.

396
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,091
Yeah.

397
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,781
So, I'll see you again tomorrow.

398
00:23:42,845 --> 00:23:44,853
You haven't forgotten about the gig, have you?

399
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:46,348
Course not.

400
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,412
So tomorrow I'll hear her songs live.

401
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,865
Why does it feel so nostalgic?
