1
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:11,406
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:14,294
I don't think I'll be able to make breakfast for you.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,671
You're not doing anything with a high fever.

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,568
You keep resting. I'll call the school for you.

5
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,941
And I don't want you making dinner either.

6
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,113
If you say so.

7
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:25,208
Oikawa.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:25,904
Here.

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:27,240
Otosaka.

10
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:30,805
Oh, right. Otosaka is absent today with a cold.

11
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:31,694
Kato.

12
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:32,495
Here.

13
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:33,388
Kijima.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,261
Here.

15
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:35,245
Kiyama.

16
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:36,134
Here.

17
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,245
Konishi.

18
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,142
Here.

19
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:39,285
Komatsu.

20
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:40,182
Here.

21
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:41,191
Komiyama.

22
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:40,722
The ability is collapse.

23
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,824
Collapse? Any idea what that could be?

24
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:52,102
No. My guess is, they can destroy
anything they target at will.

25
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:55,610
Still a guess.

26
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,372
The fact that it's not destruction is kind of scary.

27
00:02:58,414 --> 00:02:59,391
Where is this guy?

28
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,043
Let's see. What? No way.

29
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,440
This is our condo complex.

30
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:07,662
Cool. Then we don't have to worry about them.

31
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,758
Is that so?

32
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:11,787
This person is sitting in their condo right now.

33
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,613
Don't you think that's a little strange?

34
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:14,859
Why is that?

35
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:17,716
Parents can't be wielders of special abilities,

36
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,180
'cause it only happens during adolescence.

37
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,485
Yeah, that's right.

38
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,517
So then that means...

39
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,421
They caught a cold and are
absent from school or something.

40
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:28,568
Impossible!

41
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,092
Hey, I saw that. What's with the sudden anxiety?

42
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,481
I'm sure that it's nothing.

43
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:36,692
Why don't you let me be the judge of that?

44
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:40,938
My little sister is... sick at home.

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,888
This might be proof that if one sibling has an ability,

46
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:46,960
the other will, too. Interesting.

47
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:53,916
Well, we're no scientists, but still,

48
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:59,488
I say we visit Ayumi and see if she's really turned
into a wielder of a special ability while we're at it.

49
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,099
Wait. Won't it seem strange if all of you drop by at once?

50
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:04,436
Oh, right.

51
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,071
Then I guess I'll just go by myself.

52
00:04:07,182 --> 00:04:09,975
No way. Ayumi is a fan of Yusa.

53
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:13,555
If I bring her along, I'm sure Ayumi would be happy.

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,366
Is something wrong?

55
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,127
But the fan boy might get in my way.

56
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,388
I want it to be just Tomori and Yusa.

57
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,052
Maybe I should take over his body
and make him jump from the window.

58
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,654
Cool. So that's how a giraffe sleeps, huh?

59
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:31,599
Yes, indeed. They sleep by
wrapping their necks around in a coil.

60
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,676
Wait, there's a giraffe here?
Where? I don't see it anywhere.

61
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,330
I thought it was kind of
senseless for him to come with us.

62
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:45,552
Way to go, Tomori!

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,116
Is he OK?

64
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:49,854
He's got a full‐body protector suit on.

65
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,528
He's fine as long as he didn't fall head‐first.

66
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,509
Someone just fell out of a window.

67
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:56,168
Could you send an ambulance, please?

68
00:04:56,574 --> 00:05:00,247
Now, once school lets out for the day,
the three of us will go visit Ayumi.

69
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:06,018
I'd like to buy a get‐well gift,
so we'll stop at a convenience store.

70
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,742
Oh, me too. I want to buy
something for her as well, please.

71
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:13,260
I was just thinking I might want to buy
a few porridge packs on my way home.

72
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:18,352
So, then shall we eat the same thing
as Ayumi and have porridge for dinner? ‐.

73
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,631
Sounds good to me.

74
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,133
You guys can eat whatever you
want once you get to your own homes.

75
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:25,180
I suppose if we were in the way, we could...

76
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,695
I think it would be a lot better if we ate together.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,752
Why do you say that?

78
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:29,749
Because...

79
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,820
I'm living away from my parents, too,

80
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:34,995
so I'm all alone, even if I go home.

81
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,696
I'm used to being alone.

82
00:05:38,182 --> 00:05:40,458
But Kurobane just moved out recently.

83
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,212
Maybe what she says is true.

84
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:45,116
No. Yusa isn't the only one.

85
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,519
I swore that I wouldn't trust anyone ever again.

86
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,623
I snuck out of that school.

87
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:56,146
Her father sold her off to scientists.

88
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:57,642
She couldn't trust after that.

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,277
She's still alone, too.

90
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:02,468
The fact that I have a sister makes me fortunate.

91
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,696
All right, fine.

92
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,966
We can all eat porridge for dinner together.

93
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:09,791
Your total is 1,360 yen.

94
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:11,933
That’s way more than I've got!

95
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,926
Hey, don't worry. I'll pay for this.

96
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,132
And these, too.

97
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:17,981
Is that... stewed enoki?

98
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:21,084
Yeah! Stewed enoki mushrooms are the best!

99
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,779
They'll make the perfect topping for our porridge tonight.

100
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,937
We don't all have strange tastes like you.

101
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:29,057
Well, I really don't care as long as you're paying for it.

102
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:30,795
I'm glad you see it that way.

103
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,804
Excuse me, that big can of cookies
back there... can I have that?

104
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,852
I've never seen anyone buy that before!

105
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,587
That one is 2,500 yen.

106
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:40,921
That's way too pricey!

107
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:43,064
And what the heck is with that fancy bag?

108
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,191
I've never seen anyone buy that, either.

109
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:47,633
Then again, I didn't even know it was an option.

110
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,281
Thank you so much!

111
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,717
It's this one.

112
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,617
My sister is a pretty huge fan of yours.

113
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,818
Awesome! That makes me look
forward to meeting her even more.

114
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,645
However, don't forget she's in bed with a fever.

115
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,545
We can't let her get too excited.

116
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,582
At the very least, she'll get a nosebleed.

117
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,542
I want things to go gradually.

118
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,664
"Oh, wow, could that be Yusarin?"

119
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,933
So don't go full‐on idol from the start.

120
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,489
Don't worry. I have a disguise
for exactly this kind of situation.

121
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,516
Perfect.

122
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,984
Now, wait out here for a few moments.

123
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,417
Guests? I wonder who.

124
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,892
Huh? Look, everyone, my big brother is finally home.

125
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,376
Oh! Sorry for the intrusion, sir.

126
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,757
I'm Nomura, the class representative.

127
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:50,972
We came here in order to visit Ayucchi while she's sick.

128
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:52,854
I'm Oikawa.

129
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,235
I'm very lucky to have your sister as a friend.

130
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,843
It is a pleasure to meet a member of her family.

131
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:01,844
Can your brown‐nosing be more obvious?

132
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,376
You already got rejected.

133
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:05,614
Ayucchi will hate you even more if you do that.

134
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,764
So this is the guy that asked Ayumi out and got dumped?

135
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,424
Sorry to barge in with so many people.

136
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,940
Come on now, it's time to go home.

137
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,662
I'm sorry for being so rowdy just then, sir.

138
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,872
Ayucchi, get better soon, OK?

139
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,593
Hey, Ayumi. Sorry to barge in. How you feeling today?

140
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,685
Wait, I didn't call for you just yet.

141
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,905
Oh, I thought it was just a personnel swap.

142
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,540
Ahh! Hi, Tomori. I'm so glad you're here!

143
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,359
It's good to see you again, too.

144
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:50,415
Oh, I see. The two of you must be dating now.

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,208
No way.

146
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,494
Aww! You look good together.

147
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:57,079
Anyway... we have one more guest.

148
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,571
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:02,069
It's Yu... sa... rin.

150
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,807
I knew this would happen!

151
00:09:05,832 --> 00:09:07,493
She saw through me instantly.

152
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:11,056
I got this. Make sure to breathe
from your mouth a little bit.

153
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,429
All right, you're in the clear.

154
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:20,500
Oh! You're right. That's such an amazing trick.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,151
I'm so glad.

156
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:26,112
It's Yu... sa... rin!

157
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,278
I got it.

158
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:31,128
Should I cast my magic charm that stops nosebleeds?

159
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,850
No, I think it will do the
exact opposite of what you intend.

160
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,807
My, what a surprise. Yusarin actually here in my home.

161
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,561
Have you finally calmed down?

162
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:42,537
Oh, good. That's much better.

163
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:45,254
Oh, here are some cookies as a get‐well gift.

164
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,762
I really hope you enjoy them.

165
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,667
No way! I made Yusarin worry about me!

166
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,334
Try not to think of that right now, OK?

167
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,514
She's just one of my classmates, that's all.

168
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:55,655
Yep, yep, yep.

169
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,982
Her speech patterns are starting to catch on already.

170
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:02,825
Now, the get‐well gift from me. Ta‐da!

171
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:06,040
Oh! Stewed enoki. Thank you.

172
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,600
Do you have an appetite right now?

173
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:09,344
We bought you some pouched porridge.

174
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:10,698
What about you?

175
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,062
We're eating porridge too.

176
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:14,800
Yay! It's a porridge party!

177
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,007
Time to eat!

178
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,482
It's so super‐duper delicious.

179
00:10:22,507 --> 00:10:23,842
I know, isn't it?

180
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,062
Thank you for the meal.

181
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,411
That was oddly satisfying.

182
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,276
Excuse me. Hi, Yusa speaking.

183
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:36,629
Of course.

184
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,335
Oh, yes, I understand. I'll be seeing you soon.

185
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:44,325
I'm really sorry, but I have to go to work right now.

186
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,452
Whaaat?!

187
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,992
You're talking to a show biz celebrity.

188
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,333
Stop complaining.

189
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,040
Oh! You know, you’re absolutely right.

190
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:54,666
Go out there and rock their socks off, OK?

191
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,071
Good night, and thank you for the delicious food.

192
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,912
Ayumi, please get better soon.

193
00:10:58,937 --> 00:10:59,944
You know it.

194
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:02,250
Thank you for visiting me, Yusarin.

195
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,464
You're welcome back any time, so don't be shy.

196
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,353
So, I guess we'll clean up now.

197
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:12,972
You're not going to wash them?

198
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:15,257
There’s not that many. I'll do it later.

199
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,837
Don't be such a slob!

200
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:22,246
We're cleaning 'em. I'll handle
scrubbing, and you'll dry them.

201
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,690
O... K.

202
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:35,427
I think you two are dating
and keeping it a secret from me.

203
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,753
Not happening.

204
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:40,200
You're so compatible. You even talk at the same time.

205
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,309
No, we don't.

206
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:42,666
See what I mean?

207
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:45,404
Admit it, you'd make a totally great couple.

208
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,039
I'd never be a good match for
someone as intelligent as your brother.

209
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:52,587
His looks alone put him way out of my league. Ha‐ha.

210
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:58,286
I think you're such a good match that
you're even too good for him, Tomori.

211
00:11:58,548 --> 00:11:59,929
Don't be fooled, Ayumi.

212
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,547
She might as well be calling me dumb and ugly.

213
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:06,127
Hey, why don't you watch some TV?

214
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,516
Whatever.

215
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,464
Wow! That was fast. Yusarin must be supersonic.

216
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,250
That's prerecorded.

217
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,782
Oh, yeah, I see.

218
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:27,837
Here, take this.

219
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,009
You should turn in for today.

220
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:35,580
I'll tuck you in, OK?

221
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,040
Good thing you have a great big brother.

222
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:44,218
Yeah, but...

223
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:46,814
I'm a little scared of going to sleep.

224
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,431
Huh? What's the matter?

225
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:51,179
I had a scary dream this afternoon.

226
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:56,349
Well, it's pretty common to have nightmares
and stuff when you're running a high fever.

227
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,286
There's nothing to be uneasy about.

228
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,056
By the way, what kind of dream were you having?

229
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,954
Don't ask her that. It will just remind her of it.

230
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:05,803
Yes, you're right.

231
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,002
Anyway, I'll get out of your hair.

232
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,406
Get well soon, kiddo.

233
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:12,210
Thanks for coming. I hope to see you again soon.

234
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:15,432
I'm going to go see her off. Back in a bit.

235
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,427
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo!

236
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,315
It's nothing like that.

237
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,733
Please ask her what the nightmare was about.

238
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,291
It might be a clue to figuring
out what the collapse ability is.

239
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:32,319
Hold on. We still don't have proof that
Ayumi is the one with the special ability.

240
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,453
It can be someone else that lives in this condo complex.

241
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,707
It's true that we don't have proof,

242
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,849
but the possibility is still incredibly high.

243
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,199
And collapse...

244
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,330
I can't help but feel that it will be dangerous.

245
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:49,045
That's the same terror I felt initially.

246
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,060
So, get it out of her soon.

247
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:54,107
This is for Ayumi's sake as well.

248
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,981
Yeah, all right.

249
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:00,743
Even if her fever goes down,

250
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,438
make her stay home tomorrow just in case.

251
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,018
As it stands, we don't have enough information.

252
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,677
Yeah.

253
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:13,199
I'm back.

254
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,591
Welcome back, lover boy.

255
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:22,384
Hey, Ayumi, that bad dream.

256
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,463
You think you can tell me what it was about?

257
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,371
Sorry. I don't remember it all that well.

258
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:29,704
Even a vague idea?

259
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:32,901
Something breaks.

260
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:34,520
What does?

261
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,631
I think the ground?

262
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,211
What kind of ground was it?

263
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,942
It's really hard to remember that much detail.

264
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:45,434
It was like there were cracks in
the ground and it was splitting up.

265
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,388
Why are you asking about this anyway?

266
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,277
Wouldn't it be scary if it came true?

267
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:54,623
Come on, nightmares don't come true.

268
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:56,767
That's just spiritual mumbo‐jumbo.

269
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,163
The world is full of spiritual things, though.

270
00:15:02,203 --> 00:15:03,712
The ground splitting up?

271
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,252
Is that some kind of hint?

272
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:11,577
Maybe that ability is something so horrible
that it will also rope in the person using it.

273
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:16,092
We still don't have enough information.

274
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,806
So, what should we do?

275
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,202
For now we can do surveillance.

276
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:23,619
We'll use the cameras set up around
the middle school to watch the ability;

277
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:26,227
That will allow us to get the information we need.

278
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,901
Also, we should let the teachers
know to keep their eyes on Ayumi.

279
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:35,102
The middle school has lots of people, so
it will be dangerous if something happens.

280
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:36,883
It's safer for her at the condo.

281
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:41,311
I'd like to be more prepared, so make sure
she stays home from school again tomorrow.

282
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,201
All right, I can do that.

283
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,168
Should I go cast a magic spell that cures her cold?

284
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:50,574
There it is! Yusarin's Magic Spell series, 21.

285
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:54,056
If you have a cold, it's the only cure for you!

286
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,824
Shut up!

287
00:15:55,265 --> 00:15:56,939
She'll probably get a nosebleed again,

288
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,646
so I'd like you to pass this time.

289
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:01,456
OK. Then I'll just visit once she's feeling better.

290
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:03,150
Yeah. That helps a lot.

291
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,094
36.5°.

292
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:10,912
Your fever's gone down.

293
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,393
I fought off the illness, Commander.

294
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:16,742
I'm ready to return to active
duty and doing what I do best.

295
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:18,552
So you didn't have a weird dream?

296
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:19,636
No.

297
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,310
Look, you're still recovering.

298
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,373
I think you should stay home one more day.

299
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,737
But I'm losing my mind staying in bed all day long.

300
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:30,532
I wanna go back to school!

301
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,911
There's still a chance that your cold will relapse.

302
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:34,341
Trust me, it's for the best.

303
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:37,055
So you just suck it up and get back in bed, all right?

304
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,325
No excuses.

305
00:16:38,857 --> 00:16:40,293
I'll contact your school.

306
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,714
I may be a little girl,

307
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:56,904
but I'm not some pushover you can keep locked up all day.

308
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,455
The grudge of the pizza sauce will be avenged!

309
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,316
Are your injuries healed already?

310
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm assuming you mean the injuries from when
I was pushed through the window two days ago?

311
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,039
Uh, yeah.

312
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:22,385
I've gotten used to Tomori‐induced injuries,

313
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,607
so I can bounce back from them fairly quickly.

314
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,242
Though, when I first met her, it
was an instant trip to the hospital.

315
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:32,040
If I was in your shoes, I'd
never be able to deal with it all.

316
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:36,032
It really makes me unsure whether
or not Tomori should be leader.

317
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:40,008
You know, she's a lot more
calculating than you give her credit for.

318
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,621
Darn it. She’s calling us already?

319
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,954
Let's hurry up and eat.

320
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,817
Took you long enough.

321
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:56,230
Both of us were eating pasta, so we
couldn't wolf it down, sorry about that.

322
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:59,957
Why the hell were you twirling pasta
around your fork at a time like this?

323
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:01,989
What's up? Did something happen?

324
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,632
Ayumi is at school right now.

325
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:09,052
Huh? No, I contacted her school and made
her stay home, just like you told me to.

326
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:10,649
What was her condition?

327
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:12,593
Well, her fever was gone,

328
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:16,357
but I was worried about her relapsing,
so I told her to stay home one more day.

329
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,282
Her temperature's normal.

330
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:22,344
She decided to go and attend
school from the third period onward.

331
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,996
I have a bad feeling.

332
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,871
We need to go check on Ayumi right away.

333
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,915
Huh? Uh, nice seein' ya, miss.

334
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,123
Um, Otosaka?

335
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,139
I recently found a sweet shop that
serves really good red bean soup.

336
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:49,575
I'd like to treat you to some, OK?

337
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,660
I'm sorry, but I just got better,

338
00:18:51,685 --> 00:18:53,337
so I have to pass, Oikawa.

339
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,790
Wait. Hold on a second!

340
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:00,901
If right after getting better is
bad, how about we go on the weekend?

341
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:05,353
You really don't get it, do you?

342
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,943
You've already been denied once, so just give up.

343
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:10,667
Move it! If you don't get out of my way, I'll make you!

344
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,160
Oh, put a sock in it.

345
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,097
Don’t worry. I can handle this guy.

346
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,446
You go on ahead.

347
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,218
I really appreciate it, Nomura.

348
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,717
Wait. Otosaka! Hold on!

349
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,687
Just give it up!

350
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,869
Why are we doing this again?

351
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,456
It's a shortcut.

352
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,452
Konishi?

353
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,881
It's all because you showed up.

354
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:38,984
Huh? What is?

355
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:40,341
With Oikawa...

356
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,286
What are you talking about?

357
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,936
I used to eat lunch with him all alone, every single day.

358
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:48,166
We were supposedly dating.

359
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,246
But ever since you showed up, Oikawa...

360
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:56,730
Oikawa, it's like he's completely forgotten about me!

361
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,856
He just looks at you all the time!

362
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,283
Wait, Konishi, please listen to me!

363
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,037
It's just a misunderstanding.

364
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,354
Put that box cutter away, OK?

365
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,283
It's all your fault.

366
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:19,412
It's all your fault.

367
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:22,499
It's all your fault.

368
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:52,424
It's all your fault.

369
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,327
No, that's not true!

370
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:58,067
That why I'll make you feel pain for a change!

371
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:59,924
Someone, please.

372
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,408
Help me! Help me!

373
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,409
Help me!

374
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:33,346
This is... the collapse.

375
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,536
We didn't make it in time.

376
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,123
I'm going in!

377
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,663
You can't, it's too dangerous!

378
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,329
Ayumi... Ayumi!

379
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:50,107
Don't go! You'll get trapped inside.

380
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:55,028
Ayumi!

381
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:02,988
Hey, what are you doing?

382
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,185
Get away from there, it's dangerous!

383
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,593
Ayumi! Ayumi!
