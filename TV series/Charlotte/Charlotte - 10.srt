1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,587
So do your time leap and change this world for us.

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:05,746
Just make sure to time it right...

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,246
Take my power of permeation.

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:08,895
Been a while, little bro.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,968
I'm leaving the rest up to you, Big Brother.

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,729
Hey, might as well stay in bed.

7
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,867
We already did your job and made food.

8
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,756
Oh, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,263
Jeez, we have rules for a reason.

10
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:26,556
You better make breakfast tomorrow, all right?

11
00:00:27,747 --> 00:00:29,056
Let's dig in!

12
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:34,717
Hey, Ayumi, how old are you again, now?

13
00:00:35,146 --> 00:00:36,606
I'm eight, of course.

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,582
That means we get captured around three years from now.

15
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,915
After I made the time leap,

16
00:00:44,034 --> 00:00:46,733
I started by becoming friends with Kumagami and his group.

17
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,193
That way we could fight together,

18
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,884
like we had promised, in the future.

19
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:53,448
Kumagami was the one that found me.

20
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:57,008
That's an amazing ability you've got.

21
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,421
Jeez, about time you showed up.

22
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:01,897
Huh? What are you talking about?

23
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,130
We were best friends.

24
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,681
We swore that we would change the world together.

25
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:08,082
And I'm here to make sure that we do!

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,366
Stay back, don't come any closer!

27
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,568
What in the world are you?

28
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,008
Come on, you know what my ability is.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,278
Put two and two together and take a guess.

30
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,325
Can it be that we met in the future?

31
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:28,490
Yeah, you got it!

32
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:31,151
Hey, we may know each other in the future,

33
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:32,572
but for now we're strangers.

34
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,993
Don't get all chummy on me.

35
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:37,008
Jeez, you're such a drag here, Pooh.

36
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:37,873
Pooh?

37
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,373
I call you Pooh after that red‐shirted bear.

38
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:44,024
No way. I'd never let someone
call me a nickname that stupid.

39
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:50,265
At that point, Kumagami had already
made a small group of ability wielders.

40
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,392
I followed him to their safehouse

41
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,317
and met with the fledgling
group as I had originally planned.

42
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,351
This is the one who can time‐leap. Shunsuke Otosaka.

43
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:01,320
It's been a while.

44
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,288
At least that's the way it's been for me, not you.

45
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:06,104
Apparently he knows us.

46
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,161
He recently came here from the future.

47
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,035
You really expect us to believe that crap?

48
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,320
You're Shichino.

49
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,265
The wielder of permeation, the
ability to pass through matter.

50
00:02:16,582 --> 00:02:20,718
Unfortunately, passing through even one wall
makes you feel like you just ran a marathon.

51
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:21,329
What?

52
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:22,924
Next Medoki.

53
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,535
You possess powers of hypnotism.

54
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:29,276
You can make someone fall asleep,
but you also fall asleep afterwards.

55
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,157
Then Maedomari.

56
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:33,061
Yes.

57
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,601
Able to erase a memory from
someone with pinpoint accuracy.

58
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:39,679
However, for it to work, you have to touch the target.

59
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:42,735
And it takes you a long time to find that memory.

60
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:43,941
How's that?

61
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,251
Amazing. You're spot on.

62
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:49,370
That doesn't prove anything.
Kumagami could have told you all that.

63
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:53,267
But that would mean Kumagami is someone
we can't trust. Are you cool with that?

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,220
So, since you came from the future,

65
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,237
you obviously want something from us.

66
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,387
Yeah. Let me explain.

67
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:04,262
And so I told them about the tragic future

68
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:06,324
everyone with special powers faced,

69
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:09,685
about myself and about them,

70
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,662
and then about the plan that I
had made with Kumagami in the future.

71
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,207
There was only one path for us to take.

72
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,128
We need to find everyone and protect ourselves.

73
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:25,273
And so we started creating a
syndicate of ability wielders,

74
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:28,099
but in the end, it was just a gathering of children.

75
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,525
No matter how many times we started
over, we weren't able to protect ourselves.

76
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,533
What's worse, there were members that went out of control

77
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:39,065
and assaulted the lab facility to save their friends.

78
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:40,446
Damn it!

79
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:43,507
We don't have enough power to protect ourselves.

80
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,880
This wasn't something children
could take on in the first place.

81
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,880
What should we do?

82
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,176
We can get help from some adults.

83
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,708
Adults? There's no way we can trust them, and you know it.

84
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,787
They don't have any abilities.

85
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:00,811
How can they possibly understand what we're going through?

86
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:04,760
Some of them used to have abilities.

87
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,530
In fact, I know a few of them.

88
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,633
Don't you all think it's at least worth a shot?

89
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,210
Well, if you say so.

90
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:12,997
Let's try it out.

91
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:17,546
So, what will we do, exactly, Shunsuke?

92
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:20,490
Well, let me think about it for a bit.

93
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:21,450
Pooh.

94
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:26,290
Big Brother Shun, we'd like to
wish you a happy 15th birthday!

95
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,637
I need to time‐leap soon or I'll get caught.

96
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,237
Get ready for the Mega Jumbo Fortune Lottery!

97
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,219
Our number‐one prize is...

98
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:40,322
600 million!

99
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,703
Six‐hundred?

100
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:45,489
If we had that kind of money,
we could easily sway some adults.

101
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,780
But why stop there?

102
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:50,026
If I use my ability...

103
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:54,098
This is it. This is the only way left.

104
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:57,013
We need funding.

105
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:02,815
I'll leap back to the past and gather all sorts of
gambling information like horse‐racing and lotto.

106
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:03,610
Nice.

107
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:04,777
And after that?

108
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:09,609
We'll gather even more wielders and create
a syndicate the scientists can never touch.

109
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,189
So we have to follow this guy's orders again?

110
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,498
Come on, just give him a chance.

111
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,108
Well, see ya yesterday.

112
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,830
I just wish I didn't have to explain all this again.

113
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:26,752
The morning that I made the time leap,

114
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,458
I noticed something wrong when I looked in the mirror.

115
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:36,631
This ability takes a bit of vision
away from me each time I use it.

116
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:40,091
Since then, we added all sorts of comrades

117
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:43,147
and created a plan for us to gather a large sum of money.

118
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,406
It took many tries and many time leaps.

119
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,480
My vision gradually started to fail.

120
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:53,337
My ability takes in the light off of every object,

121
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,491
every person, everything I see,

122
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,911
and uses it to take me into the past.

123
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:02,792
If I went blind, I wouldn't be able
to use it again. But I knew the risk.

124
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,116
The research facility was one step ahead of us again.

125
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:10,394
How many times has this happened?
It's getting more frequent.

126
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,101
At this point, we're fighting over ability wielders.

127
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,996
Shunsuke, we need a place to
keep them safe, not to hide them.

128
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,067
Yeah. Give me a little time to think up a plan... Pooh.

129
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,121
How many times have I experienced this?

130
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:28,756
An environment where I can protect them.

131
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,422
Is there such a thing?

132
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,955
By the way, entrance exams are coming up for you.

133
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,638
Have you picked a high school yet?

134
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,495
Hey, now, there's an idea.

135
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:42,540
You! You are a freaking genius, you know that?

136
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,492
Great, now will you let me breathe?

137
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,896
I'm going to leap one more time, Pooh.

138
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:48,888
Why?

139
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,656
I created a syndicate and gained funding.

140
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:55,005
And yet I haven't been able to protect everyone.

141
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,275
But you can't. You know what'll happen.

142
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,521
Of course I do.

143
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:01,640
One more time leap and my eyesight is as good as gone,

144
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:03,950
but I have to take this chance.

145
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:07,829
You'll only get one shot, so what
are you planning to do, exactly?

146
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,162
Create a school.

147
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:12,773
Why a school?

148
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:14,516
I've said it many times.

149
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:17,326
Our abilities disappear once we're past adolescence.

150
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,548
If we build a school for them,

151
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,666
we can protect ability wielders
until they reach adulthood.

152
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,769
That way, I can protect the
potential ones like you and Ayumi.

153
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,841
I see, but this will truly be your last gamble.

154
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,469
And it will cost you your eyesight.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,294
I know, but I'll live with it.

156
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,373
Of course you will. You haven't changed one bit.

157
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,612
Please make sure to find me
after I've gone completely blind.

158
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:47,803
Leave that to me.

159
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,264
I made my very last time leap.

160
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,081
I haven't seen light since.

161
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,969
From that point on, I walked
down the ultimate path in darkness.

162
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:04,088
But not alone.

163
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:10,494
For the final touch, we decided to buy
out a certain educational institution.

164
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,517
It was a pretty tiresome job.

165
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,549
But the joy everyone felt once
it was over made it all worth it.

166
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:20,345
Now, something can be made of this, right?

167
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,416
Yeah. You really came through on this, thank you.

168
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:25,242
But this is just the beginning.

169
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,654
I know that.

170
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:30,740
On that note, Pooh, I have two favors to ask of you.

171
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:31,580
Go ahead.

172
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,280
First order of business.

173
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:36,716
I want you to erase my existence
from you and Ayumi's memories.

174
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:37,526
Why?

175
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:42,028
If that doesn't happen, there's no way I'll
be able to move around freely from here on out.

176
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:45,472
I can no longer live in the open. Forever.

177
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:48,012
I must keep living behind the scenes.

178
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:49,877
Oh, I see.

179
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:50,678
Second.

180
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:54,008
I want you to create similar syndicates all over Japan

181
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,024
and build more schools that
can harbor those with abilities.

182
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,207
Hadn't thought of that.

183
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,618
Even if we can't reach them from here,

184
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,507
it's still our duty to protect them.

185
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,221
But if I do that, my face will be known all over

186
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,983
and it will become dangerous for me.

187
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:12,723
Well, if that's the case, how about you
hide your face with that long hair of yours?

188
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:16,808
Good idea. A little water on top would make it perfect.

189
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:26,174
Did you really just drench yourself?

190
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:27,205
Sure did.

191
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:34,399
I'm back.

192
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,954
Where have you been? I've been worried sick about you!

193
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,097
You could have tried to give us a call.

194
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,648
I'm sorry. I brought a friend.

195
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:46,428
Is it cool if she comes in for a bit?

196
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,444
This place is a mess! Hold on!

197
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,095
Medoki, go do it.

198
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,039
Where should I start?

199
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:53,931
Ayumi?

200
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,042
Oh, yes?

201
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,620
Ayumi? Who is it?

202
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,408
Thank you.

203
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:13,916
Maedomari.

204
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:14,908
Yes.

205
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,274
There, it's over.

206
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,656
I owe you one.

207
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,805
Your future should be fine from here on.

208
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,440
Live your lives peacefully.

209
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:42,327
I'll always love you, no matter what.

210
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,216
All right, shall we?

211
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,446
Yes, sir. ‐Sure.

212
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:48,970
And so I left,

213
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,224
completely vanishing from Yu and Ayumi's lives.

214
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:55,026
And that's the end.

215
00:10:55,754 --> 00:11:00,905
So you created this school we've all become
a part of by time‐leaping repeatedly. Wow!

216
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,426
I'm sorry we didn't make it in
time to help your big brother, Nao.

217
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:08,751
No. He's well on his way to
recovery right now. It's all right.

218
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:12,294
You erased my memories of you using an ability?

219
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,754
Yep, that's how it all went down.

220
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,413
You even lost your eyesight.

221
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,794
I tried to leap again, but it just wasn't happening.

222
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:22,772
There is something I still have left undone.

223
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:25,471
I believe that Kumagami mentioned it to you.

224
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,090
A promise the two of us need to fulfill.

225
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:31,374
Ayumi. He said that we could save her.

226
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,128
But you can't see.

227
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,279
You have to make my time leap your own.

228
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:37,581
Use that ability of yours and presto.

229
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,120
Plunder, right? I've dreamt about it.

230
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,441
Taking abilities is your true power.

231
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:45,155
And it's our only chance to save Ayumi.

232
00:11:45,282 --> 00:11:46,790
I never knew that.

233
00:14:11,004 --> 00:11:48,904
Takajo and I knew the whole time.

234
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,250
Kumagami saw through your ability.

235
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,028
It's kind of his thing, you know.

236
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,291
His ability is the plunder of other abilities.

237
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,132
Crazy! I can't believe that kind of power is even real.

238
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,602
It's way too powerful.

239
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:13,634
We need to investigate how he
does it before we go in guns blazing.

240
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:14,840
Good idea.

241
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,853
We'll have to keep our guard up at all times.

242
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,816
As a result of our investigation,

243
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:24,337
we realized that you had misunderstood
the true nature of your ability.

244
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:27,018
It's not that you are merely possessing them.

245
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:31,399
The method by which you plunder
abilities is by possessing wielders.

246
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:37,059
As proof of that, everyone you've
possessed up till now has lost their powers.

247
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,924
You're saying that we could have
avoided a lot of crap from the get‐go.

248
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,265
I could have possessed the target outright?

249
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,376
Then everything would have been fine?

250
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:49,739
Even for ability wielders, that kind
of treatment violates human ethics.

251
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:52,295
We figured it would be better for everyone concerned

252
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,485
if you understood why you
shouldn’t use your ability carelessly.

253
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:59,339
Also, we were afraid that you
would have become a dangerous threat

254
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,672
if you kept gaining more power through plundering.

255
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:05,494
It was fortunate you didn't realize this until now.

256
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,191
Very impressive. I knew I liked you.

257
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,342
Then I can...

258
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:22,173
My ability itself should not have been lost, Yu.

259
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,078
Plunder that so you can leap into the past

260
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,119
and save our sister.

261
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,905
All right, you should jump to the
day that Ayumi develops her ability.

262
00:13:33,365 --> 00:13:36,458
Once you get there, plunder collapse from her ASAP.

263
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,910
That should make it safe for her.

264
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,879
Afterwards, find me in the past

265
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:43,466
and fill me in on everything that's going on.

266
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,815
You got all that?

267
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:48,142
Ayumi, I'll save you.

268
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:50,737
All right.

269
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,674
Good.

270
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:53,080
Then I'm counting on you.

271
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,630
I'm leaving the rest to you, bro.

272
00:14:04,146 --> 00:14:06,399
Don't worry, I won't mess this up.

273
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,392
Now go!

274
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,342
Ayumi!

275
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,515
What is today's date?

276
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,221
Yes, right where I need to be.

277
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,818
The ability is collapse.

278
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,200
Here we go.

279
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,056
Any idea what that is?

280
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:51,499
No. My guess is they can destroy anything they target.

281
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:52,933
Where's this guy?

282
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,808
This is our condo complex.

283
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,865
Can I have a minute?

284
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:57,103
What is it?

285
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,032
It's probably my little sister.

286
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:00,738
What’s your basis for that?

287
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,841
She’s absent from school with a cold.

288
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:06,022
To be at home at this time of day
means it has to be my little sister.

289
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,544
You're unusually sharp. It's uncharacteristic.

290
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,545
Well, none of us are scientists, but still...

291
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,033
I say we visit her.

292
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:18,088
That way we can see if she's actually
turned into the wielder of a special ability.

293
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:21,802
Wait, won't it seem a little
strange if we all show up at once?

294
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:24,440
Tomori, it should just be you and me.

295
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,043
That makes sense.

296
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:30,543
You're right. You're right indeed. Let's do that.

297
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:35,524
Come on, it's time to go home!

298
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,842
Ayucchi, get better soon, 'K?

299
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,683
I'm sorry for being so rowdy just then, sir!

300
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,871
So it was her.

301
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,847
Anyway, I'll get out of your hair.

302
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,284
Get well soon, kiddo.

303
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:56,145
Thanks for coming. I hope to see you again soon.

304
00:15:57,098 --> 00:15:59,264
I'm gonna go see her off. Back in a bit.

305
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,423
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo!

306
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,526
No.

307
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,251
Please ask her what the nightmare was about.

308
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,910
It might be a clue to figuring
out what the collapse ability is.

309
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,680
Hey, Tomori,

310
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:17,863
if I told you that I had time‐leaped here from the future,

311
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,054
what would you think?

312
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:21,950
I would believe you.

313
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,267
If it was for Ayumi's sake,
you'd do something just like that.

314
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,060
I have no doubt.

315
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:30,267
Good. Awesome. That saves a lot of trouble.

316
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,262
In two days, Ayumi will die
when collapse goes out of control.

317
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:39,143
I used a time leap so I could come back here
and prevent that from even happening.

318
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,055
So that's how it is.

319
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,867
I'm worried about you doing this on your own,

320
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,867
so the student council will help you.

321
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,788
That's great, thanks.

322
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,240
You know...

323
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,153
Yes?

324
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:55,062
I think I may have completely misunderstood you.

325
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:57,856
After I lost Ayumi,

326
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,634
I became reckless and nearly went to pieces.

327
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,562
I fell down a dark pit,

328
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,014
but then you came and pulled me out.

329
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,973
Since you're talking about the future,

330
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,633
I don't recall any of this,

331
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,667
but if you say that's how it happened, I guess it's true.

332
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:18,032
I saw all sorts of horrible things,

333
00:17:18,683 --> 00:17:20,452
but you always knew what to do.

334
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:21,508
Sure.

335
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:23,643
Thank you.

336
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:28,000
Well... you're welcome.

337
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,613
I guess it's time for bed again, isn't it?

338
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,462
No, not just yet.

339
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:37,391
Let me cast a magic spell that can cure your cold.

340
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,144
Sure.

341
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:45,222
How do you feel?

342
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,801
Pretty good. Thanks, big brother.

343
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:50,611
Ayumi's ability is no longer with her.

344
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,506
One more thing to do.

345
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:57,998
See ya. I'll come pick you up to go home.

346
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,355
You're still recovering so don't overdo it.

347
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,686
Right. I'll do my very best, sir.

348
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,575
This is the hard part. I'll need to be careful.

349
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,059
Good morning.

350
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,555
I can't believe you got ahold of those things.

351
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,579
And what are you supposed to be?

352
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,610
They decided that no matter what I did,

353
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,668
I wouldn't look like a middle‐school student.

354
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:24,398
So I'm disguised as a teacher.

355
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,993
Are you sure you shouldn't have a disguise?

356
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,821
Hell yeah. I want her to know it
was Ayumi's big brother that showed up.

357
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,972
Good idea. That totally changes how formidable you look.

358
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,201
Hmm. Everyone, I'm counting on you.

359
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,517
Right. We'll make sure to save your sister's life.

360
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:46,396
After that, we party! Yeah!

361
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:47,104
Yeah!

362
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:50,367
By the way, there isn't a magic
spell for saving someone's life.

363
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,248
I'm sorry.

364
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:52,526
Now, over here.

365
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,359
We'll go in from the back entrance.

366
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,878
Hey, are you a student of this school?

367
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,814
Uh, I'm a teacher here. Is there some kind of problem?

368
00:19:08,664 --> 00:19:12,556
I don't recognize you at all.
Let's go to the faculty office.

369
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:15,508
Well, sure, I'll go. After all, I am a teacher.

370
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:17,731
I've already freakin' lost one!

371
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,573
At least I still have Tomori and Yusa.

372
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:23,470
Whoa. Hey, you're Yusarin, aren't you?

373
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:25,637
No, I'm totally not.

374
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:27,819
I knew it. You are her!

375
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:31,716
Everyone, Yusarin, the famous
idol, just transferred to our school!

376
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,637
She's prettier than on TV.

377
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,129
I ain't nothing like Yusarin!

378
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:42,261
So you're saying you aren't like how you act on TV?

379
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,682
Ah, for the love of crap.

380
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:48,245
Would a pop idol do something like this?

381
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,927
What should I do with this saliva?

382
00:19:51,094 --> 00:19:52,196
So creepy!

383
00:19:52,466 --> 00:19:54,759
Hey, this other new girl is pretty cute, too.

384
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,672
Maybe she's an idol like Yusarin.

385
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,618
They could be filming a secret show right now.

386
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:00,275
I thought Yusarin was in high school.

387
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,339
You damn traitor!

388
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,021
Don't leave me here by myself!

389
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,458
They were caught instantly.

390
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,970
What was the point of wearing disguises?

391
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:14,121
One hour left.

392
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,599
It's all because you showed up.

393
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:26,385
Oikawa! It's like he's completely forgotten about me.

394
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,412
He just looks at you all the time!

395
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,651
It's all your fault.

396
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,818
It's all your fault.

397
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:55,137
It's all your fault!

398
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,648
No, that's not true!

399
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,402
That's why I'll make you feel pain for a change!

400
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:05,483
Who are you?

401
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:07,292
Big Brother Yu?

402
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,491
I'm gonna have to scare you a bit.

403
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:19,515
What's happening?

404
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:22,126
The next time you try to harm my little sister,

405
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:24,320
you won't get off this easily.

406
00:21:25,304 --> 00:21:27,613
Get lost before I get mad!

407
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:33,326
I was so scared!

408
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,199
I'm so glad you're safe.

409
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,766
Let's go home for today. Sound good to you?

410
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,551
Uh‐huh. Yeah.

411
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,395
I saved her. I was able to save her.

412
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,990
We actually did it.

413
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,156
I don't care if people say I have a sister complex.

414
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,736
I never want to lose Ayumi again.

415
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,483
You're already here, Kumagami? That was fast.

416
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,118
Hold on. You already know about me?

417
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:16,149
That's right, Pooh.

418
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,300
That makes it easy.

419
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:21,189
Come with me, you and your little sister.

420
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,517
Sure thing. Take us to him.

421
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,477
To our big brother.
