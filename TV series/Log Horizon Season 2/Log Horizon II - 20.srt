1
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:09,083
OOFF!

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,018
(CHUCKLING)

3
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:13,153
[LONDARK]
IT HAS BEEN FAR TOO LONG.

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,791
[NYANTA]
LONDARK!

5
00:01:53,253 --> 00:01:55,656
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
WITH PLANT HWYADEN...?

6
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:57,157
TELL ME, LONDARK!

7
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,727
AW NOW THAT'S NO WAY
TO GREET AN OLD FRIEND.

8
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,431
BESIDES, WHAT REASON DO WE HAVE
TO FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER?

9
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,302
THEN AGAIN I CAN'T HAVE YOU
IN MY WAY EITHER. NOW CAN I?

10
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:08,869
[NYANTA] DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU ARE DOING?

11
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,237
HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK?!

12
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,574
[LONDARK] YES, YES. OF
COURSE I DO! I DO THE JOB.

13
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,577
THEY GIVE ME MONEY.
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE, REALLY.

14
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:21,382
I'M HERE TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR
THE GENERAL'S LITTLE TOY TRAIN!

15
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,851
[NYANTA] I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES!

16
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,153
[LONDARK] "CONSEQUENCES"?
SORRY, MY FRIEND...

17
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:28,856
I'M AFRAID THAT WASN'T
INCLUDED IN THE MANUAL.

18
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:32,293
[LONDARK]
INFERNO STRIKE! HWAH!

19
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:36,096
COME TO THINK OF IT...!

20
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,999
THAT SEEMS TO BE A THEME
FOR THIS PLACE DOESN'T IT?

21
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,236
I NEVER GOT THE MANUAL
FOR THIS WORLD EITHER!

22
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,580
ARE YOU SAYING...

23
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,181
WE MIGHT END UP FIGHTING A WAR

24
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,116
WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND,
SHIROE?

25
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,052
[SHIROE] IF WE'RE THE
LEAST BIT RESPONSIBLE,

26
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,287
THEN WE HAVE TO
CONSIDER IT, YES.

27
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,057
[NYANTA, THINKING] TO PUT IT
SUCCINCTLY, THIS WORLD WE'RE IN

28
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,893
IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF
GOING TO WAR ANY MINUTE.

29
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:07,762
SHIROE‐ECCHI DID WHAT
HE COULD TO MAKE

30
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:11,366
THAT POINT CLEAR AT THE
ROUND TABLE'S FIRST CONFERENCE.

31
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:15,135
HE WASN'T JOKING, EITHER. WE
HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR OURSELVES

32
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,171
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL
WITH THAT THREAT AND

33
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,039
KEEP IT AT BAY IF WE CAN.

34
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,343
LISTEN TO ME, VERY
CAREFULLY, LONDARK...

35
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,845
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS
HELP CREATE A WAR!

36
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,281
THERE'S NO NEED TO
BE SO DRAMATIC.

37
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:30,318
IF YOU FEEL THE NEED TO COMPLAIN
TO SOMEONE ABOUT GOING TO WAR,

38
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,321
TAKE IT UP WITH THE PERSON
OF THE LAND WHO HIRED ME!

39
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,324
[NYANTA] GUILT BY ASSOCIATION
IS STILL GUILT, LONDARK!

40
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,360
[LONDARK] EH. NOT FROM
WHERE I STAND! UWAH!

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,728
IT'S NOT MY WAR!

42
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:44,064
THINK OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
WHO'LL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS!

43
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:45,833
YOU MISS WHO I SAID HIRED ME?!

44
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:47,935
THEY'RE THE ONES
WHO WANT THIS WAR!

45
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:48,803
[LONDARK]
FROST‐

46

00:03:51,906 --> 00:03:53,240
UWAH!

48
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:53,974
YAHHHHH!

49
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:55,209
(STRUGGLING)

50
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,911
WE CAN PREVENT IT
FROM HAPPENING!

51
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,245
DON'T YOU GET IT?!

52
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,548
NEVER HEAR OF A QUEST
FOR PEACE BEFORE!

53
00:04:00,648 --> 00:04:02,317
NOW BACK OFF!

54
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,621
REALLY? DO YOU SERIOUSLY
STILL CONSIDER THIS A GAME?

55
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:08,456
DO NOT CONDESCEND ME!

56
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,991
I NEVER WANTED THIS...!
THIS PLACE...

57
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:14,362
THIS PLACE BROUGHT ME HERE,
IT WAS NOT MY CHOICE!

58
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,230
[LONDARK] I NEVER
GOT AN INVITATION.

59
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,366
I NEVER GOT MY
CHANCE TO RSVP.

60
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,200
OH?

61
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,236
[LONDARK]
I WAS ABDUCTED!

62
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,372
WHAT AM I THE ONLY ONE?

63
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,442
DID YOU GET A DIALOGUE
BOX LETTING YOU DECIDE?

64
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,745
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
KIDNAPPED? "YES" OR "NO"?

65
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:32,313
[LONDARK] I DIDN'T
ASK TO BE HERE

66
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:34,114
AND I DON'T LIKE BEING HERE.

67
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:36,551
DO YOU AND YOUR LITTLE LOG
HORIZON FRIENDS ENJOY THIS?

68
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,219
DO YOU ACTUALLY
PREFER BEING HERE?!

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,156
SHUT UP...! YOU KNOW DAMN GOOD
AND WELL

70
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:44,825
NONE OF US WERE INVITED TO
MAKE THIS PLACE OUR HOME!

71
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,428
THEN DON'T STAND THERE AND
LECTURE ME ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S

72
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:50,431
WARS WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF US!

73
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,100
[LONDARK] THEY TAKE SOMETHING
FROM ME, I TAKE FROM THEM.

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,302
IT'S AN EVEN TRADE.

75
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:56,571
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT...

77
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,541

[LONDARK] DON'T HOLD
BACK ON ME, SWASHBUCKLER!

82
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:10,451
OR IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

83
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,086
[NYANTA, THINKING] I HATE TO SAY
IT,

84
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,455
BUT LONDARK HAS A POINT, MYAH.

85
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,792
WE DIDN'T ASK TO BE HERE.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A KIDNAPPING.

86
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,727
WE'RE VICTIMS AND OUTSIDERS...

87
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,162
IT WAS UNFAIR. AND I SUPPOSE
IT'S ONLY RIGHT

88
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,698
THAT SOME OF US WOULD RESENT IT,

89
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:28,168
AND LASH OUT IN ANGER, AND
WANT TO SEE IT TORN DOWN.

90
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,505
I COULD USE MY FIGHTING ABILITY
TO REMOVE LONDARK

91
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,340
AND ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,411
BUT IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
SOLUTION AT BEST, MPH.

[NYANTA, THINKING]
BUT REALLY...

95
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:42,783
IT WOULDN'T ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING...

96
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:46,554
AND WE'D BE RIGHT BACK
WHERE WE STARTED, MYAH.

[LONDARK] SO...!
YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY

101
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,063
TO HANDLE THIS, OLD FRIEND?

102
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,098
SHOULD I JUST LAY BACK
AND LET THIS WORLD

103
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:01,702
HAVE ITS WAY WITH ME?
I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO THAT!

[NYANTA] LONDARK... WHAT YOU'VE
SAID IS TRUE OF ALL MANKIND.

107
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:16,851
IT'S NOTHING BUT A
CHILD'S CONUNDRUM!

108
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,653
WE'RE ALL BORN THE SAME.

109
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,729

DON'T HAVE A SAY IN OUR BIRTH.

110
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,365
IT'S UNFAIR, ISN'T IT...?

111
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:32,500
BUT WE ALL END UP HAVING
TO DEAL WITH IT, RIGHT?

112
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,101
[LONDARK] THAT'S DIFFERENT.

YOU'RE NOT THE

YOU "ADVENTURERS" ARE SO
MARVELOUS!

ISN'T PERMANENT FOR YOU TWO.

OH ANYWAY, WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

WHO WENT AND HIRED
THAT FOOL LONDARK.

154
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:17,638
IS THIS HOW PEOPLE OF THE
LAND HANDLE THEIR BUSINESS?

155
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:21,776
(LAUGHS) SOMEONE LIKE YOU SHOULD
KNOW BETTER THAN THAT BY NOW!

156
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,345
"PEOPLE OF THE LAND"?
"ADVENTURERS"?

157
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:26,381
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

158
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,717
LIVING THINGS LIVE OFF THE
DEATH OF OTHER LIVING THINGS!

159
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:32,653
WE'RE THE STRONG, AND
OUR STRENGTH IS A WEAPON!

160
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,889
AND OF COURSE, THE WEAK USE
THEIR WEAKNESS TO GET WHAT

161
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,758
THEY WANT! THAT'S THE
TRUTH IN ANY WORLD!

162
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:40,895
[MIZPHA]
EHEH! HWAH!

163
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:41,796
YAHHHH!

164
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,730
HUAH!

165
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,198
[NYANTA, THINKING]
SHE'S NOT BAD!

166
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:45,265
HOW COULD A PERSON OF THE LAND

167
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,667
MASTER A SWORD LIKE THAT?!

168
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,803
[MIZPHA] WHAT RIGHT DOES
A PERSON WHO CAN'T DIE

169
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,606
HAVE QUESTIONING MY
DESIRES FOR DOMINATION.

170
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,108
[NYANTA]
YOU'RE INSTIGATING WAR. HWAH.

171
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,676
UYAH!
UH!

172
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:57,312
UGH...

173
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,547
[MIZPHA]
RAAAAGH!

174
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,115
GAHHH!

175
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:02,983
(GRUNT)

176
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,754
[MIZPHA] UYAH! CAN YOU FEEL IT?!
MY LIFE IS ABLAZE WITH GLORY!

177
00:09:06,854 --> 00:09:09,289
I'M BURNING WITH
THE FIRE OF WAR!

178
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,892
NOW DANCE WITH ME, YOU ZOMBIE!

179
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:13,561
HWAH! HA...

180
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:15,563
[NYANTA]
"ZOMBIE"...?

181
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:17,131
[MIZPHA] WHAT ELSE
SHOULD I CALL A FREAK

182
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,899
WHO WON'T DIE!

183
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,935
[NYANTA]
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

184
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,170
VIPER STRIKE RUSH!

185
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,340
[NYANTA] HWAH, HWAH!
[MIZPHA] OH...

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,874
[MIZPHA]
YAH!

187
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:29,644
IT'S BEAUTIFUL! YOU
REALLY ARE AMAZING!

188
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,480
I MEAN... I COULD REALLY
FALL FOR YOUR SKILL!

189
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,351
BUT I ALREADY KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE THE STOMACH TO FINISH ME!

190
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,486
[NYANTA] YOU FIND AN
UNHEALTHY AMOUNT OF PRIDE

191
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,521
IN A SWORD FUELED BY MALICE!

192
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,256
[NYANTA] ZUWAH!
[MIZPHA] UGH!

193
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:43,358
EARLY BATTLE THRUST!

194
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,460
[MIZPHA] OHH...!
[NYANTA] ZUU...

195
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,261
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

196
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,464
[NYANTA] GUH!

197
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,466
HUH?

198
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,935
[NYANTA]
HUH? HUAH!

199
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:57,672
HUH?

200
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,042
[NYANTA] KAZUHIKO...

201
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,720
[DARIELLA] SPIRITUAL HYPNOTICS.

202
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,527
(CRIES, SCREAMS)

203
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,496
[NUREHA, THINKING]
THAT WAS STRANGE.

204
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:25,400
I MEAN ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS TOY WITH THEM A BIT.

205
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,470
GAINING THEIR CONFIDENCE
SHOULD'VE BEEN SIMPLE.

206
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,240
I WAS FRIENDLY. I
SHOULD'VE FIT RIGHT IN.

207
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,842
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
BE NICE TO THEM

208
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,144
AND THOSE CHILDREN
WARMED RIGHT UP TO ME.

209
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:40,247
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
EASY AFTER THAT.

210
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,917
I THOUGHT SHIROE WAS
THE ONLY SPECIAL ONE

211
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,854
I'D EVER MEET. I GUESS
I WAS WRONG... AGAIN.

212
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:50,391
I THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING TO
THEM BEING IN THE SAME GUILD...

213
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,293
WRONG ABOUT THAT, TOO.

214
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,161
[TOYA] I'M JUST
NOT SURE ABOUT YOU.

215
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,563
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS SMILING.

216
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:56,897
[DARIELLA] IF YOU THINK SO.

217
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,434
WHY WOULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME?

218
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,338
[TOYA] YOU DON'T...
HAVE TO FAKE IT, YOU KNOW.

219
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:07,475
YOU DON'T HAVE TO...
NOT AROUND ANY OF US.

220
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,877
YOU CAN BE... WHOEVER YOU ARE.

221
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:11,178
[NUREHA, THINKING] HE MIGHT BE
YOUNG,

222
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,513
BUT THAT CHILD HAS A STRONG

223
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,383
AND MIGHTY SWORD FORGED
DEEP WITHIN HIS HEART.

224
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,717
[NUREHA] HM...

225
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,653
[NUREHA, THINKING]
YES! SHIROE'S TEACHINGS ARE

226
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:21,489
THE WEAPON HE GIVES OTHERS.

227
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,359
NOW I KNOW HOW
SPECIAL HE REALLY IS!

228
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,361
[LOREILE] PRINCESS NUREHA!

229
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,595
YOU'RE MAJESTY...!

230
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,497
IT'S NO LONGER SAFE
FOR YOU TO BE HERE!

231
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,766
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO TAKE
YOU BACK TO THE PALACE?

232
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,601
[NUREHA] WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS PLACE?

233
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:36,003
NO ONE WILL BE ABLE
TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

234
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,505
WAS MIZPHA BEHIND THIS?

235
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:38,606
[LOREILE]
YES, MILADY!

236
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:39,907
[NUREHA]
I SEE...

237
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,676
[NUREHA, THINKING]
I ALLOWED HER TO DO THIS

238
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:45,346
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GIVE ANY
THOUGHT TO THE RESULTS.

239
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:50,184
I CAME OUT HERE AT HER REQUEST.
BUT TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED...

240
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,056
[NUREHA] ELIMINATE EVERY
WYVERN FROM THE SKY...

241
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:59,059
AND DESTROY THE NIGHTSHADE
SERVANTS ALONG WITH THEM.

242
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,227
HUH?

243
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,463
[LOREILE]
ARE YOU SURE, MILADY?

244
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:04,565
[NUREHA] YOUR CHIEF COUNCILOR
GAVE YOU AN ORDER.

245
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:06,033
[LOREILE]
OF COURSE!

246
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,172
[NUREHA, THINKING] MASTER
SHIROE, I'LL DO WHAT I CAN

247
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:15,175
TO GIVE YOUR JUNIOR MEMBERS
ALL THE HELP THEY NEED.

248
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:16,777
OUR TIME TOGETHER WAS SHORT,

249
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:20,581
BUT THEY EMBRACED ME WITH
WARMTH AS ONE OF THEIR OWN.

250
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,550
I WONDER IF YOU'LL
NOTICE WHAT I'M DOING...

251
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,119
WILL YOU THINK I'M
HINDERING THEM?

252
00:12:25,219 --> 00:12:27,688
OR WILL YOU BE PLEASED?

253
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,925
I GUESS IT'S JUST ANOTHER
SILLY WHIM OF MINE.

254
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,394
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
GIVING THEM A GIFT.

255
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,663
[DARIELLA, THINKING]
SO PLEASE, HURRY...

256
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,899
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE
ONE MORE TIME, SHIROE.

257
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:43,738
(HUMMING)

258
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,350
[KAZUHIKO] IT'S BEEN A
WHILE, CHIEF NYANTA...

259
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,985
THE TEA PARTY'S LONG SINCE GONE.

260
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,955
[NYANTA] OUT OF
THE WAY, KAZUHIKO!

261
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,858
I HAVE TO FINISH THIS
BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL.

262
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,228
I THINK NOT. YOU'RE
NOT GETTING PAST ME.

263
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,499
WHY ARE YOU MIXED UP WITH
THESE PEOPLE OF THE LAND?

264
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,701
[KAZUHIKO]
MY SENSE OF DUTY, OF COURSE!

265
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,637
[NYANTA, THINKING] KAZUHIKO IS
WORKING TO TURN PLANT HWYADEN

266
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,906
INTO A HEALTHY AND
PRODUCTIVE GUILD.

267
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,275
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
SHIROE‐ECCHI SAID.

268
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,643
BUT LOOKING AT HIM NOW,

269
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:25,045
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME THAT KAZUHIKO

270
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:28,148
HAS LOST TOUCH WITH HIS
INNER SENSE OF WELL‐BEING.

271
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:30,785
THERE'S SO MUCH ANGER IN HIM
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL IT.

272
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:34,422
[MIZPHA] YAHH! YOU'RE GONNA
KILL ME WITH BOREDOM! RAH!

273
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,156
HWUH!

274
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:39,126
[MIZPHA] OPERATION: RED
NIGHT IS ALREADY UNDERWAY!

275
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,529
RED NIGHT WILL KNOCK YOU
ADVENTURERS OFF

276
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,098
OF YOUR LITTLE
PEDESTALS FOR GOOD!

277
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,469
IT'S TIME TO DIE...! NOT
THAT IT'LL BOTHER YOU!

278
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,571
(GRUNTING AND GROWLING)

279
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:51,872
UWAH!

280
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,210
(GRUNT, LAUGH)

281
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,778
MIZPHA!

282
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,580
[MIZPHA] YOU'RE DISAPPOINTING
ME, ADVENTURER!

283
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,317
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE STRONGER!

284
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:04,852
PHYSICALLY YOU ARE! BUT
ALL THAT COMPASSION

285
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:08,155
IS GOING TO GET YOU
KILLED ONE OF THESE DAYS!

286
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,625
AND YOU'LL END UP
GETTING OTHERS KILLED...

287
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,461
WITH YOUR RIDICULOUS
URGE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES.

288
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,531
HWUH! UYAHHHH

289
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:19,534
YES! THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANNA SEE!

290
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,101
(GROWLING)

291
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,908
[KAZUHIKO]
MIZPHA, PLAYTIME'S OVER.

292
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,944
[MIZPHA] YOU HAD NO
RIGHT TO DO THAT!

293
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:32,046
YOU'RE A WATCHDOG, KAZUHIKO!

294
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:34,915
[KAZUHIKO] THE PRINCESS HAS
GIVEN ME DIRECT ORDERS.

295
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:37,151
AND EVERYONE IN PLANT HWYADEN
IS GOING TO FOLLOW HER ORDERS

296
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,354
WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT!
[MIZPHA] UNNPH!

297
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:42,690
[KAZUHIKO] STAND DOWN! THIS
OPERATION IS BEING CANCELLED.

298
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,860
(IRRITATED GROWL)

299
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:51,499
[NYANTA] KAZUHIKO, WHAT IN THE
HELL IS PLANT HWYADEN DOING?

300
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,767
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE‐

301
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:54,369
I DON'T NEED TO
TELL YOU ANYTHING!

302
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:57,037
[KAZUHIKO] UWAH!
(NYANTA GRUNTING)

303
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,340
[KAZUHIKO, THINKING] THIS IS

NOT WITH THE ODDS WE'RE FACING.

345
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,415
BUT I'LL LEND YOU MY VOICE
AND MY STRINGS

346
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,117
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE ALL IMPORTANT TO ME!

I'LL DO WHAT I CAN,
AND HOPE IT HELPS.

348
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,590
MUSIC IS SUCH A MINOR,
LITTLE THING...

349
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,859
IT CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH...

350
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,027
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU
SING

351
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:34,795
ABOUT WANTING TO
CHANGE THE WORLD.

352

WE ALL HAVE TO PLAY A PART!

353
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,467
YOU CAN BE THE GREATEST
MUSICIAN THERE EVER WAS!

354
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:43,103
BUT SONGS, ON THEIR OWN, CAN'T
REALLY BRING PEACE TO THE WORLD.

355
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:46,106
AND THAT'S FINE...
BUT EVEN SO...

356
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:48,309
I'M GOING TO SING FOR YOU...

357
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:51,111
I KNOW WHAT MAKES YOU WHAT
YOU ARE AND I KNOW WHAT

358
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,881
YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT
NOW... I REALLY DO!

359
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:59,787
SONGS ARE PRAYERS THAT
ARE HEARD AND ANSWERED!

360
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,022
I KNOW THE FEELING ALL TOO WELL.

361
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,659
MY FRIENDS, MY FAMILY WERE
ALWAYS TELLING ME

362
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,127
TO HANG IN THERE,
AND TO NOT GIVE UP.

363
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:10,064
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER
BECOME A MUSICIAN...

364
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:11,599
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH,

365
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:15,936
I SWEAR I'LL LOVE MUSIC EVERY
DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

366
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:19,106
RUDY DID EVERYTHING HE COULD
TO BECOME AN ADVENTURER.

367
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:22,109
IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER IF
IT WAS REALLY POSSIBLE...

368
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:25,780
HE FOUGHT AND HE FOUGHT AGAINST
THE INJUSTICES OF THE WORLD!

369
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,682
SO I GUESS I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO KNOW

370
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,850
IF I'M A NATURAL BORN
MUSICIAN OR NOT.

371
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,354

CLOSER TO MYSELF.

TO GET ALL THE
PEOPLE OUT OF TOWN!

WOLFY HAS A REALLY GOOD NOSE!

380
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,037

ABLE TO FIND EVERYBODY

381
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,772
AND GET THEM
TO SAFETY.
