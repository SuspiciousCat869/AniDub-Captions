BUT THAT IS RIDICULOUS!

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,149
[FEDERICO]
RUSEATO OF THE SEVENTH GARDEN...

HE'S THE SPITTING IMAGE OF
THE BOSS FROM THE HEILOS RAID!

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,422
[NAOTSUGU]
LET'S BREEZE THROUGH THIS

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,324
SO WE CAN CHOW DOWN
ON SOME CHICKEN.

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,592
[SHIROE]
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,860
"BREEZE THROUGH" ANYTHING...

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,862
[WILLIAM] BUT WE MIGHT

00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,876
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] THIS IS...
THIS IS PURE INSANITY!

157
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:56,843
AGGHHHHH!!!

158
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,144
HAHHHH!!!

159
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,785
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS WORKING...

160
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,487
WE NEED TO BE GOING AFTER
THAT GIANT FREAKING KNIGHT!

161
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,756
WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE THE SHADOW
VANGUARD!

162
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,893
IF WE LET 'EM GET PAST US!
THEY'LL KILL OUR HEALERS!

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:13,960
WE CAN'T BREAK UP.

164
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,763
WE WON'T HAVE A PARTY LEFT
TO HIT THIS GUY!

165
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,565
[SHIROE]
IT'S A NUMBERS GAME...

166
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,801
[NAOTSUGU] MM?
[DEMICAS] HMM....

167
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,636
[SHIROE] THE NUMBER OF
SHADOW VANGUARD THAT APPEAR

168
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,505
IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

169
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,207
THAT CAUSE DAMAGE TO RUSEATO
IN BLACK KNIGHT MODE.

170
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,309
[NAOTSUGU]
OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO?

171
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,611
[SHIROE]
WE DO THIS...

172
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,746
WE ONLY LET OUR HEAVY
HITTERS TAKE HIM ON.

173
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,014
WE'LL TRAIN HIS FOCUS...

174
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,116
EVERYONE ELSE WILL
TAKE ON SUPPORT ROLES.

175
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,350
HYAH!

176
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,619
HWAH!

177
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,655
[SHIROE] THAT SHOULD CONTROL THE
NUMBER OF SHADOW VANGUARD,

178
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,924
ONLY RE‐SPAWNING TEN NEXT TIME.

179
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,594
[JUNZO] LET 'EM GET MAD,
BUT DON'T KILL 'EM THIS TIME!

180
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,763
[DEMICAS]
YEAH I KNOW! (GRUNT)

181

(GROWL)

182
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,200
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

183
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,504
BUT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
BEAT HIM LIKE I AM NOW.

184
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,241
NO. I CAN'T FORGIVE
HIM FOR WHAT HE DID.

185
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,109
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA KICK HIS ASS.

186
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,279
EVERYONE'S GONNA SEE IT.
AND I'M GONNA LOVE IT.

187
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,614
I'M GONNA RIP HIS GLASSES OFF

188
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,382
AND SMASH THAT
SMUG FACE OF HIS...

189
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,953
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE NAP
AND CRUSH HIM ALL OVER AGAIN!

190
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,255
[ENKARTANTO] LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
GOT HIM DOWN TO HALF HIS HEALTH!

191
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,824
[TOKO] GREAT!
I THINK WE GOT THIS GUYS.

192
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,959
HEH...

193
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,594
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
I'M GONNA GET STRONGER.

194
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,863
AND GET EPIC ITEMS ON THIS RAID.

195
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:27,067
YOU JUST WAIT... YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURS, AND GET IT GOOD!

196

IT'S IBRA HABRA!

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,582
ANOTHER RAID BOSS?

THIS ISN'T GOOD...

00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,853
THERE ARE THREE OF THEM?

[PROROCCA] THEY CAN'T DO THAT!
THEY CAN'T DO THAT!

TO BE ONE RAID BOSS‐‐

ONLY ONE BOSS PER ZONE!

00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,769
A QUEST THAT'S NOT MEANT
TO BE BEATEN?

HUH?

00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,806
ISN'T THIS...

234
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,475
... MY HOMETOWN?

235
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,746
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE.

236
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,783
HUH?

237
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,622
I CAN'T READ IT... IT WAS A
RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:07,160
OH, I GET IT. THIS IS WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO LOSE ONE OF MY MEMORIES.

00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,368
[SHIROE, THINKING]
THAT'S RIGHT. I DIED.

240
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,609
IT'S NOT LIKE THE TOWN I GREW UP
IN WAS ALL THAT SPECIAL ANYWAY.

241
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,611
YOU COULD EAT AND
SLEEP AND WORK HERE,

242
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,446
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANTED
TO GET SOMETHING,

243
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:29,816
YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO SHIBUYA
OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT.

244
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,153
I'M A NORMAL GUY,
FROM A SMALL TOWN.

245
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,789
NOT MUCH MORE TO IT
THAN THAT, REALLY.

(KEYS JINGLING, DOOR LOCKING)

249
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,547
THAT'S ME.

250
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,320
SINCE BOTH OF MY PARENTS WORKED,

251
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,556
I HAD A TENDENCY TO
SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE

252
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:12,025
AND WALK AROUND TOWN AT NIGHT.

253
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,395
EVEN WHEN I WAS GOING TO BED,

254
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,731
I WAS DEALING WITH DEPRESSION
AND BAD FEELINGS

255
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,800
WHEN I WAS BY MYSELF.

256
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,836
I WAS AFRAID OF GOING
DOWNTOWN...

257
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:24,971
SO INSTEAD...

258
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:31,912
I SPENT A LOT OF SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS ON THIS BENCH.

259
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,947
WHENEVER I FELT BAD
ABOUT SOMETHING,

260
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,248
SPENDING THE NIGHT OUT HERE

261
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,918
WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT HELPED ME FORGET.

262
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,453
[SHIROE]
WAIT! THAT'S IT!

263
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,556
NOW I KNOW WHY I CAME HERE.

264
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,160
I'M DEALING WITH
ANOTHER FAILURE AGAIN.

265
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,333
[SHIROE, THINKING]
ALL THE ADULTS I KNEW

266
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,368
COMPLIMENTED ME
ON BEING "GROWN‐UP."

267
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,238
YEAH, I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF
KEEPING QUIET

268
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,073
AND UNDERSTANDING
WHAT THEY SAID...

269
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,243
BUT WHAT DID I LOSE BY NOT BEING
LIKE THE OTHER KIDS AROUND ME;

270
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,912
ACTING HIGH AND
MIGHTY ALL THE TIME?

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,481
(SIGH)

272
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,853
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I'VE MADE SO MANY MISTAKES.

273
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,355
AND I PUSHED ALL MY
POTENTIAL FRIEND AWAY.

274
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,959
THEY OFFERED. I REFUSED, AND
CRAWLED FURTHER INTO MY SHELL.

275
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,528
AND I KEPT WALKING AWAY FROM
THE ONE PLACE

276
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,930
I NEEDED TO BE
PART OF THE GROUP.

277
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,032
MY FAMILY.

278
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,068
HOW HARD WAS IT ON MY PARENTS
TO WORK LIKE THEY DID

279
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,770
JUST TO HAVE A KID WHO WASN'T
REALLY THERE,

280
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,038
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T THERE?

281
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,275
I MADE A LOT OF LITTLE MISTAKES,

282
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,712
BUT PUNISHED MYSELF FOR THEM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

283
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,381
I'D COME HERE TO CRY EVERY TIME
I SCREWED UP IN SCHOOL.

284
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,385
I SWORE EVERY SINGLE TIME NOT TO
REPEAT MY MISTAKES...

285
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,554
AND I DID, ANYWAY.

286
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,290
YOU LEARN A LOT
ABOUT YOURSELF...

287
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,393
YOU LEARN THINGS THAT YOU WANTED
TO KNOW AND DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

288
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,329
AND IT DOESN'T GET EASIER EACH
TIME IT HAPPENS EITHER.

289
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,165
SO MOST OF US DON'T WANNA
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

290
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,038
[SHIROE, THINKING] OKAY, SO THIS
IS WHAT IT MEANS TO DIE HERE.

291
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:10,410
DEATH DOESN'T HAPPEN UNTIL YOU
ACTUALLY WANT TO DIE!

292
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:14,380
AND WELL, I CAN'T SAY I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT IT A FEW TIMES.

293
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,017
I REMEMBER THROWING ALL MY
PRECIOUS NOTEBOOKS AWAY ONCE...

294
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,586
OR JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME I SAID
GOODBYE TO MY FOLKS

295
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,387
WITH THAT FAKE SMILE OF MINE.

296
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,024
OR THE NIGHT WE PARTED
AT THE LIBRARY.

297
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:28,361
I GUESS THAT MEANS,
I'VE DIED A LOT ALREADY.

298
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,965
WHAT WAS DEMICAS THINKING WHEN
HE KICKED ME OUT OF THE WAY?

299
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,637
WHY DID WILLIAM SAY YES TO ME
WITHOUT HEARING ME OUT FIRST?

300
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,440
AND YOU WOULD THINK NAOTSUGU
WOULD'VE HAD BETTER SENSE

301
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,208
THAN TO FOLLOW ME HERE!

302
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,946
I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS,

303
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,048
NOT KNOWING WHERE I AM
OR WHAT I'M DOING.

304
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:51,084
THEY'RE JUST HANGING BY
A THREAD RIGHT NOW.

305
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,087
[MINORI]
THERE MIGHT BE A SPY FROM MINAMI

306
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,856
IN THE CITY SOMEWHERE.

307
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,090
A LEAK FROM ANY ONE OF US,

308
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,159
NO MATTER HOW "SMALL"
OR "HARMLESS,"

309
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,627
COULD CAUSE A PROBLEM.

310
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,095
[SHIROE]
THAT'S RIGHT.

311
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,065
[SHIROE, THINKING] HONESTLY,
IF THERE ARE SPIES FROM MINAMI,

312
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,967
THEY'RE THE LEAST
OF MY WORRIES.

313
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,302
SO FAR, I'VE ONLY SEEN

314
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,037
ADVENTURERS AND
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

315
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,106
BUT THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE HERE.

316
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,342
THERE'S AN UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY

317
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,580
THAT BROUGHT US TO THIS PLACE
FOR SOME REASON.

318
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,348
I'VE BEEN USING THE CONNECTIONS
OF THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE

319
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,785
TO SNOOP AROUND AND
FIND OUT THE REAL IDENTITY

320
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,054
OF THE PERSON OR
THING THAT DID IT.

321
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,524
I ASKED RODERICK TO INVESTIGATE
WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON

322
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,626
WITH FLAVOR TEXT IMBUING
OBJECTS WITH POWER.

323
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,061
AND I ASKED SOJIRO TO SEE IF
ANY OF THE MONSTERS

324
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,031
STARTED CHANGING BEHAVIOR.

325
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,433
I HAVE MICHITAKA EXAMINING
PLANTS TO THE SOUTH AND

326
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,235
KARASHIN IS COLLECTING
AND ASSEMBLING

327
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,738
A LIBRARY OF EASTAL'S FOLKTALES.

328
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,072
OF COURSE, ME BEING ME,

329
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,609
I NEVER REALLY TOLD THEM
WHY I WANTED IT DONE.

330
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,244
[SHIROE]
HMMM....

331
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,948
[SHIROE, THINKING]
AND AT LEAST, UP TO THIS POINT,

332
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,350
THERE'S NOTHING IN WHAT THEY'VE
GATHERED SO FAR THAT SHOWS US

333
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,253
THE FACE OF THE THIRD PARTY
I'M LOOKING FOR.

334
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,989
HOWEVER...

335
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,125
IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE
TOO COINCIDENTAL

336
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,993
THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE
POINTS IN THE DIRECTION.

337
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,630
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
SOMEONE PLANTED IT.

338
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,369
[SHIROE]
MPH...

339
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,705
[SHIROE, THINKING] I SUPPOSE
THAT'S JUST AN EXCUSE, RIGHT?

340
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,741
EVEN THOUGH I KEPT IT TO MYSELF
SO THEY WOULDN'T WORRY,

341
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:22,208
I'M STILL PUTTING EVERYONE OUT.

342
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,778
(SIGH) I'M NOT SURE
I DESERVE THEIR TRUST.

343
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,549
NAOTSUGU AND AKATSUKI
WAITED FOR ME BACK THEN,

344
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,651
AND NOW EVERYONE ELSE
IS WAITING FOR ME.

345
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,386
IT'S MY FAULT THERE'S
A DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

346
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,955
I SHOULD HAVE INVOLVED THEM MORE

347
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,690
AND TOLD THEM
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

348
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,324
AND THEN THERE WAS KINJO...

349
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,196
I DIDN'T TRUST HIM EITHER.
SO I KEPT MY THOUGHTS BURIED.

350
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,031
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
WHAT I WANTED

351
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,300
AND LET HIM HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

352
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,838
HMPH...

353
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,244
YEAH...

354
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,614
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

355
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:03,617
I SHOULD BE GETTING OUT
OF HERE, SHOULDN'T I?

356
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,322
YOU CAN ONLY SPEND SO MUCH TIME

357
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,158
HANGING OUT ON A BENCH
WITH YOURSELF.

358
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,437
UH? OH...

359
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,673
EARTH...

360
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:31,111
SO I'M GUESSING THIS
IS THE MOON, RIGHT?

361
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,185
MARE TRANQUILLITATIS?
THE "SEA OF TRANQUILLITY."

362
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,321
IT REALLY IS THE MOON!

363
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,224
SO WHAT AM I DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

364
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,860
WAS THIS REALLY THE TEST SERVER?

365
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,130
MANAGEMENT FOR THE ELDER TALES
GAME WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN

366
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,167
THIRTEEN SERVERS THAT COVERED
ALL OF THE REGIONS.

367
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,136
THE TEST SERVER IS NOT
OFFICIALLY INCLUDED

368
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:59,372
IN THE THIRTEEN, MAKING IT
THE FOURTEENTH SERVER.

369
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,274
[SHIROE] I KNOW SOMEONE
ON THE INTERNET

370
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,743
SAID IT WAS ON THE MOON,

371
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:05,211
BUT I NEVER BELIEVED THEM.

372
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,467
[SHIROE] I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS QUIET.

373
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,469
[AKATSUKI]
YEAH...

374
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,872
OH...

375
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,841
AH!

376
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,876
I THINK I...

377
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,745
I LOST PART OF MYSELF.

378
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:18,218
DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?
OR FEEL IT, MY LORD?

379
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:25,959
[SHIROE]
HERE, AKATSUKI.

380
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,694
YEAH, OKAY.

381
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,410
INCREDIBLE, ISN'T IT?

382
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,681
[AKATSUKI] LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

383
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:48,715
[SHIROE] YEAH.

384
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,450
[AKATSUKI]
THOSE ARE... THEY'RE MEMORIES?

385
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:52,218
[SHIROE]
EVERY TIME A PLAYER HAS DIED,

386
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,587
THEY'VE OFFERED A MEMORY

387
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,389
SO THEY COULD STAND UP
ONE MORE TIME.

388
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,927
SO I'M GUESSING YOU GOT
KILLED ON YOUR MISSION?

389
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,462
UH...?

390
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,365
[SHIROE] YEAH WELL... THE SAME
THING HAPPENED TO ME.

391
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,333
AND NOW WE'RE BOTH DEAD.

392
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,135
[AKATSUKI]
YOU TOO, MY LORD?

393
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,504
[SHIROE]
MM‐HM.

394
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:13,473
[AKATSUKI] THIS HAS TO BE

395
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,610
THE STRANGEST CHRISTMAS EVE
EVER, MY LORD. REALLY.

396
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:23,517
HUH? EH. EHEH...

397
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:28,054
[SHIROE]
I'VE COMPLETELY FAILED.

398
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,990
I DON'T THINK I
PLANNED WELL ENOUGH.

399
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,758
I DIDN'T TRUST ANYONE.

400
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,394
[AKATSUKI] I'M NOT REALLY SURE
I UNDERSTAND, MY LORD.

401
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,430
SOMEHOW I'M NOT ALL THAT
UPSET ABOUT LOSING MY BATTLE.

402
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:38,999
[SHIROE]
A MYRIAD OF THINGS

403
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,667
KEPT ME FROM DOING
WHAT I PLANNED TO DO.

404
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,637
AND IT WOUND UP
GETTING ME KILLED.

405
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,509
YOU MIGHT HAVE DIED OUT THERE
TONIGHT, AKATSUKI,

406
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,910
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS...

407
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,614
YOU STILL HAVEN'T LOST
YOUR FIGHT! NOT EVEN CLOSE.

408
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:57,751
IT'S OKAY.
I'M DISAPPOINTED, TOO.

409
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,853
BUT I KNOW YOU,
AND HOW HARD YOU WORK.

410
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:03,389
SO I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET UP AND FINISH THIS!

411
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,025
[SHIROE, THINKING]
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK...?

412
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,594
I THINK WE'VE BOTH GOTTA GET UP
AND TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT.

413
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,530
[SHIROE]
IT'S ALL SO STRANGE.

414
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,432
I NEVER IMAGINED I'D END UP
SEEING YOU OUT HERE LIKE THIS.

415
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,468
[AKATSUKI] HEH, YES, MY LORD.
IT IS STRANGE.

416
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,907
YOU KNOW, MY LORD?
I NEED TO GO BACK AGAIN.

417
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,443
I THINK I SHOULD GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT TOO,

418
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:25,679
AND USE EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE.

419
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,081
[AKATSUKI]
SHALL WE?

420
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,083
MHM.

421
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,693
MPH...

422
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:44,064
[SHIROE, THINKING] AND THAT'S...
IS WHEN I CAME BACK TO LIFE.

423
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,824
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
RAW EMOTIONS ARE FULLY EXPOSED.

424
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,694
WHAT ELSE IS LEFT?
WHAT CAN BE DONE?

425
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,696
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE: NOTHING.

426
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,899
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS,
HE PUSHES FORWARD.

427
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,135
IT'S THE PATH HE CHOSE.
AND THERE IS NO WAY BACK.

428
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:30,604
HE WILL TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN

429
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,707
UNTIL HIS BANNER IS
PLANTED INTO THE SOIL.

430
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:36,176
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
