A RAID PARTY

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,665
IS A MASSIVE ASSAULT ON AN
OBJECTIVE BY A LARGE GROUP

4
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:09,501
OF ADVENTURERS THAT
GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,437
THE USUAL PARTY OF SIX.

6
00:00:12,537 --> 00:00:14,872
THE MOST COMMON RAID PARTY
IS THE FULL RAID,

7
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,441
WHICH TAKES
FOUR GROUPS OF SIX

8
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,377
AND COMBINES THEM
INTO ONE FIGHTING UNIT.

9
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,613
THIS LET'S THE
PLAYERS EXPERIENCE

A FULL RANGE OF COMBAT AS WELL
AS GET THE BEST REWARDS.

11
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:26,984
HOWEVER, YOU CAN'T JUST
HAVE HIGH‐LEVEL PLAYERS

12
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,287
WITH OUTSTANDING EQUIPMENT
TO MAKE A GOOD RAID PARTY.

13
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:32,890
YOU MUST ANALYZE YOUR ENEMY AND
HAVE A WELL‐PLANNED STRATEGY.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,692
OF COURSE,
THE PLAYERS YOU CHOOSE

15
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,095
HAVE TO HAVE SOLID TEAMWORK
TO PULL THE RAID OFF.

16
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,864
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN JUST
PICK A BUNCH OF RANDOM PEOPLE

17
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:41,033
AND GO FOR IT.

18
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,800
AND IT DOESN'T HURT IF
THE MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,303
HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED
DEATH AND RESURRECTION TOGETHER.

20

AND THE BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS
FOR PURE COMBAT POWER.

ESTABLISHING THE
ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.

THINK YOU CAN TALK IT ALL OUT.

WHATEVER YOU DO,
DO IT WITHOUT US.

TO MOVE TO SUSUKINO,

IN SEARCH OF RAIDS MORE
WORTHY OF THEIR SKILLS.

DOWN IN THE LOWEST LEVELS
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

A FULLY PARTY RAID...

GO IN THERE WITH 24 PLAYERS.

BUT NOT EVERYONE WE HAVE.

ADVANCE RECON OF THE AREA.

TAKEN CARE OF THAT.

THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE

00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:05,063
SO WHAT DID YOU SEE?

83
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:07,132
THE TOP LEVEL
HAD SLIME MONSTERS,

84
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:10,702
AND THEY WERE EASILY
FIVE METERS ACROSS.

85
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,070
NOW, I'M ONLY
THINKING OUT LOUD HERE,

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,371
BUT BASED ON THE ORAL TRADITIONS

00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,273
AND THE LAYOUT OF
THIS "SHAFT" STRUCTURE...

88

TO BE FACING MYTHICAL BEASTS.

00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,313
ALRIGHT.
SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,015
WORKING OUT OF
SUSUKINO AS A BASE,

91
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,283
WE'VE GOTTEN USED TO
SUCH ADVERSARIES.

92
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:28,253
HOWEVER, MY GUILD ISN'T
AS STRONG AS YOU'D THINK.

93
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:28,853
HUH?

HERE BEFORE, OLD TIMER?

96
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,993
[REGAN] OH MANY TIMES!

97
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,095
I HEARD THINGS FELL APART
AFTER THE "APOCALYPSE",

98
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,796
BUT IT SEEMS BETTER NOW...

99
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:41,499
I'M BETTING HAVING THE SILVER
SWORD AROUND HAS HELPED A LOT.

100
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,802
YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE A RAID
GUILD WITH A LOT OF DISCIPLINE.

101
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,171

102

103
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,242
[REGAN]
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

104
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,711
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE
THOSE HOODLUMS WENT?

105
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,647

BUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

106
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,082

HAVE THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS

107
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,350

UP AND RUNNING.

108

110
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,588
I'M PRETTY SURE
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET

111
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:05,423
EVERYONE TO COME
WITH US...

112
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:07,392
YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED A NUMBER
OF PEOPLE SQUATTING IN GUILDS

113
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,195
JUST TO KEEP THEMSELVES
SAFE FROM ENEMIES OR MONSTERS.

114
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,797
IN OTHER WORDS,
THEY'VE BASICALLY RETIRED.

115
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:14,332
THEY MIGHT BE UP
FOR A MILD RAID,

116
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:16,734
BUT NOTHING THAT PUTS
THEM IN REAL DANGER.

117
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,436
AND THIS RAID YOU'VE
COME TO ME WITH,

118
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,406
IT COULD BE THE TOUGHEST THE
SYSTEM'S EVER PUT TOGETHER.

119
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,609
WE NEED LEVEL NINETY‐FIVES, AND
WE'LL BE LUCKY TO GET TWENTY.

120
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,845
SO TELL ME, ARE THEY TRYING
TO PROTECT THEIR MEMORIES?

121
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,747
[WILLIAM] HMMM... POSSIBLY...

122
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,083
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE

123
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,784
SAY ANYTHING OUT LOUD
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

124
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,520
MOST OF MY PEOPLE THINK IT'S
A RIDICULOUS IDEA ANYWAY.

125
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,090
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY'RE AFRAID OF IT.

126
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,957
I'M NOT SURE
I UNDERSTAND.

127
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:42,995
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
DIED SINCE YOU GOT HERE?

128

SINCE THE APOCALYPSE?

129
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:47,099
I HAVEN'T... REALLY BEEN
THROUGH IT YET.

130
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,237
I'M NOT SURE I CAN
EXPLAIN IT, BUT I'LL TRY.

131
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:55,307
YOU LEARN A LOT
ABOUT YOURSELF...

132
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:56,908
YOU LEARN THINGS
THAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW

133
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,543
AND THINGS YOU
DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

134
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,113
AND IT DOESN'T GET EASIER
EACH TIME IT HAPPENS EITHER.

135
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,182
SO MOST OF US DON'T WANNA
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

FEW MYSELF, JUST IN CASE.

WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

148

I'M KINDA PLAYIN' IT
BY EAR, YOU KNOW?

00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:38,416
THAT HARDLY TELL ME
ANYTHING, MASTER!

150
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:41,053
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
IN YOUR MAGICKY TALK.

151
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,755
I JUST NEED SOME DUDES,
KEEP AN EYE OUT.

152
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,223
I WAS THINKING
OF HELPING YOU,

153
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:47,225
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

154
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:48,326
THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST

155
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,727
TAKE CARE OF THINGS
AROUND HERE?

156
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,396
(CHUCKLES)
THAT WORKS FOR ME!

157
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,298
MY SKILLS AS A RESEARCHER
ARE BETTER SUITED

158
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,633
TO FINDING OUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THIS CITY.

159
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,335
[TETORA] AW, DANGIT!
[BOTH] HM?

160
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,171
[NAOTSUGU]
NICE PANTIES!

161
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,139
WELL FOR ONCE
I MUST AGREE WITH YOU.

162
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:02,907
A FELLOW
PANTY FAN, NICE!

163
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:04,476
I AM INDEED!

164
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,512
I UNDERSTAND ADVENTURERS ALSO
REFER TO THEM AS "BLOOMERS" OR

165
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,482
PANTALOONS OR
"HOT PANTS," IF YOU WILL.

166
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:12,184
IF YOU'LL PARDON ME,
IT SEEMS SUCH NAMES

167
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,186
MIGHT DISPARAGE
SOMETHING SO DELIGHTFUL.

168
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,687
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

169
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,422
I HOLD THEM IN THE
HIGHEST REGARD!

170
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:19,391
AS A TRUE ADMIRER OF
LADY'S UNDERWEAR I CAN‐

171
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,026
WAUUUGHHHH!

172
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,195
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

173
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,901
[AKATSUKI] I GUESS THAT'S
ENOUGH PRACTICE FOR TODAY.

174
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,236
[NAOTSUGU] WH‐WHAT WAS THAT?!

175
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,005
THE LITTLE SHRIMP
PUT A CURSE ON ME.

176
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,140
A CURSE? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN BY THAT?

177
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,209
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME ABOUT IT,

178
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,444
AND DON'T LEAVE OUT ANY
DETAILS, IF YOU PLEASE.

179
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:40,945
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU'RE WAY TOO HAPPY, DUDE!

180
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,980
[TETORA]
GET ME OUTTA HERE, YOU MORONS!

181
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,981
AH!

182
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,683
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

183
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:47,785
YOUR FINE CURVES
DISTRACTED US.

184
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,723
IT'D BE A CRYING SHAME FOR ALL
MY LOVE‐STRUCK FANS OUT THERE

185
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,858
IF MY BEAUTIFUL FACE WAS
BLEMISHED IN A SNOW BANK.

186
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,560
DID SHE ACTUALLY SAY THAT?

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,496
IT WOULD APPEAR OUR NEW FRIEND
IS QUITE FULL OF HERSELF.

188
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,564
GAH!

189
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,365
YOU KNOW WHAT, GRAMPS?

190
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:01,799
THE MORE I GET
TO KNOW YA,

191
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,268
THE MORE I'M STARTING
TO LIKE YA! HAHA

192
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,902
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

193
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:05,837
UH‐HUH!

194
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:06,804
I CAN HEAR YOU, Y'KNOW!

195
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,173
HUH?
AH, SHE'S RECOVERED.

196
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:10,775
I'M TETORA, THE STAR
SHINING IN THE NIGHT SKY!

197
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:15,180
SYMBOL OF DIVINE BEAUTY...
THE GALAXY‐STYLE STARLET!

198
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,948
OR JUST "TETORA",
IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

199
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,650
TETORA, HUH?
HM... SURE,

200
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,585
YOU MIGHT BE CUTE
AND EVERYTHING...

201
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,154
BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN
HELL I'M ADMITTING TO IT

202
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,056
WHEN YOU'RE ALL
STUCK UP LIKE THAT.

203
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,923
IF I HAD TO TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT EVERYTHING

204
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,226
I'M SEEING AND HEARING
FROM YOU SO FAR...

205
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:31,963
THERE'S NO CONTEST!
THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS...

206
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,799
IS THE LOVELY AND
GRACIOUS MARIELLE!

207
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,035
MARIELLE! MARIELLE!

208
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,170
[BOTH]
HUH?

209
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,771
UH, SORRY
'BOUT THAT...

210
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,173
[NAOTSUGU]
HERE YOU GO.

211
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,341
OKAY, THANKS...

212
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,046
[NAOTSUGU] INTERESTING,
SHE'S LEVELED UP TO 92,

213
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:51,183
JUST LIKE ME AND SHIROE
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE.

214
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:53,785
[NAOTSUGU] SHE MIGHT NOT BE
THAT BAD, ACTUALLY.

215
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,220
LOOK, MISTER...

216
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,988
I KNOW I DO A LOT TO KEEP
MYSELF LOOKING AMAZING...

217
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,656
BUT YOU NEED TO STOP STARING.

218
00:09:58,756 --> 00:09:59,991
I WASN'T
STARING AT YOU!

219
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,393
OH I KNOW YOU
CAN'T HELP IT.

220
00:10:01,493 --> 00:10:03,161
GORGEOUS HOTTIES LIKE
ME ARE CONSTANTLY

221
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,829
SPEWING OUT PHEROMONES,
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?!

222
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,100
FACE IT, YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME
WHENEVER YOU SMELL ME.(HUMS)

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,102
THIS MIGHT BE A BAD
TIME TO TELL YOU,

224
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:11,403
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE EMITTING

225
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:12,937
SOMETHING OTHER
THAN PHEROMONES.

226
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,239
ACK!

227
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,973
OH MAN! NOW THAT'S
WHAT I CALL A ZINGER!

228
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,575
CHALK ONE UP
FOR STINKY!

229
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,777
[TETORA] STARLETS DO NOT
DO SUCH THINGS, SIR!

230
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,747
[TETORA] THAT WAS VERY IMPOLITE
OF YOU, YOU WRINKLED OLD TOAD!

231
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,382
DID YOU CALL ME A TOAD?!

232
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,318
AND SINCE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
IN LOVE WITH ME,

233
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,186
I'LL LET YOU CARRY ME,
MISTER ARMOR.

234
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,055
[NAOTSUGU]
H‐HEY! GET OFF! WHA‐

235
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,289
EH‐HEHH! I DON'T THINK SO.

236
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,325
OH, I JUST LOVE SEEING
HOW MEN FREAK OUT

237
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,559
AND GET ALL GOOEY AND STUPID

238
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:36,361
WHENEVER I RUB
ALL OVER THEM. Y'KNOW...

239
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,096
AND YOU BETTER
MIND YOUR MANNERS,

240
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,731
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN GUYS
DO IT BACK TO ME!

241
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,900
[NAOTSUGU] ERK! IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, DON'T DO IT!

242
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,069
[TETORA] ALLEY‐OOP
[NAOTSUGU] WOAH!

243
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,737
(GIGGLE)

244
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:47,972
[NAOTSUGU, MUFFLED]
OKAY, FINE, YOU'RE IN...

245
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,174
HUH?

246
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,076
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A WISE IDEA?

247
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:53,011
REMEMBER I'M GOING
WITH MY GUT HERE.

248
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,679
HMM?

249
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,515
(SEETHING)

250
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,452
[VOINEN]
I THINK THEY'LL BE FINE.

251
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,720
[FEDERICO] THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD
TIME TO TAKE A BREAK OUT BACK.

252
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,656
[WAITRESS]
UH! (EXHALES)

253
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:06,058
HMPH.

254
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:07,492
[DEMICAS] LISTEN TO ME
YOU ARROGANT PRICK...

255
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,295
WE'VE GOT UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

256
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,499
[DEMICAS] LAST WE MET,

257
00:11:14,599 --> 00:11:16,301
YOU WERE HAVING SOME
TROUBLE WITH MY NAME.

258
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,569
REMEMBER IT NOW?

259
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:20,538
[SHIROE] OF COURSE I DO,
MISTER DUMMY FACE.

260
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,441
[DEMICAS] WELL GET OUTTA THAT
CHAIR! WE'RE TAKIN' IT OUTSIDE!

261
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,143
[SHIROE] OH, I THINK
I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

262
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,112
I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS.

263
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,314
[WILLIAM] KNOCK IT OFF, DEMICAS.
[DEMICAS] HUH?

264
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,149
SHIROE'S HERE AS
MY GUEST, UNDERSTAND?

265
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,518
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN...!
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM PAY‐

266
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,153
[WILLIAM]
HE DEFEATED YOU, RIGHT?

267
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,254
UWAH! (GRUNT)

268
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,023
YOU HAD A FIGHT.
YOU LOST.

269
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:40,025
YOU GOT RESURRECTED.
GET OVER IT.

270
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,726
COME ON!

271
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,529
I HAVEN'T HAD MY EXERCISE YET...
WHATTYA SAY?

272
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,933
[DEMICAS] HHRGH...
(SHAKY EXHALE)

273
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,437
I KNOW FOR A FACT HE'D JUST
EMBARRASS YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

274
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:56,141
I PICKED UP NEW RAID ITEMS,
IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME FIGHT.

275
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,010
AND RELYING ON EQUIPMENT
IS EXACTLY WHY

276
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,311
YOU WOULDN'T WIN IN A REMATCH.

277
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:01,979
I'M GONNA CUT YOU
INTO PIECES?!

278
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,750
SO TELL ME WHICH ONE YOU PREFER:
HAMBURGER OR MINCED CUTLETS?

279
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,152
THEY'RE BOTH TASTY,

280
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:09,554
AS LONG AS I MARINADE THEM IN
SOME DEMI‐WHATEVER‐IT‐IS SAUCE.

281
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:11,389
URGH! YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A
HARD TIME RUNNING THAT MOUTH

282
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,325
WITHOUT ANY DAMN TEETH!

283
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,493
WELL THAT'S NOT VERY NICE,
MISTER DEMI‐DING‐DONG.

284
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,429
(GRUNTS)
(WILLIAM CHUCKLES)

285
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,864
YOU ARE REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF!

286
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:21,766
DON'T GET BENT OUT OF
SHAPE, DEMI‐DINGLEBERRY.

287
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,768
I'M GONNA RIP YOUR HEAD OFF!
(DOOR OPENS)

288
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,537
[TETORA] AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW
IT, HALF THE GUYS IN BRIGANDIA

289
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:27,705
WENT TO THE GUILD‐HALL HERE
AND JUST BAILED ON HIM!

290
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,242
I CAN'T BLAME THEN REALLY.
SOME CAT PIRATE GUY,

291
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,477
WHO WASN'T EVEN IN A GUILD,
KICKED THEIR BUTTS.

292
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,113
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, THEIR
LEAD STRATEGIST, LONDARK,

293
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,582
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
TO LEAVE AND GO WEST.

294
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,584
[NAOTSUGU]
OK, SO WHAT HAPPENED TO DEMICAS?

295
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,453
[TETORA] DEMI‐POO AND
WHAT'S LEFT OF BRIGANDIA

296
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,855
ARE ALL UNDERLINGS
OF SILVER SWORD NOW!

297
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,157
THAT'S HOW WE FINALLY GOT

298
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,924
A LITTLE CHANCE AT
PEACE IN SUSUKINO.

299
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,393
GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE.

300
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,562
OH YEAH! YOU HAVE GOT
TO MEET HIS WIFE.

301
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,564
SHE'S AN AWESOME LADY
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER.

302
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,599
MARRIED?!
YOU'RE KIDDING!

303
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,469
I GUESS THERE'S HOPE FOR ME
IF HE CAN GET MARRIED.

304
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,704
AND HERE'S THE
REALLY AMAZING PART.

305
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,273
SHE'S THE DAUGHTER
OF AN ARISTOCRAT

306

AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND!

307
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,609
HE KIDNAPPED HER LOOKING
FOR A HOUSEKEEPER.

I COULD TAKE ON
THE GUARD, TOO.

324
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,520
ONE OF THESE DAYS, TETORA,

FOR WILLIAM TO BE OUR COMMANDER.

357
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:19,977

ANYWAY, I DON'T
KNOW WHERE HE IS,

451
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,917
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DISCUSSING

452
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,253
MILITARY STRATEGY
OR ANYTHING.

453
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,855
IT'S GOTTA BE OKAY...

454
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,758
ALL I KNOW IS HE'S GONNA BE
IN A BIG RAID, OR SOMETHING.

455
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:56,361
I'M NOT ASKING HIM ABOUT IT!
AND I KNOW ONE THING...

456
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:59,564
AFTER A BIG BATTLE, HE NEEDS
TO HAVE SOME DOWN TIME!

457
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:02,100
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO MAKE HIM COME HOME!

458
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,701
AND WELL BESIDES,
I'M TECHNICALLY

459
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,470
SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU'S
DIRECT CONTACT

460
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,039
WITH THE CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE.

461
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:09,307
SO, WHAT I'M REALLY
DOING IS WORKING!

462
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:13,278
YOU'RE PUTTING OUR SECURITY AT
RISK BY ABUSING YOUR AUTHORITY!

463
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:14,979
SO CAN I?
PRETTY PLEASE?

464
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,949
WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I
GONNA DO WITH YOU, REALLY?

465
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,053
I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT
IN ALL OF THIS...

466
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,154
IT'S OKAY BY ME!

467
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,521
AH!

468
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,923
BESIDES I'M YOUR GUILD MASTER
SO YOU KINDA HAVE TO LET ME.

469
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,994
AH... HAHAHA HMMM

470
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:33,231
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, HOW CAN I SAY NO?

471
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,204
(SIPS)

472
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,438
(MUNCH, CHEWS)

473
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:45,110
(CLOCK TICKING)

474
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,345
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI, I NEED YOU
TO STAY BEHIND IN THE CITY.

475
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,646
UH...

476
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:49,881
I'VE GOT A TASK FOR YOU TO DO

477
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,251
THAT ONLY YOU ARE
CAPABLE OF COMPLETING.

478
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,754
I NEED YOU TO PROTECT THE
PRINCESS WHILE I'M GONE.

479
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:00,958
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THERE ARE SPIES

480
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,328
SUSPECTED FROM MINAMI
IN THE CITY.

481
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,662
AND IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY HERE,

482
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:07,732
MY LORD BELIEVE THE
PRINCESS NEEDS PROTECTION.

483
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,768
I CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT, HOWEVER...

484
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:12,637
I'M GETTING THE FEELING
HE HAD ANOTHER REASON

485
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,173
TO LEAVE ME HERE IN AKIHABARA

486
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,942
[RAYNESHIA] PARDON ME...
[AKATSUKI] HM...?

487
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:20,078
WHAT IS THAT
YOU'RE EATING?

488
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,113
RED BEAN BUN.

489
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:22,780
RED BEAN BUN...?

490
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,483
AND WHAT KIND OF TEA IS THIS
THAT YOU'RE HAVING WITH IT?

491
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,285
[AKATSUKI]
ROASTED GREEN TEA.

492
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:30,288
SO I'M GUESSING APPLE TEA ISN'T
EXACTLY TO YOUR LIKING THEN?

493
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:34,159
RED BEAN BUNS AND ROASTED
GREEN TEA ALWAYS GO TOGETHER.

494
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,128
OKAY...

495
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,333
I DON'T GET IT...
EVERYTHING'S SO DIFFICULT.

496
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:42,834
HM...?

497
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:44,969
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE
SINCE I CAME TO AKIHABARA,

498
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,871
AND THERE'S STILL A
LOT ABOUT YOUR CULTURE,

499
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:48,206
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

500
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,941
I GUESS, THERE'S A LOT
I NEED TO LEARN

501
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,477
ABOUT THE CUSTOMS
OF YOUR PEOPLE.

502
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:56,548
UH... MY PREFERENCES
AREN'T CUSTOM.

503
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,051
APPLE TEA IS NICE, TOO.

504
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:03,155
AKATSUKI, THANK YOU
FOR BEING SO KIND.

505
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:04,822
(ANNOYED GROAN)

506
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,392
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHY DO I FEEL SO AWKWARD?

507
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:25,277
HMMMM...

508
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,947
[TATARA] GOOD MORNING.
[AKATSUKI] MPH...

509
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,483
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
JUST ABOUT EVERY GAMER KNOWS

510
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,652
THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET POWERFUL
EPIC‐CLASS ITEMS IN RAIDS.

511
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,155
THAT'S HOW MY LORD
ACQUIRED HIS GRIFFIN.

512
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,591
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS THE
PROOF THAT YOU AND YOUR PARTY

513
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:41,793
COMPLETED A LARGE
SCALE RAID OR EVENT.

514
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:44,862
ME, I DON'T HAVE ANY
RAIDING EXPERIENCE AT ALL.

515
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:47,565
ANOTHER WAY TO GET AN ITEM
OR WEAPON LIKE THAT

516
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,167
IS TO BUY ONE
FROM A VENDER.

517
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,536
BUT THAT CAN BE
VERY EXPENSIVE.

518
00:21:51,636 --> 00:21:53,571
HOWEVER...

519
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:54,772
[TATARA]
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

520
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:56,541
THE PRICE IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.

521
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,810
I DON'T CARE TO HAGGLE.

522
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,246
(SIGH)

523
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,782
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
NO WAY!

524
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:07,385
THAT'S MORE THAN TWICE
EVERYTHING I HAVE!

525
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,455
I MUST GET STRONGER!

526
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,362
[VOINEN] THIS IS IT. THE BOTTOM
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM...

527
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,398
[FEDERICO] IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK IT WAS HERE!

528
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:23,201
JUST LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THOSE
DOORS, THEY'RE RIDICULOUS.

529
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:25,570
AND THIS IS THE
ENTRANCE, RIGHT?

530
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,671
[SHIROE]
IT IS.

531
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,106
[NAOTSUGU]
WE FINALLY MADE IT!

532
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,774
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
ALRIGHT, SHIROE.

533
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:32,277
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE AFTER INSIDE THESE DOORS.

534
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:35,480
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T GET IT.

535
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,984
YOU'VE GOT A DREAM, LITTLE MAN.
AND I'M GONNA RIP IT TO SHREDS!

536
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,519
BY THE TIME I'M DONE WITH YOU,

537
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:44,989
YOU'RE GONNA BE CRYING FOR
SOMEONE TO GET YOU OUTTA HERE!

538
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,015
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
SLUMBERING FAR BENEATH

539
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:20,218
THE DEPTHS OF PALM LIES
THE RAID ZONE ABYSSAL SHAFT.

540
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:22,787
THERE, THE FULL‐RAID
PARTY BEGINS.

541
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,589
IN A BATTLE OF OFFENSE
AND DEFENSE,

542
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:27,892
SHIROE, WILLIAM, AND DEMICAS END
UP FIGHTING NOT ONLY THE BATTLE,

543
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,195
BUT THEIR OWN FEELINGS AS WELL.

544
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:33,398
AND ANOTHER MUST FIGHT
HER OWN LONELINESS.

545
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,302
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
