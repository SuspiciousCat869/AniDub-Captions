465
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:03,151
(LAUGHTER, MERRIMENT CONTINUES)

466
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:05,387
WELL SINCE WE FINALLY
LIFTED THE CURFEW,

467
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,323
EVERYONE IS OUT IN
THE STREET DANCING.

468
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:10,526
WE CAN INVITE MINORI AND ALL
THE LOWER RANKS BACK HOME.

469
00:21:10,626 --> 00:21:12,494
WHAT SHOULD WE DO
ABOUT... HENRIETTA?

470
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:15,431
SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
EVENTUALLY.

471
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,998
I'M SURE SHE
LOST HER MIND

472
00:21:17,098 --> 00:21:18,967
WHEN SHE SAW EVERYONE
IN THEIR PAJAMAS.

473
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,702
[HENRIETTA] I'VE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY HOTTIE PATOTTIES!

474
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:22,003
[RAYNESHIA]
OKAY.

475
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:24,773
UM, AKATSUKI...
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

476
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:27,876
I THINK I SHOULD BE THANKING
YOU INSTEAD, RAYNESHIA.

477
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:29,278
(GIGGLE)

478
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:38,520
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I THINK I FINALLY

479
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,222
FIGURED IT ALL OUT,
MY LORD.

480
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:42,591
PROTECTING SOMEONE MEANS

481
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,760
GIVING THEM A HOME
TO COME BACK TO.

482
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,728
WHAT PEOPLE NEED IS A PLACE

483
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:48,730
WHERE THEY CAN LAUGH
WITHOUT FEAR.

484
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,732
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

485
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:54,370
IT'S THE REASON WHY
MY LORD WORKS SO HARD.

486
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,240
[AKATSUKI]
PLEASE HURRY BACK HOME...

487
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:03,679
(PING)
AH...

488
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:05,481
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT]
AKATSUKI?

489
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,749
AKATSUKI? HELLO? YOU THERE?

490
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:11,252
UH, MY LORD?
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE?

491
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:13,655
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO CALL
UNLESS THERE'S A PROBLEM!

492
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:15,724
[SHIROE]
THAT WAS THE DEAL, BUT...

493
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:17,158
WOW, I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU

494
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:18,894
TO BREAK THE RULES
LIKE THAT, MY LORD!

495
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:20,929
[SHIROE]
I AM THE VILLAIN IN GLASSES.

496
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,099
OH RII‐IGHT! YOU WOULDN'T BE
YOU WITHOUT A FEW SURPRISES.

497
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,767
[SHIROE]
SO HOW DID THE RAID GO?

498
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:26,768
[AKATSUKI] UH...
[SHIROE] AKATSUKI...

499
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,670
[AKATSUKI]
UH‐HUH?

500
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,038
[SHIROE]
GOOD JOB...

501
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,173
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD...

502
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,843
WE'RE STILL FIGURING
THINGS OUT OVER HERE...

503
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,112
BUT WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

504
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:41,750
IN FACT, WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO GIVE IT ANOTHER GO!

505
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,112
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
ON CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT,

506
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,481
SHIROE AND HIS COMPANIONS DIED.

507
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,383
THE RULES HAD CHANGED.

508
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:24,653
THIS ISN'T THE WORLD OF
ELDER TALES ANYMORE.

509
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:26,588
THEIR TIME IS OVER.

510
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,856
UPON LOSING HIS BODY,

511
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:30,158
SHIROE WANDERS THROUGH
A TOWN OF MEMORIES.

512
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,194
HE ALSO SEES A FRIEND AT
THE BEACH ON THE MOON.

513
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:36,565
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
