(CHRISTMAS MUSIC)

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,479
[SOJIRO] CHRISTMAS IS PRETTY
NICE DON'T YOU THINK, LADIES?

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,747
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T WAIT!

4
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:11,215
WHY DON'T WE GET
THE GUILD TOGETHER

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:12,717
FOR A CHRISTMAS EVE PARTY?

6
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,852
[CHIKA] YEAH THAT SOUNDS GREAT!
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN!

7
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:16,521
I'M ALL FOR A CELEBRATION,

8
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,724
AS LONG AS WE GET CHICKEN
AND CAKE ALL NIGHT LONG!

9
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:23,194
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU THINK WE NEED TO HAVE?

10
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:26,564
WELL, YOU KNOW, SINCE
IT'S CHRISTMAS AND ALL...

11
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,533
MAYBE WE COULD
TRY SOME SALMON.

12
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,001
[ALL] SALMON?

13
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:32,537
MMM, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
HAVE SALMON ON CHRISTMAS?

14
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:34,739
I THINK IT'LL BE PERFECT!
LET'S DO IT!

15
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,341
YEAH! YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA LOVE IT!

16
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,610
(LAUGHS)

17
00:02:11,803 --> 00:02:13,037
[RAYNESHIA]
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

18
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,939
DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS
A LITTLE TOO SHORT?

19
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,709
I REALLY DON'T WANNA SHOW OFF
MY LEGS TOO MUCH.

20
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,844
OH, IT'S ADORABLE
ON YOU, NESSIE!

21
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:21,713
YOU LOOK
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!

22
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:23,447
[HENRIETTA]
JUST A SKOSH ABOVE THE KNEES

23
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:24,716
IS A PERFECT FIT FOR YOU!

24
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,651
[SERARA] YOU LOOK
REALLY PRETTY, PRINCESS!

25
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,520
I MUST ADMIT I'M NOT VERY
KNOWLEDGEABLE

26
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,287
OF ALL YOUR CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS...

27
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,256
BUT ISN'T THIS "SANTA CLAUS"
YOU WANNA SEE

28
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:35,192
SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE AN
OLDER, HEAVIER GENTLEMAN?

29
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:36,861
MM‐HM. THAT'S CORRECT.

30
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,096
[MARIELLE]
AH AKATSUKI, WHAT'VE YOU DONE?!

31
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:42,567
I AM SO GONNA HAVE TO PUNISH YOU
FOR THAT LITTLE INDISCRETION!

32
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,168
[AKATSUKI] EHH?

33
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,646
(ANNOYED)

34
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,981
WOW! BOTH OF YOU ARE SUPER CUTE!

35
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,816
YOU'RE AS TASTY AS
A HUNDRED CHICKENS!

36
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,352
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ROOM
FOR SOME SUPPER, YOU GUYS!

(ANNOYED NOISE)

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,689
[RIEZE] YES, OF COURSE

39
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,057
[AKATSUKI] HUH?
[ALL] HUH?

40
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:07,725
[RIEZE] THEY APPEAR TO BE
DRESSED AS REINDEER

41
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,627
AND A SANTA CLAUS
IN A MINISKIRT.

42
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:10,995
THEY LOOK VERY CUTE.

43
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:13,931
[RAYNESHIA] LADY RIEZE,
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

44
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:16,167
I AM REPORTING TO
MASTER KRUSTY.

45
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,268
(BOTH GASP)

46
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:20,171
I'M JUST KIDDING,
IT WAS JUST A FRIEND.

47
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:21,005
(SIGH OF RELIEF)

48
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,607
[RAYNESHIA]
THANK GOODNESS!

49
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,075
WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT
MONSTER WOULD DO

50
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,743
IF HE KNEW ALL
THIS WAS GOING ON!

51
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:28,813
[RIEZE] I APOLOGIZE.
THAT WAS A TAD DESPICABLE.

52
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,915
IT'S JUST YOU TWO ARE SO
TAKEN WITH EACH OTHER,

53
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:31,849
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF...

54
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,250
[RAYNESHIA]
HUH?

55
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,451
(DOOR OPENING)
[MIKAKAGE] PARDON ME, LADIES!

56
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:35,787
(SMALL LAUGH)

57
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,189
[MIKAKAGE]
WE BROUGHT YOU SOME SNACKIES.

58
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,859
[ALL]
YOU'RE AWESOME! THANK YOU!

59
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,696
HMMMM...
MMMM...

60
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:46,831
MMMMMM...

61
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,566
(QUIET GIGGLE)
[ALI] OH...

62
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,001
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
STRANGE.

63
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:53,237
WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE,
AKATSUKI WAS MY ONLY GUARD.

64
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:59,010
[RAYNESHIA]
WOW, THIS IS GOOD!

65
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,679
THIS FRUITCAKE IS REALLY
DELICIOUS! THANK YOU!

66
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,114
[MIKAKAGE]
UH‐HUH!

67
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,749
[MARIELLE] MIKAKAGE IS
A MASTER OF EVERYTHING

68
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,618
FROM APPETIZERS TO DESSERTS!

69
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:09,821
BAKING AND PREPARATION OF
SWEETS IS AN ART FORM FOR ME,

70
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,789
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE
KITCHEN IS JUST A HOBBY!

71
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,959
YOUR COOKING IS RIGHT
UP THERE WITH MR. CAT'S.

72
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:17,061
I LIKE GUARDING A PRINCESS;

73
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,597
AND THE FRINGE BENEFITS AND
PERKS AREN'T BAD EITHER,

74
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:20,965
NOT TO MENTION TASTY.

75
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:24,235
SO ABOUT THE PEOPLE
IN D. D. D.,

76
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,037
WHEN ARE YOU
EXPECTING THEM BACK?

77
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,706
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE
DONE A GREAT DEAL

78
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,142
TO VANQUISH THE LATEST
GOBLIN ASSAULT,

79
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:32,644
IT WON'T BE UNTIL NEW YEARS.

80
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,446
AND HERE I WAS HOPING TO HAVE
THEM BACK BY CHRISTMAS.

81
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:38,650
POOPY‐TOOTS, WE WERE GONNA
THROW THEM A PARTY.

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,952
IT'S LIKE EVERYONE'S
SO BUSY THESE DAYS,

83
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,154
I HAVEN'T SEEN
MASTER SHIROE IN FOREVER.

84
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,657
DID HE LOCK HIMSELF
IN HIS ROOM AGAIN?

85
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,158
UH, YOU SEE‐

86
00:04:47,258 --> 00:04:49,093
[HENRIETTA] WELL, IF HE'S
BEING HIS USUAL SELF,

87
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:50,662
THEN SHIROE ISN'T GOING TO
POP HIS HEAD UP

88
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:51,829
FOR CHRISTMAS ANYWAY.

89
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:53,731
AND HE PROBABLY HAS
A LOT OF WORK

90
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:54,799
TO FINISH BEFORE THE NEW YEAR.

91
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,034
YEAH, I SUPPOSE...

92
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:00,204
I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY
ALL OF YOU ARE KEEPING BUSY.

93
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:01,539
(EXHALE)

94
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,109
[MARIELLE] SO LONG, PRINCESS!
SEE YA AROUND.

95
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,477
[RIEZE]
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

96
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,579
[AKATSUKI]
BYE.

97
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:08,680
[RAYNESHIA]
AH, MISS AKATSUKI!

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,181
OH...?

99
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,584
I, UH... I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

100
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,251
HUH?

101
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,354
THANKS FOR DRESSING UP IN
THOSE BIZARRE OUTFITS WITH ME.

102
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:21,358
YEAH, WELL... THEY KINDA
FORCED ME TO WEAR THAT.

103
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,229
SURE, BUT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
DROPPING BY TO SEE ME EVERY DAY.

104
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:28,499
AND IT'S JUST REALLY NICE OF
YOU TO COME BY AND CHECK ON ME.

105
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,466
[RAYNESHIA]
THANK YOU.

106
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:30,602
AH...!

107
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,404
WELL I WAS... JUST DOING MY JOB.

108
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,507
SEE YOU TOMORROW

109
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,274
YEAH!

110
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,514
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHEN DID I ALLOW MYSELF

111
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,181
TO BECOME SO WEAK?

112
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:46,818
IT'S MY JOB TO
GUARD THE PRINCESS.

113
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:50,287
I SHOULD BE PLEASED THAT MY LORD
ENTRUSTED ME WITH SUCH A TASK...

114
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:54,225
BUT IT HURTS TO THINK THAT
HE'S REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER.

115
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,493
WHAT IF I WAS MORE LIKE HER...?

116
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:59,130
I MEAN WOULD IT CHANGE THE WAY
HE THINKS ABOUT ME?

117
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,565
WOULD HE WORRY ABOUT ME?

118
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:04,201
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I WAS
LIKE THE PRINCESS...

119
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:07,672
I NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD BY
MY LORD'S SIDE AS AN ASSASSIN.

120
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:10,374
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT
HIM IF I'M NOTHING BUT SMILES

121
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,678
AND CHARM AND DESSERTS
ALL THE TIME.

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,515
(GASP)

123
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:20,251
UH, HEY...! I'M SORRY AND
I DON'T WANNA BOTHER YOU AGAIN,

124
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:22,854
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
SWORD THAT WAS ON DISPLAY?

125
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:23,888
I SOLD IT.

126
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:25,590
OH? NO, YOU DID?

127
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,426
[TATARA] YES. AND THE MAN EVEN
PAID FOR IT STRAIGHT UP IN GOLD.

128
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,495
UH...
(SHAKY INHALE)

129
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:34,231
[RIEZE] HAS AKATSUKI SEEMED
TROUBLED TO YOU LATELY?

130
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:36,568
[HENRIETTA]
I GUESS IT WASN'T JUST ME, HUH?

131
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:39,537
NO... SHE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE
KIND OF PERSON

132
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:42,473
WHO LETS IT SHOW, EITHER.
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

133
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:43,608
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE...

134
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,342
WELL, SOMETHING IS GOING ON.

135
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,711
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
BEEN WATCHING

136
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:48,312
D. D. D.'S TRAINING
SESSIONS LATELY.

137
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,346
HUH?

138
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,015
[RIEZE]
I'VE ONLY SEEN HER ONCE,

139
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,250
BUT I THINK SHE'S
BEEN THERE BEFORE.

140
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,720
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
UNWELCOME, YOU KNOW?

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,121
ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS ASK,

142
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:59,824
AND SHE CAN PARTICIPATE IN
A RAID WITH US IN D. D. D.

143
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:02,093
WE ARE THE BEST IN AKIHABARA.

144
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:05,663
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
SIMPLY FORCE HER TO JOIN US.

145
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,198
AND WHEN I LET LORD KRUSTY KNOW,

146
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:11,335
HE JUST SAID TO LET AKATSUKI
LOOK ON AS MUCH AS SHE WISHES.

147
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:13,938
HE SAID THAT HE OWES
SHIROE A FAVOR.

148
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,573
AND THAT IS SOMETHING HAPPENS,

149
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,075
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE HER
WHATEVER HELP WE CAN.

150
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,444
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY
NEWS TO ME...

151
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:22,514
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
SHE MIGHT BE SPENDING TIME

152
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,516
SPYING ON THE
OTHER GUILDS AS WELL.

153
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,651
I GUESS SHE'S CONCERNED
ABOUT HER ABILITIES,

154
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:29,521
AND IF SHE HAS WHAT IT
TAKES TO GET THE JOB DONE.

155
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,055
[HENRIETTA] I KINDA GET
THE FEELING SHE'S GOT

156
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,224
SOMETHING ELSE ON HER MIND.
[RIEZE] OHH...?

157
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:37,995
IT'S MORE LIKE WHAT SHE'S
LACKING IS... CONFIDENCE.

158
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:39,531
[RIEZE]
HM....

159
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,132
[HENRIETTA]
I SUPPOSE, FOR RIGHT NOW,

160
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:43,668
ALL WE CAN DO IS
BE THERE FOR HER.

161
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,637
[RIEZE]
FAIR ENOUGH.

162
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:52,309
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THE ORAL ARTS...

163
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,179
WELL BROTHER SHIROE
SAID THEY EXIST.

164
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,048
HUH... HE REALLY DID?

165
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:59,183
[TOYA] YEAH, HE SAID THAT
THEY'RE TOTALLY LEGIT.

166
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:03,220
(COMBAT NOISES)

167
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,689
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
IF MY LORD SAID THEY EXIST,

168
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,259
THEN THERE'S NO DOUBT
THE ORAL ARTS ARE REAL!

169
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:12,329
LARGE RAID GUILDS LIKE D. D. D.
AND BLACK SWORD KNIGHTS

170
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,198
SHOULD HAVE
FIRST‐RATE ASSASSINS.

171
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,467
IF THEIR ASSASSINS ARE
USING THE ORAL ARTS,

172
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:19,504
I WANT TO SEE JUST HOW
STRONG THEY TRULY ARE.

173
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:23,440
I'LL WATCH UNTIL I ACTUALLY SEE
ONE OF THEM USE ONE.

174
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,511
THEY HAVE TO BE EVENLY MATCHED
AND WILLING TO BREAK A DEADLOCK.

175
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,412
[GUY C]
YOU GOTTA STEP INTO IT!

176
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:31,115
[GUY D] THAT WAS JUST SAD!
PICK UP THE PACE, YOU GUYS!

177
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,317
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
IF I KNEW EVEN ONE ORAL ART,

178
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,753
HOW POWERFUL COULD I BECOME?

179
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:38,823
(HUMMING A TUNE)

180
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:43,094
OH! HEY, AKATSUKI!
WELCOME BACK!

181
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:45,963
WE'RE GONNA HAVE BOUILLABAISSE
TODAY, YOU GUYS.

182
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,364
PULL UP A SEAT...

183
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:50,067
WE'RE ALMOST READY TO GET
DIN‐DIN STARTED, NYAH.

184
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,203
I THINK I'LL... PASS.

185
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,538
[MINORI] HUH?

186
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,206
[ISUZU] OH COME ON!
IT TURNED OUT REALLY GOOD!

187
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:57,809
AND RUDY AND TOYA ARE GONNA
BE BACK ANY MINUTE NOW.

188
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:00,845
[AKATSUKI] NN‐NM... SORRY,
BUT I'M JUST NOT HUNGRY.

189
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:02,880
UH... WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

190
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,017
SHE HASN'T BEEN ACTING
LIKE HERSELF FOR A WHILE.

191
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,385
UH YEAH... HMM...

192
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:11,789
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] PERFECT
LITTLE MIDDLE SCHOOL PRISS!

193
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,993
THAT SMUG LITTLE, STUPID
IMMATURE, KNOW‐IT‐ALL.

194
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:19,030
WHO THE HELL DOES SHE
THINK SHE IS, ANYWAY?

195
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,965
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF MYSELF!

196
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:25,436
WHENEVER I SEE HER, I CAN'T HELP
BUT GET JEALOUS AND ANGRY.

197
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,539
IT MAKES ME FEEL UGLY INSIDE...

198
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,207
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
SLACKING OFF. SHE ISN'T!

199
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:32,243
SHE'S TRYING REALLY HARD!

200
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:34,612
I'LL WORK AT LEAST
AS HARD AS YOU...

201
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,247
I'LL DO ALL I CAN.

202
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,983
MINORI, I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE
YOU ANY PROBLEMS.

203
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,785
I'LL DO MY BEST TO AVOID THEM.

204
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,587
UH, UM, THANK YOU...

205
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,724
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] MINORI WAS
HELPING MY LORD GET THINGS DONE,

206
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:49,493
WHILE I WAS WASTING TIME
THINKING ABOUT MYSELF.

207
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,063
I DIDN'T GIVE HIM
ANY HELP AT ALL...

208
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,565
I WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME

209
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:57,502
BUT I DIDN'T ASSIST HIM WITH
ANYTHING. I WAS SO USELESS.

210
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,505
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN
A RAID OR A QUEST,

211
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,875
WHICH MAKE ME A
SECOND‐RATE ASSASSIN.

212
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:07,278
I CAN'T EVEN BUY A WEAPON
THAT'LL HELP ME IN A RAID.

213
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:09,747
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T
TAKE ME WITH HIM.

214
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:13,350
ALL I CAN DO IS FIGHT,
BUT I'M WEAK.

215
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,788
SO, THERE'S REALLY ONLY
ONE THING I CAN WORK TOWARD.

216
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,559
I NEED STRENGTH,
BUT HOW DO I GET IT?

217
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:32,537
WE'VE CERTAINLY BECOME QUITE
THE HUB OF ACTIVITY LATELY?

218
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:35,006
WILL THEY BE COMING
BACK AGAIN TOMORROW?

219
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:37,408
YES, THEY'RE SHOWING ME
AROUND THE CITY.

220
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,645
OH, IS THAT RIGHT? WELL YOU
SHOULD AT LEAST FEEL SAFE,

221
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:43,615
WITH A WHOLE TROOP OF MIGHTY
ADVENTURERS GUARDING YOU.

222
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,617
THEY TOLD ME THAT WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A DISH CALLED

223
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:47,484
A "CREAM STEW"
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

224
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:50,922
[ELISSA] INTERESTING... I GUESS
IT'LL BE "ADVENTURER STYLE"?

225
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:53,057
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

226
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,491
(YAWN)

227
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:56,160
[RAYNESHIA] IT SEEMS LIKE
A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BEEN

228
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,162
"ADVENTURER STYLE" LATELY...

229
00:10:58,262 --> 00:10:59,396
THEY WANTED ME TO DRESS UP

230
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,432
LIKE SOMEONE CALLED,
"SANTA CLAUS" TODAY.

231
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,702
[ELISSA] AH YES, I ASKED THEM
TO BRING SOME OF THEIR CLOTHES,

232
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:07,539
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THEY
DECIDED TO PICK FOR YOU.

233
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,940
HUH?

234
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,543
THE IDEA WAS TO GET YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THEIR STYLE OF CLOTHING.

235
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,011
PERHAPS THAT WAS JUST
THEIR WAY OF INCLUDING YOU.

236
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,146
(SIGH)

237
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:17,314
KAY, WELL THAT EXPLAINS IT.

238
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,350
YOU KNOW? TRYING ON
ALL OF THOSE CLOTHES

239
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,885
KINDA MADE ME A LITTLE SLEEPY.

240
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:23,855
REALLY? WELL IT MIGHT NOT BE
MY PLACE TO TELL YOU THIS,

241
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,123
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

242
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:27,258
[RAYNESHIA] UH?

243
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:28,593
[ELISSA]
IT DOES MY HEART GOOD

244
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:31,195
TO SEE YOU MAKING
SOME FRIENDS, MILADY.

245
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:33,598
LOOK, THOSE PEOPLE
ARE NOT MY FRIENDS.

246
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:36,601
HUH? BUT YOU WERE HAVING
SUCH A NICE TIME.

247
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,469
AND IT APPEARED TO ME LIKE
THEY'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY

248
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,738
TO HELP IF YOU EVER
GET INTO TROUBLE.

249
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:44,041
TALKING WITH THEM IS NOT WHAT
I WOULD CALL A NICE TIME.

250
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:45,409
I HAVE TO BE WARY.

251
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,912
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
NORMAL LIKE WE ARE, OKAY.

252
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,747
THEY'LL ALWAYS BE ADVENTURERS.

253
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,683
YES, BUT MILADY...

254
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,350
[RAYNESHIA] I'VE MASTERED
MANY FORMS OF ETIQUETTE,

255
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,552
BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT.

256
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,921
IF YOU'RE HAPPY, ACT HAPPY.

257
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:59,356
IF YOU'RE SAD, ACT SAD.

258
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,959
EMOTIONS ARE WHAT THEY ARE...

259
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,828
AND THEY HAVE TO BE EXPRESSED.

260
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,497
IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL UNLESS YOU SHOW THEM...

261
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:11,536
LET'S FACE IT. I'M USUALLY LAZY,
IRRESPONSIBLE, AND SPINELESS.

262
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:12,904
THAT'S HOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

263
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:16,674
AND I'M NOT CHANGING.
I WAS BORN INTO THIS.

264
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:19,644
I REALLY DO HATE
PLAYING POLITICS.

265
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:24,582
[ELISSA, THINKING]
I UNDERSTAND, YOUR MAJESTY.

266
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:26,984
I'M SURE IT'S DIFFICULT
BEING A NOBLEWOMAN,

267
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:30,622
NEVER HAVING THE LUXURY OF
BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF.

268
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,490
ALTHOUGH, MILADY,

269
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:36,528
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO
STOP YOU WHEN HE'S AROUND.

270
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:38,129
[MISA] ALL MEMBERS
ARE LEVELING UP

271
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,131
AND GAINING ITEMS ON SCHEDULE.

272
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:42,333
IF WE CAN KEEP THIS UP
INTO THE SPRING,

273
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:43,701
AKIHABARA'S BATTLE GUILDS
AND SECURITY

274
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:46,604
WILL BE STRONGER AS A UNIT
WHEN WE RETURN.

275
00:12:48,172 --> 00:12:49,206
MILORD?

276
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:51,543
HUH? YES.
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

277
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:55,446
Y'KNOW NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR YOU TO LOSE INTEREST.

278
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,248
DO YOU NEED A NEW TOY
OR SOMETHING

279
00:12:57,348 --> 00:12:59,283
TO KEEP YOU COMPANY, MASTER?

280
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:00,685
DON'T BE SILLY!

281
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:04,355
JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN...
THE GOBLINS START MOVING.

282
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,427
(SIGH) WHAT'S HIS DEAL...

283
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:14,431
[RODERICK]
JUST PUT IT WHERE WE USUALLY DO.

284
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,503
[NYANTA]
GOT A MINUTE, RODERICK?

285
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:19,904
[RODERICK]
HUH?

286
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:22,339
[NYANTA] IT'S GOOD TO
SEE YOU THIS FINE EVENING.

287
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,809
[RODERICK]
HMMM?! THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT...

288
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,744
I MEAN IT WAS BARELY NOON
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED.

289
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:29,781
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA
TO SKIP LUNCH, MY MAN.

290
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,749
I NEED TO ASK YOU A
FEW QUESTIONS ANYWAY.

291
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,586
WOULD YOU CARE TO
JOIN ME FOR LUNCH?

292
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:37,555
IT'S TIME FOR DINNER,
BUT THAT'S FINE BY ME.

293
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,957
OH RIGHT, THEN LET'S
GET SOME RAMEN.

294
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:42,527
SURE. RAMEN SOUNDS GOOD.

295
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,428
[RAMEN MAN]
THERE YOU GO, GENTLEMEN!

296
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,063
[NYANTA] SO, HOW IS THE
INVENTORY PROJECT

297
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:47,832
COMING ALONG, MYAH?

298
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:49,433
[RODERICK] IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'LL NEED SOME OF THE BEST

299
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:52,003
EPIC‐CLASS ITEMS AND
A FEW SECRET ITEMS AS WELL.

300
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:55,306
AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT ONE OR TWO.

301
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:56,874
IT'S KINDA STRANGE,

302
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,544
WHY DO WE NEED TO GO OUT OF
OUR WAY TO ADD FLAVOR TEXT

303
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:01,245
TO ALL THESE THINGS NOW?

304
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,982
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
MIGHT BE GOING ON HERE?

305
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:08,185
(BLOWING)
NNHNNN.

306
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:11,055
[RODERICK] I'LL ADMIT, I CAN SEE
HOW MY MERCHANT GUILD

307
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,858
HAPPENS TO BE THE RIGHT ONE
TO GET THE JOB DONE.

308
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,861
WE CAN RAISE THE MONEY TO GET
THE RESEARCH FINISHED,

309
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,865
AND A SMALLER GUILD ISN'T
IN THE POSITION TO DO THAT.

310
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,001
WE DO APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING.

311
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,371
YOU KNOW WHEN SHIROE ASKS ME
TO TAKE ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS,

312
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,874
IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME WANT TO DO
IT RIGHT.

313
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,976
AND I'M GUESSING THAT
HE WANTS IT DONE QUICKLY

314
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,044
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

315
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:34,478
(SLURP) MMM‐MM.

316
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:38,215
WELL FAST IS GOOD, BUT DOING
IT RIGHT IS EVEN BETTER.

317
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,052
(PING) [SHIROE, VOICE CHAT]
HEY CHIEF,

318
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:42,787
DID I CATCH YOU AT A BAD TIME?

319
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:45,590
ACTUALLY, YOU CALLED AT
THE PERFECT TIME, MY MAN!

320
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,125
I JUST FINISHED HAVING A LITTLE
CHAT WITH OUR BOY, RODERICK.

321
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,994
[SHIROE] THANKS A LOT, CHIEF.

322
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:52,697
I SHOULD'VE BEEN BACK BY NOW
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.

323
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:55,166
[NYANTA] DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, OLD FRIEND!

324
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:56,568
I EVEN MANAGED TO GET

325
00:14:56,668 --> 00:14:59,203
SOME DELICIOUS RAMEN OUT OF
THE VISIT. NO WORRIES.

326
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:01,305
HOW'S EVERYONE BACK HOME DOING?

327
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:03,240
AH, IT'S GOING PRETTY
WELL AROUND HERE;

328
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,177
THE CITY'S IN HIGH SPIRITS OVER
CHRISTMAS, OF COURSE, MYAH.

329
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:08,880
[SHIROE]
OH, YEAH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

330
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,684
UH, HOW'S
AKATSUKI DOING?

331
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,852
SHE'S DROPPING IN
ON PRINCESS RAYNESHIA

332
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:18,322
EVERY DAY TO GUARD HER,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN, MYAH.

333
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:20,024
[SHIROE]
IS THAT RIGHT?

334
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,994
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF
ANYTHING CHANGES ON OUR END.

335
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:25,196
SO WHAT DID HE HAVE TO SAY?

336
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:27,732
HE SAID IT'S ALL
GOOD BACK THERE.

337
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,133
AND HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING ABOUT

338
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:31,168
EVERYONE GETTING ALL
REVVED UP FOR CHRISTMAS.

339
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:35,406
AW MAN, WE'RE NOT MAKIN'
IT BACK IN FIVE DAYS.

340
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:36,908
MPH.

341
00:15:43,515 --> 00:15:45,282
(BATTLE CRY)

342
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:49,554
WHAT THE... HUH?

343
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,392
WAHHHH!

344
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,161
'KAY, THAT'S GOOD!

345
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,095
HEHEH

346
00:15:58,195 --> 00:15:59,664
(GROANS OF PAIN)

347
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,066
[HISAKO, CHIKA, SANDY]
THANK YOU FOR SPARRING WITH US!

348
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,369
[HISAKO] THAT WAS INCREDIBLE,
KYOKO! YOU'RE REALLY STRONG.

349
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,338
[KYOKO]
WELL, I AM LEVEL 90, YOU GUYS.

350
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:08,405
[CHIKA]
PLEASE TELL ME THE SECRET

351
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,508
TO YOUR STRENGTH, MISS KYOKO!

352
00:16:10,608 --> 00:16:12,644
MISS AKATSUKI...

353
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,612
[MARIELLE]
THIS IS JUST LOVELY!

354
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:15,613
[HENRIETTA]
I DIDN'T THINK I'D EVER FIND

355
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,181
SOMETHING LIKE THIS HERE!

356
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:19,316
LET'S GET ONE FOR THE MANSION.
IT WILL BRIGHTEN UP ANY ROOM!

357
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,484
[MARIELLE] GOOD IDEA!

358
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:22,119
I JUST KNOW THAT
NESSIE WILL LOVE IT!

359
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:23,454
YOU SHOULDN'T CALL HER THAT.

360
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:26,423
RAYNESHIA'S A PRINCESS,
MARIELLE. UNDERSTAND?

361
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:27,759
NAH. SHE'S FINE WITH IT,

362
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,661
SHE GAVE ME A SMILE
WHEN I SAID IT! OH LOOK!

363
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:30,528
[HENRIETTA]
UH... HUH?

364
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:31,763
[MARIELLE]
AHHHH!

365
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,165
[HENRIETTA]
AH, FOR NAOTSUGU, RIGHT?

366
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:38,102
HUH? UHHH... WELL, YOU SEE, I
THOUGHT WHEN HE GETS BACK HOME,

367
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:39,937
HE'D LIKE A LITTLE TASTE
OF THE HOLIDAY

368
00:16:40,037 --> 00:16:41,906
AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE IT TO HIM,
IF YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN...

369
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,841
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

370
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:46,544
NOW WAIT! I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, OKAY!

371
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:49,280
SO HENRIETTA, IS THERE
ANYONE OUT THERE

372
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,782
YOU'RE GIVING A PRESENT?

373
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:53,384
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
AH... AHEM...

374
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:54,952
WELL, NO. OF COURSE NOT.

375
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:56,187
YOU SURE?

376
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,354
[HENRIETTA]
SURE, I'M SURE!

377
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:58,455
GO BUY THE STUPID TREE ALREADY!

378
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,792
[MARIELLE]
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

379
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,595
[MARIELLE]
EXCUSE ME!

380
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:07,832
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
IT'S A ONE‐SIDED LOVE

381
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:10,234
KEPT AT A SAFE DISTANCE,
FOR SURE.

382
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,669
IT'S BETTER TO
KEEP IT A SECRET

383
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:15,139
AND SIMPLY ENJOY THESE
SWEET FEELINGS ON MY OWN.

384
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:17,509
SOME DREAMS STAY UNFULFILLED,

385
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,311
BUT THAT'S ONLY NATURAL,
I THINK.

386
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:21,846
I CAN BEAR THE PAIN FOR NOW.

387
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:23,380
THAT'LL BE THE BEST
FOR BOTH OF US.

388
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,749
(MARIELLE GIGGLES)

389
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:27,852
[SERARA]
A LITTLE HELP HERE...

390
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:29,253
[HENRIETTA, THINKING]
MARIELLE HAS A BEAUTIFUL

391
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:31,856
AND CHEERFUL ATTITUDE
THAT'S ALMOST INFECTIOUS.

392
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,891
SHE'S CONFIDENT AND POSITIVE.

393
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:36,293
I THINK THAT MUST BE
WHERE IT COMES FROM.

394
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:38,563
BUT AKATSUKI...

395
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,164
AKATSUKI IS DAZZLING!

396
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,666
[AKATSUKI] HM?

397
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,935
SHE HASN'T LOST THE
DELICATE FRAILTY OF YOUTH.

398
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,539
IT NORMALLY FADES SO QUICKLY.

399
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,975
SOFT AND TENDER SIDE SHE HAS
MIGHT BE A SHORTCOMING TO SOME,

400
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,444
BUT I SEE IT AS
A WONDERFUL ASSET.

401
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:56,347
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT
SHE REALIZES THAT...

402
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:57,815
GAH! I LOVE HER SO MUCH,

403
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,751
I COULD JUST WRAP MYSELF
AROUND HER AND SQUEEZE HER UP!

404
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:00,985
[AKATSUKI]
UH?

405
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:03,320
[RAYNESHIA]
THANKS FOR WAITING FOR ME!

406
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:12,564
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA, YOU LOOK SO
CUTE AND FLUFFY LIKE A SNOWBALL!

407
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,031
HOW NICE OF YOU.

408
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:17,234
SHE LET ME PICK IT
OUT OF HER WARDROBE.

409
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:19,971
COME ON! LET'S HEAD OUT!

410
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,873
[MARIELLE] WE SHOULD TAKE
A WALK AROUND TOWN

411
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,240
BEFORE WE HAVE THAT STEW.

412
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,309
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SHOW YOU
MORE ABOUT CHRISTMAS

413
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,911
WHILE WE HAVE THE TIME, NESSIE!

414
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:28,112
SURE!

415
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:29,747
(GIGGLE)

416
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:32,049
[HENRIETTA] BE CAREFUL!
THE SIDEWALK'S FROZEN, MARIELLE!

417
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,085
AH, AH, OHHHH!

418
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:37,622
[ALL] UH...
[MARIELLE] THAT HURTS... OOOOH

419
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:38,890
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

420
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,192
ADVENTURERS, THEY'RE JUST...

421
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:44,028
THEY'RE SO MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN WE ARE.

422
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:47,632
A LOT OF MY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ADVENTURERS,

423
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:48,966
AND TO BE TOTALLY HONEST,

424
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,569
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE ANY
HELPFUL ANSWERS.

425
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,072
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THIS
CITY OF THEIRS, AKIHABARA,

426
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:57,241
AND I THINK I'VE WOUND UP
BEING MORE CONFUSED

427
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,277
THAN WHEN I STARTED.

428
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:04,682
HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE THING
I HAVE LEARNED.

429
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:07,552
ADVENTURERS ARE
SIMPLY ADVENTURERS.

430
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,186
I MIGHT NOT KNOW
ALL THE ANSWERS,

431
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:12,056
BUT LABELLING THEM ISN'T
THE RIGHT PLACE TO START.

432
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:15,560
WE CAN'T LOOK AT THEM BASED
ON THE KIND OF WORK THEY DO.

433
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,394
I KNOW THAT MUCH.

434
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,565
ADVENTURERS ARE LIKE GEMSTONES.

435
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:23,067
EVERY ONE OF THEM IS
UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL;

436
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,403
AND EVERY ONE I'VE MET
HAS THEIR OWN INNER LIGHT.

437
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,373
THESE PEOPLE ARE SO SPECIAL.

438
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:33,144
I REALLY DON'T THINK I HAVE THE
RIGHT TO CALL THEM MY FRIENDS.

439
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:34,145
[RAYNESHIA]
HUH?

440
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,281
AH!

441
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,183
[MARIELLE]
WELL, LOOKIE THERE! WE'RE HERE!

442
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:41,619
[SERARA] I TELL YOU,
THE STEW HERE IS TO DIE FOR!

443
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,889
[RIEZE] I HEAR NO ONE HAS EVER
LEFT THIS PLACE UNSATISFIED.

444
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,858
[SERARA]
C'MON, LET'S GO IN!

445
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,492
[AKATSUKI]
I'M AFRAID I MUST BE GOING.

446
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:49,627
[ALL]
HUH?

447
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:50,928
[MARIELLE]
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

448
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,631
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF.

449
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,833
UH... UM, OKAY.

450
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:58,736
IF YOU'RE SURE, WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

451
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,872
MHM...

452
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,577
[RIEZE] SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO
WATCH ANOTHER TRAINING SESSION.
