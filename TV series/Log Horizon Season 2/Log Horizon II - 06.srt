157
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:21,090
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

158
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,391
[HENRIETTA] UHA!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

159
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,093
HE DIDN'T LEAVE ANY
SCARS ON YOU, DID HE?!

160
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,862
OH! YOU'RE JUST SO CUTE!

161
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,630
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

162
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,331
I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABOUT TIME FOR YOU

163
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,300
TO COME OUT OF THAT
SLUMBER OF YOURS.

164
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,936
[AKATSUKI] EXCUSE ME...
[HENRIETTA] (COOING) HMM?

165
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:35,304
[HENRIETTA] SORRY.

166
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:37,173
[AKATSUKI] IT'S PROBABLY
A BIT RUDE OF ME TO ASK,

167
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,308
BUT I REALLY NEED YOUR
HELP WITH SOMETHING.

168
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:41,578
COULD YOU PLEASE
TEACH ME THE ORAL ARTS?

169
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,114
I WANT TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO STOP THAT SERIAL KILLER

170
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:47,149
[NAZNA] HMMMM...
[RIEZE] DIDN'T MASTER SOJIRO

171
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:49,586
ALREADY USE HIS ORAL ART
AGAINST HIM, MISS NAZNA?

172
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,853
[NAZNA] HE DID.

173
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:53,255
AND THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
TO GET THE JOB DONE, WAS IT?

174
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,491
THAT'S RIGHT.
(EXHALE)

175
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,159
[RIEZE] THERE IS NO SENSE
OBSESSING OVER IT

176
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:58,761
KNOWING THAT IT
DIDN'T WORK BEFORE.

177
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,196
[AKATSUKI] WELL I MEAN,

178
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,498
I WANT TO STOP THIS MANIAC
FROM KILLING ANYONE ELSE.

179
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,201
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE AN ORAL ART.

180
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,503
IT'S JUST...

181
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,505
IF ANY OF YOU KNOW
ANOTHER WAY TO END THIS...

182
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,207
I'M WILLING TO LEARN
ABOUT THAT TOO!

183
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,544
[NAZNA] YOU REALLY THINK YOU
HAVE A CHANCE TO BEAT HIM?

184
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:16,412
[AKATSUKI]
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.

185
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:19,281
BUT I HAVE TO TRY, I CAN'T JUST
SIT BACK AND LET HIM KEEP GOING.

186
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,283
MASTER SHIROE'S
NOT IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW.

187
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,519
WE HAVE TO HANDLE THIS!

188
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,386
AH... DID I JUST
HEAR YOU CORRECTLY?

189
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:25,988
SHIROE ISN'T HERE IN THE CITY?

190
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:29,959
UH... LISTEN HE ASKED US TO
KEEP IT QUIET IF WE COULD.

191
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,628
BUT YES, SHIROE ISN'T HERE.

192
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,230
HE'S CURRENTLY ON A MISSION
OUTSIDE OF AKIHABARA.

193
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,765
[NAZNA]
WELL THAT EXPLAINS A LOT.

194
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,701
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING SO STRANGE.

195
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,870
AKATSUKI?
UH?

196
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,406
[NAZNA] YOU STILL HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

197
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,509
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN?

198
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,045
CAN YOU STOP THIS GUY
FROM KILLING AGAIN?

199
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,379
UPH.

200
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,683
AND ARE YOU ABLE TO
DO IT ALL ON YOUR OWN?

201
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,484
[AKATSUKI] 'COURSE NOT ALONE.
[HENRIETTA] OH?

202
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,820
I KNOW I CAN'T HANDLE
THIS GUY BY MYSELF.

203
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,456
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.

204
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:02,625
PLEASE HELP ME END THIS!

205
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,927
(SHAKY BREATH)

206
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:08,765
[AKATSUKI]
OHH...

207
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,133
[RIEZE] I WOULD SAY YOU'VE
PASSED OUR TEST,

208
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,769
IF ONLY HALFWAY.

209
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,104
D. D. D. HAS BUT EIGHT
CONFIRMED ORAL ARTS

210
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:17,306
AMONG ITS MEMBERS
AT THE MOMENT.

211
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,342
LORD KRUSTY'S ALREADY
GIVEN US PERMISSION.

212
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,912
WE WILL SHARE EVERYTHING
WE KNOW WITH YOU.

213
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:23,980
UH...

214
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,649
GOODNESS...

215
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,852
THIS IS LIKE GOING THROUGH
MIDDLE SCHOOL ALL OVER AGAIN.

216
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,096
[MISA]
SEE FOR YOURSELF,

217
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:42,431
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
ANY MORE GOBLINS IN THIS AREA.

218
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:44,133
[KRUSTY]
YEAH...

219
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:45,134
[MISA]
MY LORD!

220
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,368
[KRUSTY]
HM?

221
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,638
YOU'RE GETTING BORED
AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

222
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:52,975
AH... OKAY GUILTY AS CHARGED.
I'M COMING OUT OF MY SKIN.

223
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,511
YEAH WELL DEAL WITH IT.

224
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,745
LOOK I WOULDN'T BE HERE

225
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:57,780
IF I WASN'T ABLE TO
ENDURE SUCH THINGS.

226
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,081
(SIGH)

227
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,149
HM?

228
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,718
[KRUSTY]
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

229
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,986
MY WEAPON'S BEEN ACTING
A BIT STRANGE AS OF LATE.

230
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,322
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE SOMEONE
TAKE A LOOK AT IT, REPAIR IT?

231
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:11,127
YEAH, I GUESS I COULD, BUT IT'S
WORKING FINE OTHER THAN THIS.

232
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:12,328
[KRUSTY]
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

233
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,163
YOU WEAPON IS NAMED
"DISASTER," YES?

234
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,799
YEAH, EVEN THE FLAVOR TEXT
ISN'T VERY FLATTERING

235
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,901
IN ITS DESCRIPTION
OF IT EITHER.

236
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,805
IT'S A LITTLE BETTER NOW.
SORRY FOR BRINGING IT UP.

237
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,710
(ELECTRIC SOUNDS)

238
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,547
(MUTTERING)

239
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,083
[ALI]
MMMMMM...

240
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,484
GLAD THAT'S OVER WITH...

241
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,019
I ALWAYS GET NERVOUS

242
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,955
WHEN I HAVE TO PRESENT
MY RESEARCH TO THE CLASS.

243
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,057
[AOMORI] WELL EVERYBODY
SEEMED TO BE PRETTY IMPRESSED

244
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:42,659
WITH YOUR WORK Y'KNOW.

245
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,194
IT WAS THE COOLEST THING TO COME
OUT OF RODERICK'S WORKSHOP...

246
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,597
AT LEAST IT
SEEMED LIKE IT TO ME.

247
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,299
IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY COOL
THING IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

248
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,602
NOT NEEDING A CHEF SUBCLASS
TO COOK ANYMORE.

249
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,171
[MIKAKAGE] YEAH WELL,
I WOULDN'T CALL MAKING A SALAD

250
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,739
A GRAND ACHIEVEMENT.

251
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,641
STILL I'M NOT SURE REALLY
HOW IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE

252
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,376
TO BEGIN WITH.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

253
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:01,611
[ALL]
HM?

254
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,879
[AOMORI]
IT'S THE GUILD MASTER.

255
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,914
[RODERICK]
AH, CONTINUE EATING EVERYONE.

256
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,383
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
SOME OF OUR LATEST FINDINGS

257
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,019
ON A FEW OF THE THINGS
WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING.

258
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,054
THERE ARE THREE TOPICS
I NEED TO SHARE WITH YOU

259
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:13,590
WHILE WE STILL HAVE THE TIME.

260
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,559
FIRST IS THE GENDER GAP THAT
GOES BACK TO OUR GAMING DAYS.

261
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,860
[AOMORI]
"GENDER GAP"?

262
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,596
YOU KNOW HOW SOME
PEOPLE PLAYED THE GAME

263
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,599
AS THE OPPOSITE GENDER?
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANS.

264
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:24,701
THE BODY INFLUENCES PERSONALITY,

265
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,336
BUT NOW IT APPEARS THOSE
GENDER CHARACTERISTICS

266
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,938
WILL ALSO BE PASSED TO
YOUR VOCAL CORDS.

267
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:32,174
THUS FURTHER ALTERING
ONE'S GENDER IN THIS WORLD.

268
00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:35,011
IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY AN
ADVENTURER IN A FEMALE BODY,

269
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,947
YOUR VOICE WILL GRADUALLY
BECOME MORE FEMININE.

270
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,282
THOSE MALE PLAYERS
WILL CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE

271
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,818
FEMALE CHARACTERISTICS.

272
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,819
(SURPRISED GASP)

273
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,454
NEXT IS A
GEOGRAPHICAL OBSERVATION.

274
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,823
AND TO BE HONEST...

275
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,858
THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS
THAN ANSWERS ABOUT THIS.

276
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,661
BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE
DISTANCE BETWEEN AKIHABARA

277
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,564
AND MT. FUJI IS
GRADUALLY INCREASING.

278
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:57,399
ACTUALLY IT'S THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN ANY TWO POINTS.

279
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,802
ALTHOUGH THE INCREMENTS
ARE RATHER SMALL FOR NOW.

280
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,104
[BLACKSMITH] EXCUSE ME!
[RODERICK] YES. GO AHEAD.

281
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,741
[BLACKSMITH] IS THAT GOING ON
EVERYWHERE, GUILD MASTER?

282
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:08,344
I MEAN, ARE THE MOUNTAIN RANGES
THEMSELVES ALSO GETTING BIGGER?

283
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,646
IS EVERYTHING GROWING?

284
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:11,881
YES, THAT APPEARS
TO BE THE CASE.

285
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:15,585
[RODERICK] THE LAST ISSUE WE'LL
BE ADDRESSING IS FLAVOR TEXT.

286
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:16,953
[RODERICK]
AS YOU'RE ALREADY AWARE,

287
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,288
FLAVOR TEXT IS JUST
AN EXPLANATION DESCRIBING

288
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,890
AN ITEM'S ORIGINS AND ABILITIES

289
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,025
ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY
THE DEVELOPERS.

290
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,528
THEY CALLED IT "FLAVOR TEXT"
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY THERE

291
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,396
TO ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE
OF THE GAME PLAY.

292
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,365
OKAY, THEY'RE
THE LITTLE POP‐UPS

293
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,433
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO
SET THE MOOD AND STUFF.

294
00:17:31,534 --> 00:17:33,102
[RODERICK]
THAT'S RIGHT.

295
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,972
THESE BLURBS WERE NEVER MEANT TO
HAVE ANY REAL MEANING TO THEM.

296
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,675
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
SEEMS TO HAVE CHANGED.

297
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,611
ANYTHING WRITTEN ABOUT ANY
PERSON OR THING IN ITS TEXT

298
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,145
HAS A NEW RELEVANCE.

299
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,313
[MIKAKAGE] CRAZY...

300
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:45,915
[RODERICK]
IS IT SIMPLY COINCIDENCE

301
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:48,618
THAT ALL THESE RECENT PHENOMENA
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING LATELY?

302
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,720
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY

303
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,890
THAT THIS WORLD IS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LARGE‐SCALE TRANSFORMATION.

304
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,228
IT APPEARS THE APOCALYPSE
ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR COMPLETE.

305
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,102
[RIEZE]
I HAVE A REPORT ON HIM.

306
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:09,271
THE SERIAL KILLER IS
A PERSON OF THE LAND.

307
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,773
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
SHE TOLD THEM...

308
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,975
[RIEZE] IF THIS INFORMATION
BECOMES PUBLIC,

309
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:14,711
IT'S GOING TO DO
IRREPARABLE DAMAGE

310
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:17,379
TO THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN BOTH OUR PEOPLES.

311
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,881
I CAN ONLY ASSUME
THAT'S THE REASON

312
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:21,518
YOU WENT OUT TRYING TO HANDLE
THIS MATTER ON YOUR OWN?

313
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,119
[RIEZE]
AM I RIGHT?

314
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,621
MM.

315
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:26,856
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WANTED TO DO THIS...

316
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,992
BUT THE PUBLIC WOULD'VE
DISCOVERED THE TRUTH EVENTUALLY.

317
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:32,795
WELL NOT IF EVERYONE IN THE
PUBLIC IS ALREADY DEAD.

318
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,496
IS THE BRIGADE OF
THE WEST WIND

319
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,232
PLANNING TO RELEASE
THIS INFORMATION?

320
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:40,269
NO! SOJIRO SAID WE'RE GOING
TO STAY OUT OF IT FOR NOW.

321
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,005
HE'S WAITING FOR THESE
TWO TO FIX THIS MESS.

322
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,240
[RIEZE] MEANING?

323
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,008
[NAZNA] MEANING SOMEONE
NEEDS TO SET THEM STRAIGHT.

324
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,377
AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT ME
TO BE THE ONE TO DO IT.

325
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,046
(SIGH)

326
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,214
[HENRIETTA] SO WHAT EXACTLY
WERE THE TWO OF YOU THINKING?

327
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,483
I'M GOING TO GUESS
YOU DECIDED ON YOUR OWN

328
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,019
THAT YOU SHOULD
HANDLE IT YOURSELVES.

329
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,422
EVEN THOUGH YOU ALREADY KNEW
THAT YOU COULDN'T DO THIS ALONE.

330
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:02,391
YOU WENT ANYWAY.

331
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,626
PERHAPS YOU DON'T THINK

332
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,027
VERY HIGHLY OF YOUR
FRIENDS' ABILITIES.

333
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,830
HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN ON
BEING A SOLO ACT?

334
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,800
SHIROE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
OUT HERE THAT YOU CAN DEPEND ON.

335
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,536
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN
TO RELY ON ONE ANOTHER.

336
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:14,737
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
SHE'S RIGHT.

337
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,639
THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I'VE SEEN THINGS.

338
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,940
HE CASTS A BIG SHADOW.

339
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,042
AND I'VE BEEN HIDING IN IT
ALL THIS TIME.

340
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:23,379
I NEVER EVEN MADE AN ATTEMPT
TO GET TO KNOW ANYONE ELSE.

341
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,715
MUCH LESS LEARN TO TRUST THEM.

342
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:29,552
AS SOON AS MY LORD WAS GONE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

343
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,921
I COULDN'T EVEN DO
WHAT HE ASKED ME TO...

344
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,723
[HENRIETTA] WEREN'T YOU
COMING TO THIS MANSION

345
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:35,391
TO BE A BODYGUARD
FOR THE PRINCESS?

346
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:36,859
UH!

347
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:39,228
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE
ASSIGNED TO SUIFUU.

348
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,698
DID YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON

349
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:43,099
GUARDING THE PRINCESS?

350
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,102
RIEZE AND I MIGHT HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

351
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:48,237
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON

352
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,839
MY LORD COUNTS ON.

353
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,843
BUT... BUT WHEN I SAW HOW THAT
BURDEN WAS BEARING DOWN ON HER,

354
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,246
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO
MAKE IT LESS THAN IT WAS.

355
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,949
I HAD TO HELP THE PRINCESS.

356
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,818
[AKATSUKI]
I NEED YOUR HELP.

357
00:20:01,918 --> 00:20:03,485
I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU!

358
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,054
[HENRIETTA]
OF COURSE WE'LL HELP YOU!

359
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,323
RIEZE AND I ARE HERE TO
HELP HOWEVER WE CAN.

360
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,492
BUT THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE
THAT CAN HELP YOU AS WELL.

361
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,594
[AKATSUKI]
SOMEONE ELSE...?

362
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:13,262
[HENRIETTA]
YES.

363
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:17,867
[RAYNESHIA]
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO...

364
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,970
BECAUSE ABOVE ALL,
AKATSUKI IS MY FRIEND!

[AKATSUKI] RAYNESHIA'S DOING
THE BEST SHE CAN EVERYDAY.

367
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,147
WE CAN HELP HER.

00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,481
ALL OF US.

369
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,416
TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT.

370
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:36,786
I ASK YOU...

371
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:39,956
I NEED YOU...
I NEED MY FRIENDS.
