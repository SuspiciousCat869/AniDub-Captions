1
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,494
[DINKURON] ALL RIGHT!
LET'S GET THIS RAID STARTED!

2
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:09,061
[UKIYO]
YEAH, IT'S KINDA COOL TO THINK

3
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,398
WE'RE THE FIRST ADVENTURERS
TO BRAVE THIS CHALLENGE!

4
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:13,833
[JUNZO] DEFINITELY! BUT I'M
GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS!

5
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:16,168
[PIANISSISSIMO] UH...
I'M GONNA TRY THE BEST I CAN.

6
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,006
[ENKARTANTO] WE'LL BE FINE!
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

7
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,708
[WILLIAM]
OKAY, GUYS...

8
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:23,876
I HOPE YOU'RE READY.

9
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:26,145
THIS ZONE BELONGS TO US...

10
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:29,015
WE SHALL TAKE IT AND
HOIST OUR FLAG HIGH!

11
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,710
[TOKO]
TWO GOT BY ME!

12
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,177
[DINKURON] I NEED A
RECOVERY SPELL OVER HERE!

13
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:06,779
[FEDERICO]
HIT THEIR FLANKS!

14
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,080
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THIS IS THE RAID ZONE,

15
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,583
AT THE VERY BOTTOM
OF THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

16
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:14,821
IT'S KNOWN AS "THE PATH TO THE
ABYSS," THE "ABYSSAL SHAFT"

17
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,892
THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A
TYPICAL RAID DUNGEON

18
00:02:19,992 --> 00:02:22,295
IF WE WERE PLAYING IT IN A GAME.

19
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:25,732
A "RAID DUNGEON," ‐ A POWERED UP
VERSION OF A NORMAL DUNGEON.

20
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,000
EXTRA HALLWAYS, ROOMS,
TRAPS AND PUZZLES.

21
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,503
IT IS COMPOSED OF SEVERAL
EXTENSIVE AREAS.

22
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:34,073
MORE PLACES TO GET HIT, GET
HURT, OR DIE FOR THAT MATTER.

23
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,475
YOU'VE GOTTA WATCH YOUR BACK

24
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,176
AND HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,

25
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:39,312
WHILE GOING AFTER YOUR
GOALS AND TREASURES,

26
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:41,881
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
FINDING THE EXIT.

27
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,522
[HIGHLAND]
ENEMY CONTACT, FOUR O'CLOCK!

28

[DINKURON]
DIG IN, YOU GUYS!

29
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,625

THREE ORKS' JELLIES! RAID CLASS!

[SHIROE]

31
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,528
[NAOTSUGU]
RIGHT! ON IT!

32
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,764
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
A FULL RAID IS COMPOSED OF

33
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:59,266
FOUR NORMAL PARTIES OF SIX,

34
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,335
MAKING A "SUPER‐PARTY"
OF TWENTY‐FOUR PLAYERS.

35
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:05,238
WE'VE STARTED OUT WITH
A CLASSIC BATTLE FORMATION.

36
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:07,340
PARTY ONE ARE THE TANKS,
PURE FIGHTERS

37
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,642
BIG ON MUSCLE,
HIT POINTS AND ARMOR,

38
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:11,043
TANKS MAKE UP THE FRONT LINES,

39
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,646
ABSORBING AND DISHING OUT
MASSIVE PUNISHMENT.

40
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,550
IF THE TANKS FAIL, THE REST
OF US ARE SUNK. PERIOD.

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,653
I'VE GOT THREE MONSTERS IN SIGHT
JUST SOUTHWEST OF HERE.

42
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:21,854
[NAOTSUGU]
NO PROBLEM!

43
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,491
ANCHOR HOWL!

44
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,725
WUAAH! FUUU!

[DEMICAS]
WYVERN KICK!

46
00:03:28,695 --> 00:03:30,863
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
PARTY TWO IS THE REAR ECHELON.

47
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:32,765
IF ANYTHING GETS PAST PARTY ONE,

48
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,467
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO
USE THEIR MOBILITY

49
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,736
TO ENGAGE THE STRAGGLERS
AND KNOCK THEM OUT,

50
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:38,538
WHILE STILL
SUPPORTING PARTY ONE.

51
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,007
FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY
TO BEING IN PARTY TWO.

52
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,009
YOU CAN'T JUST
SIT STILL AND FIGHT.

53
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,844
[SHIROE] MORE JELLIES
ON OUR FLANKS, PEOPLE!

54
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,446
WE NEED BACKUP HERE AND QUICK!

55
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,416
I'VE GOT SIX OF THEM IN SIGHT!
PARTY FOUR, BLOCK THE EAST EXIT!

00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:51,050
[WILLIAM]
RAPID FIRE!

57
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,388
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
PARTIES THREE AND FOUR

58
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:58,124
SPECIALIZE IN LONG‐RANGE
ATTACKS: ARCHERY AND SORCERY.

59
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,326
THEY'RE LIGHT ON ARMOR,

60
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,194
BUT HEAVY DAMAGE DEALERS
AT A DISTANCE.

61
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:03,730
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
TO STAY OUT OF THE FRAY.

62
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,232
HIT AND DON'T GET HIT.

63
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,499
PARTY THREE ATTACKS WHILE
PARTY FOUR WATCHES THEIR BACK.

64
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,268
[JUNZO] GET BACK!
[PIANISSISSIMO] OKAY!

65
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:10,002
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THAT'S THE
BEST‐CASE SCENARIO, ANYWAY.

66
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:12,439
AND HONESTLY,
IT NEARLY ALWAYS WORKS.

67
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,741
WILLIAM AND I AGREED
ON THIS FORMATION

68
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:16,209
AND THE ROLES FOR
THE MOBILE UNITS

69
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,478
ONCE WE STARTED ENGAGING
THE ENEMY'S FORCES.

70
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,614
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] "RAID CLASS"
MONSTERS ARE A LOT TOUGHER

71
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,850
THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS
OUTSIDE OF A RAID ZONE...

72
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,919
AND THEY HAVE EXTRA
POWERS AS WELL.

73
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,421
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE,

74
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,823
THE LEVEL CAP HAS GONE
FROM NINETY TO A HUNDRED.

75
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,726
THAT INCLUDES MONSTERS.

76
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:37,129
SO WE CAN'T ASSUME WE'RE MORE
POWERFUL THAN THEM ANYMORE.

77
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,599
THIS RAID ZONE IS TOO FAR
FROM THE NEAREST CATHEDRAL,

78
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,235
SO IF WE DIE, WE COME BACK
TO LIFE AT THE FRONT DOORS.

MORE POWERFUL,

THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS.

THIS IS WHERE IT
REALLY PAYS OFF.

132

A TANK HAS TO KEEP ON INCREASING
A MONSTER'S "ATTRACT FIRE,"

133
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:39,886
IT KEEPS THE MONSTER
FOCUSED ON THE TANK

152
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,127
[NAOTSUGU]
ONE HANDED CROSS SLASH!

153
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,429
[PROROCCA] LOOK AT THAT!

154
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:23,796
[MOLLUSCA] WE'VE TAKEN
A TENTH OF HIS HEALTH!

155
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,398
[BOTH] AGGHHHHH!!!

156
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,700
[NAOTSUGU] WE'VE JUST LOST
A BUNCH OFF THE PLATFORM!

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,369
[SHIROE]
WE'VE GOT ONE FLAT ON HIS BACK!

158
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,204
AND ANOTHER TWO WERE
BLOWN OUT OF THE ZONE!

159
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:33,840
[WILLIAM] UH! QUICK! HE'S TRYING
TO GET TO HIGHER GROUND!

160
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,041
[DINKURON]
LET'S GET HIM!

161
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,243
[ALL] YEAH!

162
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:37,710
[TOKO]
WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL, GUYS!

163
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,712
[UKIYO] THAT'S RIGHT.
IT CAN BREATHE FIRE.

164
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:41,614
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] WHEN A
RAID BOSS' HEALTH GETS LOWER,

165
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,116
ITS ATTACKS BECOME
MORE INTENSE AND VARIED.

166
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,553
(HOWLS)

167
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:47,220
WOAH!

168
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,589
(SCREAMING)

169
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:52,992
IT DID NOT JUST CHANGE ITS
ELEMENTAL TYPE AND TIMING.

170
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:54,994
THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY ROUGH!

171
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:56,229
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,

172
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,630
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH A RAID BOSS

173
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,132
THE SAME WAY YOU DID WHEN
IT WAS A NORMAL BATTLE.

174
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,335
[ORDISSO] AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
[RAGOMARU] AGGGHHH...!

175
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:04,103
[NAOTSUGU/TETORA]
AHHHHHH!

176
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,072
[SHIROE]
NAOTSUGU! TETORA! NO!

177
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:08,775
(SCREECH)

178
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,777
[SHIROE VOICEOVER]
YOU WON'T WIN A BATTLE LIKE THIS

179
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:12,779
SIMPLY BY GROUPING A BUNCH
OF STRONG PLAYERS EITHER.

180
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,515
[RAGOMARU]
UWH! DINKURON'S BEEN PETRIFIED!

181
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,950
[FEDERICO]
AAAGH! WE'VE LOST ALL OUR TANKS.

182
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,286
[JUNZO]
WHERE ARE THE HEALERS?

183
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,920
[RAGOMARU]
THEY'RE ALL GONE! WE GOTTA MOVE!

184
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,456
[SHIROE]
MASSACHUSETTS...! LET'S GO!

185
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:24,724
[WILLIAM]
OKAY, FINE...

186
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,561
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
FALL BACK, PEOPLE!

187
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:32,932
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
IN A CASE LIKE THIS,

188
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,368
A TEAM ENDS UP FALLING BACK
AND DYING SEVERAL TIMES

189
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:39,272
UNTIL IT FIGURES OUT THE
BEST SET OF TACTICS TO USE.

190
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,278
AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DID.

191
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:47,247
VENDEMIAIRE,
OF THE FIRST PRISON,

192
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:50,450
DEFEATED US SEVERAL TIMES
BEFORE WE EVEN HAD A CHANCE.

193
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,322
(ROAR)

194
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,461
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
HE NEVER COMPLETELY WIPED US OUT

195
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:03,596
BUT HE CAME AWFULLY CLOSE.

196
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:06,266
[HIGHLAND] I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING WRONG.

197
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,100
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
A RAID PARTY HAS TO LEARN

198
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,569
A RAID BOSS' PATTERNS
AND STRATEGIES

199
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:11,671
OR THEY'LL JUST KEEP DYING.

200
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:14,341
NOT ALL RAIDS ARE SIMPLE
IN‐AND‐OUT BATTLES.

201
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:16,543
SOME TAKE AS LONG AS
A MONTH TO FINISH,

202
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:19,011
IF YOU EVER
FINISH THEM AT ALL...

203
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,180
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
BUT EVENTUALLY...

204
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,216
[WILLIAM]
IT'S WHEN IT BLINKS.

205
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:24,484
[PROMETHEUS]
RIGHT AFTERWARDS.

206
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:25,852
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO'S FIGHTING IT,

207
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,320
IT PICKS TEN RANDOM PEOPLE.

208
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,357
IT PLACES STATUS‐EFFECTS OR
USES INSTANT DEATH SKILL.

209
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,758
[DINKURON] YEAH...

210
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,193
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT THE TIMING ON THAT.

211
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,394
[SHIROE]
TWENTY‐SIX SECONDS.

212
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:35,862
[ALL]
HUH?

213
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,998
GUYS, IT'S TWENTY‐SIX SECONDS.

214
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:42,702
(SCREECH)
[WILLIAM] TIME IT NOW!

215
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,471
[ELTON DISKA] ALL RIGHT, GUYS...
GET AROUND THE FRONT!

216
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:47,173
[SASAMEYUKI]
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

217
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:48,441
[PIANISSISSIMO]
HURRY AND GET INTO POSITION!

218
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,709
[SASAMEYUKI]
... SEVEN!

219
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,278
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
LIKE THE REST OF US,

220
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,313
RAID BOSSES HAVE RE‐CAST
AND COOL‐DOWN PERIODS.

221
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:54,614
TIMING IS EVERYTHING.

222
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,283
KNOW THE TIMING, EVADE,
THEN COUNTERATTACK.

223
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,218
THEN DOING DAMAGE
IS ALMOST EASY.

224
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,419
[SASAMEYUKI]
SIXTY! GO!

225
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,420
[SHIROE]
WILLIAM!

226
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,821
[WILLIAM]
YEAH!

227
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:04,023
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT!

228
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,359
(SCREECH)

229
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,895
[JUNZO] HEY! IT ISN'T
FLASHING THIS TIME!

230
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:11,864
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, NO MORE GETTING
TURNED INTO STATUES!

231
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:13,333
[TETORA] LET'S GO GET HIM!

232
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,535
[WILLIAM] ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS!

233
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,904
DO SOME REAL DAMAGE THIS TIME!

234
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:19,772
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
IF THE TEAM ATTACKS BASED ON

235
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,342
WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE
BOSS' STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES,

236
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,510
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME

237
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,878
BEFORE IT GETS
THE VICTORY IT WANTS.

238
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:28,348
(EXPLOSION)

239
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:32,485
BEAT A RAID BOSS,
AND YOU PRETTY MUCH

240
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:35,788
GET SHOWERED WITH GOLD
AND EPIC‐CLASS ITEMS.

241
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:40,092
THE SECOND RAID BOSS WAS
EL RAIDA OF THE FIFTH PRISON.

242
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:43,296
HER SPECIALTY WAS RESETTING OUR
ACCUMULATED FOCAL HATRED

243
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,898
AND SUMMONING GUARDIAN BEASTS
TO DEAL WITH US.

244
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,066
IT WAS BRUTAL.

245
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,167
(HEAVY BREATHING)

246
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,736
HWYA!

247
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,444
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] HOWEVER,
WE FINALLY TOOK CARE OF IT

248
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:59,111
ON OUR ELEVENTH TRY.

249
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:00,513
WE'VE HAD A TOUGH GO OF IT,

250
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,949
BUT BY HITTING ALL THESE
RAID BOSSES ONE AT A TIME

251
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,150
EN ROUTE TO OUR GOAL,

252
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:06,353
SEEMS TO BE HAVING
THE EFFECT WE WANT.

253
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:09,556
NOW... THIS IS A
FULL RAID PARTY.

254
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,634
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] WE'RE NOW
THREE WEEKS INTO OUR ASSAULT

255
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:24,003
ON THE ABYSSAL SHAFT,
GIVE OR TAKE A DAY.

256
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,073
[FEDERICO] NOT AGAIN.
[VOINEN] THERE HE GOES...

257
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,409
[DEMICAS] I'LL SHOW YOU
THE WAY TO HELL, MONSTERS!

258
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:30,777
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, WAIT!

259
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,579
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HOLD OFF
ON THE TAUNTS, MAN!

260
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:33,880
YOU'RE DRAWING TOO MUCH
ATTENTION, DEMI‐POO!

261
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,748
SHUT IT YOU POT‐BELLIED
STOVE, I'M GONNA‐!

262
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:38,518

WAAUGH! LOOK OUT! BEHIND YOU!

263
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,323
UWH! WYVERN KICK!

264
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,525
DOES HE ENJOY
GETTING HIMSELF HURT?

265
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,760
GUESS WE HAVE TO
BACK THAT MANIAC UP.

266
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,061
(RASPY BREATH)

267
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,800
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER] THE DEEPER
AND FARTHER WE GOT IN,

268
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,902
THE MORE VICIOUS
THE DUNGEON BECAME.

269
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:57,404
(LABORED BREATHING)

270
00:11:57,504 --> 00:11:59,206
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THE LEVELS OF THE MONSTERS GREW.

271
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:01,808
AND SO DID THE INTENSITY
OF THE BATTLES.

272
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:03,343
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
AND WE HAD TO FIGHT WITHOUT

273
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,312
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE
LAYOUT OF THE ZONE.

274
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,379
(GROANS)

275
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:07,414
[TETORA]
GET READY!

276
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:09,416
IT'S TIME TO HEAL!

277
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:12,385
NOW DON'T GO FALLING IN
LOVE WITH ME... OKAY?

278
00:12:12,485 --> 00:12:14,153
CAST THE FREAKIN' SPELL ALREADY!

279
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,388
(GIGGLES)
OH. OH RIGHT!

280
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,923
HERE YOU GO!

281
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:21,694
OKAY! IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE
MORE PEP IN YOUR STEP!

00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,599
[ALL] AHHHHHH....

[MOLLUSCA TYPE @ AKIBA]
OH, SPLENDID!

285
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:29,936
[SHIROE]
CONCENTRATE YOUR ATTACKS!

286
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:31,971
BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE!

287
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,373
[ALL]
RIGHT!

288
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,141
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
WE DEFEATED TWO RAID BOSSES,

289
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:38,478
BUT WE'RE WONDERING WHY WE
HAVEN'T SEEN A THIRD ONE YET.

290
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:41,981
AND A LITTLE SNOOPING AROUND
HASN'T HELPED US, EITHER.

291
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:44,917
AS IT STANDS,
WE'RE COMPLETELY STUCK.

292
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,120
[WILLIAM]
HOW MANY DO YOU THINK ARE LEFT?

293
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,556
[SHIROE]
YOU MEAN RAID BOSSES?

294
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:51,724
THERE HAS TO BE
AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR.

295
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:56,396
[WILLIAM] WE CAN'T DO THIS...
NOT IN TEN DAYS.

296
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:58,198
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
SUPPLIES AND LOGISTICS

297
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,532
ARE GETTING REALLY PROBLEMATIC.

298
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,800
WE GET RESURRECTED IF WE DIE,

299
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,069
BUT FIXING WORN OUT
EQUIPMENT ISN'T EASY.

300
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,805
WE HAVE TO TAKE TIME OUT TO LET
THE PLAYERS WITH CRAFTING SKILLS

301
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:07,774
GET OUR WEAPONS AND

00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:11,544
OTHERWISE, WE CAN'T LAST LONG
ENOUGH TO DO ANY REAL DAMAGE.

303
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:12,945
AND WILLIAM ONLY HAS

304
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,448
A HANDFUL OF CRYSTAL COMET
ARROWS TO USE AT A TIME.

305
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,517
HE'S CONSTANTLY TAXING OUR
EPIC CRAFTSMEN

306
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:20,553
AND SUPPLIES TO
RESTOCK HIS QUIVER.

307
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:22,522
(HUMMING)

308
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:24,291
SO WE'RE RUNNING OUT?

309
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,126
THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG
OUR PROVISIONS WILL LAST.

310
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:28,561
YEAH, AND THIS
FULL‐RAID PARTY

311
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,463
IS BEATING THE GEAR UP
PRETTY BADLY.

312
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:31,831
NOT TO MENTION YOU CAN'T GET

313
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,033
A LOT OF THESE WEAPONS
OUTSIDE OF A RAID.

314
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:36,135
SAME WITH THE MATERIALS
FOR THE REPAIR WORK.

315
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,639
WELL THAT'S WHY OTHER RAID
GUILDS GO ON LOWER‐LEVEL RAIDS;

316
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,040
TO GET MATERIALS THEY NEED

317
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,075
TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN
BETTER WEAPONS.

318
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,577
EASIER SAID THAN DONE...

319
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:47,480
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN HIT ALL
THE RAID ZONES ALL THE TIME.

320
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,181
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT, ISN'T IT.

321
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:52,319
WE'RE A MASTER RAID GUILD.
WE DON'T DO LESSER RAIDS.

322
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,622
AFTER ALL WE DO HAVE OUR PRIDE
TO THINK ABOUT, DON'T WE?

323
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,956
IT'S NOT JUST THAT!

324
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,891
WILLIAM WOULDN'T WASTE
OUR TIME ON SUCH THINGS.

325
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,227
GOT THAT RIGHT.

326
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:03,563
THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO STAY
WITH HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

327
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:05,765
HE HAS OUR
BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.

328
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:09,269
I MANAGED TO GET SOME
PROVISIONS BEFORE WE LEFT.

329
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,238
HOW LONG WILL
THEY SUSTAIN US?

330
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,373
ALONG WITH EVERYTHING YOU
BROUGHT... TWENTY DAYS.

331
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,942
[WILLIAM]
HUH? TWENTY DAYS?

332
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,710
[SHIROE] I GUESS THAT
ISN'T MUCH HELP, IS IT?

333
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,812
[WILLIAM]
UH, NO...

334
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,514
NOT REALLY.

335
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:22,815
YEAH I KNOW...

336
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,484
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
SERIOUSLY?

337
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:26,853
LOG HORIZON HAS WHAT,
EIGHT PLAYERS IN IT?

338
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,788
NOT EXACTLY A "POWER GUILD"

339
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,724
HOW DID HE MANAGE TO GET ALL
OF THOSE SUPPLIES ON HIS OWN?

340
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:35,195
THIS GUY REALLY IS
SOMETHING ELSE, ISN'T HE?

341
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,599
AFTER I TOLD THE ROUND TABLE
I WASN'T INTERESTED

342
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,033
IN THEIR ENDEAVORS,

343
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,603
I LEAD SILVER SWORD AROUND
TO THE VARIOUS RAID ZONES

344
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,439
UNTIL WE GOT TO SUSUKINO.

345
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,609
I DON'T REGRET ANY OF THE
DECISIONS I'VE MADE TO GET HERE.

346
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,612
I FEEL NO SHAME,

347
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,548
BUT ... NONETHELESS.

348
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:57,550
[GUY A]
LOOK, I'M DONE WITH THIS...

349
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,885
[GUY B]
GOOD LUCK. SEE YA LATER!

350
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,554
[GUY C]
IT WAS FUN, GUILD MASTER!

351
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,490
THEY EVEN KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE GOING?

352
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,592
LET 'EM STARVE
OUT THERE.

353
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,059
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
AND WELL, HERE WE ARE,

354
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,928
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T
BOTHER TO ASK SHIROE

355
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,630
WHAT THE HELL IT WAS
HE WAS LOOKING FOR

356
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,032
AND HOW MUCH TROUBLE
IT WAS GONNA BE.

357
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,135
THEY JUST FOLLOWED ME...

358
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,639
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING

359
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,508
OR THE WRONG THING OUT HERE.

360
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:24,411
OR WHAT TO TELL THEM
IF THEY ASK?

361
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:25,945
JESUS. I'M JUST A GAMER.

362
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:28,715
I'M NOT SOME GUY WHO JUMPED OFF
THE PAGES OF A COMIC BOOK,

363
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:32,319
FULL OF AMAZING FIGHTING SKILLS
AND BUILT‐IN LEADERSHIP.

364
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,588
BUT I MUST WONDER...

365
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:39,226
... WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT
MIND OF YOURS, SHIROE?

366
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:41,261
[SHIROE, THINKING] HAVING A
NICE QUIET PLACE TO READ,

367
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,896
KINDA WORKS IN MY FAVOR.

368
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:47,234
BUT HE'S SURE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M UP TO SOONER OR LATER.

369
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,769
AND EVEN IF SOMEONE FROM MINAMI
DOESN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS,

370
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,504
SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT BE AFTER US.

371
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,274
(ROCK BREAKING)
[BOTH] HM?

372
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,642
THAT LITTLE RAT!

373
00:15:55,742 --> 00:16:00,947
(GROWL) YOU LITTLE PUKE!
RAHHHH! (HEAVY BREATH)

374
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,716
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
DAMN YOU, SHIROE!

375
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:05,218
YEAH, THAT BIG MOUTH PUSSY CAT

376
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,054
AND THAT LOUD‐MOUTH KNUCKLEHEAD
I CAN DEAL WITH...

377
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:11,324
AT LEAST THEY GAVE ME A FIGHT.
I CAN RESPECT THAT.

378
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,526
(SNARL)

379
00:16:13,626 --> 00:16:17,397
ALL HE DID WAS PLAY WITH HIS
GLASSES AND GIVE PEOPLE ORDERS!

380
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:21,601
AND ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
HE DISRESPECTED ME.

381
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,236
[SHIROE] SO WHICH ONE
OF YOU FUTURE DEAD GUYS

382
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:24,637
IS DEMI‐DOOFUS OR WHATEVER?

383
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:25,738
UWAH?

384
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,139
PARDON ME...
YOU'RE DOOFUS.

385
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,941
(ANGRY SCREAM)

386
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,711
[DEMICAS, THINKING]
WAIT,

387
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:34,781
MY EXTRA FIGHTING POWER
WAS HIM BUFFING ME.

388
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:38,785
HE USED KEEN EDGE
TO BOOST MY STRENGTH

389
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:43,390
AND MIND SHOCK TO MAKE SURE
THE MONSTER DIDN'T MOVE.

390
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,426
THAT LITTLE CREEP TOUCHED ME
WITH HIS MAGIC AGAIN!

391
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:50,029
THAT KID... SAVED MY LIFE?!

392
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:52,299
UWAHHHHARRGGH!

393
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,701
(ROCK SMASHING) AHHHH!

394
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,236
I DON'T SUPPOSE
HE'S NOTICING

395
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,137
THAT I GAVE HIM MORE
VEGETABLES THIS TIME AROUND?

396
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:00,039
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

397
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:02,809
[FEDERICO]
HUMPH! WHAT A DRAMA QUEEN.

398
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,712
[VOINEN] YOU SAID IT...
BUT I'M GLAD HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

399
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,580
YEAH, AT LEAST YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM

400
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,016
RUNNING AWAY IN A FIGHT.

401
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:15,588
[NAOTSUGU]
WOAH! THIS LOOKS AWESOME!

402
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:18,090
[BOTH]
THANK YOU FOR THE STEW YOU GUYS!

403
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,158
(LAUGH, MUNCH)

404
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,560
(BLOWING)

405
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,594
(CHEERFUL CRY)

406
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:25,832
(CHOMP) MMMMM!

407
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:28,868
OH WOW! THIS IS PRETTY GOOD!

408
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,103
HUH? YOU OKAY OVER THERE?

409
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:34,307
HMMM... SOMETHING'S UP WITH
SHIROE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS.

410
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:36,276
YOU KNOW HIM
PRETTY WELL, HUH?

411
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:38,110
I KNOW HE'S GOT A LOT
ON HIS PLATE RIGHT NOW

412
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,213
AND HE'S LOOKING
PRETTY STRESSED.

413
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,316
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

414
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,819
HE ACTUALLY ENJOYS OVERWORKING
HIMSELF AND STAYING BUSY.

415
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,888
OF COURSE,
HE'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT,

416
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,658
SO IT'S HARD TO TELL IF
HE'S IN GOOD SPIRITS OR NOT.

417
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,159
BUT SOMETHING SEEMS OFF.

418
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,129
OKAY, SO HIS FRIEND CAN
SENSE THAT HE'S STRUGGLING.

419
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,898
YEAH.

420
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:01,033
YOU THINK HE NEEDS
A BEAUTIFUL STARLET?

421
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,169
YEAH MAYBE, BUT HE
DOESN'T NEED YOU.

422
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,305
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
SHOW HIM MY PANTIES?!

423
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,274
[NAOTSUGU]
WELL MAYBE IF I SAW 'EM FIRST‐

424
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:08,408
UWH‐WAHAHAHOHH!

425
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,610
HEY! YOU STAY OUT
OF THIS, PIP‐SQUEAK!

426
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,044
(SNEEZE)

427
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:15,315
LOOK, SHIROE'S HARDER
TO CHEER UP THAN I AM.

428
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,817
SO IF HE'S ALREADY DOWN
IN THE DUMPS ALL THE TIME,

429
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,719
WHY WOULD HE COME
TO THIS AWFUL PLACE?

430
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:21,854
UH... HMMM...

431
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,191
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

432
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,728
I'M NOT SURE, BUT I'D SAY
HE'S HERE TO PROTECT HIS HOME.

433
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:30,297
HIS HOME, YOU SAY?

434
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,032
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AN
ACTUAL HOUSE OR BUILDING.

435
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,934
IT'S MORE LIKE
WHAT OUR GUILD IS...

436
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,770
THE CITY... OR MAYBE
EVEN THE WORLD.

437
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,206
[TETORA] THE WORLD?
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, YEAH.

438
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:41,073
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
NEED TO EAT AND SLEEP.

439
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,242
AND DON'T FORGET OUR FRIENDS.

440
00:18:42,342 --> 00:18:44,877
WE HAD FAMILY
WHERE WE CAME FROM.

441
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:46,613
I MEAN IN THIS WORLD, NOW...

442
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:48,515
OUR GUILD'S KINDA LIKE A FAMILY.

443
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:49,849
[TETORA] HMMM...

444
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,751
[NAOTSUGU] AND ALL THOSE
PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT

445
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:53,753
NEED A PLACE TO STAY. YOU KNOW?

446
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:55,688
SO LIKE, AKIHABARA IS

447
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,825
ESSENTIALLY THE HOME
FOR OUR HOME.

448
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,927
IF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY
CAN'T BE HAPPY,

449
00:19:01,027 --> 00:19:03,863
THEN NONE OF THE GUILDS
REALLY HAVE A CHANCE.

450
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:06,233
IF YOU DON'T FEEL SECURE
ABOUT YOUR CITY,

451
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,268
THEN YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR GUILD.

452
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,003
AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
SHIROE WON'T THINK TWICE

453
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,773
ABOUT GOING NOSE TO NOSE
WITH AN ENTIRE CITY

454
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:16,409
OR EVEN THE WORLD ITSELF
TO PROTECT HIS HOME.

455
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,878
OKAY... WHERE'S HOME?

456
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:21,281
[NAOTSUGU] AKIHABARA.
[TETORA] HM?

457
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:24,083
[NAOTSUGU, THINKING] I REALLY
OUGHTA GIVE MARIELLE A CALL...

458
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:26,819
I GUESS IT'S STILL
A LITTLE EARLY...

459
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,721
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T...

460
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,891
AHHHEEEEEEEUAHHHHH...

461
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:34,194
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR
FACE, NAOTSUGU? (GIGGLE)

462
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,329
ACK! N‐NOTHING!
MY FACE IS JUST FINE, ALRIGHT!

463
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,231
MY FACE IS THE
BEST FACE EVER.

464
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,867
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR OWN STUPID FACE!

465
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,069
HM? (GIGGLE)

466
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:45,238
(MINORI HUMMING)

467
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:46,673
SO IS THERE EVEN A DIFFERENCE

468
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,775
BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND
SNOWFELL, ANYWAY?

469
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,343
SNOWFELL'S THE BIG
WINTER CELEBRATION

470
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:52,011
FOR THE PEOPLE OF
THE LAND, RIGHT?

471
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:53,145
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

472
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:54,781
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK...?

473
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:57,116
IS MASTER SHIROE GONNA MAKE IT
BACK IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS?

474
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,085
I DUNNO,
BUT I SURE HOPE SO.

475
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:00,152
HUH?

476
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:03,256
OH, MAN... I MISS THE
HOLIDAYS BACK HOME.

477
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,124
(SOBBING)

478
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:08,195
[LYCOPENE] AW, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, KATSUOMARU?

479
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,530
[KATSUOMARU] THIS IS THE
FIRST TIME I'VE SPENT CHRISTMAS

480
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,931
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY.

481
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,568
I... I'M... I JUST
FEEL LOST, YOU KNOW?!

482
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,136
[SMASH] (SNIFFLE) WHY'D YOU
HAVE TO BRING THAT UP?!

483
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,372
SO LET'S SPEND IT
TOGETHER THIS YEAR.

484
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,841
(CRYING TOGETHER)

485
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:23,175
[RUDY] SANTA CLAUS?

486
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:25,011
WE GET TOGETHER AND
EXCHANGE PRESENTS

487
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:26,579
AROUND SNOWFELL TIME, TOO.

488
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,182
[TOYA] AT CHRISTMAS, SANTA
DELIVERS PRESENTS TO EVERYONE.

489
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:32,385
RIGHT! HE RIDES ON A REINDEER.

490
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:34,787
(GIGGLE) NO THE REINDEER
PULL HIS SLEIGH.

491
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,556
[MINORI] OH YEAH...
[RUDY] I CAN'T WAIT!

492
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:38,858
I WONDER WHAT HE'LL
BRING US THIS YEAR.

493
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,493
TELL YOU WHAT!

494
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:42,795
IF HE'S GOT A SCROLL FOR ONE OF
THOSE ORAL ARTS, THEN I WANT IT!

495
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,064
DID SOMEONE SAY ORAL ART?

496
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,633
HOLY CRAP!

497
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,100
AKATSUKI, WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

498
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:50,069
YOU NEVER CEASE TO
AMAZE ME AKATSUKI!

499
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,705
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU...
COME ON DOWN!

500
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:54,106
CHIEF...

501
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:56,175
HMM, NOTHING LIKE COMING
HOME AFTER A HARD DAY.

502
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:59,078
HAVE YOURSELF SOME TEA
AND A SNACK, HMMM.

503
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,413
I APPRECIATE IT.

504
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:03,149
OKAY... WHAT'RE
THEY TALKING ABOUT?

505
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,484
UH... THE ORAL ARTS...

506
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,286
THEY'RE LIKE THE TALK
OF THE TOWN THESE DAYS.

507
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:08,855
I HEAD SOME TALK
ABOUT THAT MYSELF...

508
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,257
IT'S A NEW WAY FOR SOMEONE

509
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:13,092
TO GO OUT AND GET A NEW
SKILL RANK FOR THEMSELVES.

510
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:14,594
AS YOU ALREADY KNOW,

511
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:16,763
THE STRENGTH OF A FIGHTING SKILL
IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL

512
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,199
TO THE STRENGTH OF
THE PERSON USING IT.

513
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,367
[ISUZU] 'CAUSE THE NEW SKILLS

514
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:21,834
AREN'T PART OF YOUR
EXISTING SKILLS.

515
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:24,204
YOU GOT IT.
AND THEY WORK LIKE THIS:

516
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,139
INTRODUCTORY, MID‐CLASS,
MASTER, AND SECRET.

517
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,541
AS THE SKILL PROGRESSES,

518
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:31,110
IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY
HARD TO BEAT, Y'KNOW.

519
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,946
IT SAYS HERE YOU NEED TO GET
A SCROLL FROM AN ADVENTURER

520
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:36,048
IN YOUR CLASS TO
LEARN A MID‐CLASS.

521
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,317
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

522
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,286
YOU NEED A SCROLL THAT
USES RARE MATERIALS

523
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,821
IN ORDER TO LEARN A MASTER ART.

524
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,323
[NYANTA] THE SCROLLS
AND MATERIALS

525
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,925
ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN,
MYAH... HOWEVER...

526
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:49,095
IF YOU'RE DEAD SET ON GETTING
TO THE SECRET LEVEL OF YOUR ART,

527
00:21:49,196 --> 00:21:50,930
YOU'LL NEED TO DO
SPECIAL QUESTS.

528
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,399
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO PLAY CATCH UP.

529
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,667
IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANY
RAIDS YET, BABY.

530
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,269
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
RAIDS...

531
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,671
[RUDY]I'VE HEARD THAT ORAL ARTS
ARE SUPERIOR TO SECRET ARTS.

532
00:21:58,771 --> 00:21:59,839
IS THAT TRUE, CHIEF?

533
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:01,841
BUT THAT'S ONLY
A RUMOR, RIGHT?

534
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,843
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE
I'VE TALKED TO

535
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:05,345
THAT'VE ACTUALLY SEEN
ONE IN ACTION,

536
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,480
LET ALONE OBTAINED ONE
FOR THEMSELVES.

537
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,149
WELL BROTHER SHIROE
SAID THEY EXIST!

538
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,151
HUH? HE REALLY DID?

539
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:14,921
[TOYA] YEAH, HE SAID THEY'RE
TOTALLY LEGIT.

540
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:16,923
WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO
MASTER JUST ONE OF THEM?

541
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:18,491
MHMMH!

542
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:20,560
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] BACK WHEN
WE WERE JUST PLAYING THIS,

543
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,430
ORAL ARTS WEREN'T AVAILABLE
FOR US TO MASTER.

544
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,565
BUT NOW...

545
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:27,099
COME GET YOUR CRISPY, JUICY
CHRISTMAS CHICKEN RIGHT HERE!

546
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,101
JUST SIX DAYS TILL
CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!

547
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:33,172
[NERURESU] HOW WEAK AND
SHALLOW CAN YOU FOOLS BE!

548
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:37,777
WE'RE NOT A PACK OF LAPDOGS
BEGGING AT YOUR FEET!

549
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:40,580
IT'S TIME YOU
LEARNED YOUR PLACE...

550
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,718
ADVENTURERS, YOU HAVE
WORN OUT YOUR WELCOME!

551
00:24:16,343 --> 00:24:18,345
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] WHILE
SHIROE IS AWAY FROM AKIHABARA,

552
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,913
A WARRIOR TRIES TO
FIND HER OWN WAY.

553
00:24:21,013 --> 00:24:22,749
WHY WAS SHE LEFT BEHIND?

554
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:25,885
IS IT INEXPERIENCE? WEAKNESS?

555
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:29,889
MEANWHILE, RAYNESHIA HAS
GIVEN HERSELF TO RESIGNATION.

556
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,225
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THE
ADVENTURERS AND HER PEOPLE

557
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:34,261
WILL EVER AGREE.

558
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:37,430
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
