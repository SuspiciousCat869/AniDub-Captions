00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,806
LET ME SEE WHAT I
CAN FIND OUT HERE.

00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:14,341
I'LL CALL BACK SHORTLY.

UH?

7
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,480
[RIEZE]
I... I'M SORRY IT'S NOTHING.

8
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:24,652
I... I JUST KNOW THIS IS
A DESPERATE TIME FOR US.

00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:28,756

HIDE YOUR FEELINGS FROM US.

AH...

12
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,527
[HENRIETTA] LOOK, IF YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,

13
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:35,262
I DON'T MIND BEING HERE FOR

(STREET CHATTER)

16
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:14,428
[HENRIETTA] MISA'S SCYTHE
WENT OUT OF CONTROL?!

17
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,698
AND WHAT? IT MADE KRUSTY
VANISH INTO THIN AIR?

18
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,868
[RIEZE] NONE OF US CAN GET OUT
TELEPATHIC CALLS TO GO THROUGH.

19
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:23,971
AND WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH
THIS SERIAL KILLER MENACE.

20
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,641
IF THERE'S ONE THING WE NEED TO
KEEP UNDER CONTROL, IT'S THAT

21
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,876
WE DON'T WANT ANY INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS TO GET OUT.

22
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:32,212
YES, YOU MIGHT WANNA KEEP THIS
FROM THE ROUND TABLE.

23
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:33,814
THE TIMING WOULD NOT BE IDEAL.

WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO
MINAMI'S SPIES ARE.

00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,418
I'M WONDERING
IF WE SHOULD

26
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,454
INFORM PRINCESS
RAYNESHIA OR NOT.

27
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,689
DEFINITELY.

28
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,291
AND IF I KNOW KRUSTY
LIKE YOU DO, RIEZE,

29
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:48,462
HE'LL WALTZ RIGHT BACK TO US
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL.

30
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:50,097

[MIKAKAGE, VOICE CHAT]
HENRIETTA, THIS IS HORRIBLE!

33
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,537
WHAT'S GOING ON MIKAKAGE?

34
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,072
[MIKAKAGE]
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG

35
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,273
WITH THE FLAVOR TEXTS!

36
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:00,608
MPH....

37
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:08,983
[RIEZE] THINGS ARE LITERALLY
BECOMING THEIR DESCRIPTIONS?

38
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,318
[MIKAKAGE] YEAH. EVEN THOUGH
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE

39
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:12,687
JUST TO ADD AMBIANCE
AND INTRIGUE.

40
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,189
BUT NOW, ANYTHING WRITTEN
IN THE FLAVOR TEXT

41
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,857
IS BECOMING TRUE TO LIFE.

42
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,293
WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS
WE'LL NEED TO PAY MUCH CLOSER

43
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:22,129
ATTENTION TO ALL THE ITEM
DESCRIPTIONS FROM NOW ON.

44
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,733
IT COULD START CAUSING ALL KINDS
OF TROUBLE FOR US IF WE DON'T.

[RIEZE, THINKING]

THEIR OBJECTS UNFORESEEN POWER.

47
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:34,108
MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON MISA'S
WEAPON ATTACKED HER AND KRUSTY.

48
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,576
TO COMPLICATE MATTERS...

49
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:38,078
[RIEZE] THE KILLER IS IN
POSSESSION OF BYAKUMARU.

00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:40,781
WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF

SWORD WERE TO COME TO LIFE!
[BOTH] HUH?

52
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:45,319
THAT SWORD CAN DO AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE ON IT'S OWN.

53
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,422
NOW IT'S IN THE HANDS OF
SOMEONE IN ROYAL GUARD ARMOR.

54
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:49,924
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

55
00:03:50,024 --> 00:03:52,893
YOU GET BYAKUMARU AS
AN ITEM DROP IN A QUEST.

56
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,762
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S

THEY RELEASED IN
EXPANSION‐PACK TEN.

58
00:03:56,931 --> 00:03:59,900
YOU HAD TO BEAT THE DEAD
WARRIOR LUGRIUS TO GET IT.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,237
[RIEZE] IT WAS HIS SWORD, AND
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

DEAD WARRIOR LUGRIUS?

61
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,774
[HENRIETTA] SO WHAT
DOES THE FLAVOR TEXT

62
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:07,875
ON LUGRIUS HAVE TO SAY?

63
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:09,409
[RIEZE] IT TALKS
ABOUT THE LEGEND

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,812
OF LUGRIUS AND HOW HE
TURNED INTO A DEMON.

65
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:15,049
LUGRIUS ORIGINALLY FOUGHT AS
THE HERO OF THE ICY WALLS

66
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:18,218
ALONG SIDE THE IZUMO KNIGHTS
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.

67
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,587
IT'S SAID THAT HE FOUGHT

LONG AND HARD TO DEFEND
THE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS

OF THE SUSUKINO PEOPLE ALWAYS
KEEPING THE EVIL GIANTS AT BAY.

70
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:29,329
HE WAS TRULY THE EZZO

HOWEVER...

72
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,870
HOWEVER, THE MAID
OF ELM, SUTUYNAW,

73
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,005
SERVED LUGRIUS
A DEADLY POISON

74
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,541
IN AN UNFORESEEN
ACT OF BETRAYAL.

75
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:42,977
SHORTLY AFTER,
HE BECAME A MONSTER

FILLED WITH BITTERNESS
AND HATRED FOR EVERYONE.

PAINT A BRIGHT LIGHT ON THINGS.

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,662
[KOZARU] EVEN IF I TOLD
YOU HOW I GOT ONE,

153
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:24,031
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO DO THE SAME THING.

154
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:27,167
AH, EH... FOR EXAMPLE,

155
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,970
OUR GUILD MASTER LEARNED
HOW TO USE "HYPERION EYE."

156
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,338
WE CAN ALL LEARN WHAT IT DOES,

157
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:33,407
BUT NOT NECESSARILY MASTER IT.
[AKATSUKI] MM‐HM.

158
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:35,843
EVEN IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A
GOOD LOOK AT HIS TARGET,

159
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,912
HE STILL HAS THE ABILITY
TO DETERMINED WHAT

160
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,313
IT'S HIT POINTS AND STATUS ARE.

161
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,849
SO IF YOU WERE ABLE TO
MASTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

162
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,483
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
MANY HIT POINTS THE GUYS

163
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,753
BEHIND YOU HAVE AND FIGURE
OUT IF THEY'RE A THREAT.

164
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:46,887
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY SWEET!

165
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:48,155
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

166
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,690
[KOZARU]
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

167
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,491
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON WE
KNOW WHO CAN USE IT.

168
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:52,727
[AKATSUKI] UH...?

169
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,261
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
YOU CAN MASTER IT.

170
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,863
EVEN IF YOU LEARN
THE FIRST LEVEL.

171
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:57,264
(EXHALES)

172
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:00,835
I'LL TAKE WHAT I CAN GET!
PLEASE HELP ME!

173
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,302
(FIGHTING NOISES)
[BOTH] HYAH!

174
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:05,305
[AKATSUKI]
UH!

175
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:06,240
UH?!

176
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,007
(GROAN)

177
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,709
[YUTA] MM.
[KOZARU] HWAH.

178
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,144
(STRUGGLING)

179
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,212
[AKATSUKI]
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN!

180
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,447
UH?

181
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,551
MMM... (SIGH)

182
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:22,389
(LUNCH CHATTER)

183
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,627
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] ORAL ARTS.

184
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,996
PLEASE SHOW ME
SOME SORT OF CLUE.

185
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,565
[MIKAKAGE]
HEY, AKATSUKI!

186
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,465
HUH?

187
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,902
I MADE SOMETHING FOR
YOU... IT'S SPECIAL.

188
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,871
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S SPECIAL?

189
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,338
(BOTH GIGGLE)

190
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,175
[AKATSUKI]
HUH?

191
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:47,915
OH‐UH, UH... (PLEASANT SIGH)

192
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,686
[HENRIETTA] OUR KILLER IS A
MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GUARD.

193
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:55,422
HE IS A PERSON OF THE LAND IN
POSSESSION OF MOVABLE ARMOR...

194
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:58,659
AND HE IS ARMED WITH THE SWORD
OF THE COLD, BYAKUMARU.

195
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,062
IT'S USUAL ATTACK IS BLIZZARD
AND FREEZE AND IT CAN INFLICT

196
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,131
ITS DAMAGE AT GREAT
RANGE ON ITS TARGET.

197
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,067
I REMEMBER HIM. WASN'T
LUGRIUS A RAID BOSS?

198
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,237
YES. AND KNOWING THAT
SHOULD HELP US DEFEAT HIM.

199
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,673
ASSUMING THE FLAVOR TEXT
HOLDS TRUE FOR BOTH,

200
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,374
IT SHOULD ENLIGHTEN
US IN THREE WAYS.

201
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:16,744
FIRST, THE SWORD
WILL USE BLIZZARD

202
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:18,646
TO INFLICT THE FREEZE
STATUS EFFECT.

203
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,348
SECOND, IT WILL INCREASE ALL OF
THE STATS OF THE PERSON

204
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,618
WITH THE SWORD, MULTIPLIED
BY HIS OPPOSITION.

205
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:27,555
EVERY OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE
STATISTIC FOR BYAKUMARU'S MASTER

206
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:31,726
WILL GO UP FOR EVERY PLAYER THAT
OPPOSES HIM WITHIN FIFTY METERS.

207
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,493
AHHH... (SIGH)

208
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:37,097
MEANING THAT OVERWHELMING HIM
WITH NUMBERS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

209
00:10:37,197 --> 00:10:40,568
THAT'S WHERE OUR STRATEGY COMES
IN. IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO USE

210
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,403
A RAID PARTY IN THIS SITUATION,
BUT WITH A DIFFERENT TACTIC.

211
00:10:43,504 --> 00:10:47,074
WE STILL USE OUR TWENTY‐FOUR,
WITH THE USUAL SIX SPLIT IN TWO

212
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:50,110
OR THREE, BUT SCATTERED ACROSS
THE CITY LIKE A NET.

213
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,513
YOU WANT TO HOLD A FULL
RAID INSIDE THE CITY.

214
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,149
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
PRETTY AMAZING, RIEZE.

215
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:57,518
YOU CAN TELL SHE'S IN CHARGE OF
THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING

216
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,520
SQUADRON IN KRUSTY'S GUILD.

217
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,422
SHE'S SHOWING NO SIGNS OF
WILTING OR BACKING DOWN

218
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,324
IN THE FACE OF ALL
THE GRAND WARRIORS.

219
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,662
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE
SPREADING YOUR TEAM OUT TOO FAR.

220
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,229
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO LEAD THEM?

221
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,031
WE'LL USE THE TELEPATHIC NETWORK

222
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:13,167
TO KEEP OUR CHAT UP AND
RUNNING DURING THE BATTLE.

223
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:15,736
ONCE ONE OF THE GROUPS MAKES
CONTACT, WE'LL HAVE THEM

224
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,573
DEPLOYED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE
OTHERS CAN GET TO THEM QUICKLY.

225
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,908
[WOODSTOCK] SO I'M GUESSING
BYAKUMARU'S THIRD AFFECT ISN'T

226
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:23,744
HARD TO GUESS, AM I RIGHT?
[SOJIRO] HUH?

227
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:27,214
RIGHT, LIKE A LOT OF MAGIC
SWORDS WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT.

228
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,584
THERE SHOULD BE A BASIC BOOST
TO HIS HIT‐POINTS...

229
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:32,653
OF COURSE WE STILL NEED TO DEAL
WITH HIS OPPOSITION INCREASE.

230
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,855
[WOODSTOCK] I SWEAR, I DON'T
KNOW WHO CAME UP WITH THAT,

231
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,123
BUT I'VE ALWAYS HATED IT.

232
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,058
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO DEAL WITH IT?

233
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,260
WE NEED PERMISSION
FOR A CURFEW.

234
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,430
AND WE NEED IT FROM RIGHT NOW
UNTIL MIDNIGHT NEW YEAR'S DAY.

235
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:46,333
IT SHOULD COME FROM THE ROUND
TABLE TO ASK ALL THE PEOPLE OF

236
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,269
THE LAND TO STAY IN THEIR
HOMES FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.

237
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,472
WELL THAT'S CERTAINLY
A START I GUESS...

238
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,710
DO YOU REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
FACE SOMETHING SO POWERFUL?

239
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,211
WOODSTOCK HAS A POINT.

240
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,514
IF THE KILLER HAS A
GUARDSMAN'S MOVEABLE ARMOR,

241
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,883
THEN HE CAN TELEPORT ANYWHERE
WITHIN THE CITY AT ANY TIME!

242
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,485
IT WILL ALL BE A WASTE
IF HE GETS AWAY!

243
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:10,390
WE HAVE A SOLUTION. BUT WE NEED
THE PRINCESS TO MAKE IT WORK!

244
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,358
HUH?

245
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:17,231
(GASP)

246
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,441
[RAYNESHIA] SO YOU'RE TELLING
ME, YOU WANT ME TO CUT THE POWER

247
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:31,045
TO AKIHABARA'S
MAGIC CIRCLE, RIGHT?

248
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,180
(UNCERTAIN BREATH)

249
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,516
[KINJO] WE CAN DEPRIVE
THE ARMOR OF ITS POWER

250
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,985
BY SHUTTING OFF THE MAGIC
TO THE CITY'S CIRCLE.

251
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,687
OF COURSE, THIS WOULD ALSO

252
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,722
NEUTRALIZE THE CITY'S
OTHER MAGICAL DEFENSES.

253
00:12:41,822 --> 00:12:45,159
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STOPPING
MONSTERS FROM COMING IN.

254
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,063
WELL, IF YOU WERE TO TRY THIS?
COULDN'T YOU JUST RESTORE

255
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:50,665
THE CIRCLE RIGHT
AFTER HE'S ELIMINATED?

256
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,433
I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT THAT
SIMPLE, YOUR GRACE.

257
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,470
IT WOULD TAKE
DECADES TO RESTORE.

258
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:59,774
(EXHALE)

259
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,677
[RIEZE] I'M ALREADY AWARE
THIS PLAN HAS ITS RISKS.

260
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:07,414
LISTEN TO ME, RAYNESHIA. I KNOW
THIS CANNOT BE AN EASY DECISION.

261
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:10,217
BUT WITH YOUR BLESSING
WE DO HAVE A CHANCE.

262
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:13,521
NO! I KNOW IT WILL WORK!

263
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:16,156
SO ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS AS A
TASK OF MY OFFICIAL POSITION?

264
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,459
AS AN EMISSARY OF MY PEOPLE?

265
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,795
[HENRIETTA]
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

266
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,329
WE CAN'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY.

00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,564
(EXHALE)

268
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,400
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION,

NO MATTER WHICH CHOICE
YOU END UP MAKING.

270
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,137
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY!

271
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,172
NOTHING'LL CHANGE BETWEEN ANY OF
US NO MATTER WHAT.

272
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,675
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE DON'T
BE AFRAID OF THAT.

(EXHALE)

274
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,484
(SIGH)

275
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,654
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] IN THE
END, I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO

276
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:48,589
MAKE A DECISION RIGHT
THERE ON THE SPOT.

277
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,357
(GROANING)

278
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,026
I WANTED TO BE A FRIEND AND

279
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,361
GIVE THEM EVERYTHING
THEY ASKED OF ME.

280
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:58,899
BUT AS MY GRANDFATHER'S
AMBASSADOR...

281
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,136
WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

282
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,077
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] OKAY, TIME
IS RUNNING SHORT,

283
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:12,379
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

284
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,148
[NYANTA]
HOW'S THE TRAINING GOING, MYAH?

285
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:15,550
OH...

286
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,719
SO WHEN'S THE BIG RAID
PARTY IN THE CITY, BABY?

287
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,821
NEW YEAR'S EVE.

288
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,456
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

289
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,625
TAKING CARE OF YOUR RESOLUTION
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR?

290
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:25,693
THAT'S COOL.

291
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:28,028
NOT SURE IF I'LL EVEN
MASTER AN ORAL ART,

292
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,698
IT'S LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY
GRASPING AT AIR.

293
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:33,300
I KNOW IT'S LATE, BUT IS
THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO

294
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,570
TO MAYBE HELP YOU
OUT A LITTLE BIT?

295
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,105
[AKATSUKI] THANKS FOR ASKING,
CHIEF, BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.

296
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,608
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

297
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,409
I'M GETTING THE FEELING THAT
YOU'RE PUSHING YOURSELF

298
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,912
A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD, Y'KNOW.

299
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,647
[AKATSUKI]
OH...?

300
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,117
MY LORD, WHY DON'T YOU TRY
TAKING A BREAK FOR A WHILE?

301
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:54,955
I'M FINE, I NEED TO SQUEEZE IN
AS MUCH WORK AS I POSSIBLY CAN.

302
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:57,792
MAYBE, BUT DON'T OVERDO IT OKAY?

303
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,027
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME,

304
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:03,531
I'M WORKING HARD
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

305
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:05,733
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY MY
LORD PUSHES HIMSELF AS MUCH

306
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,535
AS HE DOES ALL THE TIME...

307
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:11,438
I MEAN I GUESS, HE'S TRYING TO
GET THE BEST OUT OF HIMSELF.

308
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,541
SO I WILL DO WITH
SAME THING FOR ME.

309
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,976
IF I WANT TO TAKE DOWN
AN ENEMY LIKE THIS,

310
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,145
I NEED TO TEST MY LIMITS.

311
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:21,616
IT'S ... IT'S JUST...
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

312
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,354
[NAZNA] COME ON YOU GUYS! KEEP
YOUR DISTANCE.

313
00:15:27,454 --> 00:15:29,557
NOW! SLIP IN BEHIND YOUR ENEMY!

314
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:31,225
YOU NEED TO BE IN
A CONSTANT STATE

315
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,927
OF EVALUATING YOUR OPPONENT.

316
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,763
KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO AND BE
AWARE OF WHAT YOU CANNOT DO,

317
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,533
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU BY
SURPRISE IN THE FIGHT.

I KNOW THAT I'M WEAK...

320
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,440
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I CAN ONLY LEARN

321
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,108
BY KNOWING WHAT
MY WEAKNESSES ARE.

[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I'VE LEARNED FROM DEFEAT,

324
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,648
AND FOUND A PURPOSE
IN MY LACK OF TALENT.

[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
BUT STILL,

327
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,819
I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING MY OWN...

328
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,756
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY
USING THIS, AKATSUKI?!

329
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,758
IT REALLY HELPS YOU
BUILD UP YOUR DEFENSES

330

HUH?! THANKS A
LOT, YOU GUYS.

00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:08,596
I BET YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE A FEW
STRAWBERRIES, WOULDN'T YA?

332

[AKATSUKI] UH...
[DOLCHE] WE GOT A BUTT‐LOAD FOR

A FEW LEFT OVER. MM‐MMM!

[AKATSUKI] UH... THANK YOU!
[KAWARA] EHEE!

335
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,404
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] I CAN LEARN
TEAMWORK

336
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:20,107
AND GET STRONG AT THE SAME TIME!

337

[NAZNA] Y'KNOW,
YOU SURE ARE TINY.

338
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:24,779
LEARN TO USE IT
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

339
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,980
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

340
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,748
THINK ABOUT HOW BIG HE IS.

341
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:29,349
IT'LL DRIVE HIM NUTS IF YOU
KEEP MOVING AROUND

342
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:31,151
AND HE CAN'T HIT YOU.

343
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:34,188
HE SHOULD HAVE A
TON OF BLIND SPOTS.

344
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,791
COME ON, THEN. GIVE IT A TRY.

ALSO USE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE.

THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE DEFEATED
HIM THAT NIGHT THEN...

WELL, TIME TO DIE...

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,190
THE CONVICTION OF TWENTY‐SIX
COMRADES DRIVES THE FIGHT.

00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,693
BUT FATE CAN BE A
FLICKERING FLAME.

471
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,795
JUST AS THE CITY
SINKS INTO DESPAIR,
