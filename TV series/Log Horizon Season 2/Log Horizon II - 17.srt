1
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:06,316
[ARUMI]
HUH?

2
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:07,617
[DAIMONJI]
UH...?

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,921
[ARUMI]
PRINCESS... NUREHA?

4
00:00:12,488 --> 00:00:13,656
[NUREHA]
UH...

5
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:15,992
[DAIMONJI]
MILADY... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

6
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:18,761
[ARUMI] DO YOU NEED YOUR
ESCORT TO GO WITH YOU?

7
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:22,532
SSSSHH!

8
00:00:28,638 --> 00:00:29,905
[DARIELLA]
UWAH!

9
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:34,444
(GIGGLING AND HUMMING)

10
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,904
[MAN B] THANK GOD YOU GUYS
SHOWED UP BACK THERE!

11
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:11,141
[MAN A] YEAH, WE THOUGHT WE
WERE GONNA GET SOME BOARS,

12
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:12,742
BUT THEY WERE OGRES INSTEAD!

13
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,310
[RUDY]
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, GENTLEMEN!

14
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,047
AFTER ALL, WE'RE ADVENTURERS.

15
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:20,350
RESCUING PEOPLE IN DANGER
IS WHAT WE DO!

16
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,685
I'M SO GLAD YOU
DIDN'T GET HURT.

17
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:23,886
[TOYA]
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

18
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:25,488
BUT IT WAS OUR FRIEND
IN THE WAGON

19
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:28,691
WHO TOTALLY SAVED US ALL..
WE HAVE HER TO THANK.

20
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:34,897
[ROE2] UGGGHHH... GOD, THE SUN,
SOMEBODY TURN IT OFF!

21
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,506
[MINORI] HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
MISS ROE2? THIS OUGHTA HELP.

22
00:02:43,606 --> 00:02:46,342
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU
GOTTA CLOSE THAT PLEASE?

23
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,311
I REALLY DON'T DO SUNLIGHT.

24
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,512
OH, YEAH. SURE.

25
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,614
THANK YOU,
I APPRECIATE IT.

26
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,083
OF COURSE.

27
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,986
(GULPING)

28
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,853
MM? WHAT'S WRONG?

29
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:00,090
[MINORI]
NOTHING! I WAS JUST WONDERING,

30
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,025
IS THAT A SPIRITUAL
CLOAK OF THE STARS?

31
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,160
YEAH! I'M SURPRISED
YOU KNEW.

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,463
WELL, MY TEACHER WEARS
ONE A LOT LIKE IT.

33
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,332
SO I GUESS HE'S
A MAGIC‐USER.

34
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,601
YEAH...
HE'S AN ENCHANTER.

35
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,037
THIS ROBE HAS SOME
PRETTY NICE STATS.

36
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:15,805
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
LOSE IT'S POWER,

37
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,740
AND IT'S GOOD FOR
GENERAL USE...

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,675
AND IT'S GREAT
FOR LONG TRIPS.

39
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,045
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE
MASTER SHIROE, YOU KNOW?

40
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:22,778
HUH?

41
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,847
OH...! WHAT I MEAN, UH,

42
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:27,750
HOW DO I PUT THIS?
YOU JUST KINDA REMIND ME OF HIM.

43
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,220
THE WAY YOU TALK AND THE WAY
YOU DRESS ARE A LOT ALIKE!

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,656
OHH? OKAY, THEN.
LEMME TRY'N DO YOU NOW.

45
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:36,026
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE
A SHRINE MAIDEN!

46
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,460
THAT'S RIGHT!

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,062
OH YEAH! YOU NEED HEALING!

48
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:41,364
PLEASE DON'T...
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

49
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:42,532
ARE YOU SURE?

50
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:46,402
REMEMBER? I SAID
I WAS A VAMPIRE? AH?

51
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,104
OH. OKAY, I SEE!

52
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:51,274
HEALING SPELLS CAN ACTUALLY
HURT VAMPIRES, CAN'T THEY?

53
00:03:51,374 --> 00:03:54,710
YEAH, AND I'M WAY
TOO WEAK ALREADY.

54
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,447
AND SO WHAT'RE YOU
DOING AFTER THIS?

55
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:58,481
HMMM...

56
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,815
UH...

57
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,652
[MINORI] MISS ROE2,
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

58
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,920
[ROE2]
HUH?

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,421
[MINORI]
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM...?

60
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,722
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

61
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:08,458
WELL WELL,
WHERE DID I COME FROM,

62
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,460
AND WHERE AM
I GOING, HUH?

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,727
THAT'S A LITTLE PERSONAL

64
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,063
COMING FROM SOMEONE
I JUST MET, YOU KNOW?

65
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:16,066
OH, SORRY!
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...! UH...

66
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,968
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

67
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:19,702
HMM?

68
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:22,305
[SERARA]
MINORI!

69
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,306
[MINORI]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

70
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:24,674
[ISUZU]
LOOK AT THIS...!

71
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,709
IT MUST'VE HAPPENED
SOMETIME DURING THE FIGHT.

72
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,511
[SERARA] IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE CROISSANT AND DANISH

73
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:30,080
GOT HURT OR ANYTHING.

74
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,514
[MINORI]
SO HOW COULD THAT...?

75
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:32,782
OH, RIGHT!

76
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:35,051
EVEN STUFF LIKE THAT
HAS DURABILITY STATS.

77
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,053
WE COULD CALL THEM
IF WE FIXED IT, RIGHT?

78
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,923
WE WOULD NEED WOOD‐CRAFTING
SKILLS TO MAKE IT WORK.

79
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,925
YEAH WELL, FOR NOW WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT PUSHING THE WAGON

80
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,460
ALL THE WAY TO THE NEXT TOWN.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,661
[SERARA]
WE'RE A LITTLE WORRIED

82
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,297
THAT MORE MONSTERS
MIGHT SHOW UP...

83
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:50,333
SO TOYA WENT AND TOLD THOSE
TWO PEOPLE OF THE LAND

84
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:51,701
THEY COULD COME WITH US.

85
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,303
[MINORI]
GOT IT.

86
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:58,041
[ISUZU] RUDY, WHY DON'T YOU
RIDE IN THE WAGON?

87
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:00,676
BARDS ARE STRONGER THAN
SORCERERS, YOU KNOW?

88
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:02,112
[RUDY]
OH, COME NOW...

89
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:04,480
WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD I BE
IF I LET YOU DO THIS?

90
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,049
(GIGGLE)

91
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:07,550
[MAN A]
IT WAS REALLY BAD.

92
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,452
WE WERE JUST HEADED
DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE,

93
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,754
THEN WE FOUND OURSELVES
UP TO OUR NECKS IN OGRES!

94
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,589
[MAN B] YEAH, WELL.
I BET IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

95
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,425
WITH THEIR HOME
GETTING DESTROYED.

96
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,827
HUH? COULD THAT BE IT?

97
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:19,262
[MAN A]
WELL, IF YOU KEEP GOING WEST,

98
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:21,664
YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP AT
THE BOXROOT MOUNTAINS.

99
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,833
THERE'S A GORGEOUS LAKE
OUT THERE.

100
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,168
NOBLES RULE THE AREA,

101
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,837
BUT YOU'VE STILL GOTTA
WATCH OUT FOR MONSTERS.

102
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:30,306
[TOYA] AREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO BE GOING THROUGH THERE?

103
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:31,707
[MINORI] YEAH...

104
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:32,976
[MAN B] THE MONSTERS AREN'T
THAT BIG OF A DEAL...

105
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,477
EVEN IF YOU SEE SOME,

106
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,246
THE ODYSSEY KNIGHTS'LL
TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

107
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:38,548
[MAN A] THAT'S RIGHT!
THOSE GUYS ARE THE BEST!

108
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,684
THEY'RE LIKE OUR HEROES! ALWAYS
RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR US.

109
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,619
[SERARA]
THEY RISK... THEIR LIVES?

110
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,388
YOU THINK MAYBE
THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE

111
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:46,957
KRUSTY OR ISAAC'S GUYS?

112
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,258
MAYBE.

113
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:50,726
[MINORI, THINKING] BUT IF
I TOOK AN EDUCATED GUESS...

114
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,762
[SHIROE] THERE'S A GROUP
WE CALL THE "HOMESICK"

115
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:54,230
OR THE "ODYSSEY,"

116
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,167
A LOOSE ASSOCIATION OF PLAYERS
TRYING TO GET BACK HOME.

117
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,135
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD,
THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY

118
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,703
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
TO GET BACK.

119
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:03,273
AND BY THAT,
I MEAN "EVERYTHING."

120
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:06,076
THEY MIGHT END UP CAUSING
MORE TROUBLE THAN THEY FIX...

121
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,077
MMMM!

122
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:09,946
[MINORI, THINKING]
SHIROE DEFINITELY DIDN'T

123
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:13,283
CALL THEM "KNIGHTS." MAYBE
THEY'RE NOT THE SAME GROUP.

124
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,785
[ROE2] I OWE YOU GUYS
BIG TIME FOR THIS!

125
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,853
I PROBABLY WOULD'VE TURNED
INTO A PILE OF ASHES

126
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,523
IF I KEPT ON WALKING OUT
IN THE OPEN LIKE THAT.

127
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,258
[MINORI]
YEA, BUT YOU HELPED US!

128
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:24,627
[TOYA]
WE TOTALLY HELPED EACH OTHER.

129
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,196
THANKS FOR WAITING, GUYS!

130
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,198
THESE ARE FROM THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND WE HELPED.

131
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,533
IT'S THEIR WAY OF
PAYING US BACK.

132
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,135
[TOYA]
SOY SAUCE FOR ME!

133
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,636
[RUDY] I'M USING
WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE!

134
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:35,138
[ISUZU] SAME HERE!

135
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,607
[SERARA] FOR A DISH LIKE THIS,
YA GOTTA HAVE MAYONNAISE.

136
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,009
OHH... KAY...

137
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,077
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE
BEST FLAVOR YOU CAN HAVE...!

138
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,279
GOURMET RANK B WORCESTERSHIRE.

139
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,214
OH‐KAY.

140
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:45,982
[SERARA]
OH, JUST THINK ABOUT IT!

141
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,584
I BET AN ADVENTURER CAME UP
WITH THIS BEEF BOWL DELIGHT!

142
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:49,819
OKAY...

143
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,787
[MINORI] ALRIGHT,
SO THIS IS SOY SAUCE

144
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,356
AND THAT'S WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE.

145
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,926
[ROE2]
OKAY... (TITTERING AND GIGGLING)

146
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:58,061
[ISUZU]
WHOA. YOU'RE DOING BOTH OF THEM?

147
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:01,797
DIPLOMACY, MAYBE? SHE'S TRYING
TO AVOID A SAUCING DEBATE.

148
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:02,999
I SEE.

149
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,201
THE GOOEY BLACK ONE

150
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:08,238
THE RUNNY BLACK ONE

151
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,240
[SERARA] THE MAYO IS YUMMY,
TOO, YOU KNOW!

152
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,142
YOU MIND IF I ASK
YOU SOMETHING,

153
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,877
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM
BEFORE YOU MET US?

154
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,147
I MADE MY WAY HERE
FROM OOU CITY...

155
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,149
I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD
ABOUT THREE MONTHS.

156
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:22,618
OOU CITY? THAT'S WHERE MASTER
SHIROE WENT ON HIS EXPEDITION.

157
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,354
[ROE2]
I ACTUALLY STARTED OUT

158
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:26,489
FROM A PLACE THAT WAS A
LITTLE FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT.

159
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:29,059
I USED CASTLING TO COVER
SUCH A LONG DISTANCE.

160
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,593
WHAT'S CASTLING...?

161
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,228
NEVER HEARD OF IT...

162
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,598
IT'S A SPELL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
CHANGE PLACES WITH A COMPANION.

163
00:07:35,698 --> 00:07:37,633
AND MISS ROE2 IS A MAGIC USER.

164
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,770
IN FACT, JUST THE OTHER DAY,
HONESTY STARTED USING CASTLING

165
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,773
TO RESEARCH HOW THEY COULD MAKE
FAIRY RINGS WORK FULL‐TIME.

166
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:46,742
[ISUZU] THAT'S AMAZING, MINORI!
YOU'VE REALLY GOT THIS DOWN!

167
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:50,680
[MINORI] HUH? I'M JUST REPEATING
WHAT MASTER SHIROE TOLD ME.

168
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,715
MISS ROE2, DOES THAT MEAN

169
00:07:52,815 --> 00:07:54,985
YOU SWITCHED PLACES
WITH YOUR COMPANION?

170
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,021
I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I'D
CALL HIM MY "COMPANION..."

171
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,223
I GUESS... HE'D BE MORE LIKE...

172
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,992
MORE LIKE MY OLDER BROTHER.

173
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:03,426
[ALL] BROTHER?

174
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,628
FOR THE TIME BEING,
I'M TRYING TO GET TO IKOMA.

175
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,130
UNTIL I DO, I'M STUCK WITH

176
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,632
THIS ANNOYING VAMPIRE
SUBCLASS OF MINE.

177
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,101
IS IT NOT LETTING YOU
TAKE QUESTS

178
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,003
THAT WOULD LET YOU
OVERWRITE IT?

179
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,605
THAT'S RIGHT...
GOTTA DO IT THE HARD WAY.

180
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,208
IF I COULD MEET THE JERK THAT
DECIDED ON THIS SUBCLASS,

181
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,944
I'D LOVE TO TAKE A BITE OUT
OF HIS THROAT OR SOMETHING!

182
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,113
"LOOKIE ME! I'M A VAMPIRE!"
[ISUZU] EHEH...

183
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,181
IT WAS KINDA USEFUL
ON THE MOON, I GUESS,

184
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,882
BUT WHATEVER MORON
CAME UP WITH IT

185
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,818
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D WIND UP HERE!

186
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,254
OMIGOD...
I HATE BEING A VAMPIRE!

187
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,556
(ROE2 ANGUISHED)
[MINORI] THE MOON...?

188
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:35,891
[TOYA]
IF I REMEMBER RIGHT,

189
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,627
ISN'T IKOMA NEAR MINAMI?

190
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,330
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW'RE WE
GONNA DO THE REST OF THIS?

191
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,597
[SERARA] UHHH...

192
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,833
[MINORI] FOR ONE THING WE
COULDN'T FIND ANYONE IN TOWN

193
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,568
WITH WOODCRAFTING SKILLS.

194
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:46,736
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME

195
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,404
FINISHING THIS TRIP
WITHOUT HORSES!

196
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:50,906
OH, COME ON.
LET'S JUST SUMMON SOME.

197
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,309
[ALL] HMM?!
[ROE2] HUH?

198
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,412
[TOYA] YOU CAN SUMMON HORSES,
BIG SIS ROE2?

199
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:57,647
HUH?!

200
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,916
BIG SIS ROE2?!

201
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:00,883
[ALL]
HUH?

202
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,485
[ROE2]
(LAUGHS) AHEM...

203
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:06,522
HEY KID... COULD YOU SAY
"BIG SIS" AGAIN FOR ME?

204
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:07,623
BIG SIS...

205
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,824
[ROE2]
(GASP) DO IT AGAIN!

206
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,060
BIG SIS...!

207
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,727
[ROE2]
(GASP) NOW YOU!

208
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:12,895
BIG SISTER ROE2.

209
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,730
AHHHH! (GIGGLE)
OH, I LOVE IT!

210
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,832
BIG SISTER!

211
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,701
I WISH... I REALLY WAS!

212
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:22,205
JUST TO HEAR YOU SAY IT, MAKES
ME THINK YOU'RE COUNTING ON ME.

213
00:09:22,305 --> 00:09:26,009
AHA! I WANNA BECOME THE BIG
SISTER FIGURE IN YOUR LIVES!

214
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,112
I SHALL BE LOOKED UP TO
JUST LIKE YOUR OLDER SISTER!

215
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:30,880
I'LL GUIDE AND PROTECT YOU!

216
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,183
AND I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO!

217
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,318
I SHALL SUMMON A HERD
OF AMAZING HORSES

218
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,753
THE LIKES OF WHICH
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN!

219
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,189
AND IN RETURN,

220
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:43,659
YOU SHALL PARADE ME AROUND
AS YOUR BIG SISTER! DEAL?

221
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,096
[ALL]
YEAH... THAT'S FINE...

222
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:50,466
HMPH! OH, GOD... TOO MUCH SUN!

223
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:53,236
(RELIEVED)

224
00:09:53,336 --> 00:09:54,770
[MINORI]
DOESN'T THIS FEEL GREAT?

225
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,173
[SERARA] I KNOW ADVENTURERS
DON'T NEED TO TAKE BATHS,

226
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,774
BUT THIS IS REALLY AWESOME.

227
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:02,312
OUR WOUNDS HEAL FAST, AND THE
SYSTEM HELPS TO KEEP US CLEAN...

228
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,814
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT BEATS A GOOD SOAK!

229
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,216
[BOTH]
AHHH! HMMM...

230
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:08,919
OH, YEAH! WE MIGHT HAVE
TROUBLE NAVIGATING

231
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,753
OUR WAY THROUGH THE
BOXROOT MOUNTAINS AHEAD.

232
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,523
RUDY SAID IT'S ROUGH.
[MINORI] IS THAT RIGHT?

233
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:16,526
YEAH. HE'S PRETTY WELL‐TRAVELED
AND KNOW THAT KINDA STUFF.

234
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,560
OH HE DOES, HUH?

235
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,694
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE.

236
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:20,163
HOW'RE THINGS WITH YOU TWO?

237
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,864
UH... WAIT WHAT?

238
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,499
HE'S JUST LIKE
MY LITTLE PUPPY DOG.

239
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,634
YEAH RIGHT!

240
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:27,537
IT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU GUYS
ARE A COUPLE, ISUZU!

241
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,872
OKAY, SINCE YOU DECIDED
TO BRING IT UP...

242
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,907
HOW'RE THINGS GOING
WITH YOU AND NYANTA?

243
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:33,643
HUH?!

244
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:36,746
AREN'T YOU LEARNING MORE ABOUT
COOKING AND CLEANING FROM HIM?

245
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:38,048
THAT'S MORE LIKE
MARRIAGE TRAINING

246
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:40,583
THAN ADVENTURER TRAINING!

247
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,751
[NYANTA] SERARA...

248
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,520
I MADE SURE I GOT YOU
A RING WORTH FORTY RAIDS!

249
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,523
I ALSO PREPARED THIS FEAST
FOR OUR RECEPTION!

250
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,026
COME AND BE MY BLUSHING
NEWLYWED BRIDE!

251
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,361
SQUEE!

252
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,029
NO, WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT!
WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT!

253
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,530
WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL!
[ISUZU] HEY!

254
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,566
[SERARA] I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT!

255
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,335
[ISUZU] OH, COME ON, SERARA!
YOU GOTTA LEARN...

256
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,971
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO ACT LIKE THAT

257
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,738
WHEN YOU BATHE
WITH CHIEF NYANTA!

258
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,274
[BOTH]
BATHE WITH THE CHIEF?!

259
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,110
I COULD GET
USED TO THIS, SERARA.

260
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,279
(SERARA SQUEALS)
[ISUZU] AND...?

261
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,613
[MINORI]
WHAT?

262
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:11,581
YOU KNOW I'VE GOTTA ASK,

263
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:13,483
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
YOU AND SHIROE?

264
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,319
[MINORI]
EH?! WELL... I, UH...

265
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,488
DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

266
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:21,524
BET THERE'S LOTS OF COMPETITION
FOR THE VILLAIN IN GLASSES.

267
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,960
[MINORI] HM? HUH?
[SERARA] OH!? TELL US MORE?!

268
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,530
[ISUZU] JUST THINK ABOUT IT!
HE STARTED UP THE ROUND TABLE!

269
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,532
[ISUZU] AND MARIELLE AND
HENRIETTA ARE GORGEOUS.

270
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,168
THEY'RE HANGING AROUND
HIM ALL THE TIME!

271
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:34,437
AND THEN, THERE'S THAT LEADER
OF THE OLD TEA PARTY, TOO.

272
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,406
OH! AND DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THE NINJA!

273
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,008
WHAT D'YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOOKING AT?

274
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:40,310
YOU WANT HIM YOU GOTTA
GO THROUGH ME!

275
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,945
(DISAPPOINTED BUBBLE BLOWING)

276
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:44,447
OH AND WHAT ABOUT ROE2, THE TWO
OF THEM MIGHT HAVE A THING, TOO.

277
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:46,016
[ROE2] HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

278
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,218
THAT'S "BIG SIS," RIGHT?

279
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,185
[ALL] WHA...? HUH?

280
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,354
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

281
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:55,325
YOU'D DO WELL TO KNOW YOUR BIG
SISTER HAS ADVANTAGES OVER YOU.

282
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,994
AND BY THAT... I MEAN THESE!

283
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,230
[ALL] EH... HUH?!

284
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,365
NO! DON'T EVEN WORRY YOU GUYS!

285
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,600
THOSE THINGS ARE
ONLY FOR SHOW, OKAY?!

286
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,439
[ROE2] HUH? I DIDN'T INTIMIDATE
MY LITTLE SISTERS, NOW, DID I?

287
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,673
(ANNOYED)

288
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:14,344
MARIELLE? YOU LOOK VERY
SERIOUS, ARE YOU OKAY?

289
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:16,546
YEAH, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

290
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:18,314
I THINK WE SHOULD DO
A SPRING FESTIVAL.

291
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:20,583
A CHERRY BLOSSOM FESTIVAL
WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

292
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:23,219
HUH... CHERRY...?
SURE THING...

293
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,055
YEAH, RIGHT...
WELL OKAY, THEN...

294
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,690
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
I SUPPOSE...

295
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,726
THAT MIGHT JUST BE THE THING TO
GET EVERYONE HAPPY AGAIN, RIGHT?

296
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,428
OH, MARIELLE...

297
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,497
I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF
THESE FESTIVALS OF OURS

298
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:36,099
ARE DOING WHAT I'D HOPED...

299
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,668
DO THEY REALLY BRING
PEOPLE TOGETHER?

300
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,644
[NYANTA] WELL, THE SITUATION
IS WHAT IT IS,

301
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:51,314
BUT IT HASN'T BECOME
A PROBLEM YET, MPH.

302
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,715
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
I GET IT,

303
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,717
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO
STAY ON TOP OF IT FOR NOW.

304
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,920
[NYANTA] OF COURSE I WILL,
MPH... HOWEVER...

305
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,755
MY GUESS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING
RIGHT NOW IS THE RESULT

306
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,558
OF AN UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT
WE HAVEN'T DISCOVERED YET.

307
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,961
ISN'T THAT THE WAY
IT USUALLY WORKS OUT?

308
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,230
(COMMUNICATOR PINGING)

309
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,766
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT] AKATSUKI?
HOW'RE THINGS OVER THERE?

310
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,569
[AKATSUKI] FINE.
AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING...

311
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,371
I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING UNUSUAL.

312
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:18,174
SO HOW'RE THINGS GOING
OVER THERE... OKAY?

313
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:19,742
[SHIROE]
SO FAR, SO GOOD...

314
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:22,112
THANKS, REPORT BACK
IF YOU SEE ANYTHING.

315
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,914
[AKATSUKI] WILL DO.
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

316
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:25,681
(ENDING PING)
(EXHALE)

317
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,218
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO,
MASTER SHIROE.

318
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,186
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR
YOU TO BE WORN OUT!

319
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:34,224
WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF THINGS
WE NEED TO GET DONE, OKAY?

320
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:35,891
[SHIROE]
YEAH, YEAH...

321
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,129
[EINS] THE ECONOMIC
DISPARITY IN AKIHABARA

322
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,697
IS CURRENTLY GROWING WORSE
AT AN ALARMING RATE.

323
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,900
PEOPLE WHO CAN HUNT OR DEVELOP
NEW SKILLS ARE GETTING RICHER,

324
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:47,103
WHILE PLAYERS WHO DIDN'T
HAVE THE RIGHT SKILLS

325
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,538
AT THE TIME OF THE APOCALYPSE

326
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,673
ARE FALTERING IN
MINIMUM WAGE JOBS!

327
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:53,944
COME ON... WHY ARE YOU
BRINGING THAT UP?!

328
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:57,847
SO? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING
ALL THIS ECONOMIC DISPARITY?

329
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:59,415
MASTERING ORAL ARTS,

330
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:02,452
AND CRAFTING CLASSES BEING ABLE
TO CREATE CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

331
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:05,321
WHAT...? HOW ARE ORAL ARTS
PART OF THE PROBLEM?

332
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,458
ANYONE CAN MASTER ONE
IF THEY REALLY TRY!

333
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,927
OKAY, MAYBE I WASN'T
BEING THAT CLEAR.

334
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,829
LARGER GUILDS HAVE BEEN
USING PEOPLE WITH ORAL ARTS

335
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,498
TO EXPAND BUSINESSES.

336
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:16,799
ONE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

337
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,768
SHOULD BE TO CURTAIL
THESE MONOPOLIES.

338
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:21,371
[MICHITAKA] OKAY, YOU'RE
STARTING TO CROSS THE LINE HERE.

339
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:22,838
[RODERICK] BASED ON SIZE ALONE,

340
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,474
WE COULD ALL ACCUSE YOUR
GUILD OF THE SAME THING, EINS.

341
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:26,076
[EINS] EXCUSE ME...

342
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,511
FIRST OF ALL, NO ONE IN MY GUILD
HAS MASTERED AN ORAL ART YET!

343
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:30,680
SECOND, WE SHOULD ALL
HAVE DECLARATIONS FROM

344
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,583
EVERY GUILD WHO ARE USING
PLAYERS WITH ORAL ARTS.

345
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,018
CRAFTING RECIPES SHOULD ALSO...

346
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,988
HEY, WAIT! COME ON, EINS!
YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT!

347
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,322
SERIOUSLY, EINS...

348
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,291
YOU CAN'T GO SIMPLY ASKING
PEOPLE TO GIVE AWAY

349
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,459
THEIR CRAFTING SECRETS
JUST LIKE THAT.

350
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,395
SOME OF THESE THINGS
TOOK A WHILE...

351
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,263
FROM RAMEN TO SOAP TO CANDLES...

352
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:48,798
ALL THOSE CRAFTSMEN
PUT IN A LOT OF TIME

353
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,666
TO MAKE ALL THOSE
THINGS WORK!

354
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,037
AND REMEMBER, DECLARING
ORAL ART USERS IS WORTHLESS,

355
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:57,573
ONLY THE PERSON WHO MASTERED IT
CAN USE IT. WHAT'S THE POINT?

356
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,742
[EINS] YOU THINK SO? ALL RIGHT.

357
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,478
WHAT ABOUT LEVYING A TAX ON
ADVENTURER BANK ACCOUNTS

358
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:05,381
IN EXCESS OF EIGHTY THOUSAND
GOLD PIECES?

359
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,250
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
CLOSE THE HUGE GAP

360
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,319
BETWEEN THE RICH AND
THE POOR THAT WAY...

361
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,288
SERIOUSLY, IT'S A PLACE
TO START, I THINK.

362
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,823
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND!

363
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:14,958
UH?!

364
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,260
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING
WHAT WE'VE SAID!

365
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,295
EVERYONE IN THIS CITY HAS
WORKED THEIR BUTTS OFF

366
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:20,630
TO GET WHERE THEY ARE...!

367
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,333
WE'VE FOUGHT FOR EVERY
LITTLE THING WE'VE GOT.

368
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,900
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET THAT.

369
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:26,869
[EINS] AND YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT OUR SOCIETY

370
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,139
IS FAVORING CERTAIN
PEOPLE OVER OTHERS.

371
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,541
THE RICH STAY RICH,
AND THE POOR STARVE.

372
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,509
[MARIELLE]
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE EVENTS...

373
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,079
WE'RE MAKING AN EFFORT TO
DO THINGS THAT INCLUDE EVERYONE

374
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,181
FROM ALL LEVELS
AND WALKS OF LIFE.

375
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:39,415
LISTEN TO YOURSELF,

376
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:41,751
YOU'RE PUSHING THE
DISENFRANCHISED AWAY!

377
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:42,818
WATCH IT!

378
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,653
NOW, WAIT...

379
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:45,055
WE DON'T HOLD THESE FESTIVALS

380
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:46,622
TO FLAUNT OUR OWN WEALTH!

381
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:48,724
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
TO BE... Y'KNOW...

382
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,727
SO YOU'RE SAYIN'...
WE GIVE THESE PEOPLE MONEY

383
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,497
AND THEN THEY'LL JUST
GO HAPPILY OFF TO WORK?

384
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,632
MAYBE SO, MAYBE NOT...

385
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,535
BUT WE CAN'T JUST LET THINGS
STAY LIKE THEY ARE.

386
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,137
[KARASHIN] YEAH, BUT IF
YOU'RE GONNA FORCE PEOPLE

387
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,438
TO GIVE UP THEIR NEW RECIPES,

388
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:04,207
CRAFTSMEN WON'T BE
MOTIVATED TO WORK AS HARD.

389
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:05,641
[MICHITAKA]
NO MATTER WHAT IT'S FOR,

390
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:07,310
ALL OF THOSE RECIPES TAKE
A LOT OF WORK TO CREATE!

391
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,779
[SHIROE, THINKING] WHAT I WOULD
GIVE TO HAVE KRUSTY HERE NOW...

392
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,447
[EINS]
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT HERE...

393
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:12,582
[MICHITAKA] YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

394
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,417
(CLAPPING)
[ALL] HM?

395
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,486
[SHIROE] I UNDERSTAND THE
GIST OF YOUR PROPOSAL...

396
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:17,853
AND IT MAKES SENSE

397
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:20,190
THAT WE NEED SOME KIND OF
POLICY TO HANDLE THIS.

398
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,557
HOWEVER, THE ROUND TABLE HAS

399
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:23,493
A LIMITED BUDGET
FOR THIS KIND OF THING.

400
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,495
UNLIKE MINAMI,

401
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,831
WE DON'T GET OPERATING FUNDS
FROM AN ARISTOCRACY.

402
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:31,601
[SHIROE]
WE ALL NEED TO TAKE A ROLE

403
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,603
IN DETERMINING HOW WE
CAN HANDLE THIS PROBLEM.

404
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,739
ALL RIGHT... BUT WE CAN'T WAIT
UNTIL IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.

405
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,142
[SHIROE] AND WE CAN'T BE
HASTY ABOUT THIS!

406
00:16:39,242 --> 00:16:40,510
LOOK A DECISION OF THIS SCALE

407
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,479
COULD WRECK OUR ECONOMY
IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT!

408
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,549
AND WE WOULD END UP
LEAVING THE CITY IN CHAOS!

409
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:48,584
[TOYA]
HMMM...

410
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:50,720
I KNOW WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN THE BOXROOT MOUNTAINS

411
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,523
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
BIG SIS ROE2'S HORSES...

412
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:55,591
BUT THIS ROAD IS A NIGHTMARE!

413
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:57,560
[MINORI]
YEAH, BACK IN THE REAL WORLD

414
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,995
THIS WOULD BE
RIGHT AROUND HAKONE.

415
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,897
[MINORI] IT WAS A VOLCANO,
SO THIS MAKES SENSE.

416
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,534
WHATEVER YOU SAY...
SO DO WE GO ON AHEAD?

417
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,970
THE VISIBILITY'S
REALLY LOUSY OUT THERE!

418
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,638
UH‐HUH.

419
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,706
[TOYA]
UGH. SULFUR...

420
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,976
[RUDY]
HANG ON. I SHALL ACCOMPANY YOU.

421
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,611
[ROE2] ALLOW ME TO SUMMON
SOME COMPANIONS FOR YOU!

422
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:19,115
I MEAN AFTER ALL,
I AM YOUR BIG SIS!

423
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,750
[TOYA]
COMPANIONS?

424
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,085
(SURPRISED)

425
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:23,286
[RUDY]
I DON'T THINK SO!

426
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,921
[TOYA]
NO THANKS! I'LL PASS.

427
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:27,457
[SERARA]
HANG ON... TAKE WOLFY WITH YOU!

428
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:28,791
[WOLFY]
YIP‐YIP‐YIP!

429
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,426
[TOYA] THANKS YOU GUYS!
THIS OUGHTA WORK.

430
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:32,963
(YIPS AND BARKS)
[RUDY] WELL I GUESS WE CAN GO!

431
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:37,800
[TOYA, NASALLY] GEEZ! I SWEAR
THIS SULFUR SMELL IS RANK!

432
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,769
[RUDY]
I WARNED YOU GUYS ABOUT THIS...

433
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,939
BOXROOT IS NOT AN EASY PASSAGE.

434
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,207
I HAVE TO SAY, THOUGH,

435
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,908
THE HAZE IS MUCH THICKER
THAN THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE.

436
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,644
[WOLFY] YIP‐YIP‐YIP!
[TOYA] HUH?

437
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,346
[RUDY] LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS.

438
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,915
[MAN B] WE'VE STILL GOT
A LOT LEFT HERE...

439
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:54,117
[RUDY] YOU NEED SOME HELP?
[ALL] HUH? HMM...

440
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:57,020
[MAN A] PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
ADVENTURERS! YOU NEED A SWORD?

441
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,821
GOT A BUNCH OF LEVELS,
TEN TO FIFTEEN!

442
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,390
SOME OF AKIHABARA'S FINEST!

443
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,858
[TOYA] NOT REALLY...! OUR LEVELS
ARE TOO HIGH FOR THAT STUFF!

444
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,494
[TOYA]
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

445
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,829
[MAN B] WELL, Y'SEE,
OUR CART BROKE DOWN.

446
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,531
[RUDY]
WELL IF THAT'S THE CASE,

447
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:10,066
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT WHAT
YOU CAN IN THE OTHER CART?

448
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,702
AND THEN JUST SHOVE THE BROKEN
CART OFF THE MOUNTAINSIDE!

449
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,670
[WOMAN A] WE CAN'T JUST
THROW OUR CARGO AWAY!

450
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,440
[MAN A] COME ON! BE A SPORT
AND BUY A COUPLE OFF OF US!

451
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,808
[MAN B] WE'D REALLY
APPRECIATE IT!

452
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,710
[WOMAN A] I BET BOTH OF
YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD!

453
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,612
NO, WE REALLY DON'T!

454
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:25,715
I'D LOVE TO BUY SOME,
BUT I CAN'T.

455
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,883
[DARIELLA] PLEASE DON'T THINK
POORLY OF THEM, DEAR TRAVELERS.

456
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,884
[BOTH] HUH?

457
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,653
THE AXLE GAVE WAY
AND WE'RE STUCK.

458
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:33,756
I'M AFRAID WE'VE BEEN TRAPPED
HERE FOR AN ENTIRE DAY.

459
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,525
PLEASE PARDON THEIR MANNERS.

460
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,461
HUH...? UH... WHO'RE YOU?

461
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,063
MY NAME IS DARIELLA...

462
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:43,633
I AM BUT A HUMBLE PERSON OF
THE LAND AND A CHRONICLER.

463
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,335
IT'S A PLEASURE, MILADY.

464
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,803
I AM RUNDELLHAUS KODE
AND THIS IS TOYA.

465
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,572
ADVENTURERS FROM AKIHABARA.

466
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,108
[DARIELLA]
REALLY! YOU'RE FROM AKIHABARA?

467
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,410
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD CARRY

468
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,013
SOME OF THE CRATES
TO THE NEXT SETTLEMENT?

469
00:18:57,113 --> 00:18:59,849
I KNOW HOW STRONG YOU
ADVENTURERS HAPPEN TO BE...

470
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,419
AND I'M SURE THE MERCHANTS
WOULD APPRECIATE IT!

471
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,820
[TOYA]
UH...

472
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,192
[MAN A]
OH, WOW!

473
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,461
YOU'RE AWFULLY STRONG
FOR SUCH A SCRAWNY LASS,

474
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:13,629
MISS... UH, IZUMAMI!

475
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:15,098
[ISUZU]
MY NAME'S ISUZU!

476
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:16,499
[MINORI]
EXCUSE ME,

477
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,368
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE ANYTHING IN THESE BOXES

478
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:19,802
BUT A BUNCH OF GOAT SLIMES!

479
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,637
[WOMAN A] YEAH, SOME WEIRD
OLD FART IN AKIHABARA

480
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:24,975
DUMPED THEM ON US.
NOT SURE WHAT THE DEAL WAS.

481
00:19:25,075 --> 00:19:26,876
(SNORING)

482
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,611
[TOYA] (LAUGH) THAT'S FUNNY!

483
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,813
THEY ATE ALL THE FOOD
AND PASSED RIGHT OUT!

484
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:32,448
[DARIELLA] WE SPENT THE NIGHT
ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD,

485
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,816
COMPLETELY EXPOSED.

486
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,651
IT'S NO WONDER
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

487
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:38,154
IT WAS A DIFFICULT NIGHT.
[TOYA] OH...

488
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:39,789
[MINORI] YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
TO ONE OF THE MERCHANTS

489
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,357
ARE YOU MISS DARIELLA?

490
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:42,825
OH NOTHING LIKE THAT...

491
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:44,394
THEY WERE JUST LETTING ME
RIDE WITH THEM

492
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,362
THE REST OF THE WAY TO MINAMI.

493
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,064
[TOYA]
OH, UH... HUH?

494
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:50,733
[ROE2] ISN'T MINAMI IN THE
SAME DIRECTION AS IKOMA?

495
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,667
[DARIELLA] IT IS.

496
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,069
[SERARA] HEY EVERYBODY!

497
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,371
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TEA
HERE READY IN A MINUTE!

498
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,672
WE'VE GOT PASTRIES!

499
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:59,242
[ROE2] MMMM! I LOVE YOU.
(SERARA GIGGLING)

500
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,511
[SERARA] THESE COOKIES
WERE MADE BY NONE OTHER

501
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:02,979
THAN OUR OWN CHIEF NYANTA!

502
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,547
[ALL] OHHH!
[RUDY] YOU'RE GONNA LOVE 'EM!

503
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:05,515
[MINORI]
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

504
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:06,649
[ISUZU]
THEY'RE GREAT!

505
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:08,218
[DARIELLA]
IT'S SWEET. I LIKE IT!

506
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:09,685
(TOYA MUNCHING)

507
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:12,588
(MUNCH) SO WHERE IS
IT YOU'RE ALL GOING?

508
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,890
[MINORI] WE'RE HEADED TO
THE REDSTONE MOUNTAINS.

509
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,292
I'M HEADED TO IKOMA, NOW...

510
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:18,728
BUT I PLAN ON STICKING
WITH THEM TILL I GET THERE.

511
00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,796
THEY'D NEED ME TO PROTECT THEM!

512
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:23,466
[DARIELLA] OH REALLY...?
I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE...

513
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,835
YOU ALL DO LOOK KIND OF YOUNG.

514
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,404
[RUDY] ONCE WE GET OVER THE
PASS WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

515
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,006
(SNOOZING)
[MINORI] YEAH...

516
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,009
BUT MASTER SHIROE SAID WE COULD
END UP RUNNING INTO WYVERNS

517
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,410
IN THE MOUNTAINS AROUND HERE.

518
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,079
HUH?

519
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,581
[ISUZU] AREN'T WYVERNS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN AERIAL‐TYPE MONSTER?

520
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:41,817
[SERARA] MAYBE THEY FOUND SOME
NEW PLACES THEY COULD CALL HOME.

521
00:20:41,918 --> 00:20:43,619
[MINORI] THE GROUNDLING
MONSTERS ARE DOING THAT...

522
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,488
SO I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.

523
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,457
[DARIELLA]

524

(OMINOUS ECHOING)

525
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,594
[ISUZU] WHAT WAS THAT?
[SERARA] IT SORTA SOUNDS LIKE

526
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,629
CHURCH BELLS AT A FUNERAL.

527
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:55,665
[MINORI]
THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY!

528
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:03,139
[SERARA]
ARE THEY A RAID PARTY...?

529
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:05,741
[MINORI]
LET'S SEE... JUST A SEC...

530
00:21:05,841 --> 00:21:07,610
THEY'RE WITH PLANT HWYADEN!

531
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,745
[ISUZU]
FROM MINAMI?!

532
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,214
[TOYA]
THAT GUY'S A LEVEL 90.

533
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:13,549
[SERARA] EVERYBODY ELSE
IN THE PARTY IS, TOO!

534
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,884
[ISUZU]
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THEY'RE

535
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:16,719
A GROUP OF PLAYER KILLERS.

536
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:17,853
[DARIELLA] IT'S POSSIBLE...

537
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:20,423
THEY MIGHT BE
THE ODYSSEY KNIGHTS.

538
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:23,793
[TOYA] AS IN THE GUYS WHO
PROTECT NPCS? THOSE KNIGHTS?

539
00:21:23,893 --> 00:21:25,161
[MINORI]
MM‐HM.

540
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:26,696
[ROE2] WHAT'S THAT THING
THEY'RE CARRYING?

541
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:28,231
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

542
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:31,001
[DARIELLA] IT'S THE
PORTABLE SHRINE OF BOREAS.

543
00:21:31,101 --> 00:21:32,768
[ROE2]
A PORTABLE SHRINE?!

544
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:36,172
[DARIELLA] I LEARNED ABOUT
THIS DURING MY TRAVELS.

545
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,141
THE ODYSSEY KNIGHTS TAKE
THE SHRINE WITH THEM

546
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:41,677
ON THEIR JOURNEYS
ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.

547
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,846
IT HAS THE POWER TO
REVIVE ANY ADVENTURER

548
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:46,382
AS LONG AS THEY'RE
CLOSE ENOUGH TO IT.

549
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,951
INSTANT RESURRECTION.

550
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:50,954
NO TIME DELAY OTHER THAN WAITING
FOR YOUR MANA TO REASSEMBLE.

551
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:53,123
IT'S LIKE HAVING
YOUR OWN CATHEDRAL.

552
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:55,258
DO YOU THINK MAYBE THE
ADVENTURERS IN MINAMI

553
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:56,692
CREATED THAT DEVICE?

554
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,996
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM?
THEY SEEM SO LIFELESS...

555
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:02,498
[RUDY] IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A FUNERAL MARCH.

556
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,134
[DARIELLA]
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS...

557
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:06,970
BUT INSTANT REBIRTH
CARRIES A PRICE WITH IT...

558
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,541
IT SUPPOSEDLY UPSETS THE VOICE
OF THE MIND IN ADVENTURERS.

559
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:13,609
UPSETS THE VOICE OF THE MIND?

560
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,345
[DARIELLA]
I SUPPOSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT

561
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:18,714
WOULD BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO
ADVENTURERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES.

562
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:20,483
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

563
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:22,085
UH...!

564
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:29,559
