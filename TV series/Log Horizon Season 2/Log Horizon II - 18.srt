1
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:06,716
[LOREILE] PRINCESS NUREHA!
PRINCESS NUREHA!

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:09,185
(VOICE CHAT PING) IT'S ME,
LONDARK... HAS SHE RETURNED?

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:12,989
[LONDARK] NO, NOT YET. YOU ARE
AWARE HOW IMPULSIVE SHE CAN BE.

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,758
[LOREILE] IS MIZPHA EVEN GOING
TO TRY LOOKING FOR HER?

5
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:18,594
[LONDARK] OH YES, GENERAL MIZPHA
HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

6
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:20,363
SAYS THEY ARE CURRENTLY
IN THE PROCESS

7
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:22,432
OF CARRYING OUT
OPERATION: RED NIGHT.

8
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,567
[LONDARK] FURTHERMORE,
IF PRINCESS NUREHA WANTS

9
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,569
TO GO OFF ON ONE OF
HER EXCURSIONS...

10
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:28,504
IT IS NOT OUR PLACE
TO QUESTION HER.

11
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:30,773
[LOREILE] WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO
BE SARCASM, LONDARK?

12
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:33,109
HER MAJESTY PRESIDES
OVER PLANT HWAYDEN

13
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,744
AS OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF!

14
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,046
(GRUNT)

15
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,684
[LOREILE] PRINCESS NUREHA... YOU
SHOULD'VE LET ME COME WITH YOU

16
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,519
AS IS MY DUTY AS YOUR ESCORT IF

17
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,821
YOU WANTED TO FIND
YOUR WAY BACK HOME!

18
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,761
[LOREILE, THINKING]
WEST IT IS!

19
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:30,593
(LAUGHTER)

20
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,930
[MINORI] UH? IT'S THEM AGAIN.
[ALL] HM?

21
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,099
[RUDY] YEAH. WONDER
WHAT THEY'RE UP TO...

22
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,800
[DARIELLA] AROUND HERE,
IT'S NOT ALL THAT UNUSUAL

23
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,535
TO SEE THE ODYSSEY KNIGHTS.

24
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,004
[SERARA] THAT'S KINDA STRANGE.

25
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:44,407
PEOPLE OF THE LAND THINK OF
THEM AS A GROUP OF HEROES.

26
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:46,709
[DARIELLA] WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL
THE TIME THEY SPEND RISKING

27
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,811
THEIR LIFE TO SAVE
TOWNS AND VILLAGES.

28
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:51,514
[SERARA] MAYBE. BUT THEY
LOOK A LITTLE SCARY,

29
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,016
LIKE THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT.

30
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:54,650
BUT THEY'RE ALSO KINDA
COOL, YOU KNOW?

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,186
[ISUZU] HUH? YOU THINK SO?

32
00:02:56,286 --> 00:02:58,554
I GUESS THEY LOOK LIKE
DEPENDABLE FIGHTERS, ANYWAY.

33
00:02:58,654 --> 00:02:59,822
[TOYA] I DON'T LIKE IT...

34
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:02,092
SOMETHING ABOUT THEM
RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY.

35
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:06,262
[MINORI] I FEEL THE SAME,
AND I'M NOT SURE WHY...

36
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:15,271
[ALL] THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!

37
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:17,907
AH!(MUNCH)

38
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,543
[SERARA] HOW'S THE FOOD
THIS TIME, YOU GUYS?

39
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,946
I REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING ALL THAT MUCH...

40
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,515
[ISUZU] MAYBE, BUT IT TURNED
OUT FANTASTIC THIS TIME!

41
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:26,983
[TOYA] YEAH, I REALLY LIKE THIS.

42
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,219
[MINORI] YOU KEEP GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER AT IT!

43
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,654
[RUDY] AND JUST LOOK
AT THE CLEAR NIGHT SKY!

44
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,756
THIS REALLY IS A
DELIGHTFUL DINNER!

45
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,459
[DARIELLA] ALL OF YOU CERTAINLY
ARE CLOSE, AREN'T YOU?

46
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,727
[MINORI] WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE!

47
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,429
GOOD FRIENDS, REALLY.

48
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,232
[DARIELLA] IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

49
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:45,969
WHAT IS IT THAT LEADS YOU
TO THE REDSTONE MOUNTAINS?

50
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:48,138
[TOYA] WE'RE HUNTING WYVERNS!

51
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:51,807
MAGIC BAGS ARE MADE
OF THEIR HIDES.

52
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,676
[DARIELLA]
OH REALLY, HOW EXCITING.

53
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,178
[ISUZU] AFTER ALL THE MILES
WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN,

54
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,513
SHOULDN'T WE BE PRETTY
CLOSE TO SAPHIR VILLAGE?

55
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,949
[DARIELLA]
YOU'RE NOT TOO FAR NOW.

56
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,917
[ISUZU] OH, YEAH? HAVE
YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE?

57
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:04,287
IT'S ON MY WAY BACK HOME...
SO I'VE GONE THROUGH IT.

58
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,757
I'D LOVE TO PUT ON A
CONCERT WHEN WE GET THERE!

59
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:10,760
[DARIELLA] A CONCERT, YOU SAY?
[ROE2] WHAT'S A "CONCERT"?

60
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,863
I DON'T THINK MISS ROE2 HAS
HEARD YOU PLAY YOUR LUTE YET.

61
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:16,933
[MINORI] ISUZU'S A BARD OR WHAT
YOU'D CALL A WANDERING MINSTREL.

62
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,936
[ISUZU] EHEHEHEH! I'M NOT
REALLY ALL THAT GOOD YET.

63
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,771
[MINORI] WHEREVER WE
STOP ALONG THE WAY,

64
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:23,773
SHE PUTS ON A SHOW AND
SINGS A FEW SONGS.

65
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,575
OH! SO YOU'RE A MUSICIAN?

66
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,144
[ISUZU]
EHEHEHE!

67
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,113
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, PEOPLE
ACTUALLY STARTED CALLING ME

68
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:33,016
"ROCK STAR" BACK AT THE
AKIHABARA BROOMHALL!

69
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,884
[ROE2] AND WHAT'S A "ROCK STAR"?

70
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:37,453
[SERARA] WELL IT'S LIKE...
SHE'S A POP IDOL...

71
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:39,222
AND THAT SHE'S REALLY COOL!

72
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,456
THAT'S KINDA VAGUE!

73
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,992
DEFINITELY VAGUE!

74
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,693
[ROE2] WELL I'D LOVE TO HEAR
YOU PLAY US A SONG,

75
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:44,894
IF THAT'D BE ALRIGHT.

76
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,762
[DARIELLA]
YES, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY!

77
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:48,231
[BOTH]
EHEH!

78
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,166
[TOYA]
OH!

79
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,201
OKAY, THAT'S IT!

80
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,336
SAPHIR VILLAGE IS
GETTING A CONCERT!

81
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,238
(CHEERING)

82
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,310
(ISUZU SINGING, MUSIC PLAYING)

83
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:38,915
(WHOOPS, HOLLERS, CHEERS)

84
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:43,819
HEY! THANKS, EVERYONE!
YOU WANNA HEAR ONE MORE?

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,156
[ISUZU]
ALL RIGHT THEN! YOU GOT IT!

86
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,858
(SURGE OF CHEERS)

87
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,629
[ISUZU] AHHH... THAT WAS GREAT,

88
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,765
BUT I COULD NOT
EAT ANOTHER BITE!

89
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:57,533
[RUDY] MISS ISUZU, MAYBE
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU

90
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,535
TO SAY 'NO' EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE!

91
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,538
[ISUZU] YEAH, BUT IT WOULD'VE
BEEN RUDE! BUT YOU'RE SWEET.

92
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,141
[ISUZU] SERIOUSLY! I'D
NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE WHERE

93
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,943
PEOPLE JUST KEPT ON
BUYING ME FOOD LIKE THAT!

94
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,412
[RUDY] I MUST SAY THE CONCERT
TONIGHT WAS TRULY AMAZING.

95
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:11,647
THERE YOU GO AGAIN...
EXAGGERATING.

96
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,683
HMPH! DON'T EVEN...
YOU'RE GREAT!

97
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,751
(ISUZU HUMMING "YOUR SONG")

98
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:18,288
[RUDY] HM? YOUR
OVERWHELMING LOVE OF MUSIC

99
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:19,755
KNOWS NO BOUNDS DOES IT?

100
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,057
[ISUZU] I GUESS IT DOESN'T.

101
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:22,358
[RUDY] SO WHY DO YOU
KEEP SECOND GUESSING

102
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,827
THE WAY YOU PERFORM?
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

103
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,930
HUH? WELL... IT'S
NOT LIKE I'M TRYING

104
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,099
TO BE HUMBLE OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

105
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,333
[RUDY]
HUH?

106
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,602
[ISUZU] I DON'T KNOW IF
I SAID THIS BEFORE...

107
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:33,869
BUT BACK WHERE I COME FROM,

108
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,538
MY DAD IS ACTUALLY A
PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN.

109
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,473
AH WELL THEN, I GUESS IT MAKES
SENSE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

110
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:41,044
AN INHERENT LOVE AND PENCHANT
FOR ALL THINGS MUSIC.

111
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,879
COME ON! DON'T BLOW IT
OUT OF PROPORTION.

112
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,481
ITS JUST THAT MY DAD...

113
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:50,586
HE'S REALLY GOOD, THE EPITOME OF
A ROCKER! HE'S TOTALLY COOL...

114
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:52,322
HIS HAIR IS LONG, AND HE'S
ALWAYS GOT

115
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:56,226
HIS LEATHER JACKET ON!
AND I SWEAR, HE'S SO SKINNY!

116
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:59,295
AND HE'D LOVE TO TELL STORIES
ABOUT WHAT HE DID ON THE ROAD!

117
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,997
SOUNDED LIKE A BLAST.

118
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,934
IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC,
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

119
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,735
HE'D JUST CRAM ALL
HIS INSTRUMENTS

120
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,803
IN AN OLD BEAT‐UP
MINIVAN AND HIT THE ROAD!

121
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:09,772
FIRST STOP, TOKYO...
LAST STOP ANYWHERE

122
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:11,641
AND HIT EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN!

123
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:13,343
[RUDY] KINDA SOUNDS
LIKE US, DOESN'T IT?

124
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:14,877
[ISUZU] YEAH, EXACTLY!

125
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,280
[RUDY] HEH...! IT SOUNDS
LIKE HE'S A WONDERFUL FATHER.

126
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,916
[ISUZU] I KNOW, RIGHT?!
HE CAN BE KINDA NUTTY...

127
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,919
BUT MY DAD HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A HERO TO ME.

128
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,555
HE AND HIS BAND EVEN
MANAGED TO GET A CONTRACT!

129
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,623
HUH? WHAT'S A CONTRACT FOR?

130
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:30,526
[ISUZU] WELL, IT'S WHEN A RECORD
LABEL PICKS YOU UP, AND...

131
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:31,327
[RUDY] HUH?

132
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:32,996
UH... WELL, I...

133
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,431
WHAT I MEAN IS...
IS HE GOT FAMOUS!

134
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,767
THEY PROMOTED HIS BAND...
AND THEN YOU COULD

135
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,802
HEAR HIS MUSIC
PLAYING EVERYWHERE!

136
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,371
NOW, THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING!

137
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:44,140
THE THING IS... BACK IN
THE WORLD I COME FROM...

138
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,343
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO CAN PLAY LIKE MY DAD.

139
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:49,913
RECORD COMPANIES GIVE ABOUT
A HUNDRED BANDS IN JAPAN,

140
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,948
THE CHANCE TO MAKE
A DEBUT LIKE THAT,

141
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:54,750
BUT THEY DON'T LAST.
[RUDY] UH...

142
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,586
OUT OF THAT HUNDRED,
ONLY A HANDFUL

143
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,121
MAKE IT AFTER
THEY GET PUSHED.

144
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,290
MY DAD DIDN'T MAKE IT.

145
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,326
HE WAS GOOD, BUT PEOPLE
DIDN'T BUY HIS ALBUMS.

146
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,361
DID HE DECIDE TO GIVE
UP ON MUSIC THEN?

147
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:07,697
NO WAY... HE LOVED
MUSIC TOO MUCH

148
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,665
TO JUST GIVE UP
ON IT LIKE THAT.

149
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,067
SO HE PICKED HIMSELF BACK UP AND

150
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,736
KEPT ON WORKING AS A SESSION
PLAYER. [RUDY] UHH...

151
00:08:13,836 --> 00:08:16,906
[ISUZU] OH... KAY... THAT'S
A LITTLE TOUGHER TO EXPLAIN.

152
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:19,475
OK! HOW ABOUT THIS!
HE'S A PRO'S‐PRO!

153
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,478
HE PLAYS SESSIONS IN STUDIO,
BUT WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S BANDS.

154
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:25,982
OKAY, SO TELL ME MISS ISUZU...
ISN'T THIS YOUR DEBUT?

155
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:28,618
[ISUZU] OF COURSE NOT!
RECORD COMPANIES DECIDE THAT!

156
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,021
BUT EVERYONE'S BEEN
ENJOYING WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

157
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,488
THAT'S A PRO TO ME!

158
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:35,358
YEAH, WELL IT TAKES MORE
THAN THAT. [RUDY] HUH?

159
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:40,997
[ISUZU] I'M..., I'M SORRY.

160
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,299
I JUST KNOW A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW THAT WORLD WORKS.

161
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,868
DON'T GET ME WRONG! I DO
LOVE PLAYING THE LUTE!

162
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:46,937
DEFINITELY...!

163
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:48,671
AND SINGING, TOO...

164
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,107
IT'S JUST THAT I, UH..

165
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,477
I DON'T... REALLY HAVE
THE TALENT. [RUDY] UH...

166
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,347
[ISUZU] MY DAD ALWAYS TOLD ME,
YOU GOTTA KEEP KICKING YOURSELF

167
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,749
EVERYDAY TO MAKE IT
IN THIS BUSINESS.

168
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,218
THAT A LOT OF
MUSICIANS ARE TALENTED.

169
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,820
AND THAT YOU NEED TO PUT IN THE
HOURS, UNTIL YOUR FINGERS BLEED,

170
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,291
AND STILL THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH
FOR SOME PEOPLE! [RUDY] I SEE...

171
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:11,361
[ISUZU] JUST UNDERSTAND...
I'M DOING THIS FOR FUN, OKAY?

172
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,629
[ISUZU] AND I'M GLAD EVERYONE
LIKES THE SHOWS WE'RE DOING!

173
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:17,233
[RUDY] NOT JUST THEM, I LOVE
YOUR SONGS, TOO, ISUZU.

174
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,570
[ISUZU] HUH... THAT'S
REALLY NICE OF YOU...

175
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,773
BUT I'M NEVER GONNA END UP
PLAYING AS WELL AS MY FATHER.

176
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,575
YOU'RE TOO HARD ON YOURSELF...

177
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,110
JUST WATCH THE CROWD...

178
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,679
THEY ABSOLUTELY ADORE YOU
WHEN YOU GET UP AND PLAY.

179
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,348
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
THEIR 42 GODDESS.

180
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,051
HUH? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

181
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:37,087
RUDY, SOMETIMES I
DON'T THINK WE'RE EVEN

182
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,055
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING.

183
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:42,092
[RUDY] OH UH...?
YOU DON'T KNOW 42?

184
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,060
[ISUZU] UH...?

185
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,328
[SERARA] YEAH... TOTALLY...

186
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,862
[MINORI] IT HAPPENED TO YOU TOO?

187
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,198
[SERARA] I WENT TO THE
STORE THE OTHER DAY

188
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:49,499
TO GET SOME BOILED
FISH PASTE AND

189
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,701
THEY WOUND UP GIVING
ME BOILED FLOUR PASTE.

190
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:55,038
IT'S CRAZY RIGHT. THE APP
MUST BE MESSED UP OR SOMETHING.

191
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,572
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

192
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,074
THE AUTOMATIC TRANSLATE APP.

193
00:09:58,174 --> 00:09:59,909
I LOVE THAT THING! HOW
ELSE WOULD WE TALK TO

194
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,145
ALL THE PEOPLE
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

195
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,980
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND HAVE

196
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,548
A SEPARATE LANGUAGE
ALL THEIR OWN.

197
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,750
WE'VE BEEN USING IT TO TALK TO
THEM SINCE THE BEGINNING...

198
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,653
IT'S BEEN GREAT... IN FACT, I
ALMOST FORGET IT WAS EVEN THERE,

199
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,056
'CAUSE IT'S ONLY NOW THAT
IT'S BEEN ACTING WEIRD.

200
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,490
[SERARA] OKAY THEN,
WHAT'S CHANGED?

201
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,993
I DON'T KNOW, IT COULD
BE ANYTHING, I GUESS...

202
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:18,194
I JUST KNOW THIS
SORT OF THING IS

203
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:19,862
HAPPENING MORE
AND MORE LATELY.

204
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,131
[SERARA] THAT COULD BE IT.

205
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,265
MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

206
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,900
EACH OTHER THESE DAYS?

207
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:29,205
FOR EXAMPLE, SEVEN
COLORS UP IN THE SKY?

208
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,740
RAINBOW?

209
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,042
[RUDY] EXACTLY,

210
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:34,010
BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
DON'T SAY RAINBOW.

211
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,046
THEY SAY "SEVEN
COLORS IN THE SKY."

212
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:38,248
SO WHAT DOES "42" MEAN?

213
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:39,916
IT MEANS, "MUSIC."

214
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,884
HUH? WHY'S THAT?

215
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:44,454
BECAUSE TO THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND...

216
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,957
THERE ARE ONLY
42 COMPOSITIONS.

217
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:49,025
[ISUZU] HUH?

218
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,294
OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS
HAD 42 SONGS

219
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:54,297
BESTOWED UPON THEM BY
THE GODS OF THIS WORLD.

220
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,600
... AND WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE
ABILITY TO MAKE OUR OWN MUSIC.

221
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,437
WAIT A MINUTE... IS THAT
LEFTOVER PART OF THE GAME?

222
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,008
[RUDY] IT'S JUST THE ONLY MUSIC
WE WERE GIVEN, AND NO MORE.

223
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:07,177
IT'S BEEN THAT WAY ALL MY LIFE.

224
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:09,079
I JUST THOUGHT THE WHOLE
THING WAS NATURAL,

225
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,181
AND NEVER REALLY QUESTIONED IT.

226
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:12,983
[ISUZU, THINKING] NO WAY...

227
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,750
IS HE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?!

228
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,354
[RUDY] AND THAT IS WHY... WE
ALL LOVE IT WHEN YOU PLAY...

229
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:21,624
WE CAN'T HELP OURSELVES
BECAUSE IT'S ALL NEW TO US.

230
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,926
(GASP)

231
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,928
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK
OUT IN THE CROWD,

232
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,163
AND YOU'LL SEE IT IN THEIR EYES.

233
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:29,399
I'VE SEEN SOME OF 'EM CRYING
WHEN THEY HEARD YOUR SONGS.

234
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:33,103
THEY WERE OVERCOME WITH JOY
WITH EVERY SINGLE NOTE.

235
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:35,371
AND THEY'VE NEVER
EXPERIENCED THAT BEFORE.

236
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:36,806
THEY JUST WANTED TO GET UP AND
DANCE

237
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,474
OR JUST HOLD ONTO
THEIR LOVED ONES

238
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:41,811
AND JUST DRINK THEMSELVES SILLY
WITH THE FEELING YOU GAVE THEM!

239
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:45,515
SERIOUSLY. WE'VE NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING LIKE WHAT YOU DO.

240
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,451
AND FOR SHARING THEM WITH US,
YOU'RE LIKE OUR OWN HERO,

241
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,821
MISS ISUZU. I MEAN IT.
YOU'RE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

242
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,489
[ISUZU]
AH...?

243
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,725
[ISUZU] OH RUDY...

244
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:58,929
SO DO YOU THINK ISUZU'S GONNA
BE A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN?

245
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,765
[MINORI] I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE
SEEMS TO LIKE IT. IT'S AWESOME.

246
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:03,899
SHE'S GOT A TALENT.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,201
SOMETHING SHE'S GOOD AT.

248
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:06,702
IT MUST BE GREAT TO HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

249
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:09,639
I TOTALLY GET WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING ABOUT HER ABILITIES!

250
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,175
IN FACT, I'M KINDA JEALOUS OF
HOW SHE CAN SING AND PLAY

251
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,545
THE LUTE LIKE THAT!
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

252
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,047
[MINORI] SO, DO YOU
HAVE SOMETHING THAT

253
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,581
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO LEARN HOW TO DO?

254
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,083
[SERARA] YOU MEAN
LIKE IF WE EVER END UP

255
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:21,918
GOING BACK TO
THE REAL WORLD?

256
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:23,419
[MINORI] WELL NOT JUST THAT...

257
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,821
EVEN IF WE CAN'T GET BACK...
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANNA DO?

258
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:28,058
[SERARA] NOW THAT'S KINDA
TOUGH. I DON'T KNOW.

259
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,193
I'M JUST ENJOYING MY LIFE.

260
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,494
[MINORI] 'KAY THEN.

261
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,895
[SERARA] BUT I BET YOU'VE PUT

262
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,164
SOME GOOD THOUGHT INTO IT.

263
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:37,000
[MINORI] YEAH, WELL...
I SURE HAVE...

264
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,502
I HAVE A DREAM I'M SHOOTING FOR.

265
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:42,038
[MINORI, THINKING] I WANT TO
BE JUST LIKE MASTER SHIROE,

266
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,607
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

267
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,944
HE IS WHO HE IS. WE DON'T
NEED ANOTHER SHIROE.

268
00:12:48,044 --> 00:12:51,381
AND LET'S FACE IT, NO ONE CAN
DO WHAT HE DOES AS WELL AS HIM.

269
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,250
[MINORI] OH JUST FORGET IT!
I'M MAKING MY BRAIN HURT!

270
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,785
[SERARA] DO YOU
NEED AN ASPIRIN?!

271
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:57,753
[RUDY] HERE'S SOMETHING
ELSE TO THINK ABOUT:

272
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,655
DID YOU NOTICE ALL THE
YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE LAND

273
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,091
COMING TO THE CITY?

274
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,993
[ISUZU] NUH‐UH.
[RUDY] EVERY ONE OF THEM

275
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:05,128
WAS COMING TO AKIHABARA
WITH A DREAM.

276
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,297
THERE ARE BLACKSMITHS AND
TAILORS AND CHEFS

277
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:10,233
AND WARRIORS AMONG
THEM... EVEN MUSICIANS.

278
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,468
EVEN IF THEY JUST SPEND A FEW
MONTHS IN AKIHABARA

279
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,370
THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO PICK UP SKILLS

280
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,706
THAT THEY PROBABLY WON'T BE
ABLE TO LEARN ANYWHERE ELSE.

281
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:19,842
THEY CAN BECOME
ANYTHING, MISS ISUZU!

282
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,511
YOU MEAN LIKE YOU DID?

283
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:25,481
YEAH, LIKE ME, AND JUST
LOOK WHERE I AM NOW.

284
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:28,919
I'M AN ADVENTURER, MISS ISUZU.
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T DO IT

285
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:31,955
ON MY OWN, I HAD SOME SUPPORT
FROM MY FRIENDS BACK HOME.

286
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,090
[ISUZU] UH...

287
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,092
[RUDY]
I STILL GO SEE THEM SOMETIMES.

288
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,394
IT'S WHY I DISAPPEAR
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

289
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,630
AKIHABARA ISN'T AN
EASY PLACE TO LIVE...

290
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,632
'SPECIALLY IF YOU'RE ONE OF US.

291
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:45,001
SO WE TRY TO HELP
EACH OTHER OUT.

292
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,136
BUT JUST LOOK AT
ALL THE COOL STUFF

293
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:47,770
THAT GOES ON THERE EVERY DAY!

294
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,807
PARADES, FESTIVALS, FOOD, MAGES
DOING TRICKS FOR ENTERTAINMENT?!

295
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,643
I MEAN, THIS PLACE IS GREAT!

296
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:57,413
IT'S LIKE THE IMPOSSIBLE
IS NOW POSSIBLE.

297
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,182
SO THIS MUSIC YOU'VE
STARTED PLAYING...?

298
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:01,551
IT'S A RADIANT MIRACLE.

299
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:03,719
[ISUZU]
YOU'VE ALL BEEN PLANNING THINGS

300
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:08,258
ABOUT HOW YOU WANT YOUR LIVES
TO BE, AND WHO YOU WANT TO BE.

301
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:11,294
AND THEN, I WALK INTO
YOUR LIVES... [RUDY] HMM?

302
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,263
I START SINGING ABOUT
LIFE AND LOVE AND

303
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,465
ALL THE THINGS I
WANNA DO FOR ME...

304
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:17,400
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING!

305
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,602
[RUDY] I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE
YOU CRY...! WHAT I MEANT...

306
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:21,171
[ISUZU]
PLEASE... DON'T...

307
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:22,472
[RUDY]
HMM...

308
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:25,375
COULD YOU... GIMME
A LITTLE SPACE?

309
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,481
[RUDY]
AS YOU WISH.

310
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:36,786
(SOBS)

311
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,561
(ISUZU CRYING)

312
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:47,830
OH, GOD...

313
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,399
(INHALE, SNIFF)

314
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:54,004
I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T KNOW...

315
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,347
(YAWNS)

316
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,483
[TOYA] CHOSHI WAS ON A
RIVER, TOO, WASN'T IT?

317
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,420
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T GET IT...
BUILDING BY THE RIVER...

318
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,455
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT
BEING NEAR THE WATER HELPS

319
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,257
WITH FARMING AND DAILY LIFE.

320
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,626
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
FOR RAIN OR ANYTHING.

321
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:19,729
THAT AND IT LOOK LIKE THERE'S A
BUNCH OF PLANT LIFE AROUND HERE.

322
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,531
I GUESS THAT STUFF
YOU LEARN IN SCHOOL

323
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:23,766
CAN COME IN HANDY AFTER ALL...

324
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,502
UH...?

325
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:30,440
(EXHALE)

326
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,378
(STARTLED)

327
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,846
[DARIELLA]
UH...!

328
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:39,382
WELL HELLO THERE, GOOD
MORNING TO YOU, TOYA.

329
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,451
[TOYA]
UH, MORNING!

330
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:43,786
[DARIELLA] WHY DON'T YOU
COME AND JOIN ME DOWN HERE?

331
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:45,688
[TOYA]
UH, SURE.

332
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,892
MISS DARIELLA, HAVE YOU
BEEN OUT HERE ALL MORNING?

333
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:52,963
[DARIELLA] YES, I USUALLY
DON'T NEED THAT MUCH SLEEP.

334
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:54,797
[TOYA] YOU SAID YOU WERE
FROM MINAMI, RIGHT?

335
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:57,300
[DARIELLA] YES, BUT I'M
USUALLY ON THE ROAD.

336
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,402
AS A CHRONICLER, I SEEK OUT
LITTLE ADVENTURES

337
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,637
AND WRITE DOWN WHAT
I SEE ALONG THE WAY.

338
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:03,873
HOWEVER, WHEN I'M NOT OUT
ON THE ROAD,

339
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:07,243
I HAVE A LITTLE COTTAGE
IN IKOMA. [TOYA] IKOMA?

340
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:09,212
[DARIELLA] IT'S VERY SECLUDED,
TUCKED AWAY

341
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,814
JUST OUTSIDE OF KYOTO.
[TOYA] OKAY.

342
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,316
[DARIELLA] BUT
HONESTLY, THINGS CAN GET

343
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,551
SOMEWHAT LONELY ON
THE MOUNTAINSIDE.

344
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,922
PEOPLE AREN'T EXACTLY CLAMBERING
UP THERE TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

345
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:23,026
SO ON OCCASION, I GET THE URGE
TO GET OUT AND VISIT THE CITY.

346
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,627
[TOYA]
ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS?

347
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,129
[DARIELLA]
I'M USED TO IT BY NOW.

348
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:28,664
MONSTERS AREN'T MUCH OF A
PROBLEM ANYMORE EVER SINCE

349
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:30,433
PLANT HWAYDEN TOOK OVER THE
DUTIES

350
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,035
OF PROVIDING SECURITY
FOR THE AREA.

351
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:35,138
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
NAME SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

352
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:52,155
(BREATH, EXHALE)

353
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,657
THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS IN
ADMINISTERING THINGS IN MINAMI

354
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,360
HAVE LEFT THE CITY
WEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL!

355
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,595
BUT IT SOUNDS AS IF
YOU DON'T CARE FOR IT.

356
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,797
I DON'T KNOW ALL
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT.

357
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,267
WELL IF YOU EVER GET THE
CHANCE TO SEE MINAMI MAYBE

358
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:06,302
YOU CAN COME VISIT
ME AT MY HOUSE.

359
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,703
UH...!

360
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:08,838
AND IF YOU HAVE THE TIME,

361
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,640
WE CAN GO SEE THE CITY TOGETHER.

362
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,475
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT, TOYA?

363
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,210
(ANNOYED)

364
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,545
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG TOYA,

365
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:17,147
WHY WON'T YOU LOOK AT ME?

366
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,681
I'M FINE, OKAY?

367
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,450
YOU CAN TRY AND DENY
IT IF YOU WANT...

368
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,152
YOU DON'T HATE ME DO YOU?

369
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,020
I'M JUST NOT SURE ABOUT YOU.

370
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,455
(GIGGLE)

371
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,124
CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS SMILING.

372
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,060
[DARIELLA]
YES. I SUPPOSE SO.

373
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:32,728
WHAT ABOUT IT?

374
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:35,598
[TOYA] YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FAKE IT, YOU KNOW?

375
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,600
[DARIELLA]
UH...?

376
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,602
THERE YOU GO, I LIKE THAT.

377
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:42,238
ALRIGHT THEN,
IF YOU THINK SO...

378
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,176
WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO ME?

379
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,449
[SHIROE]
AHHH!

380
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:54,684
[AKATSUKI]
UH... RUDE.

381
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,851
YOU JUST SURPRISED
ME THAT'S ALL,

382
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:57,353
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE ANYWAY?

383
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,754
[AKATSUKI]
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

384
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:01,691
OKAY, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME
TO USE THE DOOR. SO?

385
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,194
I'VE COMPLETED MY RECONNAISSANCE
MISSION WITHOUT INCIDENT.

386
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,997
AND I GATHERED ALL THE
INTELLIGENCE I COULD FIND.

387
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,231
[SHIROE] IT'S NOT
LIKE I SENT YOU ON

388
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:09,699
A SUPER‐SECRET SPY MISSION.

389
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,634
MAY I GIVE YOU MY REPORT NOW.

390
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,469
YES, IF YOU PLEASE.

391
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:16,672
REGARDING MAIHAMA AND
THE COWEN FAMILY.

392
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,442
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY PRETTY
FAMILIAR WITH PRINCESS RAYNESHIA

393
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,678
AND HER GRANDFATHER,
LORD SERJIAD?

394
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:25,681
FOR THE RECORD, LORD SERJIAD
HAS TAKEN A RECENT INTEREST

395
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,084
IN SEAWEED SALADS AND
BEAN‐FILLED PANCAKES.

396
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:31,287
HE ALSO DRINKS A WARM GLASS
OF MILK BEFORE BED, MILORD.

397
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,723
[SHIROE] UH... NOW
WAIT A SECOND...!

398
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:35,258
HOW DID YOU GET THIS
INFORMATION?!

399
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,760
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
BREAK INTO THE PALACE! UH...!

400
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,895
[AKATUSKI] RELAX...
RAYNESHIA TOLD ME!

401
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:40,896
[SHIROE] UH...?

402
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:41,764
GIRL POWER...

403
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:42,832
IT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED.

404
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:46,736
[SHIROE]
UHHH... "GIRL POWER"?

405
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:49,572
IT'S NOT FAIR TO DOUBT MY
FRIENDSHIPS WITH OTHER WOMEN!

406
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,374
[SHIROE]
I DON'T THINK I EVER DID.

407
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:54,177
I CAN BE EXTREMELY
FEMININE WHEN NEEDED.

408
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,345
YOU DON'T SAY?

409
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:57,113
I EVEN ATTENDED THE GIRL'S CLUB!

410
00:18:57,213 --> 00:18:58,314
UH, OKAY...

411
00:18:58,414 --> 00:18:59,515
SO? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

412
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,417
I THINK IT'S REALLY
NICE AKATSUKI,

413
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,087
IT'S A GOOD THING YOU FINALLY
MADE SOME MORE FRIENDS.

414
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:05,922
[AKATSUKI] I KNOW, RIGHT?
KIND OF ENJOYING IT!

415
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,790
ANYWAY, THE REST OF THE REPORT.

416
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,660
RESPECTED AS A WISE RULER,
LORD SERJIAD IS THE CURRENT

417
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,862
HEAD OF THE COWEN FAMILY
AND 60 YEARS OLD.

418
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,864
HIS WIFE HAS ALREADY PASSED.

419
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,067
IN HIS YOUNGER YEARS, HE LED
THE ROYAL KNIGHTS

420
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,768
AGAINST MONSTERS... UH?

421
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,636
MY LORD, WHAT'S WRONG?
[SHIROE] HUH?

422
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:23,273
YOUR FACE IS ALL WRINKLED
WITH WORRY AGAIN.

423
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:25,641
UH, YEAH...
SOMETHING'S UP.

424
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:29,012
[SHIROE] THE CHIEF ISN'T
MAKING HIS USUAL REPORTS.

425
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:31,447
[AKATSUKI] NO?
THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM.

426
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,284
[SHIROE] THAT AND I CAN'T USE
THE LINK TO REACH HIM, NOW.

427
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:36,186
HAS THIS BEEN A PROBLEM BEFORE?

428
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,521
[SHIROE]
NOT REALLY, NO.

429
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:39,822
IF I CAN'T REACH HIM,

430
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:41,791
HOW CAN MINORI AND
THE OTHERS REACH ME?

431
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,126
(VOICE CHAT INTERFERENCE)

432
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:45,095
[SERARA] I CAN'T GET
ANYONE TO PICK UP.

433
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:48,431
[MINORI] ME TOO. I WAS HOPING TO
GET SOME ADVICE ABOUT SOMETHING.

434
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:49,565
[MINORI, THINKING]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

435
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,301
HOW LONG HAS THE
LINK BEEN DOWN?!

436
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,268
UH...?

437
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,038
[MINORI] MAYBE THAT'S IT.
[SERARA] UH...?

438
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,440
[DARIELLA] INSTANT REBIRTH
CARRIES A PRICE WITH IT...

439
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,776
IT SUPPOSEDLY UPSETS THE VOICE
OF THE MIND IN ADVENTURERS.

440
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:03,379
MAYBE IT'S DISRUPTING
THE TELEPATHIC LINK...

441
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,448
HUH? WHAT?

442
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:07,017
THAT PORTABLE
SHRINE OF THEIRS...

443
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,352
MAYBE IT'S CAUSING
THE BLACKOUT.

444
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,955
[SERARA] PERHAPS WE COULD JUST
ASK THE KNIGHTS ABOUT IT?

445
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:13,756
I KNOW THEY'RE SPOOKY‐LOOKING,

446
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:16,626
BUT THEY CAN'T BE BAD IF THEY'RE
PROTECTING VILLAGES, RIGHT?

447
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,795
[MINORI]
MM‐HM! ULP...

448
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:21,797
‐IF ONLY NYANTA WERE HERE.
‐IF ONLY SHIROE WERE HERE.

449
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:23,533
[BOTH] HUH?!
(GIGGLING)

450
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,035
NOW THAT'S FUNNY...

451
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,769
DIDN'T WE ALL SAY WE
WERE GONNA DO THIS WITHOUT

452
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:28,238
THE OTHERS HELPING US?

453
00:20:28,338 --> 00:20:29,905
YEAH, WE DID.

454
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,108
[DARIELLA] I'M NOT
SURE WHAT I'VE DONE,

455
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,444
BUT IT HURTS TO THINK
THAT YOU HATE ME.

456
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,146
[TOYA] I SAID I DIDN'T.

457
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:37,680
THEN WHAT IS IT ABOUT

458
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,882
MY SMILING THAT UPSETS YOU?

459
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:43,186
[TOYA] (BREATH) HUH?

460
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:44,854
[TOYA] OH!

461
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,060
OH MY GOD...!

462
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:55,098
[MINORI] SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK MISS ROE2'S GONNA DO?

463
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:57,000
[SERARA] THAT'S A GOOD
QUESTION, MINORI!

464
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,269
[MINORI] WELL, I MEAN SHE
SAID SHE'S GOING TO IKOMA...

465
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,772
[SERARA] WITH MISS
DARIELLA, MAYBE? HMMM...

466
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:05,208
[MINORI] ISUZU STILL HASN'T
COME OUT OF HER ROOM TODAY.

467
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:07,610
[SERARA] MAYBE SHE'S
ALREADY MISSING ROE2.

468
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,479
[MINORI] SHE SAID SHE WAS
GONNA KEEP TRAVELLING

469
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,081
WITH US AS LONG AS SHE COULD.

470
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:13,917
WHICH MEANS SHE'LL BE NEEDING
TO SPLIT OFF FROM US HERE.

471
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,651
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIND A CARPENTER

472
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,587
TO GET OUR SUMMONING
FLUTE WORKING AGAIN.

473
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:19,489
(SERARA GASPS)
[MINORI] WHAT IS IT, SERARA?

474
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,125
[SERARA] I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS
OF THAT CLOUD. [MINORI] HUH?

475
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,894
[SERARA] I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT
IS, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT...

476
00:21:25,761 --> 00:21:27,230
(WOLF‐CHAN GROWLING)

477
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,799
[MINORI] I DON'T
THINK THAT'S A CLOUD.

478
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:33,736
(GROWL/ROAR)

479
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:35,871
A WYVERN SWARM!
HUH?!

480
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:38,408
[MINORI] AND THEY'RE
COMING RIGHT AT US!

481
00:21:38,508 --> 00:21:41,177
[TOYA] THIS IS BAD, REALLY BAD.

482
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,015
MISS DARIELLA, YOU NEED
TO TAKE COVER SOMEWHERE!

483
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:49,119
WHAT ABOUT YOU? HOW'RE YOU
GOING TO STAY SAFE, TOYA?!

484
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:52,122
[TOYA, THINKING] WHAT IN
THE WORLD IS GOING ON?!

485
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,891
(ROAR)

486
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,407
[MINORI]
HOW POWERFUL ARE THEY?

487
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,609
FORTY‐TWO! FORTY‐SIX!

488
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,578
FORTY‐THREE! FIFTY!

489
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:16,846
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO, MINORI?

490
00:22:16,947 --> 00:22:18,814
FIVE OF US AND
HUNDREDS OF THEM...?

491
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:21,384
I DON'T THINK WE'D
STAND A CHANCE!

492
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:22,585
[TOYA]
MINORI! SERARA!

493
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:23,886
[MINORI]
TOYA!

494
00:22:23,987 --> 00:22:25,355
[TOYA] WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF THE VILLAGE!

495
00:22:25,455 --> 00:22:27,257
WE CAN'T PUT ALL THESE PEOPLE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS!

496
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,025
[MINORI] YES, BUT...
[TOYA] COME ON!

497
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,494
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

498
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:32,462
GOT IT!

499
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:34,097
(PANTING)

500
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,233
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER] THE
ODYSSEY KNIGHTS STAND BEFORE A

501
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,369
FLIGHT OF WYVERNS
ATTACKING THE VILLAGE.

502
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:22,005
THEY'RE NOT FIGHTING
TO PROTECT ANYONE;

503
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:25,275
THEY'RE FIGHTING TO EXPERIENCE
DEATH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

504
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,012
TOYA, MINORI, AND SERARA STAND
BY AND WATCH IN HORROR,

505
00:24:29,112 --> 00:24:31,982
WHILE RUDY AND ISUZU
ENGAGE THE ONSLAUGHT!

506
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:34,450
THIS TIME, THEY WILL
BATTLE THE GODS!

507
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,553
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES
ARE ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
