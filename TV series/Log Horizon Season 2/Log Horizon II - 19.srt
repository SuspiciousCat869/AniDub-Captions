1
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,384
[NYANTA] I DOUBT THAT EVEN
SHIROE‐ECHHI COULD HAVE

2
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:11,522
ANTICIPATED A
PREDICAMENT LIKE THIS.

3
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,426
(SIGH) LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
NEED TO INTERVENE

4
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:18,962
A LITTLE MORE DIRECTLY
THAN I'D PLANNED.

5
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,566
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

6
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,465
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO DO IT RIGHT.

7
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,300
IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A TOWN OR VILLAGE,

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,637
YOU NEED TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO GET THE CONFLICT

9
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:08,939
AWAY FROM THE POPULATION AS
QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.

10
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,643
I UNDERSTAND... IF YOU'RE
FIGHTING FOR YOUR HOME...

11
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:15,111
YOU WANT A HOME STANDING ONCE
THE FIGHTING'S DONE.

12
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,314
LEAVING THE STRUCTURES IN
TACT ONLY MAKES SENSE.

13
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,385
[SERARA] RIGHT! WE CAN'T
USE OUR TELEPATHIC LINK,

14
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,421
SO LEAVE YOUR PARTY‐CHAT ON
WHILE YOU GUYS GET OVER HERE!

15
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,157
ROGER THAT.

16
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,538
[MINORI, THINKING] NONE OF
THEM ARE ALL THAT POWERFUL.

17
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,874
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S SO MANY!

18
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:46,042
WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING!

19
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,478
[SERARA] YOU THINK MISS
ROE2'S OKAY BACK THERE?

20
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,414
[TOYA] C'MON! BIG SIS
CAN HANDLE HERSELF!

21
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,316
[MAN A] OVER HERE! HURRY!
(SERARA GASPS)

22
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,518
[MOTHER B] DON'T LET
GO OF MY HAND.

23
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,752
[MAN A] C'MON! KEEP MOVING!

24
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,487
[TOYA] SERARA? YOU OKAY?

25
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:59,656
IT'S AMAZING THEY'RE
ACTING SO CALM.

26
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:01,257
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

27
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:03,293
[ALL] UH...?

28
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:05,929
[MINORI] IT'S THE
ODYSSEY KNIGHTS!

29
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,131
[TOYA] SO THEY'RE
GONNA FIGHT 'EM!

30
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,235
[SERARA] THAT'S WHY THE
VILLAGERS AREN'T PANICKING!

31
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:13,970
[TOYA] WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING.

32
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,373
HEH. (HEAVY BREATHS)

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,281

(KNOCK, KNOCK)

35
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,554
[RUDY] MISS ISUZU?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

36
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:33,056
UH... (EXHALE)

37
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:42,232
MM?

38
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,203
UH... MM.

39
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,375
[ISUZU] DO YOU THINK... THAT
THE BATTLE'S ALREADY STARTED?

40
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,044
(EXHALES)

41
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:56,613
MISS ISUZU!

42
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:58,014
UH? WHAT NOW?

43
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,883
(GIGGLE)

44
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:03,687
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR!
RUNDELLHAUS KODE IS HERE!

45
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,022
SAPHIR VILLAGE
AND MISS ISUZU!

46
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,692
ALONG WITH MISS
MINORI AND SERARA!

47
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,762
YOU ARE SAFE WITH MY
PASSIONATE ORB OF LAVA

48
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,897
PROTECTING YOU FROM HARM! GAH!

49
00:04:13,997 --> 00:04:16,733
RUDY! THIS IS NO TIME
TO GOOF AROUND! HM?

50
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,569
EHEHEHE...

51
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:19,803
PREPARE YOURSELF...

00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:21,371
WHAT NOW, RUDY?

53
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:25,441
UH...? HUH?

54
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,977
WHA‐ WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

55
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:29,212
[RUDY] THIS IS CALLED
THE "BIRD SHOE."

56
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,382
YOU WON'T REALLY FLY LIKE
A BIRD OR ANYTHING PER SE.

57
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:35,952
BUT YOU WILL NOTICE BEING ABLE
TO GET AROUND MUCH MORE QUICKLY!

58
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,921
SO IT'S A SPELL TO
MAKE ME RUN FASTER?

59
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,755
EXACTLY.

60
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,257
OH! THIS IS AWESOME!

61
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,126
[RUDY] I TOLD YOU
I'M A GENIUS, RIGHT?!

62
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,930
EHEH! WHATEVER YOU

86
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,276
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

87
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,812
THEY'RE MAKING THE
WYVERNS ATTACK THEM!

88
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:40,416
I DON'T GET IT! WHAT ARE
THEY DOING OUT THERE?

89
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,818
[SHUNICHI]
I'M RIGHT HERE!

UGH, WHAT, I'M BACK ALREADY.

THEY REALLY WANNA DIE!

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,139
[ROE2] IT'S A PRETTY INTERESTING
STRATEGY IF YOU ASK ME.

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,610
[ROE 2] THE SHRINE
IS RESPAWNING THEM.

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,078
IT'S JUST LIKE A CATHEDRAL.

101
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:09,179
ONLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE

USUALLY WOULD.

COME UP WITH THAT...?

00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,590
YOU'VE GOTTA BE
INTERESTED, RIGHT, TOYA?

109
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,991
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

110
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,627
"INTERESTED?!" THAT MACHINE
IS DISGUSTING...!

111
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:24,928
TOTALLY WRONG!

112
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,130
NO... THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH IT.

113
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:28,799
IT'S JUST AN INVENTION

114
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,501
THAT USES THE LAWS
OF THIS WORLD.

115

THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

[ROE2]
AND FROM WHERE I'M STANDING...

117
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,672
THOSE KNIGHTS ARE GIVING
UP THEIR EMPATHIUM

TO THE SYSTEM FREELY ENOUGH.
[SERARA] EH?

119
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,643
THE HARVESTING RATE IS EXCELLENT

CONSIDERING ALL THE
DYING THEY'RE DOING.

121
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,379
THE GENIUSES ARE DEFINITELY
BENEFITTING FROM IT.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

125
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:52,923
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE TRYING
TO DIE OUT THERE.

126
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:54,290
[ROE2] NONE OF THEM
ARE SLOWING DOWN

SEE THEIR FORMER LIVES,

AND THEY'RE ADDICTED TO IT!

131
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,199

00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,463
[TOYA] ALL I KNOW IS THAT
THERE'RE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE HERE

308
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:15,331
WHO ARE IMPORTANT TO ME.

309
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:17,067
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK...

310
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,502
THIS WORLD IS REAL!

311
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,370
[SHUNICHI] SHUT UP!
[TOYA] UWAH!

312
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,338
[SHUNICHI] YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING! [TOYA] AHHHH!

313
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:24,007
(WATER SPLASHING)
[TOYA] AHNGH!

314
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:27,443
[SHUNICHI] THIS PLACE HAS
NOTHING! NOT EVEN DEATH!

315
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:29,245
WE'RE NOT IN SOME FANTASY LAND!

316
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:31,515
WE'RE NOT EVEN IN
HELL! YOU GET IT!

317
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:34,150
THIS PLACE DOESN'T EVEN EXIST!

318
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,686
(DISAPPOINTED)

319
00:14:35,786 --> 00:14:37,453
AND THE ONLY THING
KEEPING US HERE

320
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:39,890
ARE VERMIN LIKE YOU
CLINGING TO LIFE.

321
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,626
YOU REFUSE TO LET IT END.

322
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:46,062
THE REST OF US ARE LEFT HERE TO
SUFFER. AND BEG FOR ESCAPE!

323
00:14:46,162 --> 00:14:48,699
[TOYA]
(GRUNT AND GROANING) UGH...

324
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:53,403
THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN
THAT, AND YOU KNOW IT.

325
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,740
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
ABLE TO SEE THAT!

326
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,408
TOYA...

327
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,010
[TOYA] YOU'VE GOTTA
BE ABLE TO SEE

328
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,845
WHAT'S RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOU!

329
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,949
(CAR SCREECHING AND CRASHING)

330
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:07,283
[MAN A] HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

331
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,985
[MAN B] HELLO?! THERE'S
BEEN AN ACCIDENT!

332
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,688
(MUTTERING)

333
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:18,829
[MINORI] TOYA... IT'S
ME... IT'S MINORI!

334
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:32,743
[TOYA] MISTER. LIFE...
IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT.

335
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,278
YOU CAN BE ALIVE,
BUT DEAD INSIDE...

336
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:38,348
EVEN BACK IN OUR OLD WORLD.

337
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,450
SURE YOU CAN WALK AROUND
AND LIVE YOUR LIFE...

338
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,587
BUT IT'S MEANINGLESS IF
YOU DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

339
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:46,757
YOU KNOW IT TRUE!

340
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,992
[SHUNICHI]
HEH! TELL YA WHAT, KID.

341
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:50,594
IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH ME,

342
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:53,764
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD TAKE IT
UP WITH THE SYSTEM OPERATOR.

343
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:58,769
THEN THEY CAN BOOT ME FROM THE
SERVER. AND THEN I'LL BE FREE!

344
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,174
OKAY... I KNOW
HOW HE FEELS...

345
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:08,444
I GET THAT HE WANTS TO GO
HOME AND ALL... BUT STILL.

346
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,815
MISS ISUZU...

347
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:12,983
OH...!

348
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,285
THE GUY OUT THERE.

349
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,554
I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT.

350
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,989
AH...

351
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:22,693
UGN. HE ISN'T RIGHT.

352
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:31,668
[ISUZU] EVERYONE... EVERYONE...
THEY'RE ALL REAL. HMM.

353
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,542
[MINORI, THINKING]
TOYA WAS ALWAYS SMILING

354
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:41,344
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS STUCK
IN THAT WHEELCHAIR.

355
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:44,114
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
HE UNDERSTOOD

356
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,550
THAT THE WORLD AROUND
HIM CHANGED,

357
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,385
AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE
COULD DO ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

358
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,788
THE WORLD GOT SO
BIG AND UNFAIR.

359
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,591
AND THERE WASN'T ANY
HOPE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT.

360
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:57,493
HE KEPT GOING, AND DOING WHAT
HE COULD WITH THAT HE HAD.

361
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,830
HE ACCEPTED HIS FATE!

362
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,066
(SNARL)

363
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,100
[SHUNICHI] HUAH!

364
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,636
[SHUNICHI] UWAH!
[TOYA] UGH!

365
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,638
[MINORI, THINKING] AND HE'S
DOING THE SAME THING NOW!

366
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,473
[ROE2] SO TOYA IS
PROTESTING FATE.

367
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:13,143
SERARA IS CASTING
HEARTBEAT HEALING ON ALL

368
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:16,479
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND AFTER
SHE DRESSES THEIR WOUNDS.

369
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,849
ISUZU AND RUNDELLHAUS ARE
DEFENDING THE VILLAGERS

370
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,284
AS THEY'RE MAKING
THEIR WAY HERE.

371
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:22,853
(BATTLE EXERTS)

372
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:25,055
[ROE2] THE THING IS, THOUGH,
AS HARD AS THEY'RE FIGHTING.

373
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,256
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

374
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,592
(BATTLE EXERTS)

375
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,827
CONSIDERING EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON...

376
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,329
YOU ALREADY KNOW THE
ANSWER, DON'T YOU?

377
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:34,565
UH?

378
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,866
[ROE2] I MEAN I
COULD STAND HERE AND

379
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,535
ASK YOU THE SAME
QUESTIONS, COULDN'T I?

380
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,504
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

381
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,205
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

382
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,345
[ISUZU] SOMETHING'S BEEN ON
MY MIND EVER SINCE YESTERDAY.

383
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,581
UH...?

384
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,683
[ISUZU] I'VE BEEN
THINKING AND THINKING.

385
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,652
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY FIGURE
IT ALL OUT UNTIL JUST NOW.

386
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,689
I HAD TO FIGHT MY
OWN INSECURITIES...

387
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,825
I JUST COULDN'T FIND
MY INSPIRATION.

388
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,193
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

389
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:04,528
BUT YOU KNOW...?

390
00:18:04,628 --> 00:18:06,329
I REALLY DID HAVE
IT GOOD BEFORE.

391
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,500
I HAD A GREAT DAD, WHO
LOVED ME AND CARED FOR ME.

392
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:14,004
AND WELL, LIFE
WAS FULL OF MUSIC!

393
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,573
WHEN I WAS SAD OR UPSET,

394
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:18,074
THERE WERE SO MANY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SONGS

395
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:19,876
I COULD LISTEN TO.

396
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:24,080
MUSIC ALWAYS HELPED ME
THROUGH, NO MATTER WHAT.

397
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,051
BUT THIS...
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

398
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:29,986
42 SONGS ISN'T ENOUGH...

399
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:31,321
NOT AT ALL!

400
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:32,656
IT'S JUST AWFUL

401
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:35,458
THAT YOU CAN'T SING
WHENEVER YOU'RE SAD,

402
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,727
WHENEVER YOU'RE HAPPY.

403
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,228
MISS ISUZU...

404
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,797
WHICH IS WHY...
(LUTE STRUMMING)

405
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:42,666
UH...! WHAT'RE YOU DOING?!

406
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:44,067
LET'S GO, RUDY!

407
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,136
UH! WHERE ARE WE GOING?!

408
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,906
[RUDY] SO UH...
WHAT'RE WE GONNA DO?

409
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,442
[ISUZU] WE'RE GOING TO PICK A
FIGHT! [RUDY] A FIGHT?!

410
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,977
[ISUZU] WE'RE GOING OUT
THERE TO PICK A FIGHT

411
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:57,047
WITH THE GODS WHO ONLY CREATED
42 SONGS FOR THIS WORLD.

412
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:59,916
AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL
THEY START SINGING ALONG.

413
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:03,319
[RUDY] (HEAVY BREATHING)
DON'T GO WITHOUT ME, MISS ISUZU!

414
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:07,524
[MINORI, THINKING] THERE'S
SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HER.

415
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,692
BUT I'M...

416
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:10,293
I'M NOT SURE IF
I REALLY WANT

417
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:11,728
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

418
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:14,965
NO, THAT SHOULDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

419
00:19:15,065 --> 00:19:19,870
NO MATTER WHO SHE IS, SHE IS
HERE WITH ME. AND MY FRIEND.

420
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,906
AND IN THE END.
THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK.

421
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,910
I MEAN, WHO AM I, REALLY?

422
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:29,613
WHERE AM I GOING?

423
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:31,582
SHE MAKES ME ASK...

424
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:33,717
... WHAT DO I WANT TO BE?

425
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:36,720
(MUSIC PLAYING)
UH?

426
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:38,789
[MINORI, THINKING] ISUZU?

427
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,958
SHE'S SINGING...!

428
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:44,861
THAT'S HER DREAM.
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

429
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:48,164
YEAH, AND I HAVE A DREAM TOO...

430
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,037
I WANT TO BE LIKE SHIROE.

431
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,412
YES. THAT'S IT. I WANT
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

432
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:05,081
I WANT TO CARVE NEW PATHS.

433
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:07,518
(INHALES) (SLAPS)

434
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:10,086
I AM THE APPRENTICE
OF MASTER SHIROE.

435
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:13,456
AND YOU'RE OUR BIG SISTER, ROE2!
[ROE2] UH?

436
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:14,925
YOU CAME FROM NOWHERE,

437
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,561
AND YOU'LL BE GOING BACK
THERE, BUT FOR RIGHT NOW...

438
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,163
YOU'RE WITH US, AND
YOU'RE OUR FRIEND!

439
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:27,804
(LAUGHING)

440
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:31,141
SO YOU FOUND YOUR ANSWER,
IN THE MIDDLE OF BATTLE?

441
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:35,512
THAT'S RIGHT I DID...
I HAVE FOUND MY ANSWER.

442
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:37,313
EVEN IF WE CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

443
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,316
WE CAN ALWAYS MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IF WE'RE WILLING TO TRY.

444
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,086
OKAY, SO SHOULDN'T YOU BE
OUT THERE HELPING TOYA?

445
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:45,255
MY BROTHER WILL BE JUST FINE.

446
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:48,592
YEAH, BUT HE CAN'T HEAR
A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

447
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,327
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE
OTHER THINGS TO DO.

448
00:20:51,427 --> 00:20:53,329
HM...

449
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,667
WELL IF YOU'D LIKED ME TO
HELP, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

450
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:57,734
SURE.
(MUSIC ENDING)

451
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,302
OKAY! YOU GOT IT, MINORI!

452
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:03,607
LET'S DO THIS! AFTER ALL,
WHAT'RE BIG SISTERS FOR?!

453
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,208
RIGHT!

454
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:06,309
SUMMON!

455
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:14,150
BEING A TRAVELER DOES COME
WITH CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.

456
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,920
MINORI, DO YOU KNOW WHAT A
SHAME IT'D BE IF I SAID NO

457
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,457
TO YOU RIGHT NOW? ESPECIALLY
AFTER YOU ASKED ME SO NICELY!

458
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:23,359
ANYTIME MY LITTLE
SISTER NEEDS ME,

459
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:24,695
I'M GONNA BE THERE!

460
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:26,429
(FIGHTING)

461
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,799
[ROE2] THE STABILITY OF THE
CONVERGING FACTORS DIRECTLY

462
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,602
CORRELATES WITH THE INCREASING
SCALE OF THE BATTLE.

463
00:21:31,702 --> 00:21:34,037
HOWEVER, THIS LEADS
TO RANK DETERMINISM.

464
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:36,039
SMALL FRAGMENTS ARE
UNNECESSARILY LOST

465
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:37,908
DURING THE COURSE OF THE EVENT.

466
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,010
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH THAT...

467
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,713
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE
HAPPY, IT'S NORMAL.

468
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,247
BUT, THINK ABOUT IT!

469
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:48,218
ALL THOSE DESIRES ARE LEADING
EVERYONE TO IMMENSE SORROWS.

470
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:49,319
DID I LOSE YOU?

471
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:50,554
MM‐HM.

472
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:51,822
WELL IT'S YOUR LANGUAGE;

473
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:53,423
I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN IT!

474
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:55,792
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING SO
YOUR LANGUAGE IS THE ONLY THING

475
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:59,095
KEEPING ME FROM EXPRESSING
MY CONCLUSIONS PROPERLY.

476
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:01,665
CAN YOU REALLY ENDURE THIS
UNREASONABLE SOLITUDE WHILE

477
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,400
LIVING LIKE YOU'RE STUCK
IN A STONE AGE?

478
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,102
I KNOW IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME!

479
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:09,973
BUT YOUR COMPASSION,
WHAT I CALL EMPATHIUM,

480
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:13,109
IT MAKES YOU CARE FOR
PEOPLE, AM I RIGHT?

481
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:15,311
[MINORI] HUH?

482
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:29,359
[LONDARK, VOICE CHAT] GENERAL
CONQUEROR OF THE EAST,

483
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,962
YOUR SERVANTS ARE UNDER
ATTACK AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

484
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,296
[MIZPHA] EXCUSE ME?!

485
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:35,532
[MIZPHA] WHO IS IT?!

486
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,069
[LONDARK] WELL WHO
DO WE HAVE HERE?

487
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,405
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE
THIS BEFORE, HAVE WE NOT?

488
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,101
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
LONDARK STANDS IN DEFIANCE.

489
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,836
THE FEELINGS HE HAS FOR THIS
WORLD

490
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,304
HAVE GROWN WARPED AND TWISTED.

491
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:24,340
HE WONDERS WHY EVERYONE WAS
BROUGHT TO THIS WORLD

492
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,610
AND WHY NO ONE WAS
GIVEN A CHOICE.

493
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,344
NYANTA HAS NO ANSWERS.

494
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,747
TOYA, ISUZU, AND THE OTHER
JUNIOR MEMBERS

495
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:31,948
CONTINUE THEIR STRUGGLE.

496
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,184
AS THEY SEEK TO FIND
THEIR OWN ANSWERS.

497
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:37,120
[SHIROE] MY COMRADES ARE
ALWAYS BESIDE ME.
