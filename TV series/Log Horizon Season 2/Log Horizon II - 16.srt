(STAGGERED GROANS)

00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,658
[ROE2]
UH?

3
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:17,327
AH, THE SUN...

4
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:20,763
THE SUN'S
KILLING ME! UGH!

5
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:58,794
[TOYA] HMMM... IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE MADE IT TO ZOOLAND.

6
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:02,398
[MINORI] UM... WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SEE IT PRETTY SOON NOW.

7
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,833
(GASP) THERE IT IS!

8
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:06,436
UH! OH MY GOD! MT. FUJI!

9
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:07,837
[ISUZU]
HUH?! WHERE IS IT, TOYA?!

10
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:10,506
[RUDY]
HMMM, OH THE SACRED MT. FUJI.

11
00:02:10,606 --> 00:02:12,308
[SERARA]
IT'S BIGGER THAN I REMEMBER.

12
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,345
[ISUZU] OMIGOSH! LOOK! THOSE
THINGS TOTALLY LOOK LIKE COWS!

13
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,113
[SERARA] WHAT?!
[MINORI] WAIT. WHERE?

14
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,049
[SERARA] OH, I THINK THAT'S A
HERD OF GREEN ELK

15
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:20,316
OUT THERE YOU GUYS!

16
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,417
HOW COOL!

17
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,385
[ISUZU]
ARE THEY DANGEROUS?

18
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,553
[SERARA]
WE'LL BE FINE.

19
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,021
NONE OF THEM ARE
CLOSE TO THE ROAD.

20
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:28,224
AND BESIDES, THEY DON'T
REALLY LOOK FOR TROUBLE.

21
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,659
MOO...

22
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,494
AW, THEY'RE SO CUTE!

23
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,663
THEY REALLY DO
LOOK LIKE COWS.

24
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,899
NOT TO MENTION THEY
MAKE TASTY BARBECUE!

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,268
[ALL]
EH...?

26
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:39,769
[SERARA]
MMMM...

27
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,378
[TOYA] (EXHALES) THERE'S
BEEN A LONG SLIGHT CURVE

28
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:49,913
IN THE ROAD AROUND THESE PARTS.

29
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,515
[MINORI] THAT'S BECAUSE THE ROAD
RUNS AROUND THE SHORELINE.

30
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,117
[TOYA] OH YEAH? THEN
HOW COME ALL I'M SEEING

31
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:55,751
ARE BUSHES AND TREES?!

32
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,487
[MINORI] (BIG INHALE)
IF YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

33
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,889
YOU CAN SMELL THE OCEAN TOYA.

34
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:03,193
(SNIFF SNIFF)

35
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,560
[TOYA] NOT GETTING ANYTHING.

36
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,396
WELL EXCEPT FOR
THOSE HORSE BUTTS.

37
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,663
(MINORI GIGGLES)

38
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,932
[TOYA]
NOW IF I REMEMBER RIGHT,

39
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:11,334
BROTHER SHIROE TOLD
US ABOUT THIS ROAD.

40
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:12,868
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
"THE TOKAIDO"

41
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,605
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE CALLED
IT A LONG TIME AGO.

42
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,441
IT WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
FIVE ROUTES.

43
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,843
STARTING AT THE NIYONBASHI
BRIDGE IN TOKYO,

44
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,778
IT BECAME A PIVOTAL
POINT OF TRADE.

45
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,180
[TOYA]
UH‐HUH...

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,416
IN THE REAL WORLD,
THE TOKAIDO ROUTE

47
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,218
IS PRIMARILY USED AS
A MAJOR HIGHWAY.

48
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,622
IT'S CALLED NATIONAL ROUTE ONE.
IT GOES ALL THE WAY INTO OSAKA.

49
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,856
[TOYA]
OSAKA?!

50
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:36,659
[RUDY]
AH... THE PLACE WE CALL MINAMI.

51
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,994
[MINORI] DOES THAT
MEAN ALL THE ROADS

52
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:39,829
ARE CONNECTED HERE
AS WELL, SHIROE?

53
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,698
[SHIROE] THAT'S RIGHT... THIS IS
PROBABLY GONNA BE THE FASTEST

54
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:44,834
WAY THROUGH THE
REDSTONE MOUNTAINS.

55
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,270
[MINORI] MPH.
[TOYA] HM?

56
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,140
IT'S FUNNY. I NEVER REALLY PAID
A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION

57
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,308
TO THE ROADS BEFORE
WE WOUND UP HERE.

58
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,745
[TOYA] UH... YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD SAY THE SAME THING!

59
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,081
BROTHER SHIROE'S LIKE A
WALKING, TALKING ENCYCLOPEDIA

60
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,083
WITH ALL THE CRAZY
STUFF HE KNOWS!

61
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,485
OH MAN! I'M GONNA LEARN A
WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF

62
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:03,987
WHILE WE'RE ON THIS
TRIP, AREN'T I!

63
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,889
(STOMACH GROWLING)
[BOTH] HUH?

64
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,259
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
WE'VE HAD LUNCH FIRST!

65
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,427
[ALL]
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

66
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,065
[TOYA]
MMM‐MMMMM, YUM!

67
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,767
THE CHIEF MAKES THE BEST HAM
SANDWICHES IN THE UNIVERSE!

68
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:21,904
[RUDY] MM. YES, HE DOES!
THE MAN IS A MAGICIAN!

69
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,606
[ISUZU]
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!

70
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,041
[BOTH]
HUH?

71
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,410
[ISUZU]
NOT EVERYONE HAS HAD THEIRS YET.

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,112
[SERARA]
YEAH. YOU HEARD HER!

73
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:31,982
[SERARA] AH...?
YOU ALMOST BIT MY HAND.

74
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,317
WE SHOULD BE COMING UP ON
CALVET VILLAGE.

75
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,386
YOU WANNA STOP?
... OR GO ON?

76
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,154
WELL, IT'S SUCH
A NICE DAY OUT

77
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,190
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE
CAN'T KEEP ON GOING.

78
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,625
I'M BETTING DANISH AND
CROISSANT CAN DO THIS ALL DAY

79
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,726
IF THEY WANT TO.

80
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,395
(HORSE NEIGHS AND WHINNIES)

81
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:48,331
[SERARA] YOU HEAR THAT! THEY SAY
THEY CAN GO AS LONG AS WE CAN.

82
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,899
[ISUZU] SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
THEY'RE UP FOR IT.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,734
[SERARA] I KNOW
I CAN KEEP GOING!

84
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:52,969
[MINORI] YEAH! ME TOO!

85
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,437
[RUDY]
ROADS UNIMAGINED ALWAYS

86
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,672
APPEAR BEFORE RUNDELLHAUS KODE!

87
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,241
[TOYA] ALL RIGHT! WE'D BETTER
GET MOVING

88
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,210
BEFORE IT STARTS
GETTING DARK OUT HERE!

89
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,877
[ALL]
YEAH!

90
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,220
(HORSES WHINNY)
[ALL] WAUUGHHH!

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,822
(DISORIENTED GROANS)

92
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:16,559
[TOYA]
OKAY... WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT...?

93
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:17,860
[ISUZU] WAUUUGHHH!
[ALL] HUH?

94
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,595
[ISUZU]
THEY MUST'VE RUN OUT OF TIME.

95
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,032
THE TWIN HORSE FLUTE
ONLY LASTS A FEW HOURS.

96
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,167
[SERARA]
WELL I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS IT.

97
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,835
THAT'S RIGHT. THEY'RE
ONLY SUPPOSED TO GIVE US

98
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,237
SIX HOURS A DAY.

99
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:28,871
(DISAPPOINTED)

100
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,573
(LAUGHTER)

101
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,443
WELL I GUESS WE'RE NOT ALL THAT
WORRIED ABOUT IT ARE WE GUYS?

102
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:35,145
[MINORI]
YEAH, TOTALLY!

103
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:37,613
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WAS
STILL A PRETTY QUICK DEPARTURE.

104
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,816
I MEAN SERIOUSLY, WHY DIDN'T
THOSE TWO MOVE THAT FAST BEFORE.

105
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,318
[RUDY]
GOOD QUESTION!

106
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,753
THAT IS JUST RUDE,

107
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,089
AND AFTER THEY ATE CARROTS
RIGHT OUTTA MY HANDS!

108
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,790
[ISUZU] NOT TO MENTION THE
CABBAGE! [RUDY] HUH...?

109
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,360
THEY DON'T HAVE A SINGLE
SHRED OF HUMAN DECENCY!

110
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,694
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE HORSES.

111
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,696
WELL THAT'S NO EXCUSE...

112
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:56,432
YOU KNOW... EVEN
HORSES SHOULD KNOW

113
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,268
IT'S NOT RIGHT TO EAT AND RUN.

114
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:01,804
(LAUGHTER)

115
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,406
[RUDY] OKAY, WE LOST THE HORSES.

116
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,808
BUT THAT JUST GIVES US
ANOTHER ADVENTURE, RIGHT?

117
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:09,579
[TOYA] YOU BET...!
SO WHERE ARE WE, ANYWAY?

118
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,081
[MINORI] WELL WITH TRAVEL TIME,

119
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,716
WE'RE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
CALVET AND WILLISTORIA.

120
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,651
[ISUZU] WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANYWHERE VERY FAST

121
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,153
WITHOUT A SET OF FRESH HORSES.

122
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,554
(DEFLATED)

123
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:21,257
GUESS THIS MEANS
WE'RE CAMPING TONIGHT!

124
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,293
WELL I DON'T SEE A
HOTEL OR ANYTHING.

125
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:26,096
JUST AS LONG AS EVERYONE
LEAVES THE COOKING TO ME.

126
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,764
NOW THIS IS WHERE ADVENTURERS
ARE AT THEIR BEST!

127
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,101
WE'RE NOT ALL
OUTDOORSMEN, YOU KNOW?

128
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,936
[BOYS]
LET'S PITCH CAMP!

129
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,005
[GIRLS]
YEAH!

130
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:45,315
[RUDY] HMM. HEH.
(CLAPPING)

131
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:46,482
[TOYA]
PERFECT.

132
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:47,750
[BOTH]
WAUUUGHHHH!

133
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,055

(SURPRISED)

136
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:01,932
[ALL] THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD!
(EATING)

137
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,934
[TOYA] IT'S REALLY... GOOD.
[SERARA] HM?

138
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:06,169
[MINORI] OH YEAH, THIS
IS, DEFINITELY GOOD.

139
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,004
[ISUZU]
IT'S JUST... A LITTLE...

140
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:10,740
[RUDY]
IT'S REALLY BLAND... AND BITTER

141
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,774
[ISUZU]
RUDY!

142
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,143
(GASP AND SCREAM)

143
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,245
[SERARA]
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!

144
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:17,280
[SERARA] WHENEVER I'M
COOKING WITH CHIEF NYANTA,

145
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,782
IT ALWAYS COMES OUT THE
WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO...

146
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:21,017
[TOYA] HEY, THE
MORE YOU DO IT,

147
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,652
THE BETTER YOU'LL GET!
DON'T SWEAT IT!

148
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,520
IF THE CHIEF WERE
HERE RIGHT NOW...

149
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,858
HE'D TELL YOU TO TAKE IT EASY,
BABY. YOU CAN TOTALLY DO IT!

150
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,261
[RUDY] KEEP WORKING TO
IMPROVE, YOU'LL BE FINE.

151
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,429
[MINORI] I WISH MORE OF US
HAD THE COOKING SKILL,

152
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:34,864
SO WE COULD ALL HELP COOK!

153
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:36,699
[ISUZU] SORRY WE'RE
COUNTING ON YOU

154
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,268
FOR ALL THE GRUB,
LITTLE DUDE‐ETTE!

155
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,436
(INHALE) YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!

156
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:43,073
I'VE GOTTA KEEP TRYING FOR
EVERYONE IN MY GUILD!

157
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,741
[SERARA] I'M THE ONE WEARING
THE NEWLYWED WIFE'S APRON!

158
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,779
IT'S TIME I LIVE UP TO CHIEF
NYANTA'S LEGACY OF AMAZING FOOD!

159
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,481
(CHEERS)

160
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:53,116
(STRUMMING LUTE)

161
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,552
[MINORI] SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE
NEXT BEST PLACE

162
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:58,254
TO STOP IS SAZAN VILLAGE.

163
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,223
[TOYA] HOW LONG WILL
IT TAKE TO GET THERE?

164
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,724
WELL IF WE CAN'T
GET MORE THAN

165
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:03,226
SIX HOURS A DAY
OUT OF THE HORSES...

166
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:05,528
IT'S PROBABLY GONNA TAKE
US ANOTHER THREE DAYS.

167
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,797
AHHH! WHY IN THE HECK ARE WE
RUNNING INTO ALL THIS TROUBLE

168
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:09,332
ON OUR FIRST JOURNEY?

169
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:12,602
WHY CAN'T IT BE A NORMAL
ADVENTURE LIKE IT USED TO BE?

170
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,104
S'NOT SO BAD...

171
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,372
WE'VE GOT OUR GUILDMATES WITH
US KEEPING US COMPANY...

172
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:18,841
IT KINDA MAKES THE WHOLE
THING MORE FUN, Y'KNOW.

173
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:20,443
I'M SURE THAT'S WHY SHIROE AND

174
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,445
THE OTHERS SENT US
IN THE FIRST PLACE

175
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,848
TO TEACH US TO TAKE CARE OF EACH
OTHER. AND TO TRUST EACH OTHER.

176
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,718
HMPH. LOOK AT
YOU, MINORI.

177
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,386
HUH?

178
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:32,522
IT SURE IS STRANGE
TO SEE MY BIG SISTER

179
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:34,490
ALL GROWN UP LIKE THIS.

180
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:43,533
MM? ALL GROWN UP?

181
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,501
I KINDA ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU
AND I WERE GONNA GROW UP AT

182
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:49,272
THE SAME SPEED. BUT YOU'RE
MOVING PRETTY FAST.

183
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:51,041
[MINORI]
YOU'RE EXAGGERATING.

184
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,808
WHICH ONE OF US WAS STRONGER
WHEN THIS APOCALYPSE

185
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,677
MESS GOT STARTED?

186
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,880
HEH. THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THIS FAR IF I DIDN'T

187
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:00,316
HAVE YOU HERE TO HELP
ME THROUGH ALL THIS.

188
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,019
WELL, I AM YOUR BIG
BROTHER YOU KNOW.

189
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,321
HUH? UH... I'M
THE BIG SISTER HERE

190
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:06,789
[TOYA]
NO, I'M DEFINITELY OLDER!

191
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,191
[MINORI]
YOU HAVE LOST YOUR MIND.

192
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,193
[TOYA] NO, I AM! I'M
EVEN TALLER THAN YOU ARE!

193
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:11,962
[MINORI] OH WHATEVER. THAT
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

194
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:13,496
[TOYA]
UH, IT SURE DOES!

195
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,401
[MARIELLE] THE KIDS LEFT FOR
THEIR EXPEDITION THREE DAYS AGO.

196
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:22,572
AWW... I HOPE THEY'RE
NOT GETTING HOMESICK...

197
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,007
[HENRIETTA] I DOUBT IT!

198
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,209
I BET THEY'RE ROMPING ABOUT
LIKE IT'S A SCHOOL TRIP.

199
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:27,877
THEY MIGHT EVEN START TELLING
THEMSELVES

200
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,412
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME BACK!

201
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,482
[AKATSUKI] HMN... THAT WOULDN'T
BE GOOD EITHER, WOULD IT?

202
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:33,549
(SIGH)

203
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,886
[HENRIETTA] YOU'RE LOOKING
PALE AGAIN, RIEZE.

204
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,654
HUH? I'M ALL RIGHT,
IT'S NOTHING.

205
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:42,625
HM‐MM. YOUR EYES ARE STARTING
TO LOOK STERN, LIKE MY LORD.

206
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:45,195
INTENSE AND SEVERE.
HUH?

207
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,231
YOU DON'T NEED TO PUSH YOURSELF
AS HARD AS YOU HAVE BEEN.

208
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,000
[RIEZE]
OKAY...

209
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,036
THE ABSENCE OF KRUSTY MUST
BE TAKING ITS TOLL ON YOU.

210
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,804
THAT'S TRUE, IT'S BEEN
DIFFICULT.

211
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,673
WORKING WITHOUT HIM OR TAKAYAMA
HAS BEEN VERY HARD FOR ME.

212
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,276
D. D. D. IS STILL FUNCTIONING
PROPERLY FOR NOW,

213
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:03,546
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF UNKNOWN
FACTORS FACING US AT THE MOMENT.

214
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,747
AND IT'S TROUBLING.

215
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,482
(EXHALES)

216
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,484
I'M SORRY TO BE SUCH A
THORN IN EVERYONE'S SIDE

217
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,554
AND I'M AFRAID, THAT WON'T
BE CHANGING ANYTIME SOON.

218
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,690
[HENRIETTA] GO AHEAD AND BE
A PAIN IF YOU NEED TO BE!

219
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,460
WE KNOW THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN
GOING SMOOTHLY FOR YOU.

220
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,531
I BET SHIROE CAN WORK SOMETHING
OUT TO HELP YOU RUN YOUR GUILD.

221
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,700
[AKATSUKI] HE DEFINITELY WON'T
CONSIDER IT AN INCONVENIENCE.

222
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,137
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY THE
WORD AND HE'LL BE HERE,

223
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,105
AND OF COURSE I WILL TOO.

224
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,807
THAT'S RIGHT! JUST ASK
US FOR ANYTHING, 'K?

225
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:33,776
WE'LL BE HERE FOR YOU!

226
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:36,046
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS,
ALL RIGHT?!

227
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,782
(GIGGLING) [AKATSUKI] GRR...
HEY! WHAT IS SO FUNNY?!

228
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:42,385
I THOUGHT THAT'S THE STUPID
CRAP FRIENDS SAY TO EACH OTHER.

229
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:44,754
I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.
(AKATSUKI GRUMBLING)

230
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:45,488
HUH?

231
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:46,856
[BOTH]
UH?

232
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,591
IF WE'D NEVER COME
TO THIS PLACE...

233
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,928
THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE NONE
OF US WOULD HAVE EVER MET.

234
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,329
(EXHALE)

235
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,898
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

236
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,335
OH NO! I'M NOT BUYING
THAT FOR ONE MINUTE!

237
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:01,371
HOTTIES ATTRACT OTHER HOTTIES

238
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,940
SO NATURALLY WE'D END UP
FINDING EACH OTHER EVENTUALLY!

239
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,275
I'M HAPPY TO BE FRIENDS
HENRIETTA!

240
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,676
BUT I THINK YOU'RE TAKING
IT A BIT TOO FAR!

241
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,945
I DON'T THINK THAT MADE
THE LEAST BIT OF SENSE!

242
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,280
HEH!

243
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,651
OH MY AKATSUKI! COME BACK TO
MAMA YOU LITTLE DARLING!

244
00:11:17,988 --> 00:11:19,289
WAS THAT AN ORAL ART, LIKE

245
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:21,624
THE NINJA REPLACEMENT
MANEUVER, AKATSUKI?

246
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:26,229
[AKATSUKI] NO. THAT WAS
NOTHING, JUST A DOLL.

247
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,241
[ISUZU]
AHH!! LOOK AT THAT SUNSET!

248
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,410
IT'S REALLY PRETTY,
ISN'T IT?

249
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,646
[TOYA] THERE IT IS, YOU
GUYS! SAZAN VILLAGE, HO!

250
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,647
(GASP)

251
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,582
LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT!

252
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,255
[RUDY] OUR BARD HERE WOULD LIKE
TO PLAY AT

253
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:54,824
YOUR FINE ESTABLISHMENT TONIGHT.

254
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,292
SHE'S A FINE MUSICIAN,

255
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:58,461
AND SHE'S LOOKING FOR A
PLACE TO PERFORM HER SONGS.

256
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,464
[BARTENDER]
OKAY KID, LOOKIE HERE.

257
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:04,034
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I
CAN'T AFFORD 42.

258
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,868
WE'RE JUST A LITTLE
PLACE Y'KNOW.

259
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,603
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
WANT THE MONEY!

260
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:09,872
ALL I WANT IS THE
OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM!

261
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,407
[RUDY]
HUH? PLEASE LET HER!

262
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,509
[ISUZU]
PLEASE LET ME!

263
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,377
(GRUNT)

264
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,046
[TOYA]
WAY TO GO, RUDY!

265
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:18,014
A CHANCE TO PLAY! FREE ROOM!

266
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,016
[TOYA] THAT WAS PRETTY
SLICK NEGOTIATING!

267
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:23,886
HMPH! THIS IS WHAT
I WAS MEANT TO DO!

268
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:25,922
AT LEAST I WISH
I COULD SAY THAT,

269
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,058
BUT MISS ISUZU'S PASSION
WON HIM OVER.

270
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:29,492
ARE YOU OKAY?

271
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,794
THERE'S NO NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT ME!

272
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:35,098
JUST USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
PLAY! BOTH YOU AND ISUZU!

273
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:37,968
OH... YEAH, SURE!
(BACKGROUND SINGING BEGINS)

274
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,236
[TOYA, THINKING] I SWEAR, I
NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LEARN

275
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,604
SO MUCH ON THIS TRIP!

276
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:42,772
(BAR ROOM BUZZ)

277
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,340
[TOYA, THINKING]
EVEN RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING ‐

278
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,509
ON THE ROAD WE TOOK TO GET HERE.

279
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:48,611
I MEAN I WAS REALLY
STARTING TO WONDER

280
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,781
WHY IT HAD ALL
THESE TWIST TURNS.

281
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,183
BUT THE FURTHER WE WENT,

282
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:55,585
THE MORE I REALIZED IT
WAS THE BEST WAY TO GO.

283
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,154
STRAIGHT LINE TO THE VILLAGE
WOULD'VE BEEN SHORTER.

284
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,056
BUT A LOT BUMPIER.

285
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,857
SOMEBODY ALREADY TRIED TO DO IT
THAT WAY

286
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,295
AND THEN CREATED THE CURVES
AROUND THE TROUBLE SPOTS.

287
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,098
AND THEN, JUST WHEN I WAS
STARTING TO GET TIRED,

288
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:09,699
THERE WAS A VILLAGE.

289
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:12,602
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT'S
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

290
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,913
[TOYA, THINKING] THAT RUDY ‐
HE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

291
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:24,714
SO FULL OF ENERGY.

292
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,816
REMINDS ME OF BEING BACK IN
THE REAL WORLD,

293
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,284
WATCHING FROM THE SIDELINES.

294
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:32,122
EXCEPT THEN, I HAD A HARD TIME
SEEING PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

295
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,890
I WONDER WILL ALL
MY TRAVELING LAND ME

296
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,993
IN A VILLAGE LIKE THIS SOMEDAY?

297
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:40,330
[TOYA]
UGH! MAN I AM BEAT!

298
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,865
[RUDY] DUDE! EVERYONE
LOVED YOU OUT THERE!

299
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,468
SERIOUSLY, THEY WERE SCREAMING
FOR ENCORE AFTER ENCORE

300
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:47,137
LIKE YOU WERE NEVER GONNA STOP!

00:13:47,237 --> 00:13:48,871
YOU WERE GREAT, TOYA!

302
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,240
[TOYA]
UH‐HUH...

303
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,308
(DISTANT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER)
[TOYA] UH? HUH?

304
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,577
[TOYA] WHOA...
THEY'RE STILL HYPED!

305
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:57,080
[RUDY] TOO HYPER FOR ME...
BUT IT DOES MAKE ONE

306
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,982
WONDER WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

307
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,750
[TOYA] RUDY! YOU
REALLY WANNA KNOW?

308
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,518
NO, OF COURSE NOT...!

309
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,854
I'M FAR TOO REFINED
OF A PERSON, TOYA...

310
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,622
TO RESORT TO EAVESDROPPING.

311
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,359
BUT YOU KNOW... I CAN STILL
MARVEL AT THE AMOUNT OF

312
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:12,195
CHATTERING THEY DO. I MEAN
HOW CAN THEY TALK SO MUCH?

313
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,164
IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE GIRLS, DUDE.

314
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:18,801
VERY WELL. A GIRL THING... I
SUPPOSED I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

315
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,038
AND I MUST ASSUME IT'S A GIRL
THING FOR ISUZU TO ACT

316
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,706
AFFECTIONATELY TOWARDS ME, YES.

317
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,042
HUH? SHE'S
AFFECTIONATE WITH YOU?

318
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:28,144
LIKE ALL THE TIMES
SHE BRUSHES MY HAIR!

319
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,246
IT DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY
CRAZY INSIDE!

320
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,082
UH... YEAH...

321
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:34,517
[TOYA, THINKING] SOUNDS LIKE
SHE'S TREATING YOU LIKE A DOG.

322
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:37,287
HMPH... IT'S NOT LIKE I'VE SEEN
MISS ISUZU TREATING YOU THAT.

323
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,854
IT'S JUST TO ME.

324
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:41,257
I'M GETTING THE FEELING MAYBE
SHE ISN'T TAKING ME SERIOUSLY.

325
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,927
UH... (LAUGHING)

326
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:47,630
HUH?! KNOCK IT OFF, TOYA!
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS!

327
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,267
TAKE IT EASY, WILLYA?! TRY
THINKING OF IT LIKE THIS...

328
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,236
SHE'S TREATING YOU
LIKE YOU'RE SPECIAL.

329
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:55,205
HMM? "SPECIAL"...?

330
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:57,140
MM‐HM!

331
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,408
(PANTING)

332
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,110
[ISUZU] SHAKE!
[RUDY] W‐WOOF! (PANTS)

333
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,379
[ISUZU] OH RUDY‐BOOBY, YOU'RE
THE SWEETEST LITTLE PUPPY...

334
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:05,081
(MUFFLED LAUGHS)

335
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:08,151
OK?! SO WHAT'S FUNNY NOW!

336
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,420
SHE'S TOTALLY HAVING
FUN WITH YOU, DUDE!

337
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,222
AND WHEN SHE DOES THE DOG THING
WITH YOU THAT'S

338
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,823
HOW SHE'S LETTING YOU KNOW!

339
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,826
[RUDY] (SIGH) YOU SURE ABOUT
THAT? [TOYA] OH, YEAH!

340
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:19,729
BUT HERE'S THE THING... DOES
SHE THINK I'M A MANLY MAN?

341
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,965
DOES SHE THINK I'M AMAZING?
DOES SHE THINK I'M AS

342
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:25,035
MAGNIFICENT AND AS
STRONG AS I REALLY AM?

343
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:28,038
REALLY. WHAT DOES MISS
ISUZU THINK OF ME?

344
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,306
(YAWN) MAYBE
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

345
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:31,774
THIS TOO MUCH? NIGHTY NIGHT!

346
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,443
WHAT?! WELL IF YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO HELP ME...

347
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:38,681
THEN I'M GOING TO
SLEEP! (SNORING)

348
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,351
WHATEVER. GOOD NIGHT, RUDY.

349
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,419
[RUDY]
G'NIGHT.

350
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:47,958
[MINORI] TODAY WE'LL BE
HEADING TO THE SAKAWA ZONE!

351
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,625
[TOYA]
SAKAWA?

352
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,095
[MINORI] BACK IN OUR WORLD,
IT'S SOMEWHERE NEAR ODAWARA.

353
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,197
[SERARA] AREN'T THEY FAMOUS
FOR ITS STEAMED FISH PASTE?

354
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,865
[ISUZU] REALLY? I
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

355
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,234
[MINORI] OH AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THE ABANDONED ARIBA CASTLE'S

356
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,070
ON THE WAY THERE, TOO.

357
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,738
AND AFTER WE GET THROUGH
THERE, WE'LL HAVE TO BREAK

358
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,075
FROM THE HIGHWAY TO REACH
THE REDSTONE MOUNTAINS.

359
00:16:05,175 --> 00:16:08,411
WE'LL NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER
TO TAKE THE SMALLER ROAD

360
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,247
OR THE ROAD THAT'S LIKE
A MOUNTAIN TRAIL.

361
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:16,052
THIS AREA IS A PADDY FIELD ZONE
WITH NATURE‐ TYPE MONSTERS.

362
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,321
IT'S GOT FERAL DOGS...

363
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:20,456
ALONG WITH MONSTROUS BOARS...

364
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:22,525
AND EVEN THE PLANTS
GET PRETTY VICIOUS,

365
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,460
BUT ONLY IF YOU PROVOKE THEM.

366
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,063
BIG BROTHER SHIROE
TOLD US ABOUT THIS,

367
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:29,299
BUT THE MONSTERS ON THE ROAD
AREN'T AS POWERFUL AS SOME

368
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,601
OF THE OTHERS WE'VE FACED.
[MINORI] MM‐HM!

369
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,536
AND THAT MEANS WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE A PROBLEM HANDLING

370
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:34,904
A BUNCH OF THEM AT ONCE!

371
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,207
THEN IT'S TIME FOR
US TO HIT THE ROAD!

372
00:16:37,307 --> 00:16:39,375
[TOYA]
LET'S DO THIS, GUYS!

373
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:41,044
[ALL]
WOOHOO! YEAH!

374
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,182
[ISAAC]
SO, IS THIS GONNA WORK?

375
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,951
[SHIROE]
YEAH, IT SHOULD BE FINE.

376
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:52,288
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS... BUT I
NEEDED SOMEONE TO TRAIN THEM.

377
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,024
YEAH WELL DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

378
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:57,327
MISTER ISAAC IS REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO GETTING THIS GOING.

379
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,429
HEY! DON'T CALL ME
THAT, ALL RIGHT?

380
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,598
OKAY, SO NOW THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE TRAINING THEM,

381
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:05,001
HOW MANY LEVELS SHOULD
WE BE SHOOTING FOR?

382
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,402
[SHIROE] WE'RE DOING THIS AS A
GOODWILL GESTURE

383
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:07,703
FOR OUR FRIENDS IN EASTAL.

384
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:09,672
JUST GET THEIR KNIGHTS
UP A COUPLE LEVELS.

385
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:11,641
THAT'S NOT VERY AMBITIOUS.

386
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:15,745
REMEMBER THESE ARE NPCS... TRY
NOT TO SLAP 'EM AROUND TOO MUCH.

387
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:18,348
WHAT? WHERE'S
THE FUN IN THAT?

388
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,283
[SHIROE] ISAAC...
[BOTH] HM?

389
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,751
[SHIROE]
PLEASE TELL ME,

390
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:23,653
YOU WON'T TRY TO JUST
POWER‐LEVEL THEM THROUGH THIS.

391
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:26,556
OF COURSE! THAT'S THE
EASIEST WAY TO DO IT, RIGHT?!

392
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,724
[ISAAC] ALL THEY HAVE
TO DO IS FOLLOW ME...

393
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:30,860
I DO THE FIGHTING
AND THEY LEVEL UP!

394
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:34,697
SEE, EVERYBODY WINS, AND EASTAL
GETS A BUNCHA TRAINED TROOPS!

395
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,699
THAT'S NOT TRAINING,
IT'S CHEATING,

396
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,734
YOU'LL JUST BE INFLATING THEM.

397
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,604
YOU ARE SERIOUSLY UPTIGHT, MAN!

398
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:44,140
CAN'T WE JUST DO COMBAT
DRILLS OR POWER‐LEVELING?

399
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,644
AH WELL, I'LL JUST RUN 'EM
TIL THEY DROP! (LAUGHS)

400
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,680
[SHIROE, THINKING] OK. MAYBE I
PICKED THE WRONG PERSON

401
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,349
FOR THE JOB. OH WELL, LET'S
JUST HOPE FOR THE BEST.

402
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:55,451
ALSO, DOES ANYBODY
KNOW WHAT'S BEEN

403
00:17:55,551 --> 00:17:57,387
GOING ON WITH KRUSTY LATELY?

404
00:17:57,487 --> 00:18:01,024
NO... AND HIS FRIEND'S
LIST ISN'T ANSWERING.

405
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,659
TELL YA WHAT; THE WAY HE'S
BEEN BLOWING OFF HIS GUILD

406
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,596
IS UNFORGIVEABLE. THEY'RE
GONNA FALL APART WITHOUT HIM.

407
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,831
I HEARD D. D. D.'S BEEN LOSING
MEMBER AFTER MEMBER

408
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:11,267
SINCE HE WENT AND
BAILED ON THEM.

409
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,469
[REZARICK] ON THE OTHER HAND,
THEY'VE STILL STUCK TOGETHER

410
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:15,338
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ORDEAL.

411
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:18,208
GUESS THAT'S A TESTAMENT
TO THEIR LOYALTY.

412
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,575
(EXHALES)

413
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,644
[ISAAC] YOU'RE NOT REALLY
WORRIED, ARE YOU?

414
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:23,679
WELL SHOULDN'T I BE
WORRIED ABOUT HIM?

415
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:25,615
AH, IT'S JUST KRUSTY.

416
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:27,583
HE GETS BORED AND
RUNS OFF, YOU KNOW?

417
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:30,186
HE'S HAVIN' THE
TIME OF HIS LIFE!

418
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,787
YEAH...

419
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:34,857
[SHIROE, THINKING] FINE, BUT I'M
STILL WORRIED ABOUT D. D. D.

420
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,428
[EINS] HONESTY'S MEMBERSHIP IS
NOW OVER 1800 GUILD MEMBERS.

421
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:40,296
THAT'S BETTER THAN WE EVER
ACCOMPLISHED IN

422
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,565
THE PEAK OF OUR GAMING DAYS.

423
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:45,101
[TOSHI] MAYBE, BUT THE MAJORITY
OF NEW MEMBERS

424
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,403
ARE JUST HERE TO SAY
THEY'RE IN A GUILD, EINS!

425
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,673
THEY DON'T LEAVE THE CITY LIMITS
TO HUNT OR GATHER, AND I DON'T

426
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:54,710
THINK THEY'RE CRAFTING OR
SELLING ANYTHING EITHER!

427
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,913
[HARUHARU]
HEH... NOTHING BUT PARASITES...

428
00:18:57,013 --> 00:19:00,050
TRUE, WE DIDN'T PICK UP A LOT OF
CONTRIBUTORS... HOWEVER...

429
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,252
[HARUHARU] "HOWEVER" WE DON'T
NEED A BUNCH OF LEACHES

430
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,087
MAKING OUR GUILD SOFT AND LAZY!

431
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,689
THE PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO NOTICE, IN THE GUILD,

432
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:09,059
IN THE CITY AND THEY'RE
NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.

433
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,794
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE IT BLOWS UP!

434
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,029
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN

435
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,864
AT THE ROUND TABLE
CONFERENCE MEETINGS!

436
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,766
[TOSHI] AND HOW ARE THEY
SUPPOSED TO FIX THIS?

437
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,069
WE JUST NEED TO KICK THEM
OUT LIKE WE USED TO!

438
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,870
[EINS] UH!
[HARUHARU] OR AT THE LEAST

439
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:22,372
RESTRICT ENTRY INTO THE GUILD!

440
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:23,873
I COULDN'T DO THAT!

441
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,376
THE SOURCE OF OUR POLITICAL
CLOUT AT THE ROUND TABLE

442
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,278
IS THE NUMBER OF
MEMBERS WE HAVE.

443
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,247
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE THE THIRD
LARGEST GUILD IN AKIHABARA.

444
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:32,882
WE CAN'T LOSE THAT.

445
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,151
IF WE DON'T TRY TO
KEEP OUR NUMBERS UP

446
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:38,621
