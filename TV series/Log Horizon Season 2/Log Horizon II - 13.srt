1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,637
(FESTIVAL CHATTER)

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,339
[MARIELLE] WOW, THEY'VE
REALLY GOTTEN INTO THE SPIRIT!

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,742
[HENRIETTA]
WELL, TODAY IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,711
WELL I'M GONNA GO ALL OUT!

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,012
(EXHALE)

6
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,372
[SERARA]
JEEZ, THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

7
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:48,875
TODAY'S LIKE PRICE
GOUGE CITY OUT HERE!

8
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,078
I GUESS EVERYONE'S TRYING TO BUY
SOMETHING FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

9
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,448
[NYANTA] WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MY GIRL, SERARA.

10
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,416
MISTER CAT!

11
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,384
IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, BABY?

12
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,788
[SERARA]
YEAH! IT'S JUST... I, UH...

13
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,390
[NYANTA] LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
EYEBALLIN' SOME COCONIA.

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,594
AND, LET ME TELL YOU, THIS
FRUIT RIGHT HERE IS SO GOOD,

15
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,264
THEY USE IT IN PIES, CAKES,
DRINKS, EVERYTHING SWEET, MMM!

16
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,499
[SERARA]
WOW! THAT'S REALLY AMAZING!

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,401
[SERARA, THINKING]
I ALREADY KNEW THAT...

18
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,771
AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
HAVE A SUPERSTITION

19
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,474
THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY
POSITIVELY SWEAR BY, HM.

20
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,745
IF YOU SERVE IT TO YOUR
SWEETHEART ON FEBRUARY 14TH,

21
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,813
TRUE LOVE WILL BLOOM!

22
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,381
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

23
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,585
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY BACK
IN THE REAL WORLD, TOO, HUH?

24
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,855
YES! YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
WELL, 'SCUSE ME...

25
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,923
I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED
SOME CHORES!

26
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,559
GOTTA GO! GOTTA GO!

27
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,926
(CHUCKLE)

28
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,704
(SLURP)

29
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,072
[TOYA]
MASTER NAOTSUGU...

30
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,007
CAN YOU HELP ME PRACTICE
SOME TANK POSITIONS?!

31
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,409
[NAOTSUGU]
HUH? OH, SORRY, LITTLE DUDE...

32
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,344
I GOT SOMETHING
GOING ON TODAY!

33
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,780
[TOYA]
WHAT?!

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,648
YOU GOT SOMETHING "GOING ON"
WITH MARIELLE.

35
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,385
THAT'S RIGHT... AFTER ALL,
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY TODAY!

36
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:05,919
HUH?

37
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,220
UH?

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,524
OH YEAH, IT IS. Y'KNOW
THAT REMINDS ME...

39
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,426
OF AN INSANE REQUEST
ASKED OF ME AGES AGO.

40
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,029
I BET YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT KANAMI! (GIGGLE)

41
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,599
[SHIROE] UH?
[TETORA] OH, COME ON NOW!

42
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,166
BOTH OF YOU WERE MEMBERS OF THE

43
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,335
TOTALLY LEGENDARY
DEBAUCHERY TEA PARTY, RIGHT?!

44
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,105
SO WAS I. EVER HEARD OF
PERSONAL SPACE? (PUSHED)

45
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,239
[TETORA]
FROM WHAT I HEARD,

46
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,841
KANAMI DIDN'T JUST
RUN THE PARTY.

47
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,611
SHE WAS, LIKE, SUPER SEXY AND
WAY POPULAR WITH ALL THE GUYS!

48
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,580
AND I ALSO HEARD SHE WAS
A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU!

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,380
ZAT RIGHT?

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,216
C'MON, LOVERBOY! FESS UP!

51
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,184
SHE WAS YOUR
SWEETHEART, RIIIGHT?!

52
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,886
AND YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER!

53
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,555
[SHIROE] UH...!

54
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:42,856
THAT'S KIND OF A STRETCH...

55
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,591
WE DIDN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.

56
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,827
[TETORA] REALLY? BUT I BET YOU
STILL LIKE HER, RIGHT?

57
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,662
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] WAIT!
WHO ON EARTH IS THIS WOMAN?

58
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,496
MY LORD IS USUALLY
CALM AND COLLECTED,

59
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,866
BUT SHE'S CLEARLY
GOT HIM FLUSTERED!

60
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,568
DOES HE HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER?

61
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,037
[MINORI, THINKING]
ANOTHER ANOTHER WOMAN?!

62
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,739
COOL IT, WILLYA?

63
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,841
YOU NEED TO PULL YOUR NOSE
OUT OF HIS BUSINESS.

64
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,576
STOP PESTERING HIM ALREADY!

65
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,712
EHEH! YOU KNOW REAL GIRLS
ALWAYS GOSSIP ABOUT SOMETHING!

66
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,348
[TOYA] DUDE! I CAN'T BELIEVE
MASTER NAOTSUGU

67
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,316
HASN'T FIGURED ALL THIS OUT YET!

68
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,053
[TOYA] I MEAN, YOU DO KNOW
THAT TETORA'S A GUY, RIGHT?

69
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,320
[RUDY]
YES, YES, OF COURSE.

70
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,356
I THOUGHT IT WAS
OBVIOUS BY NOW...

71
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,424
DO YOU THINK WE
SHOULD GO TELL HIM?

72
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,493
[RUDY] I'M STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT...

73
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,364
DO I CALL HIM "MISS" TETORA?
OR DO I CALL HIM "MR." TETORA?

74
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,432
YEAH I'M STILL TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHETHER I'M GONNA

75
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,536
CALL HIM "BIG BRO" OR
"BIG SIS" OR WHATEVER.

76
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,271
[TETORA] AND WHAT'RE YOU
TWO NOSIES TALKING ABOUT?!

77
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,741
HEY! WE REALLY WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT ANYTHING, BIG BRO‐STER!

78
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,376
[TETORA] WHAT...?
[TOYA] UH, SORRY!

79
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,178
MISS... TER... MA'AM, MISTER...
[TETORA] HUH?

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,947
HONESTLY WE'RE STUCK IN A
LITTLE BIT OF A MORAL CONUNDRUM

81
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,349
OVER HOW WE SHOULD
ADDRESS YOU PROPERLY.

82
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,485
LUCKY FOR YOU THERE'S ONLY
ONE ANSWER!

83
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,154
ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO SAY
IS TETORA‐BABY!

84
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,323
[BOTH] (NERVOUS LAUGHTER)
[TOYA] KAY...

85
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,958
[ISUZU]
UGH...

86
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,459
WELL THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT...

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,128
[NYANTA] NOW THERE'S
A SIGHT, HM.

88
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,462
[ISUZU] UH... OH...

89
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,198
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
I ACTUALLY SAW YOU HERE?

90
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,166
[ISUZU]
UH, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

91
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,503
WELL I'M BETTING IT'S
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

92
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,004
[ISUZU]
HERE'S THE THING...

93
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,607
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A
DESSERT WITH THESE BUT UH...

94
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,876
[NYANTA] OH, MY GOODNESS,
MORE COCONIA FRUITS.

95
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,279
YEAH! AND IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
TRYING SOMETHING CRAZY.

96
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,281
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A
LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL

97
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,550
THAT RUDY MIGHT LIKE.

98
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,018
[NYANTA]
OH REALLY... MMM.

99
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,554
[ISUZU] BUT I DON'T HAVE
THE CHEF SUBCLASS SO...

100
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,122
WHY DON'T WE TRY IT AGAIN

101
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,691
AND SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE
SOMETHING EDIBLE THIS TIME.

102
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,160
HUH? BUT IT'S JUST GONNA
TURN INTO A PUDDLE AGAIN

103
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,629
IF I PUT MY HANDS ON IT.

104
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,665
I HAVE JUST THE ITEM
FOR THE OCCASION, BABY!

105
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,501
THE NEWLYWED WIFE'S APRON DRESS!

106
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,970
A MASTER CHEF
ALWAYS HAS A SPARE.

107
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,138
ALRIGHT!

108
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,606
THE APRON DRESS WILL

109
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,542
LOWER YOUR BARDING
STATISTICS FOR A WHILE...

110
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,409
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'LL
GET THE ABILITY TO WHIP UP

111
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,311
A BUNCH OF DELICIOUS GOODIES!

112
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,013
[ISUZU]
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

113
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,883
WITH THIS APRON, EVEN I CAN
MAKE AN AMAZING DESSERT!

114
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,519
[NYANTA]
WOW, BABY... LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

115
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,954
SO UH, WHAT WERE YOU DOING

116
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,689
WALKING AROUND WITH
AN APRON DRESS THINGY.

117
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,091
IT WAS AN ITEM DROP
ON A QUEST.

118
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,661
AND NOW... Y'SEE...

119
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,429
IN CASE YOU'RE FEELING JUST A
LITTLE BIT RUSTY IN THE KITCHEN.

120
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,567
I'VE GOT AN EASY PASTRY RECIPE
THAT YOU CAN DO QUICKLY.

121
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,168
PEEL THE COCONIA FRUIT

122
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,838
AND CUT IT INTO HALF‐CIRCLES,
AND PUT THEM INTO BOILING WATER.

123
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,608
ONCE YOU CAN GET A SKEWER
INTO 'EM NICE AND EASY,

124
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,110
GO AHEAD AND TRANSFER 'EM
INTO A BOWL.

125
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,212
AND CRUSH THEM WITH
A WOODEN SPATULA

126
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,114
WHILE THEY'RE STILL
HOT AND GOOEY.

127
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,050
STRAIN IT NOW AND THEY'LL HAVE
THAT VELVETY TEXTURE

128
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,385
EVERYONE JUST DIES FOR.

129
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,087
OH I LOVE IT!

130
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:31,124
[NYANTA] ADD SUGAR, EGG YOLK,
WHIPPING CREAM AND BUTTER,

131
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,560
IN THAT ORDER AND THEN MIX WELL.

132
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,128
ONCE IT COOLS DOWN,

133
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,564
ROLL THE DOUGH BETWEEN YOUR
PALMS TO SHAPE THE PASTRIES.

134
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,067
BRUSH SOME MORE EGG YOLK
OVER THEM TO GET 'EM SHINY.

135
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,505
AND PLACE THEM IN THE
SALAMANDER‐PREHEATED OVEN.

136
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,140
ONCE THEY'VE BAKED TO
A GOLDEN BROWN...

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,678
YOU'LL HAVE MOCK SWEET POTATO
COCONIA PASTRIES! MHMMM!

138
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,981
AHHHH! IT SMELLS GREAT!

139
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,349
I'VE GOTTA FIND RUDY

140
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,851
AND GIVE THESE TO HIM
WHILE THEY'RE STILL WARM!

141
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,687
THANKS SO MUCH CHIEF,
YOU'RE THE BEST!

142
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,857
WELL NOW, I'M QUITE SURE
THIS DAY ISN'T OVER

143
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,326
MIGHT AS WELL CLEAN UP
FOR THE NEXT GIRL.

144
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,461
[MINORI, THINKING]
SINCE IT IS VALENTINE'S,

145
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,064
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GIVE SHIROE
SOME KIND OF PRESENT.

146
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,833
JEEZ! I'D BE TOTALLY EMBARRASSED

147
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,801
IF HE TOOK IT THE
WRONG WAY, THOUGH...

148
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,103
UH‐UH! I'VE GOT TO
GET HIM SOMETHING

149
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,639
OR IT'D BE REALLY WEIRD.

150
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,842
I MEAN, I'VE GOTTA SHOW HIM
MY APPRECIATION TODAY, RIGHT?

151
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,844
SHE WAS YOUR SWEETHEART,
RIIIGHT!?

152
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,345
AND YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH HER!

153
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,513
[SHIROE]
HUH?!

154
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,481
(WATER SLOSHING)

155
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,951
(SLIME GROANS)

156
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,222
(ANNOYED) KANAMI...

157
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,691
MMM... UH?
[TETORA] YOO‐HOO!

158
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,761
HEY TETORA, DO YOU
NEED ME FOR SOMETHING?

159
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,529
I'VE GOT SOME
INFORMATION FOR YOU,

160
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,730
YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT KANAMI?

161
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,766
WHAT... ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

162
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,401
COME ON! IT'S SO
OBVIOUS, AKATSUKI.

163
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,837
I'VE GOT THE DIRT ON HER
AND I KNOW YOU WANT IT!

164
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,908
(ANNOYED) OKAY. ASSUMING I WAS
INTERESTED, WHAT'S GOING ON?

165
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,878
[TETORA] (GIGGLE) CHECK IT OUT.
[AKATSUKI] HMMMM?

166
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,546
[TETORA] THIS IS CALLED A
"COCONIA FRUIT."

167
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,515
AND PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE
TOTALLY AWESOME POWERS

168
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,550
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

169
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,218
SO WHAT ARE THESE "POWERS"
SUPPOSED TO BE?

170
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,355
I DUNNO, YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT
THE FLAVOR TEXT TO FIND OUT.

171
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,926
[AKATSUKI] "COCONIA FRUIT: THE
PLANT IS NATIVE TO THE SOUTH.

172
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:16,963
IT CAN BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY
OF DISHES, FROM FOOD TO DRINKS.

173
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,399
ON VALENTINE'S DAY,
FEEDING THIS TO SOMEONE

174
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,668
MAY REVEAL WHAT'S
TRULY IN THEIR HEART."

175
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,904
HMM? SO WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

176
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,772
WELL YOU KNOW HOW
FLAVOR TEXT

177
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,474
IS ACTUALLY INFLUENCING
HOW THINGS WORK, DON'T YOU?

178
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,110
THINK ABOUT THAT
FOR A MINUTE...!

179
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,245
YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO
SHIROE'S IN LOVE WITH!

180
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,680
[AKATSUKI] HUH?

181
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,782
SO DO YOU WANNA SIT AROUND
AND JUST WONDER ABOUT IT?

182
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:36,983
OR WOULD YOU RATHER GIVE HIM
A LITTLE NUDGE

183
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,552
WITH SOME COCONIA FRUIT
AND FIND OUT

184
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,821
WHAT'S GOING ON FOR YOURSELF?

185
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,656
TOODLES!

186
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,725
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
COCONIA FRUIT...

187
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,895
[MINORI, ANGRILY]
COCONIA FRUIT...!

188
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,565
[HENRIETTA] I KNOW THE
APRON'S HELPING YOU...

189
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,667
BUT SERIOUSLY...

190
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,869
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THIS
AMBITIOUS IN THE KITCHEN?

191
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,804
THIS IS THE DAY
EVERY GIRL STEPS UP

192
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,573
AND DOES HER BEST
FOR HER MAN!

193
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,074
[HENRIETTA]
OH GOOD GRIEF MARIELLE?

194
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,678
HUH... JUST WHO IS SHE
BAKING FOR, ANYWAY?

195
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,046
[ISSAC]
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A MONTH

196
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,082
SINCE WE LOST THE MAGIC CIRCLE
AROUND THE CITY.

197
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,885
WE WERE EXPECTING
ALL HELL TO BREAK LOOSE.

198
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,754
[SHIROE] AKIHABARA HAS
ALWAYS TENDED TO ATTRACT

199
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,922
HIGH‐LEVEL ADVENTURERS...

200
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,792
ANY MONSTERS WITH DECENT
INTELLIGENCE STAY AWAY FROM US.

201
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,494
AND OUR PATROLS ARE HANDLING
ANY THAT CHOOSE OTHERWISE.

202
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,063
[ISSAC] NO ONE'S REPORTED
ANY PLAYER KILLINGS

203
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,498
TO THE ROUND TABLE
SINCE THEN, EITHER.

204
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,233
EINS WAS PULLING HIS
GREEN HAIR OUT

205
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,036
THINKING THERE WAS GONNA BE
ANOTHER RASH OF MURDERS.

206
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,506
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
GOING PRETTY WELL.

207
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,040
WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO
KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS

208
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,709
TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND...

209
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,944
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR
THEM OUT THERE.

210
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,980
YEAH, WE'VE GOT THAT COVERED:

211
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,883
ALL OUR BEST RAID GUILDS ARE
ROTATING THROUGH GUARD DUTY.

212
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,618
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR...

213
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,688
BY THE WAY, WHICH
GUILD'S ON DUTY TODAY?

214
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,189
THAT WOULD BE
THE WEST WIND.

215
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,423
HUH?

216
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,225
'COURSE I HAVEN'T
NOTICED 'EM OUT THERE.

217
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,360
I KINDA GET THE FEELING
WE WON'T BE SEEING MUCH OF THEM.

218
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,195
HM?

219
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,130
(SQUEALING GIRLS)

220
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,566
MASTER SOJIRO, PLEASE
ACCEPT MY FEELINGS FOR YOU!

221
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,935
HEY! I DON'T THINK SO!
I'M AHEAD OF YOU!

222
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,505
[NAZNA] COULD YOU PLEASE
CALM DOWN AND STAY IN LINE!

223
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,739
[SOJIRO] THANK YOU!

224
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,641
I PROMISE I'LL SAVOR EVERY BITE!

225
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,875
[DOLCHE] THAT'S ENOUGH

226
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,611
[GIRL] MASTER SOJI, THANK YOU!

227
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,747
[NAZNA] THAT'S RIGHT!
KEEP IT MOVING! WHO'S NEXT?!

228
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,481
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
NO ONE'S REPORTED SEEING

229
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,284
MASTER KRUSTY SINCE
THE INCIDENT WITH MISA.

230
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,620
OH HONESTLY!

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,354
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT
THAT MONSTER IS UP TO,

232
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,256
NO MATTER WHERE HE IS!

233
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,791
BUT I'M SURE IF HE FEELS LIKE IT

234
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,893
HE'LL JUST WALTZ THROUGH THAT
DOOR AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

235
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,428
[ELISSA] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA!
[RAYNESHIA] HUH?

236
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,831
YOU'RE STILL MILLING AROUND
IN THOSE BAGGY OLD PAJAMAS?

237
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,966
IT'S REALLY LATE IN
THE DAY FOR THAT!

238
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,702
WELL I DON'T HAVE ANY
"ROYAL" THINGS TO DO TODAY!

239
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,303
[ELISSA]
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, NOW...

240
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,773
CLOTHES CAN SET YOUR FRAME OF
MIND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

241
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,043
ANYWAY, ALL THE VENDORS WERE
SOLD OUT OF COCONIA,

242
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,045
SO I USED A LITTLE REPLACEMENT.

243
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,447
I THINK YOU MIGHT
LIKE THIS INSTEAD.

244
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,415
OH I'LL GIVE
IT A TRY THEN.

245
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,952
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
UGH,

246
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:56,422
IS THAT MAN EVEN TAKING HIS
OATH OF KNIGHTHOOD SERIOUSLY?

247
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,259
UH! OH WOW THIS
IS REALLY AMAZING!

248
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:02,128
[AKANEYA]
HOW IS IT WORKING FOR YOU?

249
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,397
[MISA] A LITTLE STRANGE,
BUT I'M GETTING USED TO IT.

250
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,966
[RIEZE]
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

251
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,602
[AKANEYA] WE CAN MAKE SOME
IMPROVEMENTS DOWN THE ROAD.

252
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,903
[RODERICK] I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO FIND MATERIALS

253
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,472
THAT WON'T PUT AS MUCH
STRAIN ON YOUR BODY.

254
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,975
[AKANEYA] THE RADIO MARKET
AND RODERICK MERCHANT GUILDS

255
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,110
ARE COLLABORATING
ON THE RESEARCH.

256
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,713
DON'T WORRY; I'M SURE
WE'LL WORK THIS OUT!

257
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,716
[MISA] I APPRECIATE ALL
YOUR HELP... BUT STILL...

258
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,950
WHERE DO YOU THINK MY ARM WENT

259
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,619
AFTER GETTING CAUGHT
IN THE VORTEX?

260
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,053
[AKANEYA] NORMALLY THERE
ARE HEALING SPELLS

261
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,922
THAT WOULD'VE
REGENERATED YOUR ARM...

262
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,857
SO I CAN ONLY FIGURE THAT
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOU

263
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,325
AND KRUSTY
IS NOT PART OF

264
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,260
THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING
FOR THE GAME.

265
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,897
OTHER THAN THE FACT IT
DISAPPEARED WITH KRUSTY...

266
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,600
I GET THE FEELING IT'S STILL
IN THE SAME ZONE WITH HIM,

267
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,535
WHEREVER THAT MAY BE.

268
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,605
[AKANEYA] OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE NEVER
SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

269
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,239
[RIEZE] YOU TRY TO
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

270
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,308
WHAT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON NOW
IS YOUR RECOVERY.

271
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,544
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
PICKING UP THE SLACK FOR YOU

272
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,979
UNTIL LORD KRUSTY RETURNS.

273
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,448
[MISA]
OKAY... THANK YOU FOR THAT.

274
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,886
[MISA]
MY LORD...

275
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,394
[MINORI] NYANTA!
[NYANTA] HM?

276
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,096
(GRUNT)

277
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,699
I GUESS I OVERDID IT, BUT Y'KNOW
THEY WERE REALLY CHEAP!

278
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,900
[NYANTA, THINKING]
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,536
THEY WERE NOT "CHEAP"?

280
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:16,670
[MINORI]
CHIEF!

281
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,071
YEAH, YEAH. I'M LISTENIN', BABY.

282
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,541
SINCE I ALREADY GOT
A BUNCH OF COCONIA.

283
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,710
I'D REALLY LIKE TO EXPRESS MY
GRATITUDE TO OUR GUILD MASTER

284
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,245
FOR THE WAY HE LOOKS AFTER US.

285
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,479
[NYANTA] MM‐HM...

286
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,948
IT'S... NOT WHAT YOU THINK!

287
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,851
IT'S NOT RELATED TO
VALENTINES AT ALL! UH?!

288
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,854
OH I THINK YOU'VE MAKE YOUR
FEELINGS PERFECTLY CLEAR.

289
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,590
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN WHIP UP
IN THE KITCHEN, ALL RIGHT?

290
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,725
THANK YOU CHIEF!

291
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,894
[AKATSUKI] EXCUSE ME,

292
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,929
AKATSUKI, REPORTING BACK
FROM A QUEST

293
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,965
THAT ALSO DOUBLED
AS TRAINING, SIR!

294
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,034
AS IT HAPPENS, THE REWARD WAS
NONE OTHER THAN COCONIA FRUIT.

295
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,670
AS SUCH I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
IF YOU WOULD TEACH ME...

296
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,273
THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE
REWARD ITEM FOR A QUEST.

297
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,475
[AKATSUKI] IT'S A PRESENT
FOR MY LORD! HUH?

298
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,643
[AKATSUKI]
MINORI...!

299
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,111
MISS AKATSUKI...?

300
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,146
(BREATH)

301
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,548
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
LOOKS LIKE SHE GOT HER HANDS

302
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,383
ON SOME COCONIA AS WELL.

303
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,852
[MINORI, THINKING] SHE WENT
OUT LOOKING FOR THEM, TOO?!

304
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,022
NO! WE'RE TRYING TO DO
THE SAME THING!

305
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,595
[NYANTA, THINKING]
THIS IS NOT GOOD, MYAH.

306
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,396
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN
SUCH A GRAVE THREAT

307
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,899
TO THE UNITY OF LOG HORIZON!

308
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,768
[TETORA, THINKING]
OH, GOD! THIS IS SO GOOD,

309
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,304
IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT MY
VERY OWN SOAP OPERA.

310
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,338
THAT'S MY CUE!

311
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,507
HELLO!

312
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,809
SINCE THE TWO OF YOU ARE
AFTER THE SAME THING...

313
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,143
WHY DON'T YOU TWO SETTLE IT

314
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,878
LIKE SOME SELF‐RESPECTING
FIRST CLASS LADIES!

315
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,747
GET TOGETHER AND MAKE
HIM SOMETHING NICE!

316
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,148
[BOTH]
TOGETHER, HUH?

317
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:38,051
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT
IDEA HAS A LOT OF MERIT,

318
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,120
BUT WE HAVE A LITTLE
PROBLEM, BABY.

319
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,388
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE APRON TO WEAR.

320
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,957
(GIGGLE)

321
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,728
WELL! LOOK AT WHAT MARIELLE
LEFT LAYING AROUND! UH‐WHOA!

322
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:48,929
[AKATSUKI]
NOW LET'S GET STARTED.

323
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:49,930
MASTER, PLEASE INSTRUCT ME.

324
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,064
[TETORA] A‐LA CUISINE!

325
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,232
[MINORI]
YEAH. ME TOO!

326
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,867
[NYANTA]
MIGHT AS WELL GET STARTED.

327
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,937
[TETORA] HURRAY!
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE MAIDENS!

328
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,039
JUST REMEMBER THAT THE WORLD
STILL REVOLVES AROUND ME,

329
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,440
ALL RIGHT YOU GUYS?!

330
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,475
[ISUZU]
THIS IS SO WEIRD!

331
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,345
WHERE ON EARTH COULD RUDY BE?

332
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,816
[ISUZU]
MMM...

333
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,886
ALL RIGHT. FINE!
GUESS I'LL GO HOME...

334
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,487
SORRY I KEPT YA!

335
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,989
HEY, NAOTSUGU!

336
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,559
YOU KNOW, UH...
TODAY'S VALENTINES...

337
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:19,693
[NAOTSUGU]
UH, YEAH.

338
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,828
EHEH! HANG ON A SEC...

339
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:25,832
OKAY, NOW. HERE YOU GO!
THEY'RE HARD CANDIES.

340
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,868
[NAOTSUGU] THANKS. AHEM,
(DEEPER VOICE) THANKS.

341
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,670
[SHORYU]
AGGHHH!

342
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,539
[MARIELLE]
NAOTSUGU, WELL...

343
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,510
TO BE HONEST, SOMETHING'S
BEEN ON MY MIND A LOT LATELY.

344
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,911
THE NEW GIRL IN YOUR GUILD.

345
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,913
UH... SHE'S KIND OF ADORABLE
AND CUTE AND GROSS...

346
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,414
BUT YOU KNOW... ANYWAY...

347
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,850
I GUESS I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YOU THIS FOR AWHILE.

348
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,418
[NAOTSUGU] MMM?! UHH...

349
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,154
[MARIELLE] WHAT DOES IT FOR YOU,
NAOTSUGU? WHAT DO YOU LOVE?

350
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,658
[NAOTSUGU] OH... I... LOVE...!
[MARIELLE] HUH?

351
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,993
[MARIELLE, THINKING]
HE LOVES WHAT?

352
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,461
[NAOTSUGU] P‐PAN‐!
[MARIELLE] HUH...

353
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,230
[NAOTSUGU]
‐N‐! YAHHH!

354
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,465
[MARIELLE] NAOTSUGU,
ARE YOU OKAY?! WHAT HAPPENED?

355
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,068
[SHORYU] ARE THE ROYAL GUARDS
BACK IN SERVICE OR SOMETHING?

356
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:05,872
UH, MISS AKATSUKI, DID YOU
JUST DISAPPEAR FOR A SECOND?

357
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,541
I'M A NINJA.

358
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,109
[MARIELLE]
REALLY!

359
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,077
HOW BIG OF A JERK CAN YOU BE?!

360
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,946
ALL HE HAD TO DO IS
JUST SAY LIKE...

361
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,315
"THAT QUESTION'S JUST A
LITTLE TOO PERSONAL."

362
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:15,982
HUH?

363
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,518
SHORYU...?

364
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,819
HEY THERE...

365
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,587
OH, HEY. WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME OF THIS?

366
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,123
I WOUND UP WITH A
LITTLE BIT EXTRA. HERE.

367
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,191
(GASP) ARE YOU SURE?!

368
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,694
[MARIELLE]
SEE YA AROUND.

369
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,063
GOD, SHE MAKES ME SO HAPPY!

370
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,465
[NAOTSUGU] WE'RE BAAACK!
[SHIROE] HELLO?

371
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,935
WHAT IN THE HELL WAS
THAT ANYWAY, MAN?!

372
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,503
WHAT WAS WHAT?

373
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,939
SOMEONE CAME OUTTA NOWHERE
AND KICKED ME IN THE HEAD!

374
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,707
[NYANTA]
WELCOME HOME, MYAH.

375
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,675
[SHIROE] HUH?
[NAOTSUGU] HM?

376
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,677
[NAOTSUGU]

00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,712
AWESOME! I'VE GOTTA TRY‐ AH!

378
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,380
[AKATSUKI]
NO, THIS ISN'T FOR YOU!

379
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,650
ALL OF THESE SWEETS ARE
A VALENTINE'S DAY GIFT

380
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,051
FOR THE GUILD MASTER.

381
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,152
[SHIROE]
ALL OF IT?

382
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,820
[NYANTA]
THAT'S RIGHT.

383
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,421
THE LADIES HERE WORKED TOGETHER

384
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,091
TO PREPARE SOME PASTRIES
SPECIALLY FOR YOU, SHIROE‐ECCHI.

385
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,893
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT?

386
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,028
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MADE
EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH.

387
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,532
THAT THEY DID. I MADE SURE
THEY HAD THE PROPER ATTIRE,

388
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,100
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT,

389
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,869
AND I SHOWED THEM HOW TO FIND
THEIR WAY AROUND THE KITCHEN.

390
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,470
AND I CHEERED THEM ON!

391
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,506
[TETORA] NOW C'MERE, LOVERBOY!
[SHIROE] HUH? WHA... WAUUUGHHH!

392
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:13,206
[TETORA] TAKE A SEAT!

393
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,575
[SHIROE] GWAH! OWAH...

394
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,209
(STARING)

395
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,411
[SHIROE, THINKING]
HOW DID I END UP IN THIS MESS?!

396
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:20,881
I STILL HAVE CAKE TRAUMA
FROM THE LAST TIME.

397
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,315
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD, PLEASE HURRY.

398
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,118
PLEASE ENJOY
THE CAKE WE MADE!

399
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,521
RIGHT, SURE THING.

400
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,855
REALLY APPRECIATE IT...

401
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,657
(CHOMP)

402
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,559
(HOLDING BREATH)

403
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,127
(CHEWS, SWALLOW)

404
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,762
[SHIROE]
THIS IS...

405
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:36,997
AMAZING! (HYPER MUNCHING)

406
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,331
ALL RIGHT!

407
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,433
AREN'T YOU GLAD HE
LIKES IT, AKATSUKI?

408
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,034
YEAH!

409
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,302
WAUUUGGHHHH!

410
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,504
[BOTH]
HUH?

411
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,705
HUH?

412
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,639
MM?

413
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:46,973
SHOWTIME!

414
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:48,108
UHH...

415
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,475
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
THIS IS IT...!

416
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,744
[MINORI, THINKING]
THE COCONIA FRUIT'S SPECIAL

417
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,245
VALENTINE'S DAY POWER...!

418
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,115
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHERE
HIS TRUE LOVE REALLY LIES!

419
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,416
ASK HIM! ASK HIM QUICK!

420
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,184
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
OKAY, FINE.

421
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,320
SO WHAT EXACTLY
SHOULD I ASK HIM?

422
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,723
[MINORI, THINKING] WHAT IF
SHIROE IS IN LOVE WITH AKATSUKI?

423
00:17:02,823 --> 00:17:04,691
I'M NOT SURE I
WANT TO KNOW THAT!

424
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,260
I CAN'T.
I'M TOO SCARED TO ASK!

425
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,130
WHAT WOULD I DO IF
MY LORD SAID KANAMI?

426
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,366
AND WHO IS THIS
KANAMI ANYWAY?

427
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,901
NEVERMIND.

428
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,369
I HAVE NO QUESTIONS
FOR SHIROE.

429
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,871
[ISUZU] I CAN'T FIND
RUDY ANYWHERE!

430
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,541
HE'S NOT AT ANY OF
OUR USUAL SPOTS.

431
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,743
AFTER ALL THE TRAINING
WE DID TODAY...

432
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,011
I AM FREAKIN'
STAVING TO DEATH.

433
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,513
AH, I'M HUNGRY!

434
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,315
WHAT'S FOR DINNER TONIGHT?
WHAT'RE WE EATING?

435
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,553
I AM IN LOVE WITH
CURRY AND RICE!

436
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:35,255
(ALL GASPING)
(NYANTA CHUCKLES)

437
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,424
OKAY... TELL US SOMETHING
WE DON'T KNOW, PAL.

438
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,494
HUH? DID I SAY
SOMETHING JUST NOW?

439
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,596
HOW ABOUT THIS...

440
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,565
WHY DON'T WE MAKE UP
A GIANT BATCH OF CURRY.

441
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:48,635
OH WOW... YOU LIKE CURRY
BETTER THAN GIRLS, GUILD MASTER?

442
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,972
IT COULD'VE BEEN
A LOT WORSE...

443
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,374
THAT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN FOR THE BEST.

444
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,010
HUH?
AH!

445
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,478
[NYANTA]
YOU BROUGHT THESE FOR ME?

446
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,815
RIGHT! I SAW THEM FOR
SALE IN THE MARKETPLACE,

447
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,150
AND THOUGHT THEY
WERE REALLY CUTE.

448
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,688
[SERARA, THINKING] I WANTED
TO MAKE A TREAT FOR HIM...

449
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:10,791
... BUT THE COCONIA FRUIT
WERE ALL SOLD OUT.

450
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,025
AND NOBODY WAS SELLING

451
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,895
A NEWLYWED WIFE'S
APRON DRESS ANYWHERE.

452
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:15,962

[NYANTA, THINKING]
THE STEMS ON THESE FLOWERS

455
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,134
ARE COVERED IN THORNS.

456
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,538
POOR GIRL WENT THE EXTRA MILE
TO PICK THESE FOR ME...

457
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,607
THAT WAS REALLY
THOUGHTFUL, LITTLE LADY.

458
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,942
AH... WE'RE GETTING
TOGETHER TONIGHT

459
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,310
FOR SOME CURRY AND RICE...

460
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,378
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME
JOIN US FOR DINNER,

461
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,514
SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME?

462
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,849
YEAH?! YOU
REALLY MEAN IT?

463
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,017
MOST DEFINITELY!

464
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,852
THANKS A LOT, MISTER CAT!

465
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,320
CAN I HELP IN THE KITCHEN?

466
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,856
[NYANTA]
OH YEAH. SURE. YOU BET.

467
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,325
AHHH... I CAN'T WAIT!

468
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,127
[RUDY]
I'M HOME!

469
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,829
[ISUZU]
RUDY... WHERE WERE YOU?

470
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,430
I COULDN'T FIND YOU ANYWHERE!

471
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:53,433
[RUDY] OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT!
I HAD SOME ERRANDS.

472
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,702
[ISUZU] WELL I GUESS IT'S OKAY.
THIS IS FOR YOU!

473
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,839
SO WHAT'S THIS?

[ISUZU] MOCK SWEET POTATO

475
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,644
[ISUZU] I KNOW WE HAVEN'T
HAD DINNER YET, BUT TRY ONE.

476
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:04,477
I MADE THEM MYSELF!

477
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,179
THAT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU!

478
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,481
I'LL JUST HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY.

479
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,719
OH WOW! THIS IS SO GOOD!
THANKS, ISUZU! (CHEWS)

AH! YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,421
[RUDY]

WHAT'S UP? HEY... RUDY?
(RUDY GURGLES)

483
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,862
I LOVE EVERYBODY I'VE EVER
WORKED WITH IN THE GUILD!

484
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,496
[AKATSUKI]
OKAY, THEN.

485
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,767
GUESS THE CONFESSIONS AREN'T
LIMITED TO ROMANTIC LOVE.

486
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:27,834
MM...

487
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:28,969
(EXHALE) YEAH WELL,

488
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,671
I LOVE WORKIN' WITH

489
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,806
[RUDY](LAUGHING)
WELL OF COURSE YOU DO!

490
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,675
[NAOTSUGU] SO WHAT'S
GOTTEN INTO THOSE DORKS?

491
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,942
[SHIROE]
I DUNNO...?

[NUREHA]
SHIROE...

494
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,397
[INTIX]
PRINCESS NUREHA...

495
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,266
I SEE YOU'RE SLEEPING
ON THE FLOOR AGAIN...

496
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,768
WHAT IS IT, INTIX?

497
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,138
LET ME GUESS, YOU WERE
JUST THINKING ABOUT SHIROE.

498
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,807
UH?

499
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,474
I KNOW YOU WERE.

500
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,945
PLEASE DON'T TALK
TO ME ABOUT HIM.

501
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,413
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

502
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:15,549
I'VE TOLD YOU MANY TIMES.

503
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,784
HE DOESN'T CARE FOR PEOPLE.

504
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,854
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM.

505
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,523
HE ISN'T EVEN A REAL PLAYER.

506
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:26,560
HE'S NOTHING MORE THAN
HIGHLY COMPETENT NOISE.

507
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,029
THE MAN IS A TRAITOR
TO ALL HE STOOD FOR,

508
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:33,499
NO MATTER HOW CLEVER HE IS,
OR HOW HONORABLE HE ACTS.

509
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,203
BESIDES MY DEAR, YOU KNOW
HE CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

510
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,841
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE WANT
SUCH A DIRTY LITTLE GIRL?

511
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,476
WHEN YOUR FILTH IS THE
ONLY THING ABOUT YOU

512
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,279
THAT DISTINGUISHES
YOU FROM ANYONE ELSE?

513
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,748
[NUREHA]
STOP IT!

514
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,282
HUH?

515
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,318
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR
EXISTENCE IS A LIE.

516
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:56,289
TAKE IT ALL AWAY AND
YOU ARE NEXT TO NOTHING.

517
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,659
HIDE THAT PRETTY LYING
FACE OF YOURS,

518
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,229
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS JUST
AN EMPTY, ROTTEN SHELL.

519
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,366
YOU'RE AN ABOMINATION.
FIT FOR NO ONE.

520
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,069
AND YOU DESERVE YOUR LONELINESS.

521
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,136
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

522
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,872
GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

523
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,774
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

524
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,208
NOBODY WANTS YOU!

525
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,743
AND NOBODY EVER WILL!

526
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,945
YOU BETTER REMEMBER
THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE

527
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,313
THAT EVER WANTED YOU,

528
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,983
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER WILL WANT YOU,

529
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,351
DESPITE YOUR
SOILED LITTLE HEART.

[INTIX] YOU'RE THE PERFECT
PRINCESS FOR THE MASSES

532
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:32,025
TO VIEW FROM A DISTANCE,
LIKE A BIRD IN A CAGE.

533
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,694
IT'S TIME THAT YOU REALIZED...

534
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,297
THE DAYS OF YOUR PAMPERED
PRINCESS LIFE ARE LONG GONE.

535
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,500
REMEMBER WHAT OUR
GOALS ARE, MY DEAR...

536
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,569
YOU ARE GOING TO GATHER

537
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,506
A BUNCH OF BLIND BLATHERING
PUPPETS AND CREATE A KINGDOM.

538
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:50,143
AND THIS TIME I SHALL OBTAIN THE
YAMATO SERVER IN ITS ENTIRETY.

539
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,546
THAT WAS THE DEAL WE
STRUCK, WAS IT NOT?

540
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,448
YOU ARE GOING TO CREATE
A PLACE TO CALL YOUR OWN?

541
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:56,750
[NUREHA] UM... UH‐HUH.

542

[INTIX] THE TEN SEAT
CONFERENCE IS BEGINNING.

543
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,286
I'M SURE YOU
DON'T WANT TO MISS IT.

544
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:04,090
IT WOULDN'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT
EVERYONE'S FAVORITE FIGUREHEAD.

545
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,226
FEEL FREE TO JOIN US.

546
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,696
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO
CLEAN YOURSELF UP FIRST.

547
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:13,767
[NUREHA, THINKING]
YOU'RE WRONG, INTIX...

548
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,537
I HAVE SOMETHING FAR GREATER

549
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:19,906
THAN ANY PACT
I'VE MADE WITH YOU...

550
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,441
I'VE GOT HIM...

551
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,644
[SHIROE] I CAN GIVE YOU WHAT
YOU WANT MORE EFFECTIVELY

552
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,946
AS A FOE THAN I CAN AS A FRIEND.

553
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:29,015
SO WHENEVER YOU DECIDE
WHAT YOUR REASON IS...

554
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,652
I WILL BE YOUR ENEMY.

555
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,122
[NUREHA]
I MADE A PROMISE...

556
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:39,526
THE BIGGEST PROMISE
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE!

557
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,797
AND I'LL KEEP IT, FOR HIM...

[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
THIS IS THE CHINA SERVER.

THE APOCALYPSE

ALL ACROSS THE WORLD.

561

AMIDST THAT CHAOS,
THERE IS SINGLE ADVENTURER

WHO GATHERS COMRADES AND
FIGHTS TO PROTECT OTHERS.
