1
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:05,443
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD... WHAT'S GOING ON?

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,346
[SHIROE]
THEY'RE ALL PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

3
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:12,417
[SHIROE] SHE'S SLEEPING?
THEY'RE ALL SLEEPING!

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:14,920
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,889
HMM... WINGS...
GLITTERING... A MOTH... MM

6
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:22,093
[REGAN]
"GLITTERING... WINGS"?

7
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:58,389
[SHIROE] WE'RE TAKING CARE OF

8
00:01:58,489 --> 00:01:59,724
THE FIFTY‐FOUR
PEOPLE OF THE LAND

9
00:01:59,824 --> 00:02:01,960
WHO HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP
AT THE GUILD BUILDING.

10
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,062
[RIEZE] THE SAME THING
HAPPENED IN MAIHAMA.

11
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:07,232
AND LORD SERJIAD STILL
SLEEPS AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

12
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,367
I TALKED TO SILVER SWORD,

13
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,969
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
THIS IN SUSUKINO.

14
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,072
SO BASICALLY IT'S ONLY PEOPLE
OF THE LAND WHO ARE AFFECTED?

15
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,741
[RODERICK] YES. THEIR MAGIC
POINTS DROP TO ZERO,

16
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,677
AND THEIR RESTORATION CAN'T
COUNTERACT THE DRAIN.

17
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:22,914
[MICHITAKA] WHICH MEANS THIS
THING DRAINS MAGIC POINTS.

18
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:25,883
ACCORDING TO A WITNESS,
IT LOOKED LIKE A MOTH

19
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:28,920
EXCEPT REALLY HUGE AND
WITH GLITTERING WINGS.

20
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,256
SO WE'RE DEALING WITH
SOME KIND OF SPIRIT MOTH?

21
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:35,726
I DON'T REMEMBER THE GAME HAVING
A MONSTER SUCH AS THIS ANYWHERE.

22
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,663
NEITHER DO I, BUT IT'S HERE.

23
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:41,099
AND WE NEED TO TIGHTEN
OUR DEFENSES UP, QUICK.

24
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,034
[EINS] WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT
SHIBUYA? [SHIROE] HUH?

25
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,269
[SOJIRO]
SHIBUYA?

26
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,603
[EINS]
I HEARD RECENTLY,

27
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:47,005
REGAN REPORTED THAT SHIBUYA'S

28
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,840
OLD RADIO AND TELEVISION
CENTER IS STILL WORKING.

29
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:52,643
[EINS] SHOULDN'T THAT BE OUR
HIGHEST PRIORITY, MASTER SHIROE?

30
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,346
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE LET
THE MOTH RUN LOOSE?

31
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:57,148
THIS MIGHT BE COLD OF ME,

32
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,251
BUT IF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
ARE THE ONLY ONES ASLEEP...

33
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:01,452
EINS, NO!

34
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:03,488
[EINS]
LOOK. THESE ARE DESPERATE TIMES.

35
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:04,956
YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT.

36
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:07,192
FIRST, THERE WAS THE ROGUE
ROYAL GUARD INCIDENT,

37
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:10,795
THE EMPOWERING OF FLAVOR
TEXT AND NOW, THIS?!

38
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:14,332
THERE ARE RUMORS OF THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND PREPARING FOR WAR.

39
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:17,435
HOW MUCH OF THIS ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO LET HAPPEN, MARIELLE?

40
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,604
[WOODSTOCK] LOOK, I UNDERSTAND

41
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,539
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.
HOWEVER...

42
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,542
[MICHITAKA] YEAH. EVEN IF WE CAN
GO HOME, IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN

43
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:27,045
JUST PACK UP AND
LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

44
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:28,313
RIGHT, SHIROE?

45
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,015
[SHIROE]
YES, I AGREE.

46
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:31,716
MM?

47
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,419
[SHIROE] BUT WE CAN'T JUST
IGNORE WHAT'S GOING ON, EITHER.

48
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,822
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED AND LET'S
COME UP WITH SOME OPTIONS.

49
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,498
[AKATSUKI] THERE AREN'T
MANY PEOPLE OUT TODAY.

50
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:49,767
[SHIROE]
THE MOTH IS ON EVERONE'S MIND.

51
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:52,903
(EXHALE)

52
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:59,911
[TOYA] NGHHH!
[MINORI] TOYA?

53
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,712
[TOYA] WHAT DID CHIEF
NYANTA HAVE TO SAY?

54
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,714
THAT WE'RE GOING OUT
ON PATROL TONIGHT...

55
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,417
AND THE CHIEF TOLD ME THAT
HE'LL BE COMING OUT WITH US.

56
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:07,585
I SEE.

57
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:08,819
[MINORI]
IT TURNS OUT NONE OF

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,288
THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND WHO FELL ASLEEP

59
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,823
ARE SHOWING ANY SIGNS
THEY'RE GONNA WAKE UP SOON.

60
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,759
[TOYA]
WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD.

61
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,996
I WOULD IF I COULD.

62
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,901
(EXHALE)

63
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,337
[RUDY] YOU THINKING ABOUT YOUR
HOME AGAIN? [ISUZU] OH...!

64
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,638
HEY RUDY.

65
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:28,974
[RUDY]
YOU KNOW, I WAS GIVING ALL OF

66
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,875
THIS SOME THOUGHT...
I DON'T THINK ALL

67
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:34,045
THAT MUCH WOULD CHANGE BETWEEN
US IF YOU WENT BACK HOME.

68
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:36,915
BUT IF I DO, WE MAY NEVER
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

69
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,917
[RUDY] IF YOU HAVE A
PLACE TO CALL HOME,

70
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,219
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
TRY TO GET THERE.

71
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,688
I GUESS MAYBE WHAT
I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

72
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,157
NOT EVERYONE HAS A
PLACE TO GO BACK TO.

73
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:47,258
(EXHALE)

74
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,960
[ISUZU]
RUDY...

75
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:55,433
[NYANTA] ALRIGHT, IT'S TIME
FOR US TO START OUR PATROLS.

76
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:59,404
[SHIROE] MM‐HM! NYANTA, KEEP AN
EYE ON EVERYONE FOR ME, OKAY?

77
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:00,838
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE!
[SHIROE] UH?!

78
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,607
[TETORA]
OVER THERE! LOOK!

79
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:03,808
[NAOTSUGU]
THEY'RE COMING RIGHT AT US!

80
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,044
IT'S A SWARM OF
THOSE MOTH‐JERKS!

81
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,380
[SHIROE]
ETERNAL MOTHS?

82
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,218
(TERRIFIED)

83
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,819
[SHORYU]
THERE'S SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS!

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,621
[MARIELLE]
THIS IS REALLY BAD YOU GUYS.

85
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,257
[HENRIETTA]
I DO NOT LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS.

86
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,195
[ISAAC] HOLY CRAP...! MAN,
DO I FREAKIN' HATE BUGS!

87
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,271
[KAZUHIKO]
THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

88
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,073
[DINKURON] ALL THE SCALE
DUST FROM THESE MOTHS

89
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,142
IS GETTING PAST THE
CITY'S MAGIC CIRCLE!

90
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,709
[WILLIAM] JUST KEEP
ATTRACTING THEM.

91
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,745
PUSH THEM BACK
OUTSIDE THE WALLS!

92
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:41,980
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] THEY'RE ABOUT
TO BREACH

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,314
THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER!

94
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,416
[WILLIAM] SECOND UNIT,
COVER THE OTHER SIDE!

95
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:46,451
[PROROCCA] ROGER THAT!

96
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,618
[WILLIAM] DON'T YOU NEED TO BE

97
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:49,220
GETTING BACK TO YOUR
WIFE, DEMICAS?!

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,089
[DEMICAS] UWAH! I'VE
GOT HER IN CHARGE

99
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,024
OF EVACUATING THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND!

100
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:58,096
I'M NOT LETTING A SINGLE MOTH
GET PAST ME! NOT ON MY WATCH!

101
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,866
[WARRIOR]
ALL THE ROYAL GUARDS ARE ASLEEP!

102
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,334
[KAZUHIKO] WHO COULD'VE THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

103
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:06,404
LAUNCHING AN ATTACK FROM
OUTSIDE OF THE ZONE.

104
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:09,374
GET THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND
EVACUATED NOW! [ALL] YES SIR!

105
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,643
THIS IS GOING TO GET
REAL UGLY, REAL FAST.

106
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:15,013
[SERARA]
MARIELLE, OVER HERE TOO!

107
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,748
[HENRIETTA]
ADVENTURERS NOW?!

108
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,750
[MARIELLE] SO IT'S NOT
JUST PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

109
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,686
[SHORYU] WE NEED TO
FIND COVER RIGHT AWAY!

110
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:22,787
[SHIROE]
RUN!

111
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,790
GO! GET TO THE GUILD BUILDING!

112
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,797
[AKANEYA] SO NOW ADVENTURERS
ARE FALLING TO THESE THINGS?

113
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,199
[SHIROE] THE SCALE
DUST IS THE KEY.

114
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,800
ANYONE WHO COMES INTO
CONTACT WITH IT

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,969
IS VULNERABLE TO THE
SLEEPING SICKNESS.

116
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,605
PERHAPS, THE LOSS OF MAGIC
POINTS IS

117
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,908
CAUSING THE SOUL TO
EVACUATE THE BODY.

118
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,376
ALMOST LIKE A "SOUL
EXPULSION DISEASE."

119
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:48,213
[MARIELLE] MAYBE, BUT NOT
EVERYONE HAS PASSED OUT.

120
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:49,880
[RODERICK] I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO DETECT

121
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,616
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THOSE WHO FALL ASLEEP

122
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,384
AND THOSE WHO DON'T, BUT...

123
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:55,620
[AKANEYA] IS THERE A
CHANCE OF DYING FROM THIS?

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,854
[RODERICK]
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

125
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:58,556
SO ANYONE WHO PHYSICALLY DIES

126
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:00,325
CAN COME BACK AT THE CATHEDRAL.

127
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:03,161
IN THAT CASE, SLEEPING LIKE
THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE WORSE.

128
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,063
(PING)
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

129
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,065
[SOJIRO, VOICE CHAT]
BAD NEWS, SHIROE. I THINK...

130
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:08,799
I THINK I FOUND THEIR NEST.

131
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,635
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT]
OKAY, SO WHY'S THAT BAD?

132
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,237
[SOJIRO] IT'S IN SHIBUYA.
[SHIROE] UH?

133
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,239
[SOJIRO]
BETWEEN US AND THE TRANSMITTER.

134
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,241
THE CITY'S BEEN
TURNED INTO A DUNGEON

135
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,775
AND THAT'S NOT THE WORST OF IT.

136
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,945
[SHIROE]
SO WHERE EXACTLY IS THE NEST?

137
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,913
[SOJIRO] THE OLD TV AND RADIO
CENTER,

138
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,349
THE ENTIRE COMPLEX
IS A RAID ZONE NOW.

139
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,652
I TOOK A LOOK AT THE FLAVOR
TEXT, IT'S CHANGED.

140
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:29,787
NOW IT'S THE
"FORTRESS OF CALLS."

141
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,589
[REGAN]
AH, AND THIS IS?

142
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,993
[RODERICK] A PROTOTYPE BASED ON
HOW SCREEN‐CAPTURE USED TO WORK.

143
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,327
JUST BE CAREFUL.

144
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,129
IF YOU TRY USING IT FOR
MORE THAN TEN MINUTES,

145
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:41,166
THE WHOLE THING'LL BLOW UP ON
YOU AND THAT'D RUIN YOUR DAY.

146
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,534
[SHIROE] WHOA. DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE THIS LAST WEEK.

147
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:47,005
[AKANEYA] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A
MAGIC SEAL ON THE ENTRANCE.

148
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,839
[REGAN] PERHAPS THE "ANTENNA"
DEVICE IS

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,375
ACTUALLY A HOMING BEACON

150
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,677
BRINGING ALL THOSE MOTHS
DOWN FROM THE MOON,

151
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:55,213
ALONG WITH THEIR
EGGS AND COCOONS.

152
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,848
FROM THE MOON, THAT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

153
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,117
[MICHITAKA] THERE ARE SOME
OBSERVERS ON THE MOON

154
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:00,618
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONTACT,

155
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:03,388
WE'RE HOPING THEY HAVE A
FEW ANSWERS FOR US UP THERE.

156
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,456
DON'T THOSE "GENIUS" OR
"COLLECTOR" MONSTERS

157
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:07,025
HAVE A BASE THERE TOO?

158
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,160
[MARIELLE] I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO
SAY THAT THOSE ETERNAL MOTHS

159
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,296
ARE ALSO A TYPE
OF GENIUS AS WELL.

160
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:14,032
BUT WHY WOULD THEY TAKE MP
IF THEY DON'T USE MAGIC?

161
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,201
[SHIROE] ROE2'S LETTER
STATED THAT GENIUSES ARE

162
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:20,505
IN THE PROCESS OF HARVESTING
SOMETHING CALLED "EMPATHIUM."

163
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:24,142
I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANT AT TIME, BUT...

164
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,811
[RIEZE] IS IT POSSIBLE
EMPATHIUM IS OUR MP?

165
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,846
IT APPEARS THAT
COULD BE THE CASE.

166
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,848
[AKANEYA] THE ETERNAL MOTHS
HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP

167
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,717
AT THE SAME TIME OVER
THE LAST TWO DAYS.

168
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,452
THEY'VE BEEN
TIMING THEIR ATTACKS

169
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:35,886
ALONG WITH THE MOON RISE.

170
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:38,523
BOTH OF THE ASSAULTS TOOK
PLACE AT 18 TO 22 HOURS.

171
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,825
AND WE CAN PROBABLY COUNT ON
THE SAME THING HAPPENING AGAIN

172
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:42,860
AT THE SAME TIME TONIGHT.

173
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,829
FIRST THEY TOOK OUT PEOPLE
OF THE LAND,

174
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,431
THEN WENT AFTER THE ADVENTURERS.

175
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,633
AND THERE'S MORE EACH
TIME THEY ATTACK.

176
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,302
THIS MIGHT BE UNPOPULAR,
BUT DESTROYING THE ANTENNA

177
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:53,238
COULD BE THE BEST WAY
TO GET RID OF THEM.

178
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:56,174
ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THAT'S THE
ONLY ANTENNA ON THE SERVER!

179
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,977
YES... AND ACCORDING
TO ANCIENT LEGEND,

180
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:00,578
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS
ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS

181
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:03,314
WE COULD USE TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE HEAVENS.

182
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:06,384
IT MIGHT VERY WELL STOP THE
MOTHS, BUT WITHOUT THE ANTENNA,

183
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,819
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
CARRY OUT SHIROE'S PLAN.

184
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,088
[EINS]
WHAT...?

185
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:11,856
[MARIELLE]
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SERVERS?

186
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,358
[MICHITAKA]
I DON'T KNOW.

187
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,162
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
INFORMATION ON OVERSEAS SERVERS.

188
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,430
[RODERICK] AND BESIDES, IT'S NOT
LIKE WE CAN GUARANTEE

189
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,967
THEY'LL WORK, EVEN IF
WE COULD GET THERE.

190
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,168
[AKANEYA] IT CAN'T BE IGNORED...

191
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,569
OR FINDING ANOTHER WAY TO
COMMUNICATE

192
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:27,138
WITH THE MOON WILL BE THE
LEAST OF OUR PROBLEMS.

193
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:30,241
I SUPPOSE WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO LEAVE IT BE FOR NOW.

194
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,876
(EXHALE)

195
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:35,613
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S
THE PLAN THEN?

196
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:37,648
THE OLD COMPLEX IS A RAID ZONE.

197
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,051
LAUNCHING AN ASSAULT FROM THE
OUTSIDE TO DRAW THEM AWAY

198
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,453
ISN'T GOING TO BE AN OPTION
FOR US AT THIS POINT.

199
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,322
WE'LL NEED TO GO IN BY
WAY OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE

200
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:48,226
AND ENGAGE POCKETS OF RESISTANCE
EN ROUTE TO THE ANTENNA.

201
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,728
I'LL GET A RAID TEAM
TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY.

202
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,117
[AKANEYA] SOME PEOPLE
ON THIS TEAM HAVE

203
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:13,551
PRETTY LOW STATS, YOU KNOW.

204
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,353
[SHIROE] YES, BUT I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD USE THE PEOPLE

205
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:18,123
WHO STAYED AWAKE DURING
THE LAST ATTACK.

206
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,225
I KNOW THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY A GUARANTEE,

207
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,427
BUT IT'S OUR BEST
BET, I'M AFRAID.

208
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:23,828
[MICHITAKA] YOU MIGHT
BE BETTER OFF IF YOU

209
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,563
SCOUTED IT OUT BEFORE GOING IN.

210
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,998
WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

211
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:30,168
THAT'S ONE HELL OF A
RISK, MASTER SHIROE.

212
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:32,770
[REGAN]
SORRY I KEPT YOU WAITING!

213
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,838
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?
[TETORA] OH...!

214
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,140
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU'RE COMING TOO?

215
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,441
[REGAN]
YES, INDEED.

216
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,143
THE ENTRANCE TO THE FORTRESS
OF CALLS SEEMS

217
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,410
TO HAVE A SPECIAL
SEAL THAT WOULD

218
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,279
OTHERWISE KEEP YOU
FROM GETTING IN.

219
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,348
SO MASTER SHIROE
ASKED ME TO TAG ALONG

220
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:45,050
SO THAT I COULD
REMOVE IT FOR YOU.

221
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,052
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY
REASON YOU'RE COMING.

222
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:48,653
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

223
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:51,856
IT'S THE FIRST TIME AN EVENT
LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED.

224
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:54,459
AS MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE, IT IS
MY DUTY,

225
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,928
AND A RESPONSIBILITY I RATHER
ENJOY. [TETORA] HEH.

226
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,030
WELL MAKE SURE YOU
STAY OUT OF THE WAY...

227
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,399
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL
BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOU.

228
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,501
[REGAN] I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT IF I WERE YOU...

229
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,737
IN MATTERS SUCH AS THIS,
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

230
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,241
[KINJO] ALL FACILITIES
HAVE CEASED FUNCTIONING.

231
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:13,344
AND I HAVE HEARD ABOUT
SHIBUYA AS WELL.

232
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,947
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THE
ADVENTURERS RESPOND...

233
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,283
I WISH YOU THE BEST.

234
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,052
[SHIROE] PLEASE LOOK AFTER
THE CITY FOR USE, KINJO?

235
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:23,354
[KINJO]
BE CAREFUL, MASTER SHIROE.

236
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:24,755
[SHIROE]
OH UH, AND EINS.

237
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:25,790
[EINS]
YES?

238
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,358
I'M CONFIDENT

239
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,528
THAT YOU WILL KEEP YOUR FAITH
IN US THROUGH THE END OF THIS.

240
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:32,297
(EXHALE)

241
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:35,333
[SHIROE] OUR TARGET IS THE RAID
ZONE INSIDE THE SHIBUYA DUNGEON,

242
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,635
THE FORTRESS OF CALLS.

243
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:38,937
IF WE DESTROY THE ANTENNA,

244
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:41,506
THAT SHOULD KEEP ANY MORE
ETERNAL MOTHS FROM SHOWING UP.

245
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,309
WE MAKE SURE WE DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE COMPANY...

246
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,144
THEN WE TAKE OUT THE REST.

247
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:46,945
[AKATSUKI] UH...

248
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,546
[MINORI] OH...

249
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:50,515
[NAOTSUGU] MPH...

250
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:53,784
LET'S FINISH THIS
BEFORE MOONRISE!

251
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:09,334
[RIEZE] SIX HOURS AND
THEN THE MOON COMES UP.

252
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:11,469
[MINORI]
IVE GOT EIGHT MOON RABBITS

253
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,271
FROM THE FORMER DOGENZAKA
DIRECTION!

254
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:15,073
AVERAGE LEVEL 91!

255
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:16,274
[SHIROE] KEEP THEM IN CHECK AND

256
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,243
MAKE FOR THE FORMER
CENTER‐GAI STREET!

257
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:19,544
[RIEZE] SIX MORE RABBITS,

258
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:21,379
EACH FROM TWO O'CLOCK
AND TEN O'CLOCK!

259
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,813
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I DON'T LIKE THIS...

260
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,849
IT'S A LITTLE TOO CONVENIENT
THIS HAPPENS RIGHT

261
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,052
WHEN WE START TRYING TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THE MOON.

262
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,153
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE!
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD!

263
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:29,220
[AKATSUKI]
SOME UP AHEAD OF US!

264
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,321
[NAOTSUGU]
WE GOT NINE MORE!

265
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,957
HEY! PARTY 2 DRAW

266
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,358
THE MONSTER IN FRONT!

267
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,127
[SHIROE] PARTY 1 FRONTLINE!
GO FORWARD AND...

268
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,164
WAIT! SPLIT UP THE
BUNCH IN THE REAR!

269
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:40,932
[BOTH]
HYAHHHHH!

270
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,201
MR. RICHO AND TOYA,
BACK UP PARTY 1!

271
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,735
[BOTH]
ROGER!

272
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,137
YUZUKO! YOU AND MISS OLIVE

273
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:47,872
GO AND SUPPORT
THE OTHER PARTIES!

274
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:50,675
PARTY 4 FRONTLINE, I NEED YOU TO
MAKE A PATH FOR US! [ALL] ROGER!

275
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,443
[KURINON] IS THAT
YOUR FRIEND MINORI?

276
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,379
SHE'S SO CUTE AND ADORABLE!

277
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,047
[RUDY] YOU CAN THANK A LITTLE
MAGICAL SPELL CALLED

278
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:57,615
THE FULL CONTROL ENCOUNTER.

279
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:59,684
[ISUZU] SHE LEARNED IT
DIRECTLY FROM SHIROE HIMSELF.

280
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,652
THERE'S TOO MANY OF THESE
STUPID MOON RABBITS!

281
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:03,354
[MARIELLE] HANG ON!
[NAOTSUGU] AH...!

282
00:13:03,454 --> 00:13:05,323
[MARIELLE] GIMME A MINUTE,
NAOTSUGU AND YOU'LL BE FINE.

283
00:13:05,423 --> 00:13:07,558
[TETORA] HEY! IF YOU
WANNA GET YOUR POWER UP

284
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:10,261
AND STAY STRONG, JUST LET
TETORA‐BABY DO THE HEALING.

285
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:11,496
[SHIROE, THINKING]
IF THEY'RE READING US,

286
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:13,264
WE'RE PLAYING RIGHT
INTO THEIR HANDS.

287
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,900
OLIVE, FALL BACK TO THE
REAR! NO! NO WAIT! RICHO'S

288
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,936
RIGHT FLANK'S EXPOSED!
[OLIVE] ERK! HUH? WHAT? AH...!

289
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,004
[RICHO] BE CAREFUL.

290
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:20,005
[SHIROE]
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?!

291
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,306
[SHIROE]
UH, SORRY...

292
00:13:21,406 --> 00:13:22,673
[SHORYU]
MASTER SHIROE!

293
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:23,841
WE GOT MORE ENEMIES!

294
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:26,544
NOW THEY'RE COMING AT US
FROM EIGHT O'CLOCK!

295
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,213
[ISUZU] SHIROE! I'VE GOT A
MINOTAUR OVER HERE!

296
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:29,647
[RUDY] WELL I WAS
NOT EXPECTING THAT!

297
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:31,749
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL
IT AN AMBUSH, RUDY!

298
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,385
[ISAMI] WAAAAHHHH!
[KURINON] OMIGOD, OMIGOOOD!

299
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:36,221
[SHIROE, THINKING] AT THE RATE
WE'RE GOING WE'RE NEVER GONNA

300
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,956
FIND OUT HOW TO GET BACK HOME!

301
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,958
[HENRIETTA] MASTER SHIROE?!
WE'VE GOT TWO MINOTAURS

302
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:41,592
OUT HERE! WHAT DO WE DO?!

303
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,794
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT] UH... FORCE
YOUR WAY UP THE FORMER SPAINZAKA

304
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:45,430
WITH PARTIES 2 AND 4 AT THE
CENTER! [SOJIRO] HYAHHHH!

305
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,732
(SERARA GASPS)
[NYANTA] HANG ON! I'VE GOT YOU!

306
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,367
[SERARA]
CHIEF NYANTA!

307
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,203
[REGAN] OH, MY! I'VE NEVER
SEEN A MELEE LIKE THIS BEFORE!

308
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:54,905
IT IS MOST UNUSUAL IF
I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

309
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:55,806
(GROWLING)
EH?

310
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,075
OH DEAR HEAVENS!

311
00:13:57,175 --> 00:13:58,609
[NAOTSUGU]
WATCH IT, OLD TIMER! HYAHH!

312
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:01,746
PARTY 1, YOU NEED TO FALL BACK
AND FOCUS ON YOUR HEALING!

313
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,215
[SHIROE, THINKING] THERE IS NO
WAY I CAN LEAVE THIS WORLD

314
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:07,385
BEHIND. NOT WITH
THE SHAPE IT'S IN!

315
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:08,553
[SHIROE, VOICE CHAT]
KEEP YOUR RANKS STRAIGHT

316
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:10,088
AND PUSH FORWARD, PEOPLE!

317
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,190
NO. TURN RIGHT AT
THE NEXT CORNER!

318
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,591
[KOZARU]
DOES HE KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING?!

319
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,593
[NAZNA] HE'S USUALLY A
LOT BETTER THAN THIS.

320
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,996
[SOJIRO] IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAD A
CHANCE TO DO A LOT OF SCOUTING.

321
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,830
WE'VE JUST GOTTA SUCK IT UP.

322
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,166
[HENRIETTA]
WHATEVER...

323
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,600
[RIEZE]
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

324
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,901
[MINORI]
HUH?

325
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:26,304
MY LORD TOLD ME HE WAS AN
OUTSTANDING STRATEGIST.

326
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:29,307
I WAS EXPECTING A
LITTLE MORE FROM HIM.

327
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,575
MPH.

328
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,246
[TOYA] SO THIS IS THE
FORTRESS OF CALLS...

329
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,515
[RIEZE]
FOUR HOURS, SEVEN MINUTES.

330
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,351
[REGAN] THIS REALLY IS A
COMPLICATED SEAL, ISN'T IT?

331
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,553
AND THERE! SORRY FOR THE WAIT!

332
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,722
[BOTH]
AW YEAH! NICE PANTIES!

333
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,824
[TETORA]
WAY TO GO, MISTER CREEPY GUY!

334
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,427
[REGAN] I'M MERELY A CONDUIT
FOR MY AWESOMENESS!

335
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,662
[SHIROE] LET'S GO.
[BOTH] ROGER!

336
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,731
[SHIROE, THINKING] WE DID MANAGE
TO USE SOME MYTHICAL BEASTS

337
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,267
AND FIND OUT A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THE LAYOUT.

338
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,403
BUT WE'LL STILL NEED TO
TAKE THE FLOORS ONE BY ONE

339
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:00,305
TO GET ALL THE WAY
UP TO THE ROOF.

340
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:02,773
EACH PARTY'S REARGUARD
WILL NEED TO BE READY.

341
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:04,409
(ROAR SQUEALS)

342
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,646
[SOJIRO] VOTIVE SWORD,
KOGARASUMARU! HWAH!

343
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,883
[OLIVE] OH, COME ON! I
CAN'T SEE MASTER SOJI!

344
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:14,819
[YUZUKO] ENEMY CONTACTS!
SIX MOON RABBITS!

345
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,056
[ISAMI] I'M NOT LETTING MASTER
SOJIRO HAVE ALL THE GLORY!

346
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,225
SAMURAI'S CHALLENGE!

347
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:23,028
OH WOW! I COULD
GET USED TO THIS.

348
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:24,629
LADIES... IN COMBAT.

349
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:27,532
ALL OF YOU GUYS SURE DO LIKE
EACH OTHER, DON'T YOU?

350
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:29,500
[ISAMI] OF COURSE WE
ARE. WE'RE GUILDMATES

351
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,470
[KURINON]
OH, AND SO MUCH MORE! WHOO!

352
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,372
[REGAN]
OMIGOODNESS!

353
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:35,773
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU ALL RIGHT, GRANDPA?

354
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,708
YES, I'M FINE. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT ME.

355
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:40,011
[RUDY] ALL THE PASSAGES
LOOK THE SAME TO ME!

356
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,513
[ISUZU] THIS MAZE COULD TAKE
US SOME TIME TO GET THROUGH.

357
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:43,814
[SHORYU]
ANOTHER DEAD END?!

358
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,616
[HIEN]
IT'S BLOCKED OFF BY COCOONS!

359
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,418
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, IT'S
BLOCKED OFF OVER HERE!

360
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,420
[TETORA] I CAN'T SEE THROUGH IT!
[MINORI] MASTER SHIROE!

361
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,357
THE WEST CORRIDOR IS
SWARMING WITH MOON RABBITS!

362
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,025
[SHIROE, THINKING] AS FAST AS
WE'RE MOVING, WE'RE

363
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,860
GONNA WIND UP BURNING
THROUGH OUR MAGIC POINTS.

364
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,562
NO, WAIT A SEC...

365
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,897
[SHIROE] EVERYONE! BACK TO THE
FIRST FLOOR! [NAZNA] HUH?!

366
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:02,733
WHAT?! BUT WE'VE
ALREADY GOTTEN SO FAR?

367
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,701
YOU SURE?

368
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,371
[SHIROE]
BACK TO THE COURTYARD, NOW!

369
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,474
AS LONG AS WE KEEP AN
EYE ON THOSE DOORS,

370
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,542
WE CAN FUNNEL THE MONSTERS
INTO A KILL ZONE.

371
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:14,445
TAKE TURNS. THAT'LL LET
EVERYONE RECOVER THEIR MAGIC.

372
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,248
[HIEN] I'D STILL BETTER
IF THIS WAS A SAFE ZONE.

373
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:19,384
[SHORYU] THE RAID MOB
LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH...

374
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,552
I WASN'T REALLY COUNTING
ON IT BEING THIS TOUGH.

375
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:22,988
(RIEZE GASPS)

GETTING A BREAK.

383
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,667
[KUSHIYATAMA] OH COME ON,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE IT

384
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:37,802
ANY OTHER WAY
WOULD YOU?!

385
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:39,237
[KOZARU] AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT

386
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:40,671
I WAS TEAMING UP WITH
MISS VANGUARD DUTY

387
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,507
I KNEW I WAS GONNA
WIND UP LIKE THIS.

388
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,642
WHY AM I ALWAYS FIGHTING
FOR MY LIFE AROUND YOU?!

389
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:47,946
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME I'M
BAD LUCK OR SOMETHING, ZARU?

390
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:49,147
Y'KNOW WHAT I THINK...

391
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,315
YOU'RE PROBABLY THE REASON

00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,256
DOES IT HURT? YOU
WANNA SEE MY UNDIES?

443
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:41,859
[REGAN] I'M GOOD. I'M NOT
SURE HOW THAT WOULD HELP. HEH.

444
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,096
[TETORA] MARIELLE, THANKS FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME BACK THERE.

445
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:48,733
[MARIELLE] HM? DON'T YOU WORRY.
IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO YOU HAVING

446
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:52,003
MORE MAGIC POINTS THAN I DO. YOU
WOULD'VE DONE THE SAME FOR ME.

447
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,804
[KOZARU] MAN, I
HAVEN'T BEEN IN A RAID

448
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:55,941
THIS TOUGH IN A LONG TIME.

449
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,043
[NAOTSUGU] GET OFF HER,
YOU LITTLE PARASITE!

450
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:58,643
[SHIROE] UM!

451
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:00,011
[BOTH] HM?

452
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:03,915
HEY GUYS, I'M SORRY.

453
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:08,987
MASTER SHIROE...

454
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:14,859
[HENRIETTA]
MASTER SHIROE.

455
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,626
HM?

456
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,295
(SLAPPING)
[BOTH] OH...

457
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,035
OH, MISS HENRIETTA?

458
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,770
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD...

459
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:32,743
(EXHALE)

460
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:36,247
[MINORI]
(GASP) UM, MASTER SHIROE!

461
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:40,118
WE DECIDED, WE'RE GONNA STAY
IN THIS WORLD, NO MATTER WHAT!

462
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,386
[SHIROE]
HUH...?

463
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:42,587
[MINORI]
WE KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED.

464
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:44,789
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
GETTING BACK.

465
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:47,058
YOU'RE WORRIED IF WE BREAK
THE ANTENNA WE WON'T GET HOME,

466
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,227
OR WE'RE GONNA BE
STUCK IN A WAR.

467
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,963
IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T WANT TO
GO BACK HOME, MASTER SHIROE.

468
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:55,100
BUT WE HAVEN'T MADE UP OUR MINDS
ABOUT IT EITHER. [RUDY] MM‐HM.

469
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,335
SO IF WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME
TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT,

470
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,870
THAT MAY NOT BE A BAD THING,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

471
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,539
YEAH! THE ANTENNA
CAN'T BE THE ONLY WAY

472
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,508
TO FIND OUR WAY BACK HOME.

473
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,243
BESIDES, Y'KNOW,

474
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:08,346
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND LIKE THIS.

475
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:12,250
SERIOUSLY,

476
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,020
WHEN WE WENT TO SAPHIR,
WE WEREN'T A LOT OF HELP.

477
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,287
[SHIROE]
OH...

478
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,556
[TOYA] EVEN IF THEY WERE
GRATEFUL FOR WHAT WE DID,

479
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,059
SOME PARTS OF THAT TOWN
WON'T EVER RECOVER.

480
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,894
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'LL BE
ABLE TO GO BACK HOME AGAIN.

481
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:26,864
BUT IF WE DO, IT SHOULD BE
A JOYFUL THING, RIGHT?

482
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,068
FOR BOTH OF US AND THE ONES
WHO WERE ALREADY HERE.

483
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:32,971
WE CAN WAIT TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN CAN'T WE?!

484
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:34,272
(GASP)

485
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:37,275
IT'S OKAY TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT
CHOICE, WE'RE WITH YOU.

486
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,878
IF YOU CAN'T DO TWO THINGS AT
ONCE, DON'T. DO WHAT YOU CAN.

487
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:43,281
[MINORI] KNOWING WHO WE CAN
REALLY HELP ISN'T EASY...

488
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,417
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU
DO IT YOURSELF, MASTER.

489
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:49,187
WE'RE GONNA HELP YOU, ALL OF US,

490
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,622
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET US!
PLEASE, MASTER!

491
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:53,624
HUH?

492
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:55,393
SO WHADDYA SAY?
(CHUCKLING)

493
00:20:55,493 --> 00:20:57,028
SHIROE‐ECCHI.

494
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:58,296
BUT STILL...

495
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,598
[AKATSUKI]
DON'T WORRY.

496
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:03,534
I GUARANTEE MY LORD
WILL BE JUST FINE.

497
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,236
[SHIROE]
AKATSUKI...

498
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:07,005
HMPH.

499
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:09,407
(PING)
[RIEZE] YES, IT'S ME.

500
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:11,842
[WOODSTOCK, VOICE CHAT]
OH, THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE SAFE.

501
00:21:11,943 --> 00:21:13,544
THE TELEPATHIC LINK
WASN'T WORKING,

502
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,313
SO I GOT WORRIED
AND CAME TO SEE‐

503
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,215
HMM? HANG ON A SECOND!

504
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,717
THERE'S SOMEONE IN
FRONT OF THE ANTENNA!

505
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:22,753
HE'S TOO FAR AWAY TO
SEE HIS STATUS BAR.

506
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,022
BUT I'VE GOT MY GUESS.

507
00:21:24,122 --> 00:21:26,357
[RIEZE]
UNDERSTOOD. MR. WOODSTOCK,

508
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,658
PLEASE RETURN TO AKIHABARA AND

509
00:21:27,758 --> 00:21:29,460
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO STRENGTHEN
OUR DEFENSES.

510
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,129
[SOJIRO]
A RAID BOSS...

511
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:33,464
[ISAMI] HE WASN'T THERE WHEN
WE INVESTIGATED BEFORE, RIGHT?

512
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,367
[NAZNA] MAYBE HE DOESN'T GO INTO
ACTION UNTIL THE MOON COMES UP?

513
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,768
[OLIVE]
HE CONTROLS THE MOTHS?

514
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,105
[KURINON]
UGH, I HATE HIM ALREADY.

515
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:42,573
[MARIELLE] WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON DEFEATING THAT JERK!

516
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:43,641
[TETORA] THEN MAYBE
THE MOTH'LL FLY BACK

517
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:44,976
TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM!

518
00:21:45,076 --> 00:21:46,377
[NYANTA] YOU REALLY
THINK THESE CATS ARE GONNA

519
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:47,678
MAKE IT THAT EASY?

520
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,847
MAYBE, A LOT OF THINGS
AROUND HERE STILL ACT

521
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:52,350
LIKE THE GAME IN
THE WEIRDEST WAYS.

522
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,119
[SHIROE]
THANK YOU, HENRIETTA.

523
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:57,422
[HENRIETTA] UH? YOU'RE VERY
WELCOME, MASTER SHIROE.

524
00:21:57,522 --> 00:21:59,724
[SHIROE]
THE ANTENNA, MAGIC POINTS,

525
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:01,692
AND A RAID BOSS, HUH?

526
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,128
[NYANTA]
YEAH...

527
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:03,761
[NAOTSUGU] MM‐HM.

528
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:04,729
[TETORA]
AH!

529
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,597
(PLEASED)

530
00:22:06,697 --> 00:22:08,166
[RIEZE] EVERYONE, WE'RE
DOWN TO 34 MINUTES,

531
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,834
THAT'S NOT A LOT OF
TIME FOR US TO...

532
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:12,903
[SHIROE] IT'S MORE THAN
WE'LL NEED. [RIEZE] HUH?!

533
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:14,705
[SHIROE] I WAS TRYING TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN THIS WORLD

534
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,741
AND THE ANTENNA TO
GET US BACK HOME.

535
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,477
AND ULTIMATELY, THAT'S
AN IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE.

536
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,646
SERIOUSLY. TRYING TO PICK ONE
OVER THE OTHER WOULD

537
00:22:21,746 --> 00:22:23,448
BE AN ACT OF FUTILITY.

538
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,116
SO WE DON'T MAKE THAT CHOICE!

539
00:22:25,216 --> 00:22:26,952
WE'LL JUST TEAR OUR WAY
THROUGH EVERYTHING

540
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:28,819
THAT TRIES TO STOP US,
YOU GOT IT?!

541
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,989
WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE,
BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING THEM BOTH!

542
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,891
THE ANTENNA AND THIS WORLD.

543
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:35,893
MPH.

544
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,265
[SHIROE]
WE CAN DO IT.

545
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:43,334
WE'LL GET WHAT WE WANT AND
DO IT ON OUR TERMS.

546
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:17,929
[AKATSUKI, VOICEOVER]
THE COUNTERATTACK HAS BEGUN.

547
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,266
HIS GLASSES GLEAM. HIS
STRATEGIZING, INGENIOUS.

548
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:23,768
WITH HIS TRUSTWORTHY
COMRADES AT HIS SIDE,

549
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,303
THERE IS NO MORE WAVERING.

550
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:29,040
SHIROE WILL PROTECT IT ALL.
IT'S THE ONLY ANSWER.

551
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,809
THE BATTLE TAKES SHIROE
TO A FINAL DESTINATION,

552
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,379
WHERE HE RESOLVES TO
TAKE ON A NEW QUEST...

553
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:37,182
[SHIROE]
THE HORIZON IS NOT THE LIMIT!
