[KASUMI grumbles]

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this score.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.188 position:50% align:center
Hey, a 22 is ny-ot that bad!
It's a pretty cute number!

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Flunking out isn't cute at all!

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.401 position:50% align:center
Now, now. What's done is done,

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
and besides, we should
be happy the term's over!

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Yeah! Because
our summer vacation

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.782 position:50% align:center
finally starts tomorrow!

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.452 position:50% align:center
Which means our
training camp also starts!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
So, get excited, girls!
It's gonna be great!

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.498 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.385 position:50% align:center
We're having the
training camp...

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.595 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
...on campus?

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.350 position:50% align:center
I thought we'd be at a villa
by now, not stuck at school.

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Our club doesn't
have that kind of money!

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
Besides this has all
the amenities we need!

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
It was intended to serve as
an overnight training facility,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50% align:center
so it even has beds!

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
I present exhibit A!

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
How nice!

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think this is going
to be a really good time!

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Rina Board
is officially excited!

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.871 position:50% align:center
I'm glad! Though, practice
won't start till tomorrow.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
So, food takes priority for now!

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50% align:center
It smells good!

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.506 position:50% align:center
The cheese dip and
veggies are ready!

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
Dessert is looking tasty, too!

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50% align:center
Uh? What in the world
is that smell?

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:02.182 position:50% align:center
Come and see!

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
Do you want a little taste?

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
Um. Sure.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.650 position:50% align:center
So, whacha think?

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.278 position:50% align:center
Wow! That unbelievably yummy?

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
[RINA sputtering]

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
O-kay! Fried chicken wings
are served!

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
[YU]
That's one awesome spread!

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Thank you for the food!

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.874 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Yum!

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center
It's buono! Wow!

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
Aww, thank you!
It's a specialty of mine!

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.136 position:50% align:center
I even made the crust
from scratch!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] This dip is just
bursting with flavor!

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Oh! Make sure you try
some crackers with it, too!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.936 position:50% align:center
Good call!

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.063 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's not...

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
The color's strange, but it
has a really nice, mild taste!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.570 position:50% align:center
That makes me so happy!

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
I snuck something
in to make it yummy.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Okay! It's time for everyone

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:06.663 position:50% align:center
to treat yourself
with something sweet!

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
Feels more like a "fun" camp
than a "training" camp,

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
if you ask me!

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.009 position:50% align:center
We should keep the party going

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
by doing this for
breakfast tomorrow!

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:24.264 position:50% align:center
Oh! Eggs over rice might
be fun to make together!

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
I love eggs over rice. I'm game.

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.727 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I say we make
omelets, fried eggs,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.855 position:50% align:center
and egg sandwiches, too.
A full-on eggstravaganza!

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'd love that!

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
That sounds good!

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.318 position:50% align:center
Wanna know what sounds good?

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
Doing what we came here for.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
Don't forget the whole
point of this camp

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.949 position:50% align:center
is to get in some extra
practice so we can

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:46.119 position:50% align:center
perfect everything we need
to for our concert.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
Concerts are great.
I love the vibes.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
Just like at Diver Fes.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
Ah! I can't wait to stand on
a stage as awesome as that one!

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
And when that time
finally comes,

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.465 position:50% align:center
I'll use my irresistible
charm to make everyone

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50% align:center
fall in love with me!

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.053 position:50% align:center
And I'll be able to confidently
and honestly express myself!

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.971 position:50% align:center
Could we use a bed?
Cause I wanna

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
lie on top of it
for one of our songs.

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.183 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm stoked, too!

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
It's my chance to show
how punny I can be!

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.812 position:50% align:center
This may sound unusual
but what if we

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
did a dance with everyone
holding hands?

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.274 position:50% align:center
Let's stream it if we do.

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
So we can connect
in more ways than one.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
My Diver Fes performance
was great.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
But I'm gonna step it
up a notch next time.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
And as for me, I can't wait to
shout my love with everyone!

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
Just standing on stage...

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.457 position:50% align:center
The thought alone's enough to
make my heart completely burst!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.210 position:50% align:center
You know, you really
are all different.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps, laughs]

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.839 position:50% align:center
[YU] But I think that'll be
what makes your concert

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.591 position:50% align:center
a great one.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
You're such a melting
pot of personalities

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
that you can't help but be
inspired by each other.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.
We're all unique solo idols,

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
but we're still a team. And with
so much variety in our group,

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
I just know whatever
we put together

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.191 position:50% align:center
will make Nijigasaki proud!

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.361 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be great!
I just know it will!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
Hey! What kind of act do
you wanna see the most?

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hm... Honestly,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.705 position:50% align:center
I wanna see all of your
performances the most.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
Every last one.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
[YU sighs]
I ate way too much.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.796 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
we washed dishes together at
our grade school summer camp.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:25.051 position:50% align:center
So, this isn't the
first time for us.

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
[YU] Oh, yeah. That night
we had curry, right?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Heh! Wrong!

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
The time you're thinking
of was in middle school.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
[YU] Oh. Well, guess you're my
cleaning partner for life!

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Guess so!

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] "For life" means that
we'll be always be together.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
Yep, forever. So, you'll
take care of me, right?

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
Granny Ayumu?

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
Yu! Of course, I will!

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.375 position:50% align:center
Wow! There's so much
makeup to choose from!

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
Different kinds for whatever
suits the mood you're in.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.087 position:50% align:center

[KASUMI]
Hey, first-years.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU, RINA]
Uh?

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
You two, follow me! Come on.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I thought Yu would be in here.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.021 position:50% align:center
Wonder where she went off to.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Hm? Oh! She left her phone?

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
Well, Shizuku, Rina, and Kasumi
went somewhere else, too.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
Which drives me crazy
since we should be

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
resting up for tomorrow's
practice session.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
I'll go and look
for them, okay?

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm gonna go with her, Ai.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.459 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Okay!

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center

[RINA grunting]

00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI screams]

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.099 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU screams]

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]
Ow...

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs] What the heck
are you three doing?

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Oh, that sounds fun!

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
It's scary, not fun, so
get with the program already!

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Oops, my bad.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.827 position:50% align:center
I don't think you're
all that scary, though.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
Gotta step up your
spooky game, kay?

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
That's true.
Production value's important!

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
And now that I've got
a better look at you,

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.211 position:50% align:center
your make up looks
totally awesome!

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Heh! It got Kasumi's
approval, too!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.092 position:50% align:center
If there was a ghost role,
she thinks I'd get the part!

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.885 position:50% align:center
Aw, what a nice thing to say!

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.804 position:50% align:center
Kasukasu sure knows how
to get everyone pumped!

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
Why do you people keep
using that stupid nickname?

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
I believe this calls for
a little punishment.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.979 position:50% align:center
You made the mistake
of crossing our path,

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.940 position:50% align:center
so don't think
you'll get off easy!

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
They're all so amazing.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:50.864 position:50% align:center
And, they all know
what they want,

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
which keeps them
moving forward. I wish I...

Do you have permission to be
here, second-year Yu Takasaki?

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.928 position:50% align:center
Huh? Waa!

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]
That was a joke.

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
Jeez! Did you have to scare me?

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50% align:center
You know, that sounded
even better than last time.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.314 position:50% align:center
Mm, I still have a ways to go.

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:08.149 position:50% align:center
Practice makes perfect, right?

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.860 position:50% align:center
I hope that saying
works for me, too.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
I mean, I had to practice
singing and dancing

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
over and over.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Over and over. Huh.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
Good point! Practice applies
to all sorts of things we do!

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
That's right!

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.672 position:50% align:center
You and I have talked
in here before.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
Do you remember that?

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
I had no idea then,

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
but that was kind of a
pivotal moment for me.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
You're the reason I'm
a school idol today!

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
You said a lot of things
I needed to hear.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.353 position:50% align:center
You made me realize I
could do what I love.

00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
That never would have happened
if it weren't for you.

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
So thank you for accepting me
and letting me know

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.653 position:50% align:center
it's okay to be
selfish sometimes.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
Ah, it's no big deal.
And truth be told,

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.159 position:50% align:center
I just wanted
to hear you sing again.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.452 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]

00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.912 position:50% align:center
Whenever you or
the other girls sing,

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
I get energy like you
wouldn't believe!

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:09.169 position:50% align:center
And at that music fest, the
atmosphere was even better!

00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
I could feel the passion all
around me right down to my core!

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
And the stage was
so captivating,

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.884 position:50% align:center
I couldn't tear my eyes away!

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
But then, that feeling stopped.
It was all over so fast.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
Do you really mean it?

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
I never realized that
was how you saw us.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Oh?

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
It's interesting to
hear your perspective

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.400 position:50% align:center
since the only view idols have
is from up on the stage.

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
Listen, whenever you discover

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
the thing you're
passionate about,

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:40.950 position:50% align:center
I wanna support you
the way you supported me!

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
My passion?

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Yes! You'll find
something you love,

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.581 position:50% align:center
just like we did.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.087 position:50% align:center
[YU] You know, walking around
the school at night

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
makes it feel
completely different.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.924 position:50% align:center
I was actually thinking
the same exac--

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Where'd she
wander off to?

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.477 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] How about this one
next? That's pretty!

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.944 position:50% align:center
[KARIN giggles]
Good eye, Kanata!

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
Should we try it out on you?

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.823 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Ooh! I like that one!

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
What's going on?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
Mwaaah-ha-ha-haaa!

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hm?

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Hm?

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hm?

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?
Do you need something?

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[GROUP screaming]

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
Um... What the--?

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] This is a training
camp, not a haunted house!

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.178 position:50% align:center
So, keep the goofing off
to a minimum!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
Having a minimum means we can
goof off a little bit, right?

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It does!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
So, there's no need to
get so uptight over it.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
I beg your pardon?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
[GROUP whimpers]

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we have a pretty
big day ahead of us tomorrow,

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:56.067 position:50% align:center
so let's get some sleep.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.193 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same.

00:12:57.277 --> 00:13:00.405 position:50% align:center
[exhales] Okay then.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.717 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI laughing]
I'll show you fear

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.219 position:50% align:center
the likes of which
you've never--

00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:31.019 position:50% align:center
I'm Setsuna, the Scarlet Storm
don't mess with me, kay?

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
She did that in her sleep!

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
[RINA] We should go ahead
and get some shuteye, too.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Just three more laps!

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:05.345 position:50% align:center
All work and no play makes
Kasumin a super-mega dull girl!

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:09.432 position:50% align:center
[AI] Oh, yeah? In that case, you
should get a load of my Aidea!

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm Ai! Get it? Heh!

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA panting]

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
Setsuna's it first,
so better run while you can!

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] She won't catch me,
that's for sure!

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:25.573 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Running and playing
tag aren't the same thing!

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
But doing this is the
fun way to workout!

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
Yep! I say we divide
and conquer!

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:32.580 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!

00:14:32.664 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
Does not! Training
is what sounds good!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
Lighten up a little, will ya?

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.294 position:50% align:center
Playing tag still
requires us to run.

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.046 position:50% align:center
I don't see any harm.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA grunting]
Wait! Ai!

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Don't just stand there!
You're on our team!

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Quick! They're coming!

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
Heh. You'll have to
work a little harder

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.018 position:50% align:center
to catch me, girls.

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
You're not getting away!

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.605 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI chuckles]

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Come on! What's the rush?

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.192 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Not so fast!

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU laughs]

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.319 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Wait up!

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
[KARIN chuckles]

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:08.491 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, Kanata?

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
How can she sleep like this?
Come on, time to wake up.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
I gotcha.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:19.461 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Now who's got who?

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.671 position:50% align:center
Yep. She fell for it so now I'm

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
holding her in the club
room for safe keeping.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Roger!

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center
This stinks, that was like the
oldest trick in the book, too.

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center
Just when things were
getting interesting.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.648 position:50% align:center
Shinonome?

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
And Touou.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.701 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.724 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.144 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
She's so cool!

00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Oh, yeah!

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.981 position:50% align:center
Not sure who she is,
but I'm officially a fan!

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[YU] They had no clue
who Karin was. None.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.445 position:50% align:center
Most people there probably
didn't even know

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
school idols existed.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
All they knew was they
liked what they saw,

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
which made them
want to cheer for her.

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
That's what really made
that concert so amazing.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:38.498 position:50% align:center
Everyone there had different
tastes in music,

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
but for one moment in time,

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:45.255 position:50% align:center
both the audience and performers
shared a love for school idols.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
Look! We finally
caught everybody!

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
Nice work. As per usual!

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
Best part is everyone
still got a great workout,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.015 position:50% align:center
so we're all winners!

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.766 position:50% align:center
I'm covered in sweat.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's okay.
Our next activity will help.

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.983 position:50% align:center
Good thing everyone
came prepared

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
and brought a bathing
suit with them, huh?

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] I see you decided to
pack a super cute swimsuit too.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:10.822 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
Well, you just never
know. Besides, I mean...

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
Better safe than sorry.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:18.163 position:50% align:center
Let's go!
What're we waiting for?

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] That swimsuit looks
great on you! I like it a lot!

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Really?

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Is swimming wearing
you out more than usual?

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Maybe...

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Ha! Take that! No mercy!

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Cut it out, Ai! I'm unarmed!

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I got it!

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA, SHIZUKU laughing]

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:43.563 position:50% align:center

Yeah, just like that.

Rina Board can only stare.

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center

There!

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering, laughing]

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.823 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I've been thinking.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
[YU]
What about?

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.534 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] If things had
worked out differently,

00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:59.245 position:50% align:center
we might be getting ready
for prep school this summer.

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
That's true.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.250 position:50% align:center
But still, we ended up
together anyway.

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:05.919 position:50% align:center
Sure did.

00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Do you remember the day

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.382 position:50% align:center
we decided we'd join
the School Idol Club?

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yeah. How could I forget?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I was so happy when
you said you'd be with me

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.013 position:50% align:center
every step of
the way as I chased

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
after my school idol dream.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50% align:center
Happier than you even know.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
But it's not just a dream
anymore. That's right.

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
You found the courage you needed

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
to turn your dream
into a reality.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[YU] And the reason
we ended up together

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
is because you asked me
to help you do that.

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.408 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Mm-hm.

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.618 position:50% align:center
Although, it's not just us.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
Before we even knew it,
our circle got bigger.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:43.707 position:50% align:center
But the one common interest

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
we all share is how much
we love school idols.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
And that's a love that
packs some real power!

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.756 position:50% align:center
Ayumu, thank you.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
I'll try and find
my courage, too.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.012 position:50% align:center
And do as much as
I can in the moment.

00:18:57.095 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
No more waiting.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
As much as you can?

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
[firework popping]

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.114 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping]

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
So, this concert
we have coming up...

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.675 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't just
be for our school.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.927 position:50% align:center
What I have in mind
for us is much bigger.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.638 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[YU] Okay, so, Diver Fes was
fantastic! We all agree!

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
And what made it great
was how the artists

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
and audience became one
during every performance!

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
They fed off each
other's energy,

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:53.693 position:50% align:center
until the entire arena
was overflowing

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
with this incredible vibe.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.406 position:50% align:center
The thrill I felt that
day was exhilarating.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
But I wanna hold a concert

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
that'll surpass it and not
just in terms of energy.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
I want to go beyond
the boundaries

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
between idols and fans!

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter if it's
Nijigasaki High, Shinonome,

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.294 position:50% align:center
or Touou--they can
all be involved!

00:20:11.378 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center
We should make it a festival

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
where anyone who
loves school idols

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.549 position:50% align:center
can have an awesome time!

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
Let's make a place where people
can discover school idols.

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.346 position:50% align:center
Where school idols
can find their courage

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
through the cheers!

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:26.142 position:50% align:center
Where everyone's hearts resonate
together in beautiful harmony.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
A form a love worth
shouting about!

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
That kind of place is where
I want all of you to perform.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.906 position:50% align:center
Well, you know what? I think
I want to see that, too.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
Going beyond the boundaries
between school idols and fans.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
Yep! As soon as she said
"festival," I was totally in!

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
Yeah me, too!
Festivals are the best!

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.751 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Mm. Sounds like a blast to me.

00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:54.587 position:50% align:center
Same here. I'd love to
stand on a stage like that!

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
[KARIN chuckles]

00:20:56.715 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
C'mon, what're you
thanking us for?

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.677 position:50% align:center
It's your brilliant idea, Yu.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.013 position:50% align:center
All right. But if we do this,

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
it's gonna require a
lot of time and effort.

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
Since other schools'll
be involved.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
[YU] Mm. I know I'm not a
school idol but I honestly

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
wouldn't mind putting in the
extra work to make this happen.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.192 position:50% align:center
It'll be worth it!

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:20.071 position:50% align:center
This is gonna be the start
of something new for me, too!

00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
All right!
Let's give it our best shoot!

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:41.760 position:50% align:center
A School Idol Festival.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's what we
can call this thing!

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
The perfect name. Right?
The School Idol Festival!

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:53.688 position:50% align:center
This is perfect!
A School Idol Festival!

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
And if any club can
pull it off, it's ours!

00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:58.943 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing, chattering]

00:22:02.238 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:22:06.201 --> 00:22:10.288 position:50% align:center
[AI] Okay, ladies! Next up is
the pillow-throwing contest!

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.082 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] You girls
better bring your A game!

00:22:12.165 --> 00:22:15.960 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] No fair!
You know I only scored a 22!

00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:50.388 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Next time,
"Everyone's Dream, My Dream."
