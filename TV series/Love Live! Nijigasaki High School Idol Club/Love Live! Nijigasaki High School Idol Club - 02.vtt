00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.389 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I was going to
the most wonderful wonderland

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.266 position:50% align:center
in the whole wide world!

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
Or at least, that's where
I thought I was going.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Kasumi, your
movements need to be bigger!

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.441 position:50% align:center
I wanna feel the passion!

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Maybe we should take
a quick break, Setsuna.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.988 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] It'll do more harm than
good if we overexert ourselves.

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.948 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
We don't have time to slack off!

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
I mean, you love
school idols, right?

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
And don't you wanna be one?

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
Well, with this routine...
we won't!

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.290 position:50% align:center
The fans can't connect
with us this way!

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
[EMMA, SHIZUKU exhale]

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:48.715 position:50% align:center
Listen! Idols should be cute,
too, and this isn't cute at all!

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.136 position:50% align:center
So, how may I help you?

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
Third-year Karin Asaka with a
focus in the life design course.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.309 position:50% align:center
[KARIN laughs]
Wow. I guess you really do know

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.062 position:50% align:center
every single student and
what they're studying.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.024 position:50% align:center
Then that would mean you know
about Setsuna Yuki as well.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:07.359 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.944 position:50% align:center
I would love to talk about
school idols with her.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
Somehow nobody I've come across

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.449 position:50% align:center
has any idea what
classes she's even taking.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:18.078 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see. Unfortunately,
your timing is a bit off.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.579 position:50% align:center
After a conversation we had,

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.539 position:50% align:center
Yuki disbanded
the School Idol Club.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:25.251 position:50% align:center
I doubt she feels
like discussing it.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:28.880 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's too bad.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.385 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Time to put my plan to the test!

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.136 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Is there anything
else that you--

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.681 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
It's a cat!

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.557 position:50% align:center
A cat?

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey! Stop right there!

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Stealth mode!

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
Perfect! The coast is clear!

00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:15.010 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
What are you doing in here?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:23.351 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Ah! How'd you handle
my cat-astrophe so fast?

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.479 position:50% align:center
Guess it doesn't matter since I
got what I came for! Deuces!

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.191 position:50% align:center
[NANA gasps]
Wait just a moment!

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.741 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI panting]

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI laughs]
I love it when I win!

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:27.225 position:50% align:center
What? But our club room
used to be right here!

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[NANA] General studies
first-year. Kasumi Nakasu.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
Normally, I'd say
what I'm thinking,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
but you should already know.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunts]

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
Just who does that mean old
president think she is, anyway?

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
I admit that she's kinda scary,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
but you shouldn't have
been poking around

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
in the student council office.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
I guess our club
room's really gone.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.141 position:50% align:center
Meaning the only two options
we have are to do or die!

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50% align:center
Don't allow the mean
prez to "opprez" us!

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.606 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I think I understand.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.448 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
But have you talked to Setsuna?

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.284 position:50% align:center
Well, of course not!
How could I when the only place

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
I've ever seen her
is our club room?

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Hey there. Let's go.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, coming!

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I have
rehearsal for Drama Club.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:37.754 position:50% align:center
I'll catch up with you soon!

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.006 position:50% align:center
Wait a second!

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how
insensitive Shizuko is!

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:49.516 position:50% align:center
But at least I've managed
to get a hold of her,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.976 position:50% align:center
unlike Emma and Kanata.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.813 position:50% align:center
I mean, at this rate, I'll
have to take on the role

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
of president, and I'll keep
the club going all by myself!

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
I can call it Kasumi Wonderland

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
and it'll be overflowing
with cuteness non-stop!

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.449 position:50% align:center
[YU] I wonder how you go about
becoming a school idol.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
I guess since "school"
is in the title,

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.162 position:50% align:center
being in the school idol club
is where we would start, but...

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Why, hello!

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.040 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU gasp]

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
I couldn't help but overhear you
were interested in school idols!

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.296 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU]
Hm?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.177 position:50% align:center
Right, so, I'm the new president
of the School Idol Club!

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
Kasumi Nakasu!
Just call me Kasumin, though!

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.683 position:50% align:center
Did you say School Idol Club?

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
My name's Yu Takasaki!

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
I'm Ayumu Uehara.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
And please correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
but didn't the club disband?

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.442 position:50% align:center
If there are those who
still believe in the club,

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:43.695 position:50% align:center
then it will live on!

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
Here. Since the three
of us are friends now...

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
--[YU] You sure?
--Yep!

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Thank you!

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:53.872 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
So good!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
Are these from a shop?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
Those babies were made
by me, myself, and I!

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're not only cute, but
you're crafty in the kitchen!

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
So, it's no wonder
you're a school idol!

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
You think I'm cute?

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop! I mean, anybody who
has eyes can see that I'm cute,

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
so it's not like it isn't true.

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
It's nice to be reminded,
though, so thank you!

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
Sure. No prob.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
I'm just stating
the obvious, right?

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.069 position:50% align:center
It definitely takes a cutie
to recognize another cutie,

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
which is why I think
you two would make

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
perfect idols alongside
an adorable angel like me!

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.409 position:50% align:center
Do you think we can?

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.786 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm...

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] One hundred percent!
You absolutely can!

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Especially since it's my goal to
make the cutest School Idol Club

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
in the history of
School Idol Clubs!

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
Uh! If it's cute,
then maybe I will join.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
I was hoping you'd say that!

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.178 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm sorry to disappoint,

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.138 position:50% align:center
but I'm not looking
to be a school idol.

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.265 position:50% align:center
I just wanna support Ayumu.

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.143 position:50% align:center
So what, are you like
her manager? Is that it?

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, maybe?

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
Aw, no fair! I'm the president,
so you should support me, too!

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.235 position:50% align:center
I know more about
this idol business

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50% align:center
than the both of you
put together, right?

00:08:07.028 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
Which means you
should listen to me!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
Well, you've got me
there, Nakasu.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.701 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Managers and their talent

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
should be more
familiar than that!

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
We'll call you "Kasukasu," then!

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.665 position:50% align:center
I already told you,
it's Kasumin!

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
But "Kasu's" in your
first and last name, so...

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean you need
to make a nickname out of it!

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
Look, if somebody tells you
that her name is Kasumin,

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
then that's the name
you should be calling her!

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
Where'd the "min" come from?

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
Now, club activities will
begin effective immediately!

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.516 position:50% align:center
Let's go, ladies!

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Oh, yeah!

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.733 position:50% align:center
So, this is where
our club meets?

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Nah. Let's go somewhere else.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
[jackhammer buzzing]

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
We're gonna meet
here every day?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Hello, Mister Cow!

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
This place won't work, either.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
Why are you picking spots
that aren't at school?

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:03.501 position:50% align:center
The student council kinda has
it out for poor little Kasumin,

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
which makes it tough
to do club stuff on campus.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:10.300 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm.... Oh! I know!

00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Whoa! There's so much space!

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.932 position:50% align:center
I doubt we'll bother anyone
way out here. Whacha think?

00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
It's perfect! Nice job, Manager!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
Heh! Like this, ta-da!

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.611 position:50% align:center
[YU] Uh. Where did you
get that nameplate?

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.154 position:50% align:center
From the student council office,

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.866 position:50% align:center
though I had to
resort to... mutiny.

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Is that why they
have it out for you?

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
Like it even matters!
What does matter, though,

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.790 position:50% align:center
is that the Nijigasaki
School Idol Club

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
finally has a new
place to meet, yay!

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50% align:center
We'll start singing
and dancing soon,

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
but our top priority
for the time being

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
is getting more girls to join!

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
Wait, why's that
the top priority?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
The more girls there
are standing around me,

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
the cuter I end up
looking by comparison!

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU laughs nervously]

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.725 position:50% align:center
So, yeah! New recruits
come first and foremost!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I have an idea!

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh?

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
Hello! Everybody's
favorite idol, Kasumin,

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
has a message just for you!

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
Nijigasaki High's
latest and greatest

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.825 position:50% align:center
School Idol Club President
is now yours truly,

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
but it's a really big role.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:21.496 position:50% align:center
One that I'm not sure
I can live up to!

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.082 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best, though,
so keep your eyes peeled for me

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
or else you might
miss something amazing

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50% align:center
as I try to become
the cutest school idol

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:31.715 position:50% align:center
in all of Japan,
just for all of you!

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
I've never seen a school idol
intro in person before,

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
but you totally nailed it

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
and perfectly grabbed
my heart just now!

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Aw, shucks, Yu!

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
I knew you had impeccable taste!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
Now we'll go upload this
to a streaming site

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
and try to get more members!

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
After Ayumu makes one,
of course!

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.323 position:50% align:center
Smile for the camera
and do something like I did!

00:10:57.407 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
[gasping] It's way too
embarrassing like,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
are you kidding me?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.787 position:50% align:center
What's so embarrassing about it?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.873 position:50% align:center
Introducing yourself is
one of the first steps

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
to becoming a school idol.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I don't know if I
trust you with that face.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:09.627 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
It'll be fine!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.338 position:50% align:center
I mean, it might be
kinda intimidating

00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
since you're not
as cute as I am,

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
but you do have potential!
So, show me what you've got!

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:22.766 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm, uh, Ayumu Uehara,

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
and I'm a second-year at
Nijigasaki High School.

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
Um. What else do
you need to know?

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.148 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess there's also...

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.192 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Speak up!
The viewers can't hear you!

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.362 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! I just, I-I
wanna be a school idol!

00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:37.447 position:50% align:center
Since all the fans
most likely heard that,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.824 position:50% align:center
I guess we don't really
need to record you.

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
Fans...? [groans]

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
You just failed lesson one.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.747 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.124 position:50% align:center
I can't say stuff off
the top of my head!

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
Top of your head, huh?

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
Put your hands above
your head like this.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Okay.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
Now add "bun" to the
end of things you say.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Bun?

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
--Bun!
--Yeah! Ayu-bun!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Let's see it.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
Go on!

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
Hi. I'm Ayumu-bun.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Do it again,
but be louder this time!

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.366 position:50% align:center
I'm Ayumu, bun!

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] You need to
believe you're a bunny!

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
I'm a real bunny, bun!

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I wanna be able
to feel those buns!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Bun!

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] The plan is to upload
the videos this weekend,

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.088 position:50% align:center
so practice on your own
in the meantime, okay?

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.298 position:50% align:center
Being cute is scary.
Being cute is scary...

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.426 position:50% align:center
[YU] Sure does take a lot
of work just to be cute.

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Well, it's hard to be
a school idol if you're not.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
But I didn't think Setsuna
was that cute.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.141 position:50% align:center
"Cool" is a more fitting word.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait a sec,
you actually know Setsuna?

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
Yep. Not personally,
but I did see her perform.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
I keep wondering
what exactly caused

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
the club to disband.
Do you know?

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.574 position:50% align:center
It's all Setsuna's fault.
She's to blame entirely.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Everything was pretty
much sunshine and rainbows

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.829 position:50% align:center
when we first formed the group.

00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
But once we decided to do
our debut performance,

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
Setsuna would snap
at every little thing.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
"Wanna be a school idol?
Well, you can't!

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
If you don't connect
with the fans

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.133 position:50% align:center
and express your love, that is."

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
So then I got angry.
Really angry!

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
And before I knew it...

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
We took a break,
a permanent one.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
You and Setsuna
sound really alike.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
You both have things you wanted
to share with your fans.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I did!
It only makes sense,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.778 position:50% align:center
because there's nothing
more important

00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:42.489 position:50% align:center
to a school idol than the
ones who support them!

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:46.826 position:50% align:center
And if we wanna be the cutest
idols of all time then--

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.620 position:50% align:center
Cute. I don't think I've ever

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
fully comprehended
what cute is exactly!

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:53.416 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Jeez. At this snail's pace,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.587 position:50% align:center
the fans might not ever see
how cute you really are!

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
Uh. Is everything okay?

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:13.728 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm doing
the exact same thing.

00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunts]

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.946 position:50% align:center
We should be cute,
and this isn't cute at all!

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.489 position:50% align:center
Passion's not a big deal!

00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
If the thing I wanna
focus on is being cute,

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
then you should
just let me do it!

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.755 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI groans]

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]
Is it yummy?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.433 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be busy helping
out the sports clubs.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
I will in a bit.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
So, how did it go then,
with your family?

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:59.065 position:50% align:center
[AI] It didn't go. They do
run a restaurant, after all.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Our condo doesn't allow
occupants to have pets either.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
[AI, RINA sigh]

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
--[RINA] Uh.
--[AI] Huh?

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.826 position:50% align:center
[RINA] That girl. She's the one
who took Hanpen yesterday.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.037 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] And I was working
so hard in hopes of getting

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
the group back
together someday, too.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:17.917 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grumbles]
What am I supposed to do?

00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:21.546 position:50% align:center
I thought I knew,
but it turns out I don't!

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
Do you have a headache?

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center
[screaming] The heck?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.928 position:50% align:center
You seemed off,
so I thought I'd check.

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
Uh? Kay. But where's Ayumu?

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
[YU] She wanted to practice some
more before heading to the park.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
[whines] I'm awful!

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
Heya! I'm the newbie
school idol, Ayumu, bun!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
I'm a scaredy bun,
but I'll try really hard

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
not to hop away! Bun!

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll...

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasping]

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
I-I was just practicing.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.306 position:50% align:center
It's a type of introduction
that schoo-schoo-schoo.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
School idols do?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.479 position:50% align:center
Heh. Oh, I see.
Please forgive me.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean to intrude
on your cuteness.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
But those things
you were saying...

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center
Are they actually
from the heart?

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
You may want to think
about whom it is

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.365 position:50% align:center
you're speaking to
a little bit more.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
Well, I would think about
that kind of thing

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
if I actually had
any fans to talk to.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:45.213 position:50% align:center
I do have someone who supports
me, though. She counts.

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:50.510 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I think I've meddled
enough. Just do your best.

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:55.807 position:50% align:center
It might not seem like it,
but I have an important reason

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
for wanting to be a school idol.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
And honestly? That's what
keeps me motivated.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
But I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
And I know it.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:08.445 position:50% align:center
I'm always gonna wanna
do what I wanna do.

00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.280 position:50% align:center
But I'm not gonna make
others to do it, too,

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center
because I'd hate it
if they did that to me.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
I say that, and then
I go and do something

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
like force Ayumu to be cute.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
So, then this is probably
stemming from everyone in

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.211 position:50% align:center
the club having different goals,
but you're bound to fight

00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
over stuff like that in any
group you're a part of.

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding me!

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.801 position:50% align:center
If you're saying we're bound
to fight no matter what,

00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
then our club might
not ever work out!

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:38.224 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You look extra
adorable when you get upset.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
I'm trying to have a serious
conversation with you,

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
and you just go and tease me?

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
I wasn't teasing you on purpose!

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I'm so sorry for running late!

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
No worries, you're fine.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Okay, so,
about my introduction.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
Oh, um...

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.785 position:50% align:center
Would you mind if we
film it right now?

00:17:56.868 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI gasping]

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:06.503 position:50% align:center
I'm ready when you are.

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Rolling!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:13.259 position:50% align:center
Hi! My name's Ayumu Uehara!

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.636 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you!

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.554 position:50% align:center
I'm a second-year who
joined the School Idol Club

00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:18.014 position:50% align:center
because I want to
express the things

00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:19.683 position:50% align:center
I love through song and dance!

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.603 position:50% align:center
I still have a long
way to go, but!

00:18:23.687 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
Every step gets me that much
closer to the person I wanna be!

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
Bye for now! [laughs]

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:37.742 position:50% align:center
How was that?

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:40.662 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]
So unbelievably cute!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
You pulled at every
single heartstring!

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Ah-hem!

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU]
Huh?

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
If I'm being completely honest,

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
that wasn't what I
had in mind for you.

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.463 position:50% align:center
But it was cute, so you pass.

00:18:50.547 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
Really? That is such
a relief to hear!

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
[YU] I don't think wanting
different things is bad.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
It's natural.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.640 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Huh?

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
[YU] Let me see if I can
phrase it properly...

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center
I believe that there's a
way for everybody to be

00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
the best version of themselves.

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
And there's more than
one way to get there.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.110 position:50% align:center
More than one, huh?

00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Let's get there together!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:18.116 position:50% align:center
I mean... life is
more fun that way.

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
And coincidentally,
it's the cute way, too!

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
[laughs] For sure!

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You know what?
Check this out, okay?

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunting]

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Some people are cute
while others are cool.

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
But I'd like to
create a place where

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
all kinds of people
can coexist in harmony!

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
Here's another lesson for you!

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I don't care how cute
you think other idols are--

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.027 position:50% align:center
the cutest girl
you'll ever encounter

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.989 position:50% align:center
in your whole life goes
by the name of Kasumin!

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
[panting]

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:36.838 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yeah!

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] A place where
cool and cute people alike

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
can get along with each other.

00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if it's possible,

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
but if we could actually
create such a place,

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine a more wonderful
wonderland than that.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.737 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Here's the student
directory back.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.032 position:50% align:center
Sorry I didn't ask
before I borrowed it.

00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:29.117 position:50% align:center
So, I've read that thing
front to back,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.912 position:50% align:center
but Setsuna Yuki
wasn't listed anywhere.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:35.040 position:50% align:center
Considering Setsuna
doesn't exist,

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:36.958 position:50% align:center
I'm curious as to
how you were able

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.461 position:50% align:center
to discuss disbanding the club.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:44.924 position:50% align:center
Could you explain that?
How 'bout it Setsuna Yuki?

00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:50.180 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Next time,
"Shouting Your Love."
