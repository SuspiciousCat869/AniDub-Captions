00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
if that's what you'd prefer.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:15.680 position:50% align:center
I don't. I... want to try.

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
I know it won't be easy
for me, but I'll still try.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.604 position:50% align:center
All right, then.

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Rina! This is where you live?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:31.529 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Yeah. I have some visuals made.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
But it'd be nice to get second
opinions before it's finished.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
Wait. Your phone is the key?

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
That's not all my phone does.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
It can help me with most
things around the house.

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU]
Ohh...

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] So much tech! Seems
like you've got everything!

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Yeah. You see...

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.893 position:50% align:center
I've had trouble expressing
myself since I was a kid.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
Which made it hard
to make friends.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:08.942 position:50% align:center
I had to be creative
and entertain myself.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.404 position:50% align:center
But then things
started to change.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
When I entered high school,
I made my very first friends.

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
Who would've thought it, right?

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
You've all changed
my life in ways

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.455 position:50% align:center
that I never dreamed
were possible.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
So, thank you for
being there for me.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center
Thank you... for everything.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.053 position:50% align:center
Come on! Let's make
your concert great!

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.471 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Mm-hm.

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.182 position:50% align:center
One and two and three and four.

00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:42.475 position:50% align:center
Five and six and
seven and eight.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
[RINA] That's right.
I'm a different girl.

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
It's time for my
very own upgrade.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Meow! Alley-oop!

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Rina Tennoji has her first
ever concert coming up!

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
It'll be held at
Joypolis in Tokyo!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
Hope to see everyone there!
Meow, meow!

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
Your dance gets better and
better with each practice!

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
Way to go!

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
Really. Just keep up
the awesome work!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.600 position:50% align:center
--[RINA] Right.
--[KYOKO] Hey, Tennoji!

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
Are you in the middle
of practice now?

00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.978 position:50% align:center
I bet it's for the concert!

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
We saw the video
announcement you made!

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.190 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS chattering]

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I'm not who I used to be.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:36.905 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:42.619 position:50% align:center
[RINA] I was just wondering,
would it be okay if...?

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:54.089 position:50% align:center
Would what be okay?

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Never mind.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Huh?

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
Rina, wait!

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:02.597 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I'm gonna head home for the day.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I'm still the same.

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I'll never change. Ever.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.159 position:50% align:center
Should we go ahead and start?

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.120 position:50% align:center
Uh! We're still waiting on Rina!

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
She's not coming.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
She's not even answering
any of our calls.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.293 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Her show's tomorrow!

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
She was working
so hard up till now!

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
Why throw all that time
and effort down the drain?

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] She had a choice
and she made it.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.593 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI grunts]

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Maybe we should
just call it a day, too.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
Come on, Karin.
Please don't mope.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm not moping!

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Says the girl

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
who kept her schedule
for tomorrow clear.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
You were just as excited
for her concert.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
It's only natural to
be bummed about it.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
She's just an interesting girl,

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
so I thought it'd be
an interesting show!

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
Careful, Karin.
You know your cute side

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
really shines through when
you're in denial like this!

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
I'll show you cute.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
I was just kidding,
please let go!

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.126 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back!

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.753 position:50% align:center
Hey! Where's the fire?

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
--[YU] Wait for me!
--You, too?

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
Where're you going?

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
To find Rina, where else?

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
Well... It's what
friends are for, right?

00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
I see looks like
you're all going.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
So, are you not coming?

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
'Course I am!

[gasps]

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.455 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Hang on.
Randomly shouting her name

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
might not be the best idea.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.625 position:50% align:center
Oh. My bad.

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50% align:center
I got caught up in
the moment and forgot

00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
she's not the only
one who lives here.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
Hey, girls. I'm pretty sure
I just heard Rina's voice.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
Are you sure Emma?

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Rinari.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
Can we talk? Inside?

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center

Please forgive the intrusion...

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Is she not here?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.989 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
No, I am.

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
She's hiding in a cardboard box?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
Hey, there.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:39.170 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Sorry for not
coming to practice today.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
You should be.
You had us all worried sick.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It might sound silly,

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
but I'm embarrassed
with myself.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
I wanted to change
and thought I had,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
but nothing's changed for me.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
I still look irritated
with everyone

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
even when I'm having
a lot of fun with them.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.984 position:50% align:center
Nobody wants to be
friends with a girl

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
who looks upset or
indifferent all the time.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:08.450 position:50% align:center
That's the reason I don't have
any friends in my class.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
I know it's my fault,
not theirs.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.038 position:50% align:center
So, I planned on
working on myself

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.749 position:50% align:center
and getting better once
I got to high school.

00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
But changing the way you are
is a lot easier said than done.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
Then, something amazing
happened. I met Ai one day.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.050 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[RINA] And then another
amazing thing happened

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
when we discovered school idols.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
I felt inspired to try
and become the person

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
I want to be one more time.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:37.645 position:50% align:center
School idols connect with so
many people through their music,

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:40.899 position:50% align:center
and I thought I could finally
do the same if I became one.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.609 position:50% align:center
I realize what
I'm stressing over

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
might not seem like a big deal
to the rest of you, but...

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
My expression has
always held me back.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
No matter what it is I do.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
I'm always self-conscious about
what my face looks like!

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:01.169 position:50% align:center
It's hopeless. Just thinking
about how people might

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
misunderstand me before
I even say a word

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
sends a pain through
my chest that hurts

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
like you wouldn't believe!

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
I can't do this. I just can't.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
[RINA sobs]

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
I tried but I can't connect with
everyone the way I want to.

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.402 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.655 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.615 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
Thanks for being honest with us.
About your feelings.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm glad you
opened up as well.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
You know, I'd still really
like to see your stage.

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
[YU] So, what if there are
things you can't do right now?

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
Who cares?

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
She makes a good point.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
Focus on the things you can do.
Not what you can't do.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
But I--

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] You've worked
harder than anyone, Rina!

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.395 position:50% align:center
You're nice to
everyone you meet.

00:17:00.478 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
And you're awesome with tech.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.649 position:50% align:center
You're kind to animals--
especially cats!

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:08.987 position:50% align:center
No fair! Stop stealing
the things I wanna say!

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
Get ready! Now it's my turn!

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
[RINA yelps]
Please don't.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:17.787 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
It's embarrassing...

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
Just sayin'.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
But idols that find ways
to turn their weaknesses

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
into their strengths are
the best in the biz!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:29.215 position:50% align:center
Hear that? So, we need to
figure out how to balance

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center

The answer is just
a brainstorm away.

And we have time to find it.

Thank you.
