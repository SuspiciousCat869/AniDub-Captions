00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
All I really wanted was
to do the thing I loved.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
I mean, you love
school idols, right?

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:24.582 position:50% align:center
And don't you wanna be one?
Well, with this routine,

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
we won't! The fans can't
connect with us this way!

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Listen!
Idols should be cute, too,

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.966 position:50% align:center
and this isn't cute at all!

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.843 position:50% align:center
Passion's not a big deal!

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
If the thing I wanna
focus on is being cute,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
then you should
just let me do it!

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.308 position:50% align:center
[NANA] I didn't mean to, but
what I loved was interfering

00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:44.477 position:50% align:center
with what someone else loved.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Intentional or not, the bottom
line was I was being selfish.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
And how could I expect
my passion to get through

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center
to the fans when I couldn't
even convey it my friends?

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
[NANA] If Setsuna Yuki quitting
the School Idol Club

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
can let the others
keep moving forward...

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Then this is what's
best for everyone.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.263 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
What's up?

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
[NANA] A brand-new chapter
of the Nijigasaki High School

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
Idol Club can be written now.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
At least, that's my last,
selfish wish for them.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
What? That mean old student
council president is Setsuna?

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
What's worse is that you
all decided to confront her

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
about it, but didn't think
to tell me till now!

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
She's not even a member!

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
Wow... Are you the cute
one or sassy one?

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
Ah! Please forgive my sassiness!

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:56.049 position:50% align:center
I'll give you this
bun as an apology!

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.843 position:50% align:center
Well, it does look good.

00:11:58.927 --> 00:12:01.471 position:50% align:center
I graciously accept
your apology.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
We couldn't find you anywhere,
but we did look.

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
So, we left a message
on your phone instead.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
Huh? You did?

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
Huh? I should check my
messages more often!

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
So she's the president.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
Apparently,
Setsuna's serious about

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
not being a school idol anymore.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.660 position:50% align:center
We tried talking to her
so she could hear our side,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
but no matter what we said,
nothing got through.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.249 position:50% align:center
Super-mega bummer.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:34.379 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] I'm failing to see
the problem here, girls.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.382 position:50% align:center
Maybe something's
going over my head,

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
but it seems to me you've
already met your goal, so...

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
You need a minimum
of five members,

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
which you have covered.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.726 position:50% align:center
And since it's not
against school policy

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
to reestablish a club,

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.981 position:50% align:center
you could restart as
soon as today, right?

00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:55.984 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't quit just
because your leader did.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
If you all want to keep the
club going, then so be it.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.408 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure
she wanted to quit.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
What makes you think that?

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
[YU] Look, I can't be
the only one thinking it.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
What about the rest of you?
Do you want her to quit?

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Why would we want her to quit?

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.211 position:50% align:center
Setsuna's the absolute best!

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
She's meant to be
a great school idol!

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
So great that we
couldn't keep up.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
That's a big reason why our
club chose to take a break.

00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
Emma and I are the oldest,
but age is just a number.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
It takes more than years to be
the leader of an idol group.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
I know the day we were supposed
to debut has come and gone,

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
but all of us practiced hard
to be on a stage together!

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
If Setsuna doesn't perform,
then neither will we!

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.946 position:50% align:center
I 100% agree with her!
If we're gonna do this,

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.074 position:50% align:center
then we do it with Setsuna!

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
She really didn't go easy on
us when it came to practice.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.538 position:50% align:center
But now, I think
that I understand

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
why she did the things she did.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I'd prefer if the
past didn't repeat itself.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
But I'm also confident
there's a way

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
to solve the problems we had.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
And in order to do that,
we simply need someone

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
who isn't me to figure it out.
We need our former leader back!

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
Aw, Kasumi! Look how
big you've grown!

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.603 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] If you're making
fun of me, then stop!

00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
...and still cute as ever!

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
You know, thanks to Setsuna,
we were able to find our dreams.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.654 position:50% align:center
So, I'd like to
return the favor!

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Mm-hm!

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:27.951 position:50% align:center
But still, just remember this
all comes down to how she feels.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
Uh. Way to ruin our good
vibes. What a killjoy.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
She's right. We can't
force Setsuna to do this.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
Look! Would you girls be cool
if I went and talked to her?

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.426 position:50% align:center
for you, President.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
Suppose I'll have
to check it out.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.431 position:50% align:center
Much appreciated!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
All right! Your fee,

Don't phrase it like that.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[NANA] If they're calling
for both of us, then that

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
narrows down the ones
responsible. Is it Emma? No.

Though during our chat

I'm here. What did
you want to say?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

[gasps] Where did
that come from?

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
Well, I felt bad making you
talk about why you quit

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.995 position:50% align:center
being a school idol yesterday.
I'm sure it's a touchy subject.

do anything wrong.

you have to participate
in that thing!

I mean, I'm not trying to knock
Love Live or anything like that.

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.309 position:50% align:center
I think you can still be
a great school idol

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
without doing Love Live.

But why? Why do you like me?

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
I told you. I love you, Setsuna!

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
And the reason
I love you is simple:

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
You make me happy!

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
But still, you're sure
this is what you want?

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.739 position:50% align:center
You're saying it's
okay to be selfish?

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:38.535 position:50% align:center
That I can do what
I love, my way?

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yep!

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
[NANA gasps]

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:51.423 position:50% align:center
[NANA] Heh. I hope you
know what you just did.

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:54.217 position:50% align:center
You might not have meant to,
but you said something

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.389 position:50% align:center
very deep. Something that
really hit home with me.

[YU gasping]

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:05.645 position:50% align:center
So don't blame me
for what comes next.

[gasps]

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
This song is for a fresh start!

[SETSUNA panting]

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:13.773 position:50% align:center
I'm a proud member of the
Nijigasaki School Idol Club!

00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
I'm Setsuna Yuki!

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheer]

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Setsuna!

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:28.872 position:50% align:center
I love you so much!

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Hey! Careful!

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
So, um you two gonna stay
down here forever or what?

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
You really are amazing!

[YU]
Isn't she?

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] I didn't realize
you girls were watching.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're back.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
Although, you may have
overdone it, Setsuna.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:00.070 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
You could get in serious trouble

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
if the teachers find
out about this.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:06.159 position:50% align:center
What are you gonna do?
Student Council Prez?

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
I'm not the prez right now!
The name's Setsuna Yuki!

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
So, I think it's time for
us to make our getaway!

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.709 position:50% align:center
