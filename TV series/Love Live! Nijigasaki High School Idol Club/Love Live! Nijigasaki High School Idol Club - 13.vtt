[SHIZUKU]
The music course?

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:15.015 position:50% align:center
I guess it's pretty natural
for some students

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
to change courses when our
school offers so many of them.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.562 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] That's a gutsy
move. I'm impressed.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Ayumu's the reason
I was able to do it.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.692 position:50% align:center
Although, you all played a part

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
in helping me find
my courage, too.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
I don't really see how.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.990 position:50% align:center
[YU] By just being yourselves
and chasing your dreams

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
of becoming school idols.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
It made me realize if
I work hard like you,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
I can do anything I want!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.455 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
With that being said.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.126 position:50% align:center
I'm still required to take
the transfer exam.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.171 position:50% align:center
And if I don't pass it, I'll end
up right back at square one.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.256 position:50% align:center
Ah, you've got this
in the bag Yu-Yu!

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
You're gonna pass
with flying colors!

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
I'm happy you found
such a wonderful dream.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
If there's anything we can do
to help, don't hesitate to ask.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
You know what? One of my dorm
mates is in the music course

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.934 position:50% align:center
and I can talk to her
if you want.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
Also, I can figure out
what your test will be like

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
and help you prepare.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.815 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I can't give you
any details right now,

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center

stuff to help you out, too!

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
Thank you. That's awesome!

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.407 position:50% align:center

Of course!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center
That's the spirit! It's finally

idols to their fans,

Here you go, Setsuna.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.235 position:50% align:center
Just so we're clear,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
I hand it off to Emma once
I'm done with it, right?

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yeah, that's the plan.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center

What's the hold up?

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:23.661 position:50% align:center
Come on! Don't dillydally.
The other clubs are ready to go.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I didn't realize the time.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.791 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
My bangs, for some reason,

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
I think they look a
little weirder today.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:32.545 position:50% align:center
They're cute. Just like you.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.798 position:50% align:center

Ai. Hold on. We can't go yet.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] There's something
important we still need to do.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.981 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]
My bad.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center

Would you do the honors, Kasumi?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
I'd be more than happy to!

Weren't you saying
you wanna be one?

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Saying it is one thing,

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
but actually doing
it is another.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
It's some type of festival.

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:05.063 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Here, take this.

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
Your timing's great! Shinonome
will be performing soon.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
And their stage is pretty close.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
You should check
it out if you can!

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
Sounds kinda fun to me.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
You wanna go?

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.495 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Enjoy!

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yu!

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:25.458 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm? Ayumu! Sure is hot.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
I hope you've been hydrating
between your sets.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.214 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm. Have you been
handing out fliers all day?

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Sure have!

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
But that would mean you're
missing everybody's shows.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
That is unfortunately
a downside to this gig.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
But it's an even trade.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.224 position:50% align:center
A lot of other people get
to see you this way!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
So, I don't mind.
Because the more people

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
that experience this, the more
everyone's hard work pays off!

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.856 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
[YU] I'm also kinda, sorta
using the festival's success

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
as an ego boost.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
Doing something new is
always tricky at first.

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
But having more confidence
makes it easier.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
So that's why, if the School
Idol Festival does really well,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
I think it'll give me
the confidence

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.457 position:50% align:center
to excel at other things.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.875 position:50% align:center
It may seem silly,

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.419 position:50% align:center
but I'd like that reassurance
while pursuing my dream.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.005 position:50% align:center
Well, at least for now.

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
That's how you feel?

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
--[phone buzzing]
--Uh?

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
[YU] Hello? What?
You girls are having

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
technical difficulties with
the sound? Sorry, Ayumu,

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.726 position:50% align:center
but I need to head
to Ai's stage, pronto!

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.065 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
[YU]
How's it going?

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
[AI] Rinari's working
her magic as we speak.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
Is it fixable?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
[RINA] We'll find out
once we restart it.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
It's good to go.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.998 position:50% align:center
[gasps, squeals]

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.876 position:50% align:center
I love you so much,
you don't even know!

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
Well, this is a first.

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
Cause you're always helping me,
but I finally helped you.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
[AI] What are you talking about?
You're so silly sometimes.

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
Heh.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Aw, now that's a face I
haven't seen in a while!

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.107 position:50% align:center
Rina Blushy.

00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
You did great today.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
You did, too.

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:22.283 position:50% align:center
I never knew you had
such a knack for improv.

00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
I think the audience
really liked it!

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
Well, you know, having
a costar like you helped.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
As for your bangs...

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
What's this?

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:42.679 position:50% align:center
A "thank you" for the play,
and also it looks cute!

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:47.017 position:50% align:center

This is the best!

[KASUMI]
Does that sound good?

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
I think it sounds perfect.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.830 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Looks like we did it.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
We should all be able to get
together after the collab set

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:14.002 position:50% align:center
with Shinonome's
School Idol club.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center

[MISAKI]
This is bad news.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
What's the status on shows?

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
All performances are on hold.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
The weather report said
it'd be sunny today.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] So, how long do we have
access to the venues?

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
Until seven tonight.

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
What about the rest
of the shows?

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
If it keeps raining like this,

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
we'll have to figure
something out.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.801 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
Well, it stopped raining.

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.169 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
So, it's over? Just like that?

00:14:38.253 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Just like that.

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
It's past seven, so we
can't use the stages.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
And even if we could,

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
I doubt anyone stuck
around to see it.

00:14:46.845 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Just sucks that it
ended this way.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
It's not the end, though!

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
It can't be the end. Not yet.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:59.274 position:50% align:center
Because there's still
something we need to say.

[phone ringing]

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.653 position:50% align:center

00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.155 position:50% align:center

talked to the school

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
and pulled some strings
so that we could

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
have one more performance!

And it's not just here,

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
every stage still
has an audience!

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.925 position:50% align:center

the finale amazing!

if we hurry!

But run, don't jog!

Let's get going!

we wanted to give today.

but don't come with us.

the audience this time.

[KASUMI] To everyone
who waited out the rain

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
and came to see our
last show of the day:

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:51.052 position:50% align:center
That goes for the people
watching on the monitors, too!

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.971 position:50% align:center
We're grateful to
every single person

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.431 position:50% align:center
who came out and supported us!

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
We hope you had as
much fun as we did!

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
Although we wound up hitting
a few bumps along the way,

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.063 position:50% align:center
we got through it together,

00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
and now we can stand on this
stage and do one last song!

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
[RINA] We had stages to
suit every school idol

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.904 position:50% align:center
and fan imaginable, which
gave us a better connection.

00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:11.573 position:50% align:center
And that's exactly
why this will be

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:13.324 position:50% align:center
a day we'll always treasure!

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] This is much more
than a festival.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
It's a place where
dreams come true.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center
Most school idol clubs
perform as a group,

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:21.958 position:50% align:center
but our club chose
a different path,

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.127 position:50% align:center
one in which we'd still be
moving towards our goals,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.588 position:50% align:center
but as individual idols instead.

00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Having dreams is easy,

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:30.133 position:50% align:center
but reaching them
is where it gets hard.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.926 position:50% align:center
So, as I'm sure you can imagine,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.762 position:50% align:center
we've had our fair
share of obstacles.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
But none of us had to face
those obstacles alone.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:38.350 position:50% align:center
And today, we were able to make

00:17:38.433 --> 00:17:40.435 position:50% align:center
a larger-than-life
dream come true!

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:44.439 position:50% align:center
We may sing individually,
but we always stand united.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] We're up here
because of each other,

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
and because of you!

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
So, now it's our turn to help
make your dreams a reality!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
Life can be tough.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.702 position:50% align:center
Just when you think you've
found your footing,

00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.329 position:50% align:center
you're bound to stumble.

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
And if you're lucky, someone
catches you before you fall.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
I'm here for you,
like you've been for me.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
We all feel the same way,

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
so together, we'll
sing our hearts out!

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
This song is just for you!

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
[YU] Nothing ever pans out
exactly the way you want it to,

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
no matter how hard you try.

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
Having goals means
having regrets.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:05.265 position:50% align:center
Sometimes lots of them.

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50% align:center
And other times...

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Hey, get a load of this.

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
Our inbox is full of emails
from other schools,

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
and they all say the same thing.

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
"We saw a post about the
School Idol Festival you had.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.619 position:50% align:center
Super bummed we missed out.
If you have another one,

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
we'll totally be there!"
And there's more?

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
It kinda makes sense. Lots of
people were taking videos of us.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
They must have
shared them online!

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
Not too shabby.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
Who'd have thought we'd be the
talk of the school and the town?

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:42.135 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Oh, my gosh!
You've gotta see this!

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:43.803 position:50% align:center
These letters were
written by our fans

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:45.555 position:50% align:center
from all over the world!

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
That's pretty neat.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
I guess we really will have to
do a second festival, won't we?

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
I am officially fired up now!

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
We'll have to make it
bigger and better

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
than the first one, though.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center
So, even more people
can enjoy it with us!

00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Are you okay, Ayumu?

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Guess I was
lost in thought.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.994 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad I'm a school idol!
