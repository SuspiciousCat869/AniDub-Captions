[KARIN]
Huh?

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
You can do this, Karin.
I know you can.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.918 position:50% align:center
But at this rate...

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
You'll be okay.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
Cause all of us
are supporting you.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:17:31.301 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
Exactly. We may be solo idols,

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.473 position:50% align:center
but that doesn't mean
you're alone here.

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
How come everyone's
so nice to me?

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious? I'm surprised
you even have to ask that!

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'll be fine.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Here's an idea! Let's all
give some high-fives!

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
And it's a great way to
transfer positive vibes!

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.902 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
<i>Forza!</i>

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
You've got this!

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Wish me luck!

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
Hey, where are you going?

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.670 position:50% align:center
To go do what
cheerleaders do best!

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
[HIMENO gasps]

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] You're all my friends,
but we're also rivals.

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
However, I know
they've got my back!

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheers]

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
That was lovely.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
Be careful there, Himeno.
Your "fangirl's" showing.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
Which makes sense.

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:20.113 position:50% align:center
I mean, you did just see
your favorite model dance.

00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
I'm freaking out enough
as it is without your teasing!

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI laughs]

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A]
She's so cool!

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Not sure who she is,
but I'm officially a fan!

00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:16.146 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
I'm happy for Karin and all,

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.815 position:50% align:center
but I really wanted to
perform at Diver Fes!

00:23:18.898 --> 00:23:22.277 position:50% align:center
I did, too.
Everything from her outfit

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.946 position:50% align:center
to her stage presence
was positively glowing!

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.489 position:50% align:center
You'll both get your chances.

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:27.699 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:31.119 position:50% align:center
We haven't done our
group concert yet.

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.413 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]
That's right!

00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:34.789 position:50% align:center
Think it's time?

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:36.166 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:38.793 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case, we
should have a training camp!

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:40.211 position:50% align:center
Really buckle down on this!

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.839 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Ooh! Sounds fun!

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.759 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
All right! Let's do it!

00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:50.180 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Next time, "Summer Begins."
