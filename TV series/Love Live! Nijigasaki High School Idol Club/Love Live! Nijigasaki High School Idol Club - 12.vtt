[AYUMU] The only person I want
to be a school idol for is you.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:27.402 position:50% align:center
So, please. Please just be mine.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
[phone vibrates]

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I, uh, think I'll head back now.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Oh, hey there! Good morning!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.639 position:50% align:center
Hey, morning.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.440 position:50% align:center
Um... So about yesterday.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.151 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. That was weird, huh?

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
Uhh...

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.155 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Let's go.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.826 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I'll see you in the
clubroom later today, right?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
[YU] Uh, yeah. I'll head
there after I meet

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.289 position:50% align:center
with the reps from
the other two schools.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:26.086 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Okay. Everything's
starting to come together now.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
It'll be great, as long
as we do our best!

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.340 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.179 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] And as long as you
don't leave my side.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:11.691 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to report,
Shinonome Academy

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
will accept your invitation to
join the School Idol Festival.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
Our club, too. We're in.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
[laughs] That's wonderful!

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
Working with you girls
will be a real honor!

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We feel the same.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
[HIMENO]
How's it going with the venues?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.875 position:50% align:center
I heard there's going to be
quite a variety to choose from.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.460 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
You heard right!

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
Thanks to the student council
helping us with negotiations,

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:35.423 position:50% align:center
every place we requested
is good to go.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.175 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's great news!

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:41.680 position:50% align:center
If it's okay, we thought of
a possible venue, as well.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:43.598 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
It's crazy how small the
venues look by themselves,

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.435 position:50% align:center
but when you look
at them all together,

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
it makes them seem
a whole lot bigger.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.147 position:50% align:center
And fans have been
submitting ideas

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.732 position:50% align:center
for other entertainment, too.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
So, I really think it'll live up
to the title of "festival" now.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.321 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What're some
of the suggestions?

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.449 position:50% align:center
A <i>monjayaki</i> stall.
A random request, I know.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.618 position:50% align:center
But we have a member
who'll run it, so...

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
You're building food stalls?

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Safe to say
anything goes.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.582 position:50% align:center
The more that I hear
about the festival,

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
the more fun it sounds.

00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
Let's do our part
to make it fun, too!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
What are the timetables
looking like?

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
It will be more defined
once we know

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
what the other
entertainment will be.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
But Yu here made
a temporary schedule

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
for us to work with.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:25.724 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50% align:center
Huh? Ahh! The schedule!
Just a second.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.063 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I know it's
in here somewhere.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.109 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Finally. What started
out as our wishful thinking

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
is about to become a reality!

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
Just goes to show having
big ambitions pays off!

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
So, let's keep that ambition
burning brightly

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
by really going all
out during practice!

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
Wait, ambition?

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
Ayumu, are you okay?

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
This is no time to let your
guard down! So, stay sharp!

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
This upcoming concert may
very well be what kick-starts

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
our club to stardom,
but that won't happen

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:09.559 position:50% align:center
unless everyone
puts in the work!

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
Hey, Rina!

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
Hi. What're you doing here?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
I was hoping we could talk.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.569 position:50% align:center
It's about entertainment
for the festival.

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.780 position:50% align:center
So, could I get your
opinion really quick?

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.407 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'll be back later.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center
Sounds good!

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.744 position:50% align:center
Kay! <i>Arrivederci!</i>

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
Oh, good!
I'm glad you're both here!

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
[KARIN, EMMA]
Huh?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
Can we borrow you?

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.209 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Sure.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
Shizuku! I have a great
idea for the festival!

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
You do?

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ai!

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:39.923 position:50% align:center
Kanata!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Huh....?!

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:46.221 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
We'll see ya later, kay?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
Let's train our butts off.
We'll show them.

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.565 position:50% align:center
And when the day of the
festival finally arrives,

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.151 position:50% align:center
we'll steal the hearts
of every fan they have!

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
Kasumi...

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI growls]

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:07.742 position:50% align:center
They're our rivals and friends!
Don't ever forget that!

00:06:07.826 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50% align:center
Ayumu!

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.622 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I'm sorry.

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] So, here's
what I was thinking...

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
[cries] Do I really
not have a single fan?

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
I'm too cute to be
treated this way!

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI wails]

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
Kasumin?

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:33.601 position:50% align:center
We thought your stage
could be a bridge to dreams.

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
Or maybe a cute tea party.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
Or maybe even a fun trip
around Odaiba with you!

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
We haven't been able to
settle on anything yet.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Well, all of those ideas
sound great to me.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.072 position:50% align:center
No! They're still lacking!

00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
Um, lacking how?

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.325 position:50% align:center
It's not enough!

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
This is our chance to show
the other school idol fans

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.290 position:50% align:center
how amazing you are, so we need
to pull out all the stops!

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.252 position:50% align:center
Time to brainstorm for a bit.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I don't really see how someone

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.345 position:50% align:center
could describe me as "amazing."

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:11.806 position:50% align:center
But I can't deny how nice it
was to hear Kyoko say that.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.975 position:50% align:center
I've only been a member
of the School Idol Club

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
for a few months. I thought
my world got bigger back

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.732 position:50% align:center
then but the fans are making
it expand even more.

00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:23.985 position:50% align:center
Yu is working hard
and having so much fun.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
I really am happy
for her, but I...

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.371 position:50% align:center
So, embarrassing.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
Come on. Practice time.

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.549 position:50% align:center
Okay, tell me what happened.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.802 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean?

00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
Please don't play dumb with me.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm not.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
I remember.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm fine.

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
You're not the only one.
Ayumu was acting strange, too.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks for the concern,
but it's not a big deal.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:14.661 position:50% align:center
--Even so, I think--
--Really, we're both fine.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.538 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
If you say so...

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:27.090 position:50% align:center
There's something I have to do,
so go ahead without me.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Ayumu, wait!

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.515 position:50% align:center
We should talk about yesterday.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
We really don't need to, though.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
Yes, we do!

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.355 position:50% align:center
Things are really
awkward between us.

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
We can't leave it that way.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
Ayumu, listen.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.448 position:50% align:center
There was something I wanted
to tell you yesterday.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.535 position:50% align:center
Something new.
Something I'm trying.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
I have my own dream.

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
[YU] I didn't mean for
Setsuna to find out.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
It just kinda happened.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
The first person I wanted
to tell was you.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry that I
kept it a secret.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
But I thought it through
and made up my mind.

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
So, um. Will you hear
what I have to say? Ayumu?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
I won't.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.564 position:50% align:center
Because it means we can't
be together anymore, right?

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:25.899 position:50% align:center
I can tell!

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
You've never said anything
like this up until now!

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
I don't want you to leave!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center

I can't, though.

Why, Ayumu?

I didn't become an idol so
I could have countless fans.

That never even crossed my mind.

There was only one girl
I thought of.

She's what kept me
moving forward.

And Yu is that girl.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] But like you said,
so much has changed.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
I have fans that care about me.

And it makes me happier
than I ever thought it would.

So, I'm starting to care about
them, too. How can I not?

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
I wanna perform for a
lot more people now.

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
Yu isn't the only
one that matters.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
And I feel like I'm
distancing myself from her.
