00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.415 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, Ai.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
[AI] Here. You should find
the School Idol Club

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:10.503 position:50% align:center
in room 212.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
No one we talked to seemed
to have a clue where it was.

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
That doesn't surprise me,
since the club

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
was just created this year.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
Thank you. You're a lifesaver!

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.637 position:50% align:center
Happy to be of help!

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:20.847 position:50% align:center
[RINA grunts]

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Huh?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
Earlier. It wasn't a bad time.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:29.064 position:50% align:center
I was just startled
by you, is all.

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:32.442 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry about that.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
Do you like school idols?

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
Uh? You bet! I'm totally
obsessed with them!

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
I see. You as well?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
Me? Um. I'm not sure.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.709 position:50% align:center
Still trying to
figure it out, I guess.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:50.960 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway. We'll leave
you two in peace.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.007 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Ayumu!

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Right, coming!

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
[YU]
This is it!

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:05.600 position:50% align:center
We finally found the
Nijigasaki School Idol Club!

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.893 position:50% align:center
Um, Yu?

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.729 position:50% align:center
[NANA]
What are you two doing here?

00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Second-years Yu Takasaki
and Ayumu Uehara.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU gasp]

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:18.238 position:50% align:center
[YU] Have we...
met somewhere before?

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
You do realize,
as student council president,

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
it's my job to know who you are.

00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:27.831 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] What? You're the
student council president?

00:12:27.914 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
Yes. I'm Nana Nakagawa.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Oh, yeah.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.380 position:50% align:center
I think I recognize her
from the school assemblies.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.008 position:50% align:center
Do you ladies have business
with this particular club?

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:42.137 position:50% align:center
Yes! I'd like to see
Setsuna Yuki, if possible!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.015 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, you won't
find her around here.

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.766 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU gasp]

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.769 position:50% align:center
Word is she quit being
a school idol, so...

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.898 position:50% align:center
And she's not the only one.

00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
That's actually what I came
down here to take care of.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
The School Idol Club
has been disbanded.

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:03.658 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:03.742 --> 00:13:05.702 position:50% align:center
Please excuse me.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I know in my heart
that tomorrow will be

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:24.429 position:50% align:center
no different! There will never
be happiness, but even so!

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:26.681 position:50% align:center
[PRESIDENT B]
Okay. You can stop there.

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
Let's finish up with ten
laps around the track.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:33.480 position:50% align:center
Less whining and more
hustle, please.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
Shizuku, I heard the news
about your other club.

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
It's good that you have
less on your plate.

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
Now, you can devote more
time to the Drama Club!

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh-oh.
The sun's starting to set.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
If I don't hurry up,
I know Setsuna will be mad.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
I guess... I don't have to
worry about that anymore.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.722 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
What's with the long face? Huh?

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:10.600 position:50% align:center
Hi, Karin, I thought
you'd be modeling.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
Today's my day off.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
That so?

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] What are you going to
do about being a school idol?

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
Since Setsuna's our leader,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
I tried to talk to her but I
haven't had any luck so far.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:27.742 position:50% align:center
I was under the
impression the club

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
would be taking a short break.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
Not disbanded.

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
Oh, stop making that face.

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hm?

00:14:41.923 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Is there anything I
can help you out with?

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
[growls] It's not over yet!
Because I'm not giving up!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.857 position:50% align:center
[YU] Ooh! What flavor
did you get this time?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center
Limited-edition raclette
cheese and honey, want some?

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.571 position:50% align:center
Sure do.

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Then let's go
halfsies on it. Here.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.912 position:50% align:center
--So good!
--Mm-hm!

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
--It really is a shame.
--Huh?

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
About that girl.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
But you still might run into her
since we go to the same school!

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
No biggie. I'm sure she had
a good reason to quit.

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
I can only imagine
how hard it is

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
to chase after
a dream like that.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.396 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center
[YU] That's the definition of
a school idol, though, right?

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
I don't have a dream.
At least not yet anyway.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
I thought if I could support
someone working hard

00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.617 position:50% align:center
and chasing after theirs...

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.412 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'd realize my own
dream in the process.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Or at least, that's how I
thought it would happen.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasping]

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding!

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:07.092 position:50% align:center
Let's hit Odaiba
on the way home.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:14.557 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Hm?

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
Cute, right?

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. For sure.

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
[YU] Wow, I can't believe
how cheap this is!

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.373 position:50% align:center
[YU] Should I just buy
that shirt, or nah?

00:16:38.456 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
Let's go back
tomorrow and decide.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yeah.

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
[YU]
I'm game if you are.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
Oh! By the way, about
tomorrow's math class...

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.890 position:50% align:center
Hm? You good?

00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Let's do it. We can
do it if we're together!

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
I just know it!

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
I did the same thing.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
Yesterday, I watched
idol videos.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
And not just the ones
that had Setsuna.

00:17:16.077 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
I watched so much more.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
And everything I
saw was amazing!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
I could feel what they felt

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
because of how clearly
they expressed themselves!

00:17:25.253 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
I can't stop thinking about it!
That's how awesome they are!

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.509 position:50% align:center
And I also can't
stop thinking about

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.804 position:50% align:center
how much I want to be like them!

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.264 position:50% align:center
Ayumu...

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I'm sorry I didn't come
clean about this sooner.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
I secretly wanted
to meet Setsuna, too.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
More than you know!

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
But... I panicked.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.734 position:50% align:center
I thought I would get too
emotional if I saw her,

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
so I kept quiet.

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:54.324 position:50% align:center
It started. We're finally
going somewhere.

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:58.495 position:50% align:center
We can't stop now.
We can't hold back, either.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:08.171 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I love them!

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
I love super girly
and pink outfits.

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
The cuter they are, the better.
And I still want to wear them!

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
I need to be honest with myself.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
So please, please watch me.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I'll show you!
I'm going to become one!

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.837 position:50% align:center
A school idol!

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
As of right now...

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:22.574 position:50% align:center
I'm not super confident,
and not that brave.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Here. Please take this.

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
It's me asking you
to chase this dream with me.

00:21:38.673 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
[YU laughs]

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:45.430 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:21:45.513 --> 00:21:49.642 position:50% align:center
Of course, I will!
I'll always be by your side.

00:21:49.726 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
Every step of the way!

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:45.258 position:50% align:center
This means war...
student council!

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:50.430 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Next time, "Cutest Girl."
