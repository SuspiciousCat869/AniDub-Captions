00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] No matter what I do,
I always give my all.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
Whether it's working
my part-time job

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
five days a week,

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
or cooking a nice,
homemade meal.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
If the hard work I put in means
I get to see my sweet,

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.027 position:50% align:center
little sister smile...

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.069 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
It's great!

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.822 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
...it's totally worth it.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
So, where's Mom?

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
She already left.
Working the night shift.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
Duty calls, huh?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
While I'm thinking about it,
do you have plans this Sunday?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
If not, you should
come see my concert!

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
Concert? That's awesome!
Where's it gonna be held?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
Odaiba. At the Venus Fort.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:54.637 position:50% align:center
And the best part is,
I was picked as the center.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.475 position:50% align:center
I'll be there. Cheering
from the very first row!

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
How cool! You'll actually be
the Shinonome Academy

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
School Idol Club's center!
You totally deserve it though!

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
Heh! Now we just need you
to perform in a concert

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.612 position:50% align:center
where you're the one
who's front and center.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess so! I'm sure it
will happen sooner or later!

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
[KANATA laughs]

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sis! Good morning!

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.561 position:50% align:center
Good morning. You're up kinda
early today, aren't you?

00:01:43.645 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
Yep! I thought you
might like some help.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
That's nice of you, Haruka.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.360 position:50% align:center
But I've got this under control,
so just relax.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.861 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
But...

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:56.950 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I'm almost done,
anyway. It's fine, I promise.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.743 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right!

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:01.996 position:50% align:center
Could, um... Could I check
out your School Idol Club?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.748 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could come
sometime today?

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
[gasping] I would love that!

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:45.600 position:50% align:center
Ta-da! This is my
baby sis, Haruka!

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
It's very nice to
meet all of you!

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.230 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Oh my gosh!

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
Haruka Konoe,
the most popular girl

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
at Shinonome Academy, is here!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
I can't believe this
is my life right now!

00:03:57.696 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
That's kind of you to say.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I didn't realize you
were such a fan of idols

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
from other schools, too, Yu.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah!
She's from Shinonome!

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.331 position:50% align:center
They have one of the most
famous idol clubs in town,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
and Haruka's only
in her first year,

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
but she's still trending like
crazy on the internet!

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.462 position:50% align:center
Yu sure knows her stuff!

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:17.632 position:50% align:center
It's true! She is a star!
Aren't you?

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:19.884 position:50% align:center
I realize that my request
to come here was sudden,

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
so thank you.

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.347 position:50% align:center
No. We're all honored
to have you at our club.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.976 position:50% align:center
Wow, and she's super polite
to boot! Too cute!

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.561 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
I know, right?

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
She's the best. And she's
here cause she noticed

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:34.566 position:50% align:center
how happy our club has
been making me lately,

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
and so she wanted to come
experience the fun for herself!

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center
Makes sense. Every single
time we practice,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.657 position:50% align:center
it looks like you're
having a blast!

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
My mood's even better now
that my sister's with us.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
It's time to blast off!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I think it's sweet how
you wanted to check in

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
on Kanata. I can see
how much you care!

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
[YU] Mm! All right!
Brace yourself for a day

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
that you will
never forget, Haruka!

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:01.509 position:50% align:center
C'mon! Let's show
her what we can do!

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.012 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Okay, she may be
Kanata's little sister,

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:07.223 position:50% align:center
but she's still the enemy
and should be treated as such!

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
That's why I say we
pull out all the stops

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50% align:center
while she's here and demonstrate
what a dark horse we are!

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
We're a force to
be reckoned with!

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh... You realize
just because they're our rivals,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.445 position:50% align:center
that doesn't make them
our enemies, you know?

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
What? Of course,
they're our enemies!

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
It's common sense!

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.034 position:50% align:center
What's worse is
she's a first year

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
just like me but she's
gotten way more praise

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
than I ever have! It's not fair!

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50% align:center
Do you see where I'm
coming from now?

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:35.627 position:50% align:center
Uh... No, if I'm being honest.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
It's School Idol Club 101!

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
Ooh. I'm likin' all this energy!

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:42.592 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm gonna put all
this energy into proving

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
that our club shouldn't
be taken lightly!

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
Plus, it is my sworn duty as
our current club president!

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
Wait, you've been the
president this whole time?

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
She's self-proclaimed.

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.521 position:50% align:center
Biases aside,
when it comes to fame,

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:57.273 position:50% align:center
the difference between our club
and Shinonome Academy's

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
is pretty much night and day.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.903 position:50% align:center
[grunts] You don't have
to say it like that.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
At least our popularity's
growing among the students

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
at our school. Huh?

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
I was able to borrow a tea set!

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:13.707 position:50% align:center
Just a little something special
for our guest of honor!

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
Kanata says she's really cute.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
She likes to compare
her to an angel.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
I'm twice as angelic
as this girl is!

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.091 position:50% align:center
That so? "Ai" can't
wait to meet her!

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
Heh. Since my name is Ai.
You get it? [laughs]

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:32.726 position:50% align:center
I'm Haruka Konoe. It's a
pleasure to meet you all.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
Believe me, the
feeling's quite mutual.

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
Super stoked to meet you!

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
Hi, welcome.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you. Rina
Board is glad you're here.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.699 position:50% align:center
Wow, thanks for such
a lovely welcome!

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.911 position:50% align:center
You may have noticed,
but I'm as cute as you are!

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
In fact, I might
just be even cuter!

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad you're here!

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:59.586 position:50% align:center
Us cuties, we have to
stick together, right?

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:05.884 position:50% align:center
Do you know how rude it is to
leave during an idol's intro!

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
Watch this Haruka!

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA laughs]

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Whoa. Never knew
my sister could run so fast.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.358 position:50% align:center
Yep! She gives it everything
she has every time.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
She's been that way for
as long as I've known her.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
Wow, every time, huh?

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
[KANATA grunting]

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.712 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I think this is
a new record for you!

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
You can do it!
Put your back into it!

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
[KANATA grunting]

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.677 position:50% align:center
You're crushing this! Yeah!

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50% align:center
This is the lowest
you've gotten!

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Come on, Sis!

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Uh-oh.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
[KANATA grunting]

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
Yes, you've got this!
No pain, no gain!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:05.402 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Not that kind of pain.
Oh, well. Let's call it a day.

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.030 position:50% align:center
[YU] Shall we make it
official, ladies?

00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Welcome! Please, have a seat!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
We're so happy you came today!

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.705 position:50% align:center
Wow! I don't know what to say.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
Just say that you'll
join us for a cup of tea.

00:08:19.082 --> 00:08:21.418 position:50% align:center
Come on,
before it gets cold.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.253 position:50% align:center
Oh, good point.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
So, we only have
cookies for snacks

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.132 position:50% align:center
because we didn't have
time for much else.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
You definitely have to try
the special buns that I made!

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.303 position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:35.765 position:50% align:center
Heh! I respond very
well to flattery.

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
Make sure you try a bun,
Haruka! They're great!

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
Alrighty... So good!

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:49.029 position:50% align:center
Feel free to have as
many cookies as you want.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
Please do, before Emma
eats all of them.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Karin!

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughing]

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
So, uh...
What'd ya think of us?

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
Um... Well...

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
My sister wasn't the only
one who was having fun.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
Every time I turned around,
I saw somebody smiling.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
You're my kind of club!

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
That's awesome! And very true!

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA grunts]

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center

Hey, sis, are you okay?

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Don't you worry,

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.685 position:50% align:center
we have a pillow
with her name on it.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
She's fine. Just give her
a minute to rest her eyes.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
She'll wake back up eventually.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.610 position:50% align:center
Um. So, you mean this is
something that happens a lot?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.612 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. As far as I know,

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
if Kanata has any free time,
she usually spends it snoozing.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
Our laps are her second
favorite pillows after this one!

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
Seriously, she's used
my lap plenty of times!

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
I had no clue.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.628 position:50% align:center
I just feel like this isn't
healthy, you know?

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
Makes me wonder if she's okay.

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:54.219 position:50% align:center
lately, she's been even
more sleepy than usual.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.720 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
When were doing vocal exercises,
she completely conked out.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.851 position:50% align:center
That's not all.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
I barely managed to wake her up
when I found her the other day.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
Aw, poor thing.

00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
[YU] So, basically,
I'm more of a cheerleader

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.155 position:50% align:center
than an actual idol.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] I wish our club
had someone like you!

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
What the...?

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
Oh! You're awake!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.957 position:50% align:center
[gasping] I can't believe
I fell asleep

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
right in front of you
and revealed my secret!

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.754 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] This is nothing to be
embarrassed about, honestly.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
And I know why you're tired.

00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
You've been pushing
yourself too hard.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
What do you mean I'm
pushing myself too hard?

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.597 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Are you kidding?

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] You've been losing
even more sleep than usual

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:46.021 position:50% align:center
since the club started
back up, haven't you?

00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.982 position:50% align:center
I have. Don't wanna
miss out on the fun.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.275 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
I noticed how much you've
been working lately,

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
and was worried you might
pass out from overexertion.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
And then you did pass out.

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
You were worried about me?

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
You nearly had me fooled, too.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
You were so energetic and
cheerful the whole day,

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
I was starting to think
it was all in my head.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
I really did like seeing
you happy, though.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
You always put me first,

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.133 position:50% align:center
so I'm glad you're finally
doing something for yourself.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
What're you getting at?

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
The thing I'm getting at is,
anyone with eyes

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
can see how important
this club is to you, Sis.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
I've made a choice.
Here and now.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
Huh? What choice?

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
I quit. I'm done being
a school idol.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.032 position:50% align:center
[KANATA, YU]
Wha--?!

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
You, why...?

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.411 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yeah! Why?

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Cause if I don't,

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.624 position:50% align:center
you'll keep on overworking
and make yourself sick.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
That has nothing to do with you.

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:52.379 position:50% align:center
I realize I take a handful
of naps every day,

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
but I'm perfectly fine.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] You're not fine,
and we both know it!

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
You take it upon yourself to do

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.346 position:50% align:center
all the chores at home
cause Mom's too busy.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:04.724 position:50% align:center
And then you work a part-time
job to help with finances.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
The cherry on top is
you're on a scholarship,

00:12:07.018 --> 00:12:10.146 position:50% align:center
so you're always studying!
No wonder you're always tired!

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.775 position:50% align:center
I'm exhausted just
thinking about it!

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:19.864 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:20.824 position:50% align:center
[KANATA gasps]

00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:22.450 position:50% align:center
Please don't worry about me.

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:26.162 position:50% align:center
I want you to focus on your
own happiness from now on.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
Be rational, Haruka.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:30.542 position:50% align:center
Wait a minute...

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
So, you'll give up on
being a school idol

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
to make it easier for Kanata?

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
I can't let you do that!

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
Being a school idol
is your dream!

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:40.427 position:50% align:center
You can't just throw
away your dream!

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.096 position:50% align:center
Your health is more
important than my dreams!

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.266 position:50% align:center
I refuse to watch you work
yourself to death!

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
Come on now. You don't
need to worry about me.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
Besides, last I checked,
I was the big sister, not you.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:56.609 position:50% align:center
Don't worry?

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.946 position:50% align:center
Does the fact that I'm younger
mean I shouldn't worry?

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.490 position:50% align:center
I guess that didn't
come out the way I meant.

00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I'll work harder
so you don't worry.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:10.457 position:50% align:center
Never mind! You just
don't get it at all!

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Haruka!

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.504 position:50% align:center
I'll go get her.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
Why is she upset?

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
What did I do?

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
Please don't leave yet, Haruka!

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:39.152 position:50% align:center
So, um... Are you
really gonna quit?

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.737 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.201 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Are you sure?
It's a big decision.

00:13:46.284 --> 00:13:48.870 position:50% align:center
I know, but my mind's made up.

00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
It's time for me to
pull my own weight.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
This way she'll stop
tiring herself out.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
Since you're her cheerleader,
please look after her, too.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.441 position:50% align:center
Jeez, this stinks.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
--Um...
--So, last night,

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
I confronted her and tried to
talk about what happened.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] Thanks for dinner.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] Hey, so about
the school idol thing.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
I would prefer if we didn't
talk about that anymore, okay?

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
For what it's worth,

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.887 position:50% align:center
I'm not quitting until after
the concert this weekend.

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.349 position:50% align:center
So there. Now you
have to come see me!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what to say.

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:58.064 position:50% align:center
I mean, what do you say
to something like that?

00:14:58.148 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
It's her dream.

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.694 position:50% align:center
And the instant she became
an idol, she made it real.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
How many people do that?

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
But she's giving it up
because of me.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
I should be the one
to quit, not her.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:13.538 position:50% align:center
No, you can't!

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Listen Kanata.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
Are you being completely
honest with yourself?

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.342 position:50% align:center
Do you really want to quit?

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
I don't. Which is what
complicates things.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
I don't think I
realized it until now.

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
But this is my dream.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
It's no secret how much
fun I've been having

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
since the club
was reestablished.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
And now I have even more
goals than I did before!

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
The best part, though, is that I
get to chase after those goals

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.283 position:50% align:center
alongside all of you.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
Our club is precious to me.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
The kind of thing you
don't wanna lose.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.667 position:50% align:center
If I quit, I think I'd
also lose a part of myself.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.210 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.963 position:50% align:center
But then, I need to consider
my sister's feelings as well.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:07.467 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, girls.
I know I'm being selfish.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
Are you, though?

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
It doesn't sound
that selfish to me.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.516 position:50% align:center
What it sounds like is you
being honest with yourself.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Don't feel bad about
being honest with yourself.

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
I don't really know her, but...

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
I have a hunch
your little sister

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.442 position:50% align:center
feels the exact same way you do.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
It makes sense considering
all you have in common.

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
Wait, are we really that alike?

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:32.492 position:50% align:center
For sure! Seems like you two
have the same solution, too.

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:33.827 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you do.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
The both of you are
trying to solve this

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
by thinking of each
other's happiness.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.624 position:50% align:center
Well, of course I'm
thinking of her,

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
because that's what
a big sister does!

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:44.379 position:50% align:center
It's not just you.
She loves you.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
What's so bad about her
looking out for her sister?

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.508 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
She wants to help. Listen age
is just a number anyway.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
She quit because she loves you.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.057 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:05.692 position:50% align:center
When you put it like that,
it makes a lot more sense.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:11.614 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I need to go find
Haruka and talk this out!

00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
Haruka! You have visitors. Look!

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA] I wasn't
expecting you to come!

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
Um. Did my sister happen to
come with you girls, too?

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
I really wanted her to see
me perform. Since it's...

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.471 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yup! She's here!

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:36.806 position:50% align:center
And I'll gladly take
you to her. C'mon!

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
What? Ahh!

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:39.684 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
But wait... Why'd we
stop here? [gasps]

00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.412 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:17:59.496 --> 00:18:00.789 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Sis! That was amazing!

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.431 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're here.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:43.933 position:50% align:center
I wanted to apologize
for not understanding

00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
what you were trying to tell me.

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
I see it now.
How much you care.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
And I'm so grateful to have
a sister as loving as you.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
So, here's the deal...

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.616 position:50% align:center
No one quits. Since you
feel the same way that I do,

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
let's both support each other
instead of shouldering it all.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.830 position:50% align:center
Uh, support each other how?

00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] For starters, we can
split the chores at home, 50/50.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
And, of course, we can be there

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.254 position:50% align:center
for moral support when
it comes to school idols.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
We'll make our dreams come true,
and we'll do it together!

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
What about your part-time job?

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Even if we split
the work at home,

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:22.430 position:50% align:center
I still feel like you'll have
too much on your plate!

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'll be just fine.
Know why?

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
Cause making you an idol
is part of my dream.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.064 position:50% align:center
So, it's worth a
little extra effort.

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Yeah, but...

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:36.027 position:50% align:center
But what? You know it's true.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
Besides, imagine how
annoyed you'd be watching

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
from the sidelines
while I continue to give

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
knockout performances
like the one I just did!

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Honestly? You're right.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
I mean, we are rival
school idols, right?

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:52.419 position:50% align:center
So, let's do our best!

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Yeah!

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.552 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
Looks like this won't be
her last show after all.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.889 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] I know we didn't
give you much notice

00:21:04.973 --> 00:21:06.433 position:50% align:center
when we asked to
borrow your stage,

00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
so thank you for cooperating.

00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.312 position:50% align:center
It's fine! We should
be thanking you! Really!

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:16.693 position:50% align:center
No joke! Cause you saved our
member, and I feel super pumped!

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.286 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Oh, no!

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
It looks edible enough to me.

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:30.415 position:50% align:center
You should have
the other one I made.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.042 position:50% align:center
This could give you
a tummy ache.

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:33.918 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Only one way to find out!

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
Please don't eat it, Sis!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
Some people just aren't cut
out to be cooks, I guess.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:41.593 position:50% align:center
So, let's trade and I'll
take the part-time job.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
That's one trade I won't
be making anytime soon.

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
Mm! Kanata!

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.894 position:50% align:center
No pouting! I'm just happy
that I get to eat your cooking,

00:21:50.977 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
since I'm sure it's
all made with love!

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
[HARUKA]
Come on!

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
Maybe when it's time for dinner

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
you can show me
how to cook again?

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:04.824 position:50% align:center
Huh? Of course!

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:50.805 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Next time,
"Shizuku, Monochrome."
