00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] In a certain city
at a certain theater

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.102 position:50% align:center
there is a girl with a dream.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
A simple wish, really.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
She desires to be the
best singer in town.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
That girl has the gift of song
and wants people to hear it.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
That girl wants to be
everyone's ideal heroine!

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHIZUKU] 
Impossible.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.582 position:50% align:center
Such lofty goals for a voice
that can't reach anyone.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
But you know all about that,
right? Because I am you.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:52.802 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU giggles]

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
[YU] 
You look adorable, Ayumu!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.514 position:50% align:center
[KARIN laughs]

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.600 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Karin's as gorgeous as always!

00:00:58.683 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.519 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Ai's energy is off the charts!

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.522 position:50% align:center
You girls are totally knocking
this outta the park!

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
My turn! I'm sure
they're just dying

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
to get some pictures
of a cutie like me!

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
Idols are great because
there's such a wide variety

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:16.242 position:50% align:center
to choose from, so which kind
of idol are you striving to be?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.912 position:50% align:center
Easy. The kind
that's loved by all.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.539 position:50% align:center
I think that'd suit me the best.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:24.250 position:50% align:center
Could you clarify?

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.587 position:50% align:center
I imagine a school idol that
simply appeals to everyone.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
Then I do my best to become her.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
An idol that appeals
to everybody, huh?

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
So, is it safe to assume
that you're playing

00:01:33.677 --> 00:01:36.221 position:50% align:center
the role of a beloved school
idol, even as we speak?

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.892 position:50% align:center
Talk about commitment!
But I think it suits you, too.

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.853 position:50% align:center
You know, since you're a member
of the Drama Club as well.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.480 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
[NEWSPAPER CLUB A] Speaking of,
I heard the Drama Club

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50% align:center
is doing a joint festival
with Touou Academy soon.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.447 position:50% align:center
Yes. The rumors about
us joining up are true!

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.742 position:50% align:center
Each school will be performing
their own program, though.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.285 position:50% align:center
And rumor has it you were picked

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.497 position:50% align:center
for the lead role in the
Nijigasaki performance!

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind,
could we get a quick comment

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.669 position:50% align:center
for our loyal readers in
regards to how you feel?

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.713 position:50% align:center
Tell them I'm going
to give it my all.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.716 position:50% align:center
And they should
definitely come see it!

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.971 position:50% align:center
What? You're really
replacing me?

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
I promise it's
nothing personal--

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.434 position:50% align:center
this just wasn't the right
role for you, Shizuku.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center
I can work on
whatever's wrong!

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
So, please! Tell me what it is!

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.732 position:50% align:center
It's the kind of part
that requires you

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
to be vulnerable and really
put yourself out there.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.112 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] 
You don't think I can?

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
I originally thought you'd
be perfect for this role.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.533 position:50% align:center
She's a singer and
you're a school idol,

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:42.203 position:50% align:center
so it kinda felt
like a no-brainer.

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.915 position:50% align:center
Then, please!
Give me another chance!

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.134 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
What I want is to sing.

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
And I want everyone
to hear it when I do!

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
It will be a song I put
my whole heart into,

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:28.518 position:50% align:center
so that my passion is
evident with every note!

00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Shizuko.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
[YU] Ta-da! The school paper
just published your interviews!

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.363 position:50% align:center
So! You're officially official!

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Oh, wow!

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
They got some really
great shots of us!

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Apparently,
we're pretty popular.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Hopefully this interview
is just the first of many.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Maybe they can
cover one of our practices

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:54.502 position:50% align:center
the next time they do this.
What do you girls think?

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50% align:center
For sure! Get a behind
the scenes look! Great idea!

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:01.217 position:50% align:center
What a relief,
seems like she's fine.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
And they talk about Shizuku's
upcoming performance!

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Ooh! Where?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:12.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It really is cool
that you're the lead!

00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] In that case, I'm
definitely going to go see it.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
Thank you. It should
be a great show.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Ohh...

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
[RINA] So, you think there's
something wrong with Shizuku?

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Mm-hm. I can tell.
She looks gloomier than usual.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
Much gloomier than usual.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
She seems happy enough to me,
but that could just be a front.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's right!
I heard the lead role

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
she was gonna play
got taken away from her.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
What? Are you for real?

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.887 position:50% align:center
Someone in the
Drama Club told us.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
She said they're gonna hold
another audition to recast it.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHIZUKU] My song is
incapable of reaching anyone.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
Remember when we were little?
Of course, you do.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.038 position:50% align:center
We were different
from the others.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
It may seem trivial in hindsight

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
but every little thing
would worry me.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
Like, what if someone
thought I was weird?

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.383 position:50% align:center
What would I do if people
just didn't accept me?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
I felt like I was drowning
in a sea of anxiety!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHIZUKU] So, then I began
to guard my true self from

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:36.896 position:50% align:center
the world. I hid and I felt
better in the shadows.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
I've been living a lie ever
since I made that choice.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50% align:center
My song can never reach anybody.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
Not when I'm perpetually
lying to myself.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU cries]

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
[DARK SHIZUKU]
You know I'm right.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.588 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] 
Gotcha! Hey!

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay?
What's up?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
That's your cue.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Roger. Rina Board equipped.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps] Am I supposed
to not be able to see?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.392 position:50% align:center
That's right, now off we go!

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
[RINA] 
Woo.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.022 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] 
What's going on?

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:25.278 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
These pancakes are legendary.

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
So, you wanna try
and eat them all?

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I'm currently
oh-for-five in my attempts

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
to take down pancake mountain.
We'll conquer it together

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
once I share my secret
techniques with you!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
But you're oh for five.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
My best advice is to just
eat through the pain!

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:42.545 position:50% align:center
Ready? Charge!

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.673 position:50% align:center
[RINA] 
Don't mind if I do.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
It's so fluffy!

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.554 position:50% align:center
[RINA] 
Sweetness overload!

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Open wide! You know you want it!

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:01.981 position:50% align:center
It's good!

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Awesome!

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Dig in, girls! We're
gonna devour this whole thing!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Rina Board went from being flat

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
to fat in a matter of minutes.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
That was my first victory. Yay!

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:19.624 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
We did it.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[RINA] 
Yay!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:24.546 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] 
Too cute!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
[RINA] 
Oh, these are nice.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Aw! This pupper
looks just like my Ophelia.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Say "cutie"!

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Cutie.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
Decisions are tough.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Everything they sell
sounds like it tastes good.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
[RINA] I take it you're into
old-fashioned movies?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Is that why you act?

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
Cause you've watched movies
like this since you were

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
a little kid? Do you think
that's what inspired you?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
Well. Maybe.
That's part of it, at least.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:08.590 position:50% align:center
Actually, the biggest
reason I like acting

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
is because of how
it makes me feel.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
I stop worrying about
what others think.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
I forget the fact that I'm
Shizuku Osaka for a while.

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
So you're saying you
don't like yourself?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.652 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry! How weird
do I sound? Never mind.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
Hey! I thought we chased
that doom 'n' gloom away!

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.950 position:50% align:center
Only thing I wanna see on
your face is a smile! Okay?

00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.827 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] 
Kasumi.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Even if it's just for a day,

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
let's focus on the good,
not the bad!

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
And once you're
in a better mood,

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
you can audition again
and win your role back

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
like the champ you are!

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
[gasps] So, you heard
about that.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Mm-hm. I mean... Yeah.
I totally get why you're sad.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
But, really, it's
their loss, not yours.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
We love you. So, if something's
got you feeling

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.728 position:50% align:center
down or depressed,
don't be afraid to tell us!

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:05.480 position:50% align:center
I'm fine!

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.858 position:50% align:center
I promise I'm fine.
Don't worry about little old me.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
But thank you both for caring.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
But Shizuku...

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:17.992 position:50% align:center
It's time for me to head
home anyway. See you later!

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.549 position:50% align:center
Look at that scared little girl.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
Can't even reveal her
true self to her friends.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
I just...

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:40.306 position:50% align:center
Don't want them to hate you?
I'm well aware.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
I know all about wants.
Because I want a chance to sing!

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:53.194 position:50% align:center
But to do that, you'd have
to put yourself out there.

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
Accept me.

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:05.248 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can. No way.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50% align:center
I can't, and I
hate that I can't.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Did she text you back yet?

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] She said she has
to practice for the play.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Bad timing on our part, I guess.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.473 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I wish eating lunch
with me were as important

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
to her as rehearsal is.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.269 position:50% align:center
Being blown off stinks.

00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Who knew such a cute girl
could be so stubborn?

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
Good grief. Wonder what's
going on with her.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
You know.

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.366 position:50% align:center
Sad and stubborn Shizuku
is still Shizuku.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
I get it. I went through
something fairly

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:49.542 position:50% align:center
similar recently. I didn't care
for the way I was, either.

00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
But I pulled through
cause, I had Ai.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
She makes me feel
like a better person.

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.884 position:50% align:center
Then the whole club came
and cheered me up.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.594 position:50% align:center
If not for that...

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
I would've never performed.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
Just having Ai made
all the difference.

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
She needs someone like that.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
Well, then,
why didn't you say so?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Fighting!

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I wish to wash
my Irish wristwatch.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
Peter Piper picked a
peck of pickled peppers.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.663 position:50% align:center
What a to-do to die today,
at a minute or two to two.

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.667 position:50% align:center
A thing distinctly hard to say,
but harder still to do.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
I saw Susie sitting
in a shoeshine shop.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
I thought I thought of
thinking of thanking you.

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
Red leather,
yellow leather, red--

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] 
Kasumi?

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
Can-- Can I help you?

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
Help me? You're kidding!

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.278 position:50% align:center
Okay. So, I didn't like how
we parted ways yesterday.

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
That's why I wanted to make
sure you were doing all right.

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.785 position:50% align:center
I should apologize for
making you worry, then!

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
But if I say I'm fine,
it's because it's true!

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
I'm just practicing my--

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
Huh. Then why do you
have puffy eyes?

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.674 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps]

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.761 position:50% align:center
I've met stubborn people before,

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
but you are by far
the most stubborn!

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:30.643 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU gasps]

00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
You'll need a better poker face

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.064 position:50% align:center
if you're gonna try
and hide behind it!

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
If I'm really your friend,
then talk to me!

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
All right, then, I'll talk.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
I was told I have to be more
vulnerable if I want the role.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
But I... I can't do that.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.921 position:50% align:center
Wanna know something?
I think old movies are neat.

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
And I find old-fashioned
novels just as interesting.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
Thing is not many other kids
were into that stuff growing up.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.639 position:50% align:center
I felt alone.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.642 position:50% align:center
Every time someone gave me
any sort of funny look,

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:14.270 position:50% align:center
I'd assume it was
because they hated me.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
I didn't like that.

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50% align:center
Which led to me
developing this fear

00:14:17.691 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
of people seeing me in a way
they might classify as "weird."

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
That's why I became an actress.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
And I perfected the part
of the girl people liked.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
And you know what?
I felt better.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
Shizuko...

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
You see? I can't be vulnerable.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:42.048 position:50% align:center
I don't even think
I know how to!

00:14:42.132 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
Which means,
if that's a requirement

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:48.930 position:50% align:center
to be a school idol or
an actress, why bother?

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
I'll never be either of them!

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.062 position:50% align:center
I can't express myself.

00:14:56.146 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
I'm too afraid people
will hate me.

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Seriously?

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
I mean, do you even
hear yourself right now?

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
What you really can't do
is make everyone like you!

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
Take me, for instance! Look!

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.966 position:50% align:center
See all this cuteness
I'm packing?

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
Think I get sad when people
don't say it to my face?

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
In fact, you never tell
me how adorable I am

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.515 position:50% align:center
even though you see me
almost every single day!

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
So, what's your honest
opinion about me?

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
Am I cute? Or am I just okay?

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
I'd say cute before okay.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:47.530 position:50% align:center
There now! That wasn't so hard.

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:51.368 position:50% align:center
You have standout traits, too!
Your stubbornness is number one!

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
Followed by your
lack of confidence.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:56.956 position:50% align:center
They're part of who you are,
and therefore uniquely you!

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
Those aren't
compliments, though.

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
But they make you, you!

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
And even if there are
people who don't like

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.547 position:50% align:center
those things and want
you to keep them hidden,

00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:09.010 position:50% align:center
I don't care! Cause I love you
the way you are, Shizuku Osaka!

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.845 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
You get it now? So, what
are you worrying for?

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving!

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
Wait! Thank you!

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
If you really wanna thank me
for getting all mushy like that,

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
then do everything you can

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
to make sure you nail
that second audition!

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.072 position:50% align:center
Did you hear? The lead in
this play doesn't just act.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
She's also a school idol
at Nijigasaki High School.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.327 position:50% align:center
[HIMENO] Oh, you don't say.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.172 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
I'm glad they cast Shizuku

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
as the leading lady again!

00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:35.263 position:50% align:center
Ah, I can only imagine
how nervous she must be!

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.015 position:50% align:center
--[buzzing]
--[ALL gasp]

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's starting.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
You've got this, Shizuko!

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
In a certain city,
at a certain theater,

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
there is a girl with a dream.
A simple wish, really.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
She wants to be the
best singer in town.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
That girl has the gift of song
and wants people to hear it.

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
That girl wants to be to be
everyone's ideal heroine!

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.174 position:50% align:center
Before you leave, tell me why!

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.968 position:50% align:center
Why am I the only one
not allowed to perform?

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
You know how unpopular
your songs are,

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
which should be an
explanation in itself.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:20.725 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but to
put it bluntly,

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
you're not welcome
on our stage anymore.

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.064 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A]
Wait! Why don't we ask the owner

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
to give you one last chance?
I'm sure she'd agree. So...

00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:32.237 position:50% align:center
No! It's over!

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.828 position:50% align:center
Are you really that afraid?

00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
Showing your true
self can be scary.

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
Hold on!

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center
Don't leave!
Singing is my passion.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.340 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] I've been
ignoring you for a while now.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.564 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Because you're right.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:10.942 position:50% align:center
You don't just walk away
from your passion!

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
I'll stay, I want to sing!

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
This is who I am.

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
With faults and all,
and I embrace them!

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center
Some may not, though.

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
They don't have to,

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center
because I already have
people who love me.

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Here and now,
on this tiny stage,

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.133 position:50% align:center
I'll begin my journey
as a singer anew!

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
[PRESIDENT A laughs]

00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
That was spectacular!

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.846 position:50% align:center
I've gotta say,
I can't imagine anyone

00:21:44.929 --> 00:21:48.433 position:50% align:center
