00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
[YU] Here's our application
for the School Idol Festival.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
So, please approve it
whenever you're ready, kay?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
Well, well, well.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
I must admit, I am
intrigued by all this.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.443 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Right? Just imagine, President:

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.405 position:50% align:center
a festival that all
school idol fans can enjoy!

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Um...

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.869 position:50% align:center
Forgive me. I'm not that
up-to-date with pop culture.

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
Could you please explain
what school idols are?

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:39.581 position:50% align:center
[YU gasps]

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
They're extremely cute girls,
brimming with energy!

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.710 position:50% align:center
Like me! See?

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Uhh...

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Uh--

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
They're students who
sing and dance.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.803 position:50% align:center
And they have a club where they
meet to practice their routines.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
Interesting.
You're so knowledgeable.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
[gasps, clears throat]

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.102 position:50% align:center
Since I'm the president,
I have to know about all clubs.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.230 position:50% align:center
Huh. I should follow
your example,

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.858 position:50% align:center
and do more research on
what goes on at our school.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.860 position:50% align:center
But that's beside the point.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:10.945 position:50% align:center
The details of your
application are too vague,

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.448 position:50% align:center
so we won't be able
to approve this as-is.

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.657 position:50% align:center
She's right.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.992 position:50% align:center
It says you're working
with other schools,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.494 position:50% align:center
but doesn't list them.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:20.622 position:50% align:center
We also need a basic list
of activities you're planning.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
[SECRETARY A] Oh! And a progress
report on top of that.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT]
Most of all...

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
We need to know where you
plan to hold this event.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center
Okay. If we do those things,
you'll approve the application?

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:32.967 position:50% align:center
Most likely.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Then we'll be back soon!

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.763 position:50% align:center
We've got work to do!
So, let's go!

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Mm!

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.809 position:50% align:center
[YU, KASUMI]
Excuse us.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:45.563 position:50% align:center
I wonder what that
would look like.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.733 position:50% align:center
A festival all school
idol fans can enjoy.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.154 position:50% align:center
I truly hope that
it turns out well.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thank you!
I hope so, too!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.957 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Well, this festival
won't plan itself, so let's go!

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Too bad.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.884 position:50% align:center
Thought we'd get
approved right away

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
what with Setsuna being
the president and all.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.014 position:50% align:center
Guess that won't
work this time, huh?

00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry everyone.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
I should've known our proposal
was only half-baked.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.521 position:50% align:center
[YU] It's fine. It's not
like they shot us down.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
I just have a few more
details I need to get.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
That's right. I can
help you with them!

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
That's sweet, but you really
don't have to do that.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
I mean, you've got
your performance

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
to focus on, right?

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
We should focus on putting
our best foot forward.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
That way it'll be perfect.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
I know it won't be easy,

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.790 position:50% align:center
but if we support each other,
we can do this!

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.459 position:50% align:center
[RINA] When do we have to have
everything figured out by?

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Oh, the deadline is next week's

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
student council meeting.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.548 position:50% align:center
Let's decide on the venue first.

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50% align:center
Can't have a concert
without a stage.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.722 position:50% align:center
What's goin' on, party people?
Thanks for coming out

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
to see me perform today!

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
I hope Ai can make you smile
with all my Ai-tastic puns!

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.562 position:50% align:center
Yay puns!

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50% align:center
Okay...

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, if I ever need
to hype myself up,

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
I'll just stand on a stage!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I totally feel you, Ai.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
Being on stage makes me wanna

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
close my eyes
and drift off sleep.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.704 position:50% align:center
She even falls
asleep while talking.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
This auditorium is really nice,

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
but I'd prefer to be a little
bit closer to the fans.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
Well, we still have other
venues to check out.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
<i>Buono!</i> One sip and suddenly
all of my energy is restored!

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
[YU]
It was a long day.

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
Personally, I really
love to sing outside.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
Nothing like hearing
the waves, the wind,

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
and the crowd during a show!

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Out of all the
places we saw today,

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
I think this one is topping
my list of favorites.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.331 position:50% align:center
It's special for us
because this is where

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
we were supposed
to have our debut.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:37.045 position:50% align:center
And it'd be nice if we could
perform here at least once.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
I'm down. A concert
in the middle of a city

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.968 position:50% align:center
sounds pretty cool to me!

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
Your individuality
strikes again.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
We'll keep this place in mind
but let's keep looking.

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Okay!

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
[YU yawns]

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
Have you been doing your
summer vacation homework?

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm just about done
with classical lit and math.

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
Way to be responsible!

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.490 position:50% align:center
I haven't so much as
touched mine. Not yet.

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
This wouldn't be the first time

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
you saved everything
for the last day.

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:11.371 position:50% align:center
Oh, here it comes!

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.624 position:50% align:center
Bye, I'll see you in the
clubroom a little later, okay?

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.918 position:50% align:center
Kay, see ya later.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:28.596 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
What do you girls think?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
I know it hasn't
been done before

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
but would you be willing to try?

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
Oh, I definitely am! Sis
already told me about it,

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
so I was just waiting
for you to ask!

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
I think it's a great idea!
Sounds like it'll be really fun!

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
Plus Karin will be there and
I'd love to share a stage

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
with her... again.
It'd be an honor.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Uh? You're so sweet.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
I feel like I should be the one
who's honored in this situation.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
[HIMENO gasps]

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
It's fine. She's just
a huge fan of yours.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.462 position:50% align:center
Don't tell her that!

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Oh, so you're a fan.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Aww, it's a shame I didn't
know about that sooner.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI gasping]

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.436 position:50% align:center
[MISAKI laughs]
I like this idea, as well.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
A festival that all school
idol fans can enjoy

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.941 position:50% align:center
sounds really awesome.
I mean, what a concept, right?

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:24.319 position:50% align:center
[CHRISTINA] For sure! I'm
totally on board, too!

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.363 position:50% align:center
Though, we won't be able
to make a formal decision

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
until we speak with
the rest of the club.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
I'm fairly confident
the rest of the members

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
will be as thrilled as we are!

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:35.497 position:50% align:center
As for Touou, you can mark
us down as participants.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
You won't regret this!

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] So, what's the
schedule look like so far?

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.340 position:50% align:center
Setsuna and I are
working on that now.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
[AI] No venue, no concert, so
finding that should come first.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
[YU] Each venue has
its own perks, right?

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50% align:center
I didn't think it'd be
this hard to narrow it down.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
What's your personal
preference, though?

00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:01.272 position:50% align:center
Huh? Mm... I'm not exactly sure.

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
All our problems are about
to be solved, ladies.

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.448 position:50% align:center
Wow! I can't believe
how cute this is!

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
It is cute, but what is it?

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.162 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] So glad you asked!
I call it the Kasumin Box!

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
The Kasumin Box, huh?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I asked people where
they'd like to hear me sing,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
and they put their
replies in here!

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
I always try to keep an open ear

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
to the adoring fans
who support me.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
That's just the kinda
idol I wanna--

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.308 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI gasping]

00:08:37.392 --> 00:08:40.103 position:50% align:center
So, there's nothing inside?

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI whines]

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] Why isn't there a
single friggin' request in here?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.568 position:50% align:center
Because it's summer vacation,

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
so a lot less people
are coming to school.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
But Yu! Kasumin's so sad!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[YU]
It'll be okay.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:57.203 position:50% align:center
Even though it didn't
work out this time,

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.998 position:50% align:center
it's still a fun way to
get the fans involved.

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And it's a cute
way to do it, too!

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.920 position:50% align:center
Well, of course!
If I made it, then you know

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
it's gonna be
brilliant and cute!

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:10.133 position:50% align:center
What'd be even more
brilliant is if we ask

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
for opinions on
other things, too!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
There! Something like that!

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Concise and easy
to see! I like it!

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
I'll go set it outside!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Hey! Wait a minute, Setsuna!

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:25.774 position:50% align:center
You can't see my cute
little face anymore...

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
Yu's right. It's summer
vacation now.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
We need a better way
to spread the word.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
Heya!

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
We just got through making some
cookies in the Baking Club!

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:49.381 position:50% align:center
Inspired by the School
Idol Club, if you can't tell.

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
Wanna try some?

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:56.888 position:50% align:center
[ASAGI] You're having a
festival? I had no clue!

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
I want as many people
as possible to know

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
about it so I'm
making a website.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.229 position:50% align:center
It's good.

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
[IROHA]
I'm glad you think so!

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
My friends would
die if they knew

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.567 position:50% align:center
there was a festival
for school idols!

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
Do you think it'd be okay
if I told 'em about this?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.363 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Uh...

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
Can I, please?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it hasn't gotten approved
by the student council yet.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
Aw, what a bummer. Too bad.
I'll keep it a secret.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.836 position:50% align:center
[RINA gasps]

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Actually,
go ahead and tell them.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
[IROHA gasps]
Are you positive, Rina?

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
Yeah. We're doing
everything we can

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
to make sure it happens.
So, no secrets. It's fine.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.815 position:50% align:center
We'll definitely be
cheering for you!

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Rina Board is more
determined than ever.

00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS laughing]

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[IROHA]
Is, uh, Ai gonna stop by?

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
Ah. The real reason you wanted

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
to test those
cookies is revealed!

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
[IROHA]
Gimme a break, okay?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.582 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Ai and the others
are out jogging

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
so they can build up their
stamina for the festival.

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
Everyone make way for a bunch
of cuties coming through!

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]
Hey-- Uh?

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.136 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Ayumu. Time to wake up.

00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
Guess I dozed off.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
Why'd you wait?
You could've left.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised since you
should already know

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
the answer to that question.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:22.033 position:50% align:center
I know if you were in
my shoes and had to wait,

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:25.036 position:50% align:center
you would've stuck around
no matter how long it took.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right. Sorry
it's so late. Let's go home.

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:31.751 position:50% align:center
It's no problem at all.

00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[YU] Setsuna's been helping me
out with the application,

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.925 position:50% align:center
so we've actually made
some decent progress!

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
That's great.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
I guess she didn't wanna
walk home with us, huh?

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.893 position:50% align:center
[YU]
She still had some stuff to do.

00:12:48.977 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
Ah, I see.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.691 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's the due date
for the application, right?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.444 position:50% align:center
[YU] Yeah. We were going
back and forth about

00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center
which location would
be the best for a festival,

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
but what makes it hard is trying
to accommodate every member

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
since you all have
such different styles.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
It's a real head-scratcher.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yeah, it really is.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
Especially when you throw
Shinonome and Touou

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
into the mix. Together,
we're all a rainbow of colors

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
when it comes to preferences
and personalities.

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.673 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
Think Yu. What should I do?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.149 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Come on. We have to pick one.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
From a practical standpoint,

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.320 position:50% align:center
our best option here
would be the auditorium.

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
That would really limit
a few of our performers.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.574 position:50% align:center
Hey! There's been a development!

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
Look how full it is now!

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
So, we reviewed
your new application.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
And it appears as though
you've made some progress.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Yes.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
That said, the one thing
it's still missing is a venue.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:02.133 position:50% align:center
Because that's the one thing
our club couldn't decide on.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
We asked ourselves what kind of
venue would satisfy everybody.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
But that was the wrong question.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.395 position:50% align:center
You might if you look at this.

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
Still confused.

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:17.315 position:50% align:center
They're supportive messages
people left for our club.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
They found out
about our festival

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
before it was even official!

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT]
And these are from your fans?

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:27.117 position:50% align:center
There are so many.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
"I love Kanata's songs."

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] "I could be having
the worst day ever,

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.872 position:50% align:center
but just hearing the
sound of her voice

00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
cheers me up. Thanks to her,
we made it to the Inter-High,

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
so I wanna return the favor and
lend a hand if you need it."

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
"Emma's PVs help me decompress.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.426 position:50% align:center
We have a bunch of outfits
we'd love for her to wear,

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:46.261 position:50% align:center
so if the festival
becomes a reality,

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
so will seeing her in
some of these clothes!"

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
[RINA] "We love the School
Idol Club so much

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
that we even made cookies
that look like each of them!

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
Hopefully they can be our
taste-testers

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.815 position:50% align:center
at the upcoming festival!"

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
After reading the messages,
we had another talk.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
We tried to pinpoint
what a festival

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
that all school idol
fans can really enjoy is

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
and where it should be.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.618 position:50% align:center
That's when we realized

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
it's much more than simply
holding a concert at some venue.

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I still don't follow.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.293 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Care to explain, Kasumi?

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
We were too wrapped up in making
our own dreams come true.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.967 position:50% align:center
But a festival for everybody
isn't just about us.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
It should include making

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.262 position:50% align:center
our supporters' dreams
come true, too!

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:31.097 position:50% align:center
[YU] In addition to the
thanks and encouragement

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
were a lot of requests
in regards to the venue,

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
which is why we won't
be narrowing it down.

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
We'll use them all.

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.900 position:50% align:center
Getting everybody in the school
involved is the best way

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
to do this thing!

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
If a school idol wants to
perform indoors, she can.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
If she wants a sunny stage
outside, she's got it!

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
They can perform however they
choose, and their fans can go

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
to whichever venue
suits their mood.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
No compromises, just fun!

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
Our fans told us
what they want to do,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
so we'll do our best
to make it a reality.

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure if we
could even pull it off.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.463 position:50% align:center
But if we have a festival
where everyone

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
is where they want to be,
then how could they not love it?

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:16:10.053 --> 00:16:13.807 position:50% align:center
A festival that all school
idol fans can truly enjoy.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center
You solved the puzzle.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:21.231 position:50% align:center
We did! So, do you
give your approval?

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.857 position:50% align:center
Very well. Unless the president
has something to add.

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
What do you make of their idea?

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.574 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
Well, sounds good to me.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
All right! Go team!

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
We did it!
We really appreciate it!

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
Honestly. I think I'd like
to participate, too.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:47.549 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.050 position:50% align:center
Does that mean...?

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT] I'm much more
versed in school idols now

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
than I was the last
time you were here.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
I've been researching.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:57.934 position:50% align:center
You have? Oh, I bet you
fell in love right away!

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:00.937 position:50% align:center
So, who's your favorite idol?

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Setsuna Yuki is nice.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
You're wrong, though.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
I didn't fall in
love right away.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
It's still new, so it feels
forward to say that.

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
Who cares if it's new?

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
It's perfectly fine to
love your fave idol!

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
She's right! If Setsuna knew,

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she'd be ecstatic
to have a fan like you!

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
Definitely!

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
Oh, my goodness, are you...

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
...a Setsuna Yuki fan as well?

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.218 position:50% align:center
You had so much passion
in your voice when you spoke!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.636 position:50% align:center
What a pleasant surprise to have

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
a like-minded person
on the council!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
Um... Well...

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:37.515 position:50% align:center
[VICE PRESIDENT]
I know!

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
Why don't we go to
the festival together?

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:41.811 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
I'm so relieved the
application went through.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:45.940 position:50% align:center
Not only did it go through,

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
the whole student
council was for it!

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.737 position:50% align:center
But it turns out the
vice president's your fan.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
Will you be able to
hide your identity?

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.366 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't you worry, Karin.

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
For the sake of my mysterious
image, I'll persevere!

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say...

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.163 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
I talked with a few girls
from the Baking Club,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
and they said they wanna help
with the festival in some way.

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
The Costumes and
Accessories Club does, too!

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
That's not all. The Basketball
Club offered to help

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
with prepping the venues
whenever the time comes.

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
Having a ton of stages was
the best idea ever, huh?

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
I can hardly wait. [laughs]

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Way to go! We pulled it off!

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
What would we do without you?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Oh, stop!

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU exhales]

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:33.279 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Hey! We need more
drinks, so I'll go grab some.

00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Good idea. I'll come with you.

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:41.329 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
It almost doesn't feel real,

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center
but the festival is
actually happening!

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:44.708 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yeah.

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
I'm glad. Mostly for Yu's sake.

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:49.170 position:50% align:center
She put so much work
into that application.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:51.464 position:50% align:center
At least she had you
to give her a hand.

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
You both pulled some
really late nights, right?

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:56.136 position:50% align:center
Well, it's true we
both stayed late,

00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
but I did very little
compared to her.

00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:03.852 position:50% align:center
I guess. It was still more
than I could do, though.

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
What do you mean?

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Just curious but that
night when Yu went missing

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
during the training camp,

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.573 position:50% align:center
what did you end up doing
when you found her?

00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] I brought her back
to be with everyone else.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] Right, but what were
you doing in the east building?

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
I saw you together.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Oh! I found her
playing the piano in

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
the music room. The melody is
what wound up leading me to her.

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:34.424 position:50% align:center
She was playing the piano?

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.926 position:50% align:center
That's right. I was impressed
with how much she improved

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
since the last time
that I heard her play.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
There's no greater discovery

00:19:40.847 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
than finding something
new you love.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
I didn't know any of that.

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:54.444 position:50% align:center
Hm? Are you okay over there?

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:56.571 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm fine.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.327 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Huh?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I didn't know that
about her. She never told me.

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Hm?

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
Been a long time since
you've hung out at my place.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:38.029 position:50% align:center
Oh. That thing.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
I've been practicing it
for a little while now,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
but I can't seem to get better.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
Listen, I have a
pretty big something

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.584 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to tell you.

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
I was gonna tell you when
I got better at piano

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
but I just didn't have
the confidence I needed

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
to say it, and before I knew
it time just passed me by.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
Is this "something"
about the piano?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well yeah, but...

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] You had the confidence
to tell Setsuna.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
You couldn't tell me,
but you told her!

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Wait. What does Setsuna
have to do with--?

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.609 position:50% align:center
Is she more important to you?

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
She's not.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.362 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:32.625 position:50% align:center
[YU] That "big something"
is something further ahead.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
I have a dream.
And I've finally--

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
No!

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
I don't wanna hear it.

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:52.645 position:50% align:center
Ayumu.

00:21:52.729 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] The last time we talked
about dreams together,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:01.571 position:50% align:center
you said you'd stay by my side
and see mine through with me.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:05.617 position:50% align:center
The only person I want to be
a school idol for is you.

00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:13.291 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
So, please. Please just be mine.

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:49.888 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU, YU] Next time,
"Blossoming Feelings."
