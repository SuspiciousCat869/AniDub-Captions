[EMMA]
The cerulean sky

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
stretched as far as
the eye could see.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.234 position:50% align:center
I was blinded by
how bright it was.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
Once I became a school idol,

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
would I be able
to shine like that?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.991 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
My map. I need it
to get to the dorms.

[KARIN]
You good down there?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.590 position:50% align:center
Um. Hello. Do you go to
Nijigasaki High School?

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Thank you for the other day.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.680 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
You alone?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.434 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm not a fan
of big groups.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:03.146 position:50% align:center
I see. Well, then,
since it's just me,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
would you mind if I joined you?

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I dreamed of eating this
when I was in Switzerland,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
and now I can!

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.837 position:50% align:center
<i>Buono!</i>

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.298 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You came
all the way to Japan

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:31.966 position:50% align:center
just to eat a bowl of rice?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, this?
No, that would be silly.

00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
I was joking.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.890 position:50% align:center
I see! [giggles]

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.393 position:50% align:center
Actually, the real reason
I came to Japan

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.936 position:50% align:center
is to be a school idol.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.979 position:50% align:center
Huh. Is that so?

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.607 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I watched videos of
idols when I was a kid,

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
and they always gave me
this warm and fuzzy feeling

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.820 position:50% align:center
that I loved.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.656 position:50% align:center
And ever since then,
I've wanted to become an idol

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.533 position:50% align:center
so I can spread
those feelings, too!

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
"Feelings" made you move here?
You've got guts.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.205 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Excuse me.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.583 position:50% align:center
But are you Karin Asaka?

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.460 position:50% align:center
Yes. That's me.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.089 position:50% align:center
Wow! We know you from magazines!

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50% align:center
We're huge fans!

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:13.717 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
We wish you nothing
but the best!

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
So, you're a model?

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.144 position:50% align:center
Yes, just for fashion magazines.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.145 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
Being an idol is
awesome, as well.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.774 position:50% align:center
So, let's both do our best!

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:32.652 position:50% align:center
[gasps, laughs]

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:09.624 position:50% align:center
They're both <i>buono</i> !

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:11.876 position:50% align:center
You're quite the foodie,
aren't you?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
No, I just like good food.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
Is today a "club day"?

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.176 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Those two
new girls joined!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
So, it's been more
active than ever!

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
We're also excited about the
prospect of being solo idols,

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.142 position:50% align:center
so we can't wait to get started.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.393 position:50% align:center
Oh?

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
I really wish that you
could join, too, Karin.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:36.317 position:50% align:center
Uh. You know I don't enjoy being
surrounded by that many people.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] I'd better get going.
I'll see you later.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
Okay. Bye.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Who's a good kitty?

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
I am, meow.

00:04:49.914 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]
This is kinda nostalgic.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
I used to pet little
Neve the same way!

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] Is that a friend
from Switzerland?

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
Neve is from Switzerland,
but it's a baby goat.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Really?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.385 position:50% align:center
Your family has
baby goats back home?

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
Yeah! And when I
was a little girl,

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
I'd sing to them
every chance I got.

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
I'm getting even more nostalgic.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Emma, do you ever feel homesick
being an entire continent away?

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
Sure, but it's only natural
to feel that way.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Being with you girls
helps, though,

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.321 position:50% align:center
because we let loose
and have fun

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
like I do with my
younger siblings.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:25.825 position:50% align:center
Makes me... glad.

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
I'm all right. But I'm
still in foreign country,

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.747 position:50% align:center
so my family worries
about me all the time.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.540 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
Good! Everybody's here.

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
You two sure took
your sweet time.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI laughs]

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
What's so funny, Kasumi?

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Oh, nothing but check this out!

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
Ayumu's video!

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.636 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec, why're
we watching this?

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50% align:center
Ladies. Direct your attention
from the adorable girl

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.683 position:50% align:center
and check out all those views!

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
There are lots of comments, too.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Oh, wow.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:58.483 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA]
So, we have a proposal.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50% align:center
We think it would be a good idea

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.862 position:50% align:center
to make promotional
videos as solo idols.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.698 position:50% align:center
What're we promoting, though?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever talents
that you have.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
They serve as introductions

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
as well as showing off
what makes you appealing.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
All right! That sounds fun!
I say we try it out!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
Emma! This is perfect!
You could show your family!

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.129 position:50% align:center
You just gotta choose a concept!

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
Huh? Concept? Let's see...

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
Setsuna is a whole
other level of cool.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the views on this
have skyrocketed, too.

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
True, and I'm flattered.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! The editing
was done by Rinari!

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
Yep. I edited the video,
but Yu gave me a lot of ideas.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Aw. I didn't really
say that much.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.169 position:50% align:center
What about yours?

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.463 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
You mean moi?

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Kasumi is killin'
it with the cuteness!

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
Don't you think?

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
Of course! I see you're
a lady of culture, as well!

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
Having our own concert
won't be just a dream

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
if we can get our names
out there with these!

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.103 position:50% align:center
Your PVs should overflow
with charm!

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.064 position:50% align:center
So basically, make them
as amazing as mine,

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
and you'll be set!

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
I wonder... Yu?

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.320 position:50% align:center
What do you think is
most charming about me?

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:28.365 position:50% align:center
Hm... Do you want
me to be honest?

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
Heh, of course!

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.535 position:50% align:center
I think one of your best
features is your smile.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.373 position:50% align:center
Also, your frown. Especially
when you get those puffy cheeks!

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
Never a dull moment with you!

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
Hang on! How are my cheeks
a part of my charm?

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
Oh, and there they go!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
Yu! Stop picking on me!

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
Yu's so sharp. It's wonderful.
She pays attention to all of us.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.391 position:50% align:center
The research you do for school
idols is a very big help, too.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.142 position:50% align:center
A true team player!

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.063 position:50% align:center
What I really am is
obsessed with school idols!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
So, I wanna support you,
you know?

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
Having you as a manager is nice.

00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
But! What's nicer is having
our own personal cheer squad.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know you inspire me
to push myself harder!

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.994 position:50% align:center
Um, if any member in
our group has a right

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
to pump the brakes, it's you.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Nobody gets better
by pumping the brakes!

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
Come on! Setsuna!

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
Your popularity is cutting
into my popularity, so stop!

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.296 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] I think this
essentially sums you two up.

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.138 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea what you
want to do for your PV, Emma?

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
What kind of idol
do you wanna be?

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
That's easy, I wanna be an idol
who can make people feel

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
warm and fuzzy all the
way from head to toe.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.856 position:50% align:center
Very appropriate!

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.066 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'm not sure
what kind of idol

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
that would classify
me as, though.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
What would warm fuzzies be?

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
That is kinda tough
to visualize.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
My pillow and blankie
are real fuzzy and warm!

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
Read an excerpt from a novel!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.663 position:50% align:center
Something like an
emotional journey!

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
You can use my trademark
"buns," if you want to!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
Or! Maybe anime!

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
Plushies are fuzzy
and warm. Aren't they?

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
My grandma's pickles, for me.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
And school idols
give me that feeling!

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Uhh...

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.135 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
I guess that's a question
with all kinds of answers.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center
What's important
is Emma's answer.

00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.436 position:50% align:center
Well, with acting,
putting on a costume

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
helps open your mind
to new possibilities.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Good idea!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
Huh? Costumes?

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasping]

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.492 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for
helping us out!

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
Sure. It's fine.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.412 position:50% align:center
This is super cool.

00:09:39.496 --> 00:09:42.415 position:50% align:center
You've got some pretty
fancy-schmancy hook-ups, huh?

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.502 position:50% align:center
Some of the club members
just share a class with me.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
Hey, you good?

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Oh, yeah! More than good!

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.592 position:50% align:center
[YU, AI gasping]

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
Welcome home. Shall I make
you some tea? My lady!

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
She's just so cute!

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Would you mind
if I try a few others?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
Yes, please!

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Let's go watch
the fireworks together!

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50% align:center
[YU]
You look perfect!

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.322 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Yay! Go! Fight! Win!

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Rawr! I'm Beary Verde
and I'll eat you up!

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.829 position:50% align:center
Ah! My heart!

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
That's a costume?

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
Sure is!

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.000 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Is this what it
feels like to make people

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
feel warm and fuzzy inside?

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
Hey, try this one next. I know
it's gonna look great on you.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
Whoa! That's some good taste!
The eyes of a model!

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.555 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Can I get
a picture with you

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
in this outfit before you
change into that one?

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
Me, too! I want a picture!

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me three!

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
[AI] C'mon, Rinari!
Saved you spot right by me!

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Okay.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey! Get over here!

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.821 position:50% align:center
Me? Nah, I think I'll pass.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
So, models get camera shy?

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I have to take this.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Karin...

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
They want to interview me?

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.894 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] "What are you
most interested in?"

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
"What do you want to
do on your days off?"

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.864 position:50% align:center
That'd be nice.

00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:39.908 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
You in there?

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.243 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Emma? Just a minute.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Come in.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
[EMMA gasping] And the messiest
room award goes to...

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.382 position:50% align:center
You're my friend, not my maid.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:59.719 position:50% align:center
Thanks for today. You wanna
see the pictures we took?

00:11:59.803 --> 00:12:01.304 position:50% align:center
Not right this second.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Okay.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
Hm? No way!

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hm?

00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.689 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]
So, you are interested in them!

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
If that's true,
you should join the club!

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
I just know you'll love it!

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:19.614 position:50% align:center
The two of us could become
school idols together!

00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
You're wrong. They don't
interest me at all.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.620 position:50% align:center
Actually, I bought that magazine
to give to you, anyway.

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
Besides, modeling keeps me
busy enough as it is.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
I don't have time to dabble
in this school idol stuff.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
You know that.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I do.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.635 position:50% align:center
I also know how much
you help me out.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
So, I thought I'd
return the favor

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
and encourage you this time.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
The only interest
I have in idols

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
is supporting you being one,

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
but if I'm giving you the wrong
idea, then I'll back off.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.064 position:50% align:center
Karin...

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Go ahead and take that magazine.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.403 position:50% align:center
Might inspire a costume or two.

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, and stop
inviting me to join.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Why? Why did she get so mad?

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Does she secretly
hate school idols?

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
I don't understand what's
going on in her head.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] I knew it! Flowers
compliment Emma perfectly.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA] Hold up. Why is
she wearing her uniform?

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.937 position:50% align:center
That's her starter outfit.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
We're gonna switch her into
all kinds of ensembles today!

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU]
How many?

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
Well, it was tough to decide,
so when I said "all kinds,"

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.488 position:50% align:center
I meant it literally.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
Makes perfect sense to me.

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:46.326 position:50% align:center
We'll get to see every side
of Emma's charm this way!

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
Okay, rolling.

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center
You ready Emma? And action!

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hi, I'm Emma Verde and
I'm a foreign exchange student.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
<i>Ciao a tutti!</i>

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.174 position:50% align:center
Something's off here,
but I don't know what.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
Maybe she just needs a nap.

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
--[EMMA] Okay. I'll go change.
--[YU] So cute!

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Super cute. Like, no joke.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:19.234 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] You're wrong.
They don't interest me at all.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
Who was the girl that said that?
Was she the "real" Karin?

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Coming in!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.409 position:50% align:center
Huh? Something wrong?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
Nah, we're good.
Just came to check on you

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.246 position:50% align:center
since you've been
up here a while.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:32.455 position:50% align:center
Besides, we're the ones

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:34.249 position:50% align:center
who should be asking
if something's wrong.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Sorry. Didn't
mean to make you worry.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
That's like the opposite of
making you feel warm and fuzzy.

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Emma?

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
Oh! Never mind! I should get
changed. They're waiting.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
Right. That the latest
issue? Can I see?

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Go ahead.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.688 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Huh?

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
This is...

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
Karin.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.287 position:50% align:center
[YU, AYUMU]
Hm?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.208 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I'm really sorry,
but I have to go!

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
Where's my questionnaire?
Did I throw it away?

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:15:34.142 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, there.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
--C'mon!
--Huh?!

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hold on! Where are we going?

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
I want you to hang
out with me. Please?

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Uh.

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
Uh. Are we gonna run everywhere?

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the invite.
That was fun.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
Speaking of...

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
Hm?

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] This questionnaire
is yours, right?

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.453 position:50% align:center
I found it in the magazine
you gave me.

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
If it is yours... is that
how you really feel?

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
It says the thing you're most
interested in is school idols.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
That's just...

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
Just what? Another lie?

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:52.053 position:50% align:center
Why pretend you don't
like them when you do?

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
Tell me--why keep
those feelings bottled up?

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
I told you something.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
I said I wanted to
be the kind of idol

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.568 position:50% align:center
that makes everyone feel
warm and fuzzy inside.

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.237 position:50% align:center
But little did I know
I couldn't even make

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
the one who's closest to me in
the whole world feel that way.

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
Who am I kidding?

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
How can I expect to
bring others warmth

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.372 position:50% align:center
when my best friend's so cold?

00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
Emma...

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
Feels like it's been forever
since I've seen you smile!

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:26.171 position:50% align:center
Which is a shame because
your smile's beautiful!

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
So, I want to learn more
about you and see you smile!

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
You wanna know something?

00:17:39.934 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
Back when I helped you
reunite the idol club,

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
I really enjoyed that.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
Might even go so far
as to call it "fun."

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
All of you were heading
towards the same goal.

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
You butted heads and worried,
but also laughed.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
I used to consider that stuff
a colossal waste of time.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
It's not. I was wrong.

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
But that's not me.
It's not who Karin Asaka is.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
I'm not a happy-go-lucky idol,
I can't be.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
I'm cool and mature.
That's the path I chose.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:21.059 position:50% align:center
So, please, don't feel
guilty for any of this.

00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
It's far from your fault.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center
You are capable of
making everyone happy.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.278 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
It's okay. Honest.

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:35.657 position:50% align:center
Be whoever you wanna be,
but just keep smiling.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
Cause that's the best you!

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
Thank you for opening up.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
If you ever need to talk,
I'll listen.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:58.263 position:50% align:center
I'm right here!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.505 position:50% align:center
You really think so?
That I could be an idol?

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:57.590 position:50% align:center
I kinda think you already are.

00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.218 position:50% align:center
It happened the moment
you chose to be one.

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.594 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:42.654 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] What? Karin suddenly
wants to be a school idol?

00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:46.533 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I think it'll be fun!
After all, the more the merrier!

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
I like it.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:50.578 position:50% align:center
Aw! I get a new member
to cheer on! Awesome!

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:51.913 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
Sounds great! Then welcome
to the School Idol Club!

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.251 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much!

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:58.461 position:50% align:center
Hang on. You're still
gonna model, right?

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:00.338 position:50% align:center
So, won't your idol
schedule conflict

00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:01.881 position:50% align:center
with your modeling one?

00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:04.884 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I'll do my
best to make this work.

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.845 position:50% align:center
I wanna be amazing at both!

00:23:06.928 --> 00:23:07.887 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI gasps]

00:23:07.971 --> 00:23:10.807 position:50% align:center
--[SETSUNA] Huh?
--[KASUMI grumbles]

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50% align:center
Uh, people like you, Emma. The
views for your PV keep growing.

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.896 position:50% align:center
Same goes for the comments.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.773 position:50% align:center
--Really?
--Of course! It's you!

00:23:18.857 --> 00:23:21.651 position:50% align:center
Wow! I also showed it
to my family back home!

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:23.653 position:50% align:center
They were happy to see
I'm doing so well!

00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:25.071 position:50% align:center
Even better!

00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:30.368 position:50% align:center
Well, of course it's good.
I am the one who shot it.

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:32.495 position:50% align:center
Now that you're an idol,
you're next!

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:34.622 position:50% align:center
Sure, so long as you film it.

00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:36.124 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:41.129 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's the matter?
You okay?

[RINA gasps]

00:23:43.757 --> 00:23:45.592 position:50% align:center
It was nothing.

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:50.680 position:50% align:center
[RINA] Next time,
"The Shape of Smiles."
