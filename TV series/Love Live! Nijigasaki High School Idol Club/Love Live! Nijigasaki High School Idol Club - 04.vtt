her song and the wave

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:19.019 position:50% align:center
of excitement washed
over her audience...

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.688 position:50% align:center
[AI] ...it made me realize
that I wanted

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
to go down that uncharted
path for myself!

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.696 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What do you think?

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
[RINA]
Mm...

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
Should we do it?

[meows]

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
I say we at least try it out!

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why not? Let's try it out.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center

[SETSUNA] We managed to
scrounge up some extra chairs.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
Excellent job on the cleaning,
ladies, go team!

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.890 position:50% align:center
We just finished,
so you're right on time!

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:00.518 position:50% align:center
Nope, not yet!
There's one last thing.

[KASUMI laughs]

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
We're officially back in action.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
So, let's get this School Idol
Club meeting underway!

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
--[AI] Heya!
--[GROUP] Hm?

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
Did I hear you guys shouting

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.572 position:50% align:center
about the School
Idol Club just now?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.407 position:50% align:center
But wait, aren't you two...

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
I mean, what can
we help you with.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Ai Miyashita!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.290 position:50% align:center
And my name is
Rina Tennoji. Hi.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.124 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU gasps]

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.709 position:50% align:center
Wait, I know you.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Back when you were looking
for the School Idol Club, too!

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
I didn't care much at the time,
then I saw Setsuna

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.467 position:50% align:center
just singing her heart
out on the rooftop,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.095 position:50% align:center
and I was totally blown away!

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.472 position:50% align:center
Same here!
She just stole my heart!

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.808 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.227 position:50% align:center
To put it bluntly,
it was amazing.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.481 position:50% align:center
Um. Thank you both very much.

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.149 position:50% align:center
So, if you're
accepting applicants,

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:49.567 position:50% align:center
we'd love to give it a shot!

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
We welcome you with open arms!

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.989 position:50% align:center
I'm a total team-player
who's in it to win it,

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.367 position:50% align:center
so I'll be fully committed
to you girls!

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
But I admit I'm
a little clueless.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.038 position:50% align:center
What does a School
Idol Club do, anyway?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.373 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Hm?

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.875 position:50% align:center
You're not alone in that.
Even we haven't decided

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.628 position:50% align:center
what we want our
club to focus on yet.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Hm?

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
We're idols!

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
Of course, we have
things we wanna do!

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50% align:center
Live performances are a given,

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:46.976 position:50% align:center
you can't be an idol
without a stage.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.938 position:50% align:center
[KANATA] And we still haven't
performed together as a group.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
Let's take a moment
and brainstorm

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
the kind of live shows
we want to put on.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.027 position:50% align:center
I vote we do a national
tour together!

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
We should do a dance
where we all hold hands!

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Could be fun to act out
little skits between songs.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
If you include naptime,
that'd be great.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
I want everyone to have what
they love explode on stage!

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.208 position:50% align:center
Like using pyrotechnics
to actually light it up!

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.419 position:50% align:center
That doesn't sound safe.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
I would prefer a
cuter show without fire.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
It's getting a little heated.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.927 position:50% align:center
Everybody's saying
completely different ideas.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
With such passion, too!

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.933 position:50% align:center
[AI] What? Did I say
something offensive?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
'Course not.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:32.105 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Your turn.
What's your idea?

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.733 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:39.404 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure. Although!
I know I want it to be fun!

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
I think we can
all agree on that.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
For sure. Even if the audiences
we're performing for

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
aren't big at first,
it's not going to stop us

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
from doing what we love and
having fun the whole time.

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
Ahem. I think this
is a conversation

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.671 position:50% align:center
we should save for
another day. Right now...

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.089 position:50% align:center
We need to train!

00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
Because whatever
we decide to do,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
we need to make it spectacular,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.720 position:50% align:center
or we'll disappoint
our loving fans!

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
You mean like for
singing and dancing?

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
[KANATA]
Dancing, huh...

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
[AYUMU] I, personally, wouldn't
mind a singing lesson or two.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.520 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:14.064 position:50% align:center
Then why don't we split up
and practice the things

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
that we really want to
focus on. Sound good?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.443 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds perfect!

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.404 position:50% align:center
[AI] Quick question! Is it
cool if we do everything?

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
Fine by me.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, talk about
exciting! Right?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
[RINA grunts]

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.791 position:50% align:center
[KARIN]
I think you can go further.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.542 position:50% align:center
You thought extremely wrong.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[RINA grunting]

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
Is that seriously her limit?

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.635 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it is.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.178 position:50% align:center
[BOTH groaning]

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Dancers need to be flexible.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
So, you two are going
to have to work on that.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
While I'm thinking about it,

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
I should thank you
for helping out.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
You just caught me on a day
I had some free time.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's finish stretching.

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
You're gonna break my
poor little back in half!

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.195 position:50% align:center

Don't worry! I can help!

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
[AI] Okay. So, what do you say
we give it another shot?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
Take a deep breath in...

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.375 position:50% align:center
[KANATA, RINA inhale]

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
Now breathe out, nice and slow.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.421 position:50% align:center
[KANATA, RINA exhale]

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Heh.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.429 position:50% align:center
Perfect. It's more
fun when you know

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
the right way to stretch.
And the more you practice,

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
the more flexible
you're gonna be!

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
Mm. I'll keep at it.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
It's no wonder she's
the Club Building Hero.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.439 position:50% align:center
Hero?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50% align:center
So, you don't know?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.692 position:50% align:center
She's pretty well known
around here because

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
she goes from club to club,
helping them out.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Athletic clubs, that is.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
That's really neat!

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.033 position:50% align:center
Speaking of helping out clubs...

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
You helped reestablish ours,
but then didn't join,

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
which was quite the curve ball.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.665 position:50% align:center
[KARIN] Hm? Because I
never intended to join.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
I just hated seeing
Emma depressed,

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.419 position:50% align:center
so I did what I could
to change that.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
[KANATA, AI]
Really...?

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
What do you mean "really"?

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Karin.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
[gasps] It's not
that big of a deal.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:15.685 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI] A-hem. It's time for
Kasumin's lecture to begin!

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.437 position:50% align:center
Ooh! This sounds fun!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
Where did those glasses
come from?

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Setsuna let me borrow them
for a little while! Kinda.

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU] She's gonna be
mad when she finds out!

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
That's not the topic
of discussion! Osaka!

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:32.660 position:50% align:center
Please, enlighten us on what
it is school idols need.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Um...

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
The ability to express
themselves freely?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
Bingo!

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
[SHIZUKU]
Oh, I was just guessing.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.797 position:50% align:center
Now, this time I wanna
hear Tennoji's answer.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
What do all school idols need?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
Is it the ability to
connect with the people

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.304 position:50% align:center
who support them?

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
Exactly!

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
We're both right, huh?

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
[KASUMI]
Last up is Miyashita!

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.144 position:50% align:center
Yes? [laughs]

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
Beats me, I have no idea.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
Well, ring-a-ding-ding!
Because that's exactly right!

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
It is?

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Huh? Truth be told, yeah, I was.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
But what I wound up being most
surprised about was myself.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Hm?

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
[AI] The thing everyone seems
to be concerned with

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
is if they'll be able to fully
express themselves on stage.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center
I've helped out so many
clubs at Nijigasaki.

00:16:17.727 --> 00:16:19.145 position:50% align:center
But you know what?

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
They had that "teamwork makes
the dream work" mentality.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:26.319 position:50% align:center
So, I'm not used to
doing things alone.

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
[AI] It's different from
what I'm used to.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Why don't we
head out so the others

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.418 position:50% align:center
don't think we ran away?

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.671 position:50% align:center
They said nine. Don't wanna
race against the clock!

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
Are you all right?

00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:52.512 position:50% align:center
[laughing] That's hilarious!

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
Wait, wha--?

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.390 position:50% align:center
[AI] First you said the
thing about running away,

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
and topped that with
"race against the clock"?

00:16:57.726 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
You're too good at puns Emma!

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
I am? Oh!

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:04.107 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Those were awesome!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
I didn't even realize
I was being funny.

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:11.239 position:50% align:center
[AI, EMMA laughing]

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:13.533 position:50% align:center
[AI sighs]

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] I'm so happy you chose
to join the School Idol Club.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Oh? Why's that?

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.082 position:50% align:center
Because you're a
perpetual ray of sunshine.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
[AI] I guess it's hard for me
to see since I don't know

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.377 position:50% align:center
what I want right now.

00:17:24.461 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
You don't have to know,

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:28.423 position:50% align:center
you can still be your fun self
while you figure it out.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:32.844 position:50% align:center
Recently, our club disbanded,

00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
but we managed to come back
together and try it again.

00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
All of us have things
that we worry about.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
And yet I can't help
but think we're also

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.688 position:50% align:center
looking at the future
with bright eyes,

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
anticipating what
it has in store.

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:49.569 position:50% align:center
Oddly enough, that's what
makes us worry, too.

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
We know there's a step
we need to take,

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
we just need the
courage to take it.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:57.744 position:50% align:center
Your positivity's contagious and
I've seen so many more smiles

00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
on the girls' faces
since you joined!

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.665 position:50% align:center
You think so? But I
haven't done that much.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
And that makes it all
the more amazing.

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
By being myself?

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.463 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
By being yourself.

00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
You're the best!
Thank you! I am so pumped!

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
Where're you going?

00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.736 position:50% align:center
[AI]
The answer was simple.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
I love it when the people
around me are having fun.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
And it's even better when
I'm having fun with them!

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
What would be even better
is if we could share

00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
those positive feelings
as school idols!

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
If we can do that, I can run
down this uncharted path!

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.004 position:50% align:center
Wherever it may lead!

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I say bring it on!

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
[AI laughs]

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
[AI]
All of these people were here.

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
We're never completely
alone on a stage!

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.631 position:50% align:center
So awesome!

00:20:56.715 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect that, but she
completely owned that stage!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
I wanna see all of you sing
and dance just like she did!

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.349 position:50% align:center
Everybody's so
uniquely themselves,

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:07.475 position:50% align:center
and I truly believe that

00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
the possibilities for
you are endless!

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
I just can't wait to see
the shows you put on!

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.065 position:50% align:center
Because I know whatever
you girls decide to do,

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
it's gonna be great!

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
You know, Yu. Takes a
great girl to know one.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
[YU]
Huh?

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.658 position:50% align:center
Kanata's right about that!

00:21:23.742 --> 00:21:25.243 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling pumped.

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.202 position:50% align:center
[EMMA]
Mm!

00:21:26.286 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
[SETSUNA laughs]

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
Me, too!

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.678 position:50% align:center
[AI]
You may be a second-year, Ayumu,

00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:10.098 position:50% align:center
but your cuteness is only
second to your voice!

00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:13.476 position:50% align:center
That jog made my emotions run
high cause you know, jogging!

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.228 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:16.855 position:50% align:center
[AI]
We may be the School Idol Club,

00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:20.775 position:50% align:center
but we can't just
wait idol-y by.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.944 position:50% align:center
[YU] Please, stop.
I can't take anymore.

00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:25.447 position:50% align:center
She's really into
Ai's jokes, huh?

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.741 position:50% align:center
Yu's always had a
childish sense of humor

00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:31.286 position:50% align:center
since we were kids, and she
just never grew out of it.

00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.621 position:50% align:center
Where did all these
puns come from?

00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:36.833 position:50% align:center
They're a crucial part to
my school idol training!

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.251 position:50% align:center
[EMMA laughs]

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:50.930 position:50% align:center
[EMMA] Next time, "Something
I Can Only Do Right Now."
