[NARRATOR] On January 30th,
1961, as part of their manned

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
spaceflight initiative
known as Project Hermes,

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
the United Kingdom sent a vessel

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
into space containing
a live chimpanzee.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Despite an equipment failure
that nearly killed the animal,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.448 position:50% align:center
the craft returned safely.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
The chimpanzee,
whose name was Sam,

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
rapidly grew into a
beloved cultural icon.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.414 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
It's absurd!

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
If things continue to go
this smoothly for the UK,

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
they'll surpass
us in no time!

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
I apologize.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.756 position:50% align:center
After the issues during
N-Forty-Four's flight,

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
we were forced to make some
improvements to the cabin.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.760 position:50% align:center
But I assure you
that we're working

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:54.929 position:50% align:center
at the fastest possible pace.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Of course.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
Certainly. By springtime,
as we planned.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
Good to hear.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
I'm leaving it in your
hands then, Comrade Chief.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:12.322 position:50% align:center
That's quite a lot of fuss
over a silly little animal.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
I will not lose to a country
built on hamburgers!

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
I know, but if our men
should die in space,

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
that still won't be enough
to outdo a live chimpanzee.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
Let's focus on the next step:

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.379 position:50% align:center
Who's going to be part
of our Mechta Shest?

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.436 position:50% align:center
Wake up, Lev. It's time.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
The candidate graduation test

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
has now concluded.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.370 position:50% align:center
And out of these Mechta Shest,

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
the top three will be given
the title of "cosmonaut".

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Candidates four through
six will be our reserves.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
Private Mikhail Yashin.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.713 position:50% align:center
Yes sir!

00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.924 position:50% align:center
Private Roza Plevitskaya.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
Yes sir!

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
And our third-place cosmonaut...

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
...is Private Lev Leps.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES murmur]

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
Huh...? Oh! Sir!

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.191 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] Finally. I'll announce
the three reserves.

00:03:53.274 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
Private Semyon Adamov.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center

Sir!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I did it... They picked me.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
I'm going to space!

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Congratulations, you two!

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
Let's all do our best!

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
Only the first cosmonaut will
be remembered in history.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.590 position:50% align:center
The other two don't
count for a thing.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.593 position:50% align:center
Well, we all want to
be first, but still,

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
this is a massive honor for us.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
We're comrades working
to reach space.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
That's a nice sentiment.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.019 position:50% align:center
It sounds like the brass
values your team spirit.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.895 position:50% align:center
But while your tongue
may be made of honey,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
it's clear that you
have a heart of ice.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Good job, I guess. Hmph.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
We'll see you around, Lev.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.619 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It's fine. I am who I am.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! I should tell Irina!

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Oh.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.795 position:50% align:center
Huh? Hey. I earned a
spot in the top three,

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
just like I promised
you I would!

00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
You could try to be
a little excited.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but they still
haven't picked you

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
to be the first one in space.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
Plus, you got third place,
you barely succeeded!

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.686 position:50% align:center
That's our Irinyan.
Don't let her fool you, Lev.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.814 position:50% align:center
Believe me, she was dying
to find out the results.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
And get this. On New Year's Eve,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
she wished on a pinecone
that you would make the cut!

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.028 position:50% align:center
Sweet, right?

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
Be quiet!

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
Why a pinecone?

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
Um. Don't listen to Anya.
She's just running her mouth.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
Look, you. Stop smiling--!

[ANYA, LEV laugh]

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.971 position:50% align:center
Take this seriously!

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
You might get to become the
world's first cosmonaut!

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
Me? No, the world's
first cosmonaut is--

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
If you let another human take
the title, I'll bleed you dry.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Then you'll be a mummy!

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
And you wouldn't
want that, right?

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.988 position:50% align:center
Don't screw it up!

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
[LEV] A sudden stop at a
hundred kilometers per hour?

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
[PAVLOV]
During the test flight,

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.090 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four passed out just
before she reached zero-G.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
That was alright in her case.
But for the real flight,

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
we need you to remain
conscious until the end.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:31.182 position:50% align:center
To prepare, you'll sit in
this special device here.

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
It'll help acclimate you
to drastic deceleration.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.563 position:50% align:center
That's insane.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
Heh! Don't worry.
We've already run some tests,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
and the machine
is absolutely safe.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
Now then, which of you
would like to go first?

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:48.908 position:50% align:center
I'm ready. Let's go!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] In light of the
new data from N-Forty Four's

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
successful launch with the
Nosferatu Project, the cosmonaut

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.184 position:50% align:center
training regimen was adapted
for human spaceflight.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
[LEV] If Irina got through this,
then I can too!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
I promised her that I
would go to space,

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
and I refuse to let her down!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Irinyan...! Irinyan?

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm?

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I tried knocking first.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I've got news
from the training center.

00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
You might want to hear it!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Okay, obviously the
first-place candidate

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.717 position:50% align:center
is Comrade Mikhail Yashin.

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
He's got a stellar reputation,
high test scores,

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
and good looks to boot!

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
Second place,
Comrade Roza Plevitskaya,

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
or the White Rose of Sangrad!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
But you're well-acquainted
with her.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.441 position:50% align:center
The White Rose of Sangrad, huh?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.151 position:50% align:center
That's a weird name.

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
Well, she is full of thorns,
so I suppose it makes sense.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
There's been some
controversy over it.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
People are kind of upset
they chose a woman.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Why does that matter?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.123 position:50% align:center
Officially, the UZSR
claims that it doesn't,

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
but still, her chances
are awfully slim.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Okay, so what about Lev, then?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
Ooh, you sound eager!
Wonder why that is?

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.133 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Aw, come on, Irinyan,

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
it's not worth running
away from home over!

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
I just need air. Calm down!

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Shouldn't you
take your coat, though?

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
What's bothering you?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Hey, Anya,
would you say I've proven

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
myself useful since
I've been here?

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.657 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.493 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] The exams you've done,
the data you've gathered.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
You learned helpful
things from those, right?

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
What I'm asking is,
do I still have some value?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Of course you do!

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't for you,

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
they wouldn't know how
to improve the spacecraft!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
And training's better now, too!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Let's hope you're right.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Please don't worry, Irinyan.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
Everything'll turn out okay.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.533 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50% align:center
[STEPAN sighs]

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50% align:center
[SEMYON sighs]

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
It's kind of cool eating
in the suit, huh?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
And we'll be training
in the cabin.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.387 position:50% align:center
Little things like that make
all this feel so real.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.097 position:50% align:center
--Oh yeah?
--Of course!

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
Just the thought of going
to space, it's all so exciting!

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
And what makes you
think you'll be selected?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
Honestly. Your attitude
is obnoxious.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Alright! I'll see
you in the drop zone!

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Huh?

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[ROZA gasps]

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
[ROZA grunting]

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
Oh no!

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
[LEV yells]

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
It's not serious.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't need to
drop out of your training.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
But I do suggest that you
get three days of rest.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
You're quite accident-prone.
Watch yourself, will you?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] Lev! Are you
trying to die out there?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
At least that's
what I would say,

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't just
made me so proud.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
You did great, Lev.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
Risking your life to save
a comrade in peril.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
That's what a soldier does.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
Hmph.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
So, Roza. How is she?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It's a good
thing no one was hurt.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
And now we're getting
three days off!

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Talk about lucky, right?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
Yeah.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
[ROZA] But tell me,
why did you save me?

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I have?
If a friend's about to die,

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
you don't just sit
back and do nothing.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
I reacted on instinct,
that's all.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
So we're friends, huh?

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
Before I said your
tongue is honey

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
and your heart is
made out of ice.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
But that's wrong.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think your heart
is made out of honey, too.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
And sugar and jam, as well.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. That sounds
like heartburn.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hey, let me grab a drink.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
It's my treat.
Why don't we sit down?

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
I'm done, by the way.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
I'm saying that I'm
out of the running.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
Face it, if not for you,
I'd be dead.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
My whole body froze up on me.
I thought it was all over.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
When I enlisted
in the Air Force,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
everyone thought less of
me because I was a woman.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
That made me furious and I
refused to let anyone defeat me.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Whenever people taunted me,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
I'd turn around and
crush them in dogfights

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
till that's what
I was known for.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
The White Rose of Sangrad,
that's what everybody called me.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
But...

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Roses don't suit me.
They're too beautiful.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
This whole time I've been
pushing myself so hard,

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
my only option was
to be the best,

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
to outscore you and Mikhail.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they'd never let a
woman go into space first.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
Gender doesn't matter at
all when it comes to being

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
a capable cosmonaut.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
You're the only person
I know who feels that way.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
[ROZA sighs]

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
I don't like admitting it,

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
but you're much
stronger than I am.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Not just physically,
but emotionally, too.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
You made that
perfectly clear today.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I couldn't
stand to be bested.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
Instead, I attacked others
because it felt like

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
the only way I could
protect myself.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
So I'm not some beautiful rose.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
I'm just a tangled-up vine,
covered in sharp thorns.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
Lev Leps.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
I want to say sorry
for everything.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
Try to forgive me, if you can.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
And, um, the same to her.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hm? Oh, Irina?

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
I don't know why I said
all those awful things.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
She survived that
rigorous training

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
and made it back from space.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four is an
amazing cosmonaut.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
It's Irina. Irina Luminesk.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
Irina.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
You're right. Of course
she has a name.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
The vampire test subject who
beat all of us to space.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
Still hard to believe.

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
So where is she right now?

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Has she been disposed of?

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
No. She can't be.

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Not if there's any justice.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Huh? What's the matter,
did you forget something?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
I changed my mind.
We can skip the soda water.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
I feel like going shopping.

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
U-Uh...?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
This is a surprise.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
You never want to come
into town just to shop.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs] Hey, I'm not
always a shut-in, you know.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
And I won't get another
chance for a while.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Uh... That's true.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
So, um, have you decided on what
you're going to say to Lev?

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I'll just tell him the
same thing they told me.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Is that okay, though?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
It doesn't really concern Lev.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Nothing I do does. Not anymore.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Oh, no!

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A grunts]

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
Irinyan!

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Wait, stop! Don't run away!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
What happened? Are you hurt?

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Natalia?

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA grunts]

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A]
Please don't do this!

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
I was disposing of that
vampire for the motherland!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
But there was no order.
You acted on your own.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
And the organization
won't have that.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A]
As long as she's alive,

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
our state secrets
will be in danger!

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
I was trying to--!

00:17:58.661 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
He's late!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
He should be here soon.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] How does he
expect to go to space

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
if he can't even
show up on time?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
[ANYA sighs]

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
So you hurt yourself
while protecting her?

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Yeah, but it's not
serious or anything.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
See? I'll be fine.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
So I haven't seen
you in a while, Lev.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
True.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
I've been too busy with
my training to come by.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
How long has it been now?

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
Getting close to
a month, I guess.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Is that
why you're mad?

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm not mad.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're in high
demand lately, right, Mr. Hero?

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
Hanging out with
your human friends,

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
knocking back soda waters.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
Soda water?

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
We can't have alcohol at this
point, so I do drink that a lot.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
But...

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Hm. So, uh, that's all
you wanted to say?

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...
Actually, one more thing.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
What is it then?

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
Just that... I'll be
leaving the city.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
I'm transferring to Sangrad.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
They want me there.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
I'll keep getting health exams,
but they'll have some work

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
for me in the
Design Bureau, as well.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Really? You're leaving?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
That's right. Real soon.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
Um, Comrade Chief wouldn't
take no for an answer.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
He said that he saw firsthand
what a quick learner Irinyan is

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
and that her flight experience
was too valuable to go to waste.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.
Well, that's a big relief.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] The only downside is
that she's supposed to start

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
on March first.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh? That's in two days!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. And I know
tomorrow is kind of sudden,

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
but I think we should
throw a party.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
Both as a farewell to her
and a good luck to you!

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
Okay. Sounds good.

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, and tomorrow's
Armed Forces Day, isn't it?

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Yep, it's a national holiday,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
which means all three
of us will be off!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Let's celebrate
all day!

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess it'll be
all night, in our case.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
Do you like that idea?

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Go for it, Irinyan.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
I don't need a going away party,

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
but it couldn't hurt
to wish you luck.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
Not because I care!

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
I just don't want some other
human to get picked instead!

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
I get it. Thank you.

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
Alright, sounds like a plan!

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
There's just
one problem, though.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
I have to go to
Sangrad tomorrow,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
so you'll be
partying without me.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
But, oh well,
can't change it now!

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
[LEV, IRINA]
Huh?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
What? Why didn't you tell me
you were doing something?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
That's weird. I thought
I mentioned it before.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
You liar!

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
And in this country, it's bad
manners to cancel something

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
last-minute, isn't that right?

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
Uh, maybe?

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
[LEV, IRINA sigh]

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
Okay, tomorrow at six, then.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
Anya.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
Those two are so clueless.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[giggles] But all they
need is a little push!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
[bells chime]

00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Right on time, huh?

00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
