00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
And what makes you
think you'll be selected?

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
Honestly. Your attitude
is obnoxious.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL] Alright! I'll see
you in the drop zone!

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Huh?

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:45.645 position:50% align:center
[ROZA gasps]

00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:52.444 position:50% align:center
[ROZA grunting]

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.782 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.932 position:50% align:center
Oh no!

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
[LEV yells]

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.372 position:50% align:center
It's not serious.

00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.832 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't need to
drop out of your training.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.169 position:50% align:center
But I do suggest that you
get three days of rest.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
You're quite accident-prone.
Watch yourself, will you?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] Lev! Are you
trying to die out there?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
At least that's
what I would say,

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
if you hadn't just
made me so proud.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
You did great, Lev.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
Risking your life to save
a comrade in peril.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.690 position:50% align:center
That's what a soldier does.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
Hmph.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.655 position:50% align:center
So, Roza. How is she?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It's a good
thing no one was hurt.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
And now we're getting
three days off!

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Talk about lucky, right?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.793 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
Yeah.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
[ROZA] But tell me,
why did you save me?

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I have?
If a friend's about to die,

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.594 position:50% align:center
you don't just sit
back and do nothing.

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
I reacted on instinct,
that's all.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
So we're friends, huh?

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
Before I said your
tongue is honey

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
and your heart is
made out of ice.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
But that's wrong.

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think your heart
is made out of honey, too.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.865 position:50% align:center
And sugar and jam, as well.

00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. That sounds
like heartburn.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hey, let me grab a drink.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
It's my treat.
Why don't we sit down?

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:25.972 position:50% align:center
I'm done, by the way.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
I'm saying that I'm
out of the running.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
Face it, if not for you,
I'd be dead.

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
My whole body froze up on me.
I thought it was all over.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.115 position:50% align:center
When I enlisted
in the Air Force,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
everyone thought less of
me because I was a woman.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
That made me furious and I
refused to let anyone defeat me.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.875 position:50% align:center
Whenever people taunted me,

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
I'd turn around and
crush them in dogfights

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
till that's what
I was known for.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
The White Rose of Sangrad,
that's what everybody called me.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:06.971 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
But...

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
Roses don't suit me.
They're too beautiful.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
This whole time I've been
pushing myself so hard,

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:21.486 position:50% align:center
my only option was
to be the best,

00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:24.197 position:50% align:center
to outscore you and Mikhail.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they'd never let a
woman go into space first.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
Gender doesn't matter at
all when it comes to being

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.789 position:50% align:center
a capable cosmonaut.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
You're the only person
I know who feels that way.

00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.845 position:50% align:center
[ROZA sighs]

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
I don't like admitting it,

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
but you're much
stronger than I am.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.394 position:50% align:center
Not just physically,
but emotionally, too.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.855 position:50% align:center
You made that
perfectly clear today.

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.440 position:50% align:center
That's not true.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:04.029 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I couldn't
stand to be bested.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
Instead, I attacked others
because it felt like

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.200 position:50% align:center
the only way I could
protect myself.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
So I'm not some beautiful rose.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:15.623 position:50% align:center
I'm just a tangled-up vine,
covered in sharp thorns.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
Lev Leps.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
I want to say sorry
for everything.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.008 position:50% align:center
Try to forgive me, if you can.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.180 position:50% align:center
And, um, the same to her.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hm? Oh, Irina?

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
I don't know why I said
all those awful things.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
She survived that
rigorous training

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.274 position:50% align:center
and made it back from space.

00:15:41.358 --> 00:15:44.611 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four is an
amazing cosmonaut.

00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:47.447 position:50% align:center
It's Irina. Irina Luminesk.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.282 position:50% align:center
Irina.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
You're right. Of course
she has a name.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
The vampire test subject who
beat all of us to space.

00:15:57.916 --> 00:15:59.417 position:50% align:center
Still hard to believe.

00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:00.877 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
So where is she right now?

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Has she been disposed of?

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
No. She can't be.

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.108 position:50% align:center
Not if there's any justice.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Huh? What's the matter,
did you forget something?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
I changed my mind.
We can skip the soda water.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
I feel like going shopping.

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
U-Uh...?

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
This is a surprise.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
You never want to come
into town just to shop.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.795 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs] Hey, I'm not
always a shut-in, you know.

00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
And I won't get another
chance for a while.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:49.342 position:50% align:center
Uh... That's true.

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
So, um, have you decided on what
you're going to say to Lev?

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I'll just tell him the
same thing they told me.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Is that okay, though?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
It doesn't really concern Lev.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Nothing I do does. Not anymore.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:07.027 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Oh, no!

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A grunts]

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center
Irinyan!

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.124 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
Wait, stop! Don't run away!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
What happened? Are you hurt?

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.339 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Natalia?

00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA grunts]

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.304 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A]
Please don't do this!

00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
Let me go!

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:38.099 position:50% align:center
I was disposing of that
vampire for the motherland!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
But there was no order.
You acted on your own.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
And the organization
won't have that.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
[MAN IN BLACK A]
As long as she's alive,

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
our state secrets
will be in danger!

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
I was trying to--!

00:17:58.661 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
He's late!

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
He should be here soon.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] How does he
expect to go to space

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
if he can't even
show up on time?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
[ANYA sighs]

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's wrong?

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.427 position:50% align:center
So you hurt yourself
while protecting her?

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Yeah, but it's not
serious or anything.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.224 position:50% align:center
See? I'll be fine.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
So I haven't seen
you in a while, Lev.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
True.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
I've been too busy with
my training to come by.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.815 position:50% align:center
How long has it been now?

00:18:26.898 --> 00:18:29.442 position:50% align:center
Getting close to
a month, I guess.

00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Is that
why you're mad?

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm not mad.

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're in high
demand lately, right, Mr. Hero?

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.368 position:50% align:center
Hanging out with
your human friends,

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
knocking back soda waters.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
Soda water?

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
We can't have alcohol at this
point, so I do drink that a lot.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
But...

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Hm. So, uh, that's all
you wanted to say?

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:56.469 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...
Actually, one more thing.

00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
What is it then?

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
Just that... I'll be
leaving the city.

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.728 position:50% align:center
I'm transferring to Sangrad.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.438 position:50% align:center
They want me there.

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
I'll keep getting health exams,
but they'll have some work

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:11.735 position:50% align:center
for me in the
Design Bureau, as well.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
Really? You're leaving?

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
That's right. Real soon.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
Um, Comrade Chief wouldn't
take no for an answer.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
He said that he saw firsthand
what a quick learner Irinyan is

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.915 position:50% align:center
and that her flight experience
was too valuable to go to waste.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.
Well, that's a big relief.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] The only downside is
that she's supposed to start

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
on March first.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh? That's in two days!

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. And I know
tomorrow is kind of sudden,

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.512 position:50% align:center
but I think we should
throw a party.

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:42.432 position:50% align:center
Both as a farewell to her
and a good luck to you!

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:45.143 position:50% align:center
Okay. Sounds good.

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.937 position:50% align:center
Oh, and tomorrow's
Armed Forces Day, isn't it?

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Yep, it's a national holiday,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
which means all three
of us will be off!

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:54.235 position:50% align:center
Perfect! Let's celebrate
all day!

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess it'll be
all night, in our case.

00:19:57.822 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
Do you like that idea?

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Go for it, Irinyan.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:10.418 position:50% align:center
I don't need a going away party,

00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
but it couldn't hurt
to wish you luck.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
Not because I care!

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
I just don't want some other
human to get picked instead!

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
I get it. Thank you.

00:20:22.514 --> 00:20:23.973 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
Alright, sounds like a plan!

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
There's just
one problem, though.

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:30.146 position:50% align:center
I have to go to
Sangrad tomorrow,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
so you'll be
partying without me.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.942 position:50% align:center
But, oh well,
can't change it now!

00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.402 position:50% align:center
[LEV, IRINA]
Huh?

00:20:35.485 --> 00:20:38.279 position:50% align:center
What? Why didn't you tell me
you were doing something?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
That's weird. I thought
I mentioned it before.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.242 position:50% align:center
You liar!

00:20:42.325 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
And in this country, it's bad
manners to cancel something

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
last-minute, isn't that right?

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
Uh, maybe?

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center

[giggles]

00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:01.136 position:50% align:center
Okay, tomorrow at six, then.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.307 position:50% align:center
Anya.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
Those two are so clueless.

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
[giggles] But all they
need is a little push!

00:21:33.585 --> 00:21:35.879 position:50% align:center
