Yes, I did, sir. Even if
something goes wrong,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.046 position:50% align:center
I need to report that

To be honest, when you
asked them to pull over,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
I was secretly hoping
you had gotten sick,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center

It took me long enough,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
Why they chose you.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center

from the Zirnitra Union!

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
This development will
change the world forever.

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
Through the power of science,

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
our motherland has ushered
in the era of space conquest!

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:49.644 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow!

Huh?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
They succeeded! Lev is in space!

[ANNOUNCER A] Major Lev Leps
is currently in correspondence

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
with ground control and
is reporting no issues...

[IRINA]
He's in space right now?

[ANNOUNCER A]
When describing the view,

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
he remarked that our planet
looked as though it were wrapped

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50% align:center
in a bright blue veil!

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Wait a minute.
That's what I said!

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] And that the stars
resemble a beautiful garden

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.445 position:50% align:center
of white chervil flowers!

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
Those were my words exactly!

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.116 position:50% align:center
You didn't even know
what a chervil was!

Lev...

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.354 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Why? Is it just
because I'm a vampire?

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lev, why did you use my words?

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Also.

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:25.782 position:50% align:center
Major Leps wanted to share
a special message with us.

[IRINA gasps]

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center

Explain yourself, Lev!

[ANNOUNCER A] "Once I'm back
from space," he says.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
"we should have some <i>kholodets</i> ".
My, what a patriotic gesture!

[ANYA] <i>Kholodets</i> . He may
have said it to everyone,

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
but he meant that
message for you.

[IRINA gasps]

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] I can't imagine the
pain you must feel right now.

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:07.574 position:50% align:center
Lev sharing your words
is the only way that

00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:11.244 position:50% align:center
the rest of the world will ever
get to know what you've done.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
But still... I'll always know!

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
And Lev knows it, too!

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.793 position:50% align:center
We know how hard you
worked to make it there!

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center

My dear Comrade Leps.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center
It's an honor to speak
one-on-one with the man

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
who led our
motherland into space.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It was a group effort, sir.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
My colleagues are the
reason I survived.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] As I'm sure you know,
having been the first human

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.892 position:50% align:center
ever to accomplish such
an incredible feat,

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.103 position:50% align:center
your name is going
to be immortalized

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center

There's no greater honor.

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:28.279 position:50% align:center
Major, I've been sent here to
escort you to your lodgings.

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.329 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The world's
first cosmonaut, huh?

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
It's time to greet
the public, Mister Hero.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
And do try to be personable.

[PARTYGOERS chattering]

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I didn't know you were
here, you should've said so.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you made
it home safe!

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
I wanted to thank
you personally.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
Well done, Private--Major Leps!

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
Nice work getting promoted!

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.872 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot, Chief.

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
Huh? Something wrong?

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
I hope you're not too exhausted,

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
or you won't make it through
tomorrow's celebration.

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.755 position:50% align:center
It's the newspaper.

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:31.009 position:50% align:center
They didn't mention your
name even once, sir!

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN laughs]

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:37.390 position:50% align:center
Is that really all
that's bothering you?

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
Though, if I thought it would
improve our finances,

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:44.105 position:50% align:center
then I'd print my face on
every surface in the UZSR!

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Also.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:46.232 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
Hm?

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
I made it back because of
what she accomplished.

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.112 position:50% align:center
Because of Lycoris.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
ou're worried about what
will happen to her,

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
aren't you, Aster?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
I swear, I'll do all I can.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
But I make no promises.

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
As I said from the start,

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
you're expected to set
aside everything for this.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Do you know
why I recommended you

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
for the cosmonaut position?

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:15.553 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
No.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] It was because
I believed that you had

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
the resolve to lead this
world of ours into a new age,

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
and I still do.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
I wonder what he meant.

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:27.732 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] Zero points!
It needs to show more gratitude

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
to the motherland and
our leader! Start over.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
I don't know where your
head is at the moment,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.532 position:50% align:center
but it's certainly not here.

00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Could it be that you're
thinking about our

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
cute little test subject again?

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center

You're supposed to treat her

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
like an object, remember?

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
Irina. What are going they
going to do with her?

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:52.382 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] We dispose of
things we no longer need.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.300 position:50% align:center
That's how our country works.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:59.264 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] As of yesterday,
your life has changed.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.060 position:50% align:center
How delicious.

00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
You have become the first
cosmonaut in history.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
A title like that brings
massive responsibility.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:14.988 position:50% align:center
You should've known it wouldn't
be all fun and games.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:18.533 position:50% align:center
I mean, I told you what I was
looking for in a cosmonaut.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.035 position:50% align:center
Do you recall?

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
Someone who'll lead us to
the future. Isn't that right?

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.540 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] Yes. And now
that you've ventured

00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
into the new world
known as space,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.295 position:50% align:center
you're in a unique position
to influence the people.

00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:33.465 position:50% align:center
You have the power to
ignite a drastic change,

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
so you can choose to savor their
accolades like sweet chocolate,

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
or to feed them poison,
like a lycoris flower.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
Write your speech.
Your public awaits.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
She's crazy. That not me at all.

A threat disguised as a plea?

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
Come now!

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
Preparations are now complete.

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
Hm! Tomorrow's events will
surely go down in history.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.608 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
Good.

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
This nation, no, the entire
world will remember it forever.

Long live our Zirnitra!

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
I have some bad news, Irina.
My orders have changed.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center

assigned to you anymore.

Oh.

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center

to ask a favor of you.

[gasps]

00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Can you give
this to Lev for me?

00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
And say "congrats"?

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
Your pendant.

00:21:26.828 --> 00:21:28.955 position:50% align:center
No, you have to give
him that yourself!

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.291 position:50% align:center
Anya, I just can't.

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
You're the person who
opened the path to space.

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:38.757 position:50% align:center
Quitting is the one
thing you can't do!
