[NARRATOR] After the World War
that divided the globe,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
it wasn't long before the
Zirnitra Union in the east

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.095 position:50% align:center
and the United Kingdom of
Arnack in the west both set

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
their sights on space,
which had yet to be claimed.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
The UZSR moved first.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
On October Fourth of 1957,
the UZSR successfully launched

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:55.402 position:50% align:center
the first satellite into orbit.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
One month later, they sent
the first animal into space.

Hey, Lev!

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir! What is it?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
Come with me, please.
Comrade Chief wants to see you.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:47.931 position:50% align:center
Wonder why?

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
What kind of trouble
have you gotten into?

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's nothing!

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Trust me,
it's definitely something.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
No way he would bother
coming out here otherwise!

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
Nice knowing you, pal.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.069 position:50% align:center

Time's wasting, Lev!

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Sir!

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
It's been a while.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50% align:center
I take it you've been training
hard in hopes of being selected

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
to man the first
human spaceflight?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
I have, Comrade Chief.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, after your
incident occurred,

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50% align:center
you needed to be demoted
to a reserve candidate.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
Despite how impressive your
marks are, there's currently

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
zero chance you'll be
chosen for the mission.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
I understand that, sir.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I believe I've found
another use for your talent.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
I'll be placing you
on a special project.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
Uh! Yes, sir!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] The Manned
Spaceflight Project, "Mechta."

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
Our main goal is the same.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
However, the Committee
has added a new objective.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] This will defeat
the UK for certain!

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
Not only will we put a
human being into space,

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
but we'll broadcast it all live
for the entire world to see!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.460 position:50% align:center
Broadcasting it live? But what
if something were to go wrong?

00:06:58.543 --> 00:07:00.670 position:50% align:center
We couldn't cover it up
like the last time.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.505 position:50% align:center
Yes, exactly.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
Dr. Mozhaysky, would you mind
explaining the problem

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
we're facing in
greater detail, please?

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:11.139 position:50% align:center
Well. There are things
a dog can't tell us.

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
Can people function
in zero gravity?

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
Will the sight of Earth
make them homesick

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
and cause depression?

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] Our cosmonauts
are national heroes.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
If they're hurt or killed
on live television,

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
it'll be a catastrophe.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] When we expressed
our concern to the Committee,

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:31.493 position:50% align:center
they demanded that we carry out
an outrageous experiment first.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
One that would
involve humans?

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.664 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] Experimental subjects
are nothing more than objects.

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
This order comes straight
from the Supreme Leader.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
If we don't succeed,
our lives may be forfeit.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
So, what am I supposed to do?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY]
Huh?

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I'm the subject, right?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY] Don't be absurd.
If we sent you into space,

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
that would make you
an actual cosmonaut.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Then who is it?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
It's not a human.
It's a vampire.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.233 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.736 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Vampires are a
rare and elusive species,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
isolated deep within the
mountains of UZSR territory.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.535 position:50% align:center
Most people have a
frightening image of them

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.496 position:50% align:center
based on the way they
appear in movies and books,

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:19.749 position:50% align:center
but have never actually
encountered one.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
That description matched
Lev's experience exactly.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
[chains rattle]

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY]
Huh?

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY]
Come on out, now.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:13.136 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
That girl is a vampire?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY]
Correct.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:18.641 position:50% align:center
But, please, just call
it N-Forty-Four.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
Though vampires have
particular traits and abilities

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
that set them apart
from our kind,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
they're biologically quite
similar to humans.

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center
Therefore, they're ideal
as subjects for our work.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.988 position:50% align:center
Since it isn't
technically human,

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
it won't be counted
as a human flight.

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
And if it dies, well,
it'll be easy to cover-up.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:42.999 position:50% align:center

Mm... Um--

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
Now, as for you, my boy.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Sir!

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:49.506 position:50% align:center
Here are the details
of your task.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
You have four main objectives.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
The first, is that for the two
months leading up to launch day,

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
you are going to be responsible
for closely monitoring

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
and training N-Forty-Four.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.729 position:50% align:center
Secondly, you will keep
N-Forty-Four's identity

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
a secret from all civilians.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Irina Luminesk, age 21?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.988 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY] Three. Ensure the
subject does not escape.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.448 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.784 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY] Four. You will
reside in the adjacent room

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
in order to maintain
constant supervision.

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait a second.
I'm living here?

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
Yes, your personal effects
have already been moved

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
into the neighboring cell.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
[chuckles nervously]

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
On your feet, N-Forty-Four.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
Now, remember, Lev.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
When you take it outside,
you'll have to hide its ears.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
So we're allowed to go outside?

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
If you don't, the boredom
may kill you.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.981 position:50% align:center
Think of it as though
you're taking a puppy out

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:50.108 position:50% align:center
for a brisk walk.

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
Alright then. I suppose
I'll be on my way.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.362 position:50% align:center
You're making me do this alone?

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:55.780 position:50% align:center
[MOZHAYSKY]
Certainly not.

00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
You'll have an assistant who's
well-versed in vampires.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.619 position:50% align:center
Anya!

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.080 position:50% align:center
She may be young,
but she's extremely bright.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
I'll be entrusting her
with the finer details.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
My name's Anya!

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
I'll be working with you as
N-Forty-Four's health manager,

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
so direct all of your
questions to me!

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
Um, hello there.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you know this already,
but since N-Forty-Four

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.514 position:50% align:center
is an experimental
test subject,

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
you must treat it as such.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:24.684 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Sir!

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
Well, there go my dreams.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.572 position:50% align:center
May I continue my intro, please?

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] First of all, vampires
are at a physical disadvantage

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:43.453 position:50% align:center
when they're in the sunlight,
so daily training will be

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
conducted from dusk until dawn.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Great, so I'm
nocturnal now, too.

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:52.003 position:50% align:center
[LEV] By the way,
if vampires see the sun,

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
do they turn to ashes?

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.674 position:50% align:center
Of course not, that's
nothing but a myth!

00:11:55.757 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
It does cause their skin
to tingle, and they're more

00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
susceptible to heatstroke, but
typically vampires don't face

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
mortal danger from
simple exposure.

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.308 position:50% align:center
They do have the unique
ability to see things clearly

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.686 position:50% align:center
in the dark thanks to their
night vision, though.

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Here, have a look
at today's schedule.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.403 position:50% align:center
Meal time, a city tour,

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
and then she goes to sleep
until dusk tomorrow.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
Wait, a meal?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.200 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.915 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
But doesn't she drink blood?

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
No, she'll be given
the same food as you

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:32.377 position:50% align:center
and the other residents.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
So, not blood?

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
The other candidates are
socializing in the cafeteria.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.885 position:50% align:center
Hurry over there
and introduce her!

00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
Roger that.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Irina.
Put these clothes on, okay?

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
No, Lev, you aren't
supposed to use her name!

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.732 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I'll have to call her
Irina when we're in town.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:54.983 position:50% align:center
I don't follow you.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
Well, if I call
her N-Forty-Four,

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.903 position:50% align:center
people will be suspicious,
don't you think?

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure.

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.243 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Now you look like
a normal candidate.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:28.224 position:50% align:center
[LEV] About 9,000 people live in
this city doing space research.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.603 position:50% align:center
But, it's not on any maps and
they're not registered citizens.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
[LEV] That's because our
work is a national secret.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
This is the cafeteria.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
I'll introduce you, okay?

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
But, take the hat off.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
You might as well get it
over with quick, right?

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[LEV] This is N-Forty-Four:
Irina Luminesk.

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
All right, guys?

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
Let's find a seat.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE B]
Heh. N-Forty-Four, huh?

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE C]
Who's that?

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE D]
Those pointed ears.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
And fangs.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.853 position:50% align:center
You think that she'll bite?

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:16.690 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATE E] She's got
vampire skin and eyes.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
She looks like a human.

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
Except for the parts that
are full-on monster.

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
[hisses]

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:30.120 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Look out!
I'll suck your blood!

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
[YUSTIN laughs]

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Yustin. Give it a rest.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
You're such a fool.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.213 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
[YUSTIN sighs]

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
Would you still say that
if you were alone?

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.850 position:50% align:center
--[YUSTIN] Yeah, so what are--!
--Tasteless.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:53.601 position:50% align:center
That's why I hate humankind.

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hey!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.236 position:50% align:center
Does she really hate humans?

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second, guys!
Forget the blood stuff!

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
She eats regular food,
just like we do, okay?

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
I thought Lieutenant-General
Viktor would've told you that.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
[shuffling, clapping]

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:17.334 position:50% align:center
Welcome, to the forefront
of space research!

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.710 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:18.793 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
She's devoted her life to
furthering our pursuits,

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
say thanks!

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
Mikhail...

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think it's best if
we let Lev take over from here.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:35.602 position:50% align:center

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA]
I hear you eat what we do.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
Have some borscht.
It's a Zirnitra specialty.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
I was instructed to make sure
you get a bit of this, as well.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sniffs]
Is that milk?

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:32.659 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.090 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The residential sector
has lots of things.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Libraries, restaurants,
some schools too.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.346 position:50% align:center
And there's even a lake you can
skate on in the wintertime.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
What is it? Is something wrong?

Don't look!

Stay away from me, human!

00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:13.241 position:50% align:center
But I saw... crosses.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Huh? Crosses?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.206 position:50% align:center
What did you think? I'd die?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.128 position:50% align:center
So you're okay?

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
It's all just nonsense
you humans made up.

Hey, what's that thing?

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Mm?

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
That's, uh...

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Go on, tell me.

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:41.603 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Well...

00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
It's the grave of Maly,
the first dog in space.

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Tsk. So you
treat them as objects

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
and then mourn their lives?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
No, it wasn't always this way.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.910 position:50% align:center
Actually, Maly was very loved.

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:00.455 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Three years ago,
the government commissioned

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
the first animal
spaceflight in history.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
Demanded, really.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:07.087 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, the ship
wasn't finished,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
it wouldn't be able to return
safely in that state.

00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
But the government's
words were final.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center

Rapid heart rate and breathing!

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center

Forty-two, forty-three

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center

Due to extreme heat,

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.409 position:50% align:center
Maly died within a
few hours of liftoff.

00:18:37.492 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
A few hours?

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
But I read in the paper that
it flew for a whole week!

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
Was that a lie?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.293 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I think I've said too much.

00:18:47.377 --> 00:18:50.255 position:50% align:center
After that, it became
an unwritten rule

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
that we treat
subjects like objects.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.556 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Isn't that just a way
for people to run away

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.058 position:50% align:center
from the guilt?

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.476 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Who knows?

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I guess that
makes you lucky, then.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
At least I'm a cursed

--[LEV] I didn't say--
--[IRINA] It's fine.

It's not like I want sympathy
from some human, anyway.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:25.290 position:50% align:center

No. To me...

[IRINA]
Of course I'm not cold.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.526 position:50% align:center
You should know that my species

extremely well.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:38.446 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's right.
You're weak against the heat.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center

Get out of here, then.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50% align:center

Sorry. I didn't think of that.

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:50.250 position:50% align:center
And in the cafeteria.

No, wait. There's more.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
I treated you differently.
