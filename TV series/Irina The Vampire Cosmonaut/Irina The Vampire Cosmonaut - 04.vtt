00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.596 position:50% align:center
We have some news
for you, Comrade Leps.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.099 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four's launch
date has been finalized

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
and will be held on the
twelfth of December.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.813 position:50% align:center
Training will continue until
the week prior to the event.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.024 position:50% align:center
That gives you three
more to work with.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.317 position:50% align:center
How's that project
coming along so far?

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
It's going well.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:30.488 position:50% align:center
I have confidence she'll
be ready by the date.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Excellent. Then, get to it.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Lieutenant General.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
Do we have an update concerning
the ship or rocket at this time?

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:45.128 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
We're in a crunch!

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
Drop the emergency rations
or spare equipment!

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.592 position:50% align:center
I don't care, just get
that weight down!

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
I'll take responsibility,
understood?

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.512 position:50% align:center
[ENGINEERS]
Yes, sir!

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] To compensate
for N-Forty-Four's size,

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.267 position:50% align:center
which was much
greater than a canine's,

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
major adjustments had
to be made to the craft.

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:03.980 position:50% align:center
However, with each upgrade,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.900 position:50% align:center
the chances of the ship
not working as intended

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.652 position:50% align:center
increased significantly.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN groans]

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.201 position:50% align:center
I have to see this
thing through.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center line:10%
â™ª

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
[LEV] So, basically, you'll be
in orbit around the planet

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.848 position:50% align:center
for one hour and fifty minutes.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.516 position:50% align:center
At that point, you'll descend

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.644 position:50% align:center
and make your landing
in Palma Plains.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
Like I mentioned before,
once you're ejected,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.776 position:50% align:center
you'll use jumping equipment to
make it safely back to earth.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.945 position:50% align:center
Now. I know you haven't
parachuted on your own yet,

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid you'll have
to master it in three weeks.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.700 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Okay, got it.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:22.452 position:50% align:center
Now, can we start training?

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.788 position:50% align:center
The centrifuge is
up first, right?

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] A few days later,
the space suit arrived 

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
at the Training Center.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.093 position:50% align:center
Feeling special?

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50% align:center
You get to try that suit
on before anyone else!

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.349 position:50% align:center
Ha! Guess I'm
breaking it in then.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.393 position:50% align:center
[SCIENTIST A] This equipment was
constructed with protection

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.311 position:50% align:center
and durability in mind.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
The bright coloring is designed
to make it easier to locate you

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
in any terrain or
weather conditions.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:56.403 position:50% align:center
It's so heavy, and hot, too.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.697 position:50% align:center
And don't forget that you'll
also be lugging around

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
a parachute.
Better get used to it.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.786 position:50% align:center
[IRINA groans]

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
[IRINA pants]

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.585 position:50% align:center
[LEV] C'mon. You're gonna
catch a cold.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.634 position:50% align:center
[IRINA yelps]
Stop looking, you creep.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.594 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I wasn't, I swear!

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
You're in charge of me!
Fetch me my clothes already!

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.027 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
I heard that the vampire
got to try on the spacesuit.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
You should have seen it.
She looked so ridiculous.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[ROZA] How are you
not upset about this?

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:50.623 position:50% align:center
She's taking everything from us.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
I guess it doesn't
matter to you,

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
since you're the
one helping her.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm just
doing my job, alright?

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Naturally...

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.635 position:50% align:center
Ha. It's not like it matters.
She has one purpose.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
And when they're finished
with her, she'll be disposed of.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
It must break your heart to
know you're aiding in her death?

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Please, don't say that.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.980 position:50% align:center
She seems awfully obedient,
if you ask me.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
I starting to wonder
if she's a U.K. spy.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
She's not that sort of person!

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.611 position:50% align:center
A person?

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.238 position:50% align:center
Do you actually believe
that experiment is a person?

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
She's an object. Get it right.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.659 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:32.332 position:50% align:center
Irina...

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
If there's something you
want to tell me, 

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
then you can say it to my face.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
Even if your launch
is successful,

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
I still won't acknowledge you.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.183 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less about
what your kind thinks!

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.228 position:50% align:center
Careful how you're speaking
to me, blood sucker!

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.730 position:50% align:center
Can we take it down
a notch or two?

00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
[ROZA grunts] I wouldn't get too
comfortable around this one.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
She's waiting to sink
her teeth in you.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
So how much did you overhear?

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
I heard enough of it.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about her.
Roza's like that with everyone.

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.670 position:50% align:center
Her bark is louder
than her bite.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:32.976 position:50% align:center
Hey. I know what I said before,
but what do you think of me?

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:38.189 position:50% align:center
Wait! It's not like that.
Don't make it weird.

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
It's just, other people
suspect I'm a spy,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.986 position:50% align:center
but that that thought never
seemed to occur to you.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Which made me wonder.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
I dunno. On one hand
I think that's silly,

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center
but on the other, you do
seem a bit too passive

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
for being forced here.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Forced?

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
Huh? You weren't, then?

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
No, I volunteered.

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:02.756 position:50% align:center
When the UZSR people came to
my village, I offered to go.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
You signed up?

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
That's right. There were other
candidates at the time too,

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
but I came of
my own free will.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
My mistake. That's what
I get for assuming.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.061 position:50% align:center
I thought it was something
like you were abducted

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:17.187 position:50% align:center
and your family was held host--

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.105 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Stop making things up.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Point taken. I'm sorry.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Hang on, why did you--

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.030 position:50% align:center
That's enough.
I'm an object, right?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The Arctic
Air Mass known as "Moroz"

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:42.504 position:50% align:center
chilled the region
with an icy breath.

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
LAIKA44 braced itself for
the long and bitter winter

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
that lay ahead.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
Next week, you'll be put into
an anechoic altitude chamber.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
A what? Think you
can explain that?

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.481 position:50% align:center
It's solitude training.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.818 position:50% align:center
The anechoic altitude chamber is
a room with increased oxygen 

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
levels and lowered air
pressure to mimic space.

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.032 position:50% align:center
They're designed to absorb
all sound, so you won't be able

00:08:11.116 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
to hear anything, even noises
made within the chamber itself.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.248 position:50% align:center
You'll be locked inside for days
with sensors attached to you.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]
What's the point of all this?

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
It's all to help you get
acclimated, since you'll

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
be flying in a cabin with
very similar conditions.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.677 position:50% align:center
Solitude is something that
most people will struggle with.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
Plus, there's a possibility that
some issue might come up.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.725 position:50% align:center
You need to be ready in
case you're stuck in space

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
for a week.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.854 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Okay. And how long
will I be in the chamber?

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
Anywhere between
one and ten days.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.692 position:50% align:center
You're done when the door opens.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
The experience is something
I dread, personally.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
I'd try to relax beforehand.
You know, have some fun.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.626 position:50% align:center
Uh, but do what you want!

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.423 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] And how would
you suggest I do that?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:12.427 position:50% align:center
Relax? I suppose I
like the jazz bar.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
A bar? You drink there?

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:17.682 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you not enjoy
drinking alcohol?

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
Where I come from,

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.935 position:50% align:center
you're not allowed to drink
until you're 20 years old!

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:24.397 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm 17, so...

00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Huh? You are? Your ID
said you were 21!

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I heard it would
make things easier

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
if I was seen as an adult.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
Got ya. It's no wonder I
thought you looked so young.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.453 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
Well, good on you for obeying
the drinking laws then.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Anyway, I'll start
getting ready.

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
I'm fine with the
jazz bar idea.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.339 position:50% align:center
If you're not going to drink,

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
then I take it
you're a jazz fan?

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Does it matter?

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
I mean, um...

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Wait a sec.
Have you never heard jazz?

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Well, they serve
other kinds of drinks,

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
and I think you'll
enjoy the music.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
But, we don't have to--

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
Stop with all the questions!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
Let's just go!

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
First time seeing
you out of uniform.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
I feel anxious.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
No surprise.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
Cold out, huh?

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
It's not.

Huh? What is that?

Huh?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's a phonograph.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
It plays music off that spinning
disc you see there on top.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Never heard music like this.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
We've only been allowed
to listen to it recently.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
Jazz was banned in the Union,

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
just because it originated
in the United Kingdom.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
What's the name of this song?

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
"My Beloved."

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I like it, even though
I can't make out all the words.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]
Well, are you ready to order?

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Seems you've turned into
a real fan of soda water.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a special
occasion, right?

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
She likes the stuff after all.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Nope, nothing.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
Fine, I admit it's tasty.

Why are you staring at me?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Oh, sorry.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Mm.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
What kind of drink
did you order?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty red color.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
Want a sip? They make
it from soaking <i>oleaster</i>

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
in <i>zhizni</i> for about
three weeks.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
It's called <i>nastoyka</i> .

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
No thanks. Pretty sure
I told you I'm only 17.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
You know, here in the UZSR,
the drinking age is 16.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll like it even
more than soda water.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
Okay. I suppose just one sip.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
[IRINA whimpers]

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
Yuck! It's like my
tongue's on fire!

enjoyable about that!

Hey. Hey, Lev.

[LEV] Huh? Lev?
She called me by my name.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center

Excuse us!

Are you hurt?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
I'm a-okay.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
As I was saying.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
When did you first know that you
wanted to go into space someday?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm curious.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
When I was five.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I saw a plane.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
It was crossing in front of
the full moon, and I thought,

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
maybe it could take me there.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Seems dumb looking back,
but there you have it.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted
to visit the Moon.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
I assume it's the same for
U.K. cosmonauts, too.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
The contrast is hypnotizing.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
We live in such an ugly world,
but space is so beautiful.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
I don't believe we
should corrupt space

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center

Natalia! Why are you here?

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
Now, now. I may spend a lot
of time in the kitchen,

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
but I don't actually
live there, you know.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
That wasn't what I meant.
I'm surprised to see you!

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center

Right. I'm sorry.

Is "Snow Thaw" Lev
here bothering you?

What's that mean?

Come on, Natalia! You don't
have to tell her about that!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
It's a nickname he earned
because he gets so heated up

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
talking about space.

[IRINA] I don't know.
What else is there?

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
[LEV] We could catch a movie,
play billiards...

Hey! Hold on!

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That was great!

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
You know, going to space seems
so far-fetched, even now.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
I suppose it still is
since I'm a reserve.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
Why is that anyway?

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I was under the
impression you had high marks.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I got into a
fight with a superior.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] What happened?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The son of a chief
engineer blamed a new

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
He took it out on the
guy and got him fired.

The graduate apologized,
but things turned ugly,

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
and he wound up
getting assaulted.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center

and watch, so I charged in.

That's "Snow Thaw" Lev for you.

You heard that part?

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
When they look at my kind,
I wonder what most humans see.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
As a kid, I lost my parents.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
I was only three years old when
they got caught up in the war.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
They were burnt to death.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Many villagers lost
their lives that day.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]  You know, the meaning
of my name is "peace."

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
And yet, here we are.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Hey, have you heard vampires
called "People of the Moon"?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I actually thought that
was true when I was younger.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
As People of the Moon,

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
we're "other" and hated
on this planet.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
I wanted to take this

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
However, without wings it
always seemed impossible.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
That changed when the
UZSR people arrived.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm fine with
being an experiment,

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
because I need human technology.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
I just want to see space.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It all makes sense now.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
So that's why she puts up
with so much during training.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
You've been fascinated by
it... since you were a kid.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I wanna beat
the humans to space!

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
If I can accomplish that,

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
then I don't care
if I'm disposed of.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I wish to see the Moon
before your people defile it.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
So, please, stick with
me a while longer.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Of course!
I'll make sure that happens.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
I'm by your side,
no matter what.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
You're such a weirdo.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad you're the
one supervising me.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm gonna do another loop!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Go for it.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
I can't remember anything
that happened last night.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
We got back from ice
skating on the lake

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
and you passed out.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
I did what now?

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
Oh, Irinyan.

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
I'll be isolated from
humans a few days?

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
Sounds fantastic.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:11.581 position:50% align:center
