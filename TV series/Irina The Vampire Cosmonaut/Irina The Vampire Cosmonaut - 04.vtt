00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
Well, they serve
other kinds of drinks,

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
and I think you'll
enjoy the music.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
But, we don't have to--

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
Stop with all the questions!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.357 position:50% align:center
Let's just go!

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
First time seeing
you out of uniform.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
I feel anxious.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
No surprise.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:33.466 position:50% align:center
Cold out, huh?

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.844 position:50% align:center
It's not.

Huh? What is that?

Huh?

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:00.994 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's a phonograph.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
It plays music off that spinning
disc you see there on top.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.167 position:50% align:center
Never heard music like this.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
We've only been allowed
to listen to it recently.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
Jazz was banned in the Union,

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
just because it originated
in the United Kingdom.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
What's the name of this song?

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
"My Beloved."

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.401 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I like it, even though
I can't make out all the words.

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]
Well, are you ready to order?

00:11:41.493 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Seems you've turned into
a real fan of soda water.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a special
occasion, right?

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
She likes the stuff after all.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Nope, nothing.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.761 position:50% align:center
Fine, I admit it's tasty.

Why are you staring at me?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Oh, sorry.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Mm.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
What kind of drink
did you order?

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
It's a pretty red color.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
Want a sip? They make
it from soaking <i>oleaster</i>

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
in <i>zhizni</i> for about
three weeks.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
It's called <i>nastoyka</i> .

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:36.256 position:50% align:center
No thanks. Pretty sure
I told you I'm only 17.

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.260 position:50% align:center
You know, here in the UZSR,
the drinking age is 16.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:43.930 position:50% align:center
Maybe you'll like it even
more than soda water.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.392 position:50% align:center
Okay. I suppose just one sip.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
[IRINA whimpers]

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.233 position:50% align:center
Yuck! It's like my
tongue's on fire!

enjoyable about that!

Hey. Hey, Lev.

[LEV] Huh? Lev?
She called me by my name.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.172 position:50% align:center

Excuse us!

Are you hurt?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.473 position:50% align:center
I'm a-okay.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.645 position:50% align:center
As I was saying.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
When did you first know that you
wanted to go into space someday?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.359 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm curious.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:43.114 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
When I was five.

00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.868 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I saw a plane.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
It was crossing in front of
the full moon, and I thought,

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.207 position:50% align:center
maybe it could take me there.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.044 position:50% align:center
Seems dumb looking back,
but there you have it.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:58.505 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted
to visit the Moon.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.675 position:50% align:center
I assume it's the same for
U.K. cosmonauts, too.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
The contrast is hypnotizing.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
We live in such an ugly world,
but space is so beautiful.

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
I don't believe we
should corrupt space

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center

Natalia! Why are you here?

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
Now, now. I may spend a lot
of time in the kitchen,

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
but I don't actually
live there, you know.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
That wasn't what I meant.
I'm surprised to see you!

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:32.330 position:50% align:center

Right. I'm sorry.

Is "Snow Thaw" Lev
here bothering you?

What's that mean?

Come on, Natalia! You don't
have to tell her about that!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50% align:center
It's a nickname he earned
because he gets so heated up

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.309 position:50% align:center
talking about space.

[IRINA] I don't know.
What else is there?

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
[LEV] We could catch a movie,
play billiards...

Hey! Hold on!

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That was great!

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
You know, going to space seems
so far-fetched, even now.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
I suppose it still is
since I'm a reserve.

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
Why is that anyway?

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I was under the
impression you had high marks.

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I got into a
fight with a superior.

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] What happened?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.168 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The son of a chief
engineer blamed a new

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
He took it out on the
guy and got him fired.

The graduate apologized,
but things turned ugly,

00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
and he wound up
getting assaulted.

00:18:58.805 --> 00:19:01.933 position:50% align:center

and watch, so I charged in.

That's "Snow Thaw" Lev for you.

You heard that part?

00:19:22.287 --> 00:19:26.332 position:50% align:center
When they look at my kind,
I wonder what most humans see.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
As a kid, I lost my parents.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
I was only three years old when
they got caught up in the war.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
They were burnt to death.

00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:40.764 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Many villagers lost
their lives that day.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:46.144 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]  You know, the meaning
of my name is "peace."

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.397 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
And yet, here we are.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Hey, have you heard vampires
called "People of the Moon"?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:00.075 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I actually thought that
was true when I was younger.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
As People of the Moon,

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.329 position:50% align:center
we're "other" and hated
on this planet.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:28.895 position:50% align:center
I wanted to take this

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
However, without wings it
always seemed impossible.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
That changed when the
UZSR people arrived.

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.781 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm fine with
being an experiment,

00:20:39.864 --> 00:20:42.450 position:50% align:center
because I need human technology.

00:20:42.534 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
I just want to see space.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.915 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It all makes sense now.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
So that's why she puts up
with so much during training.

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
You've been fascinated by
it... since you were a kid.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I wanna beat
the humans to space!

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.099 position:50% align:center
If I can accomplish that,

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:08.393 position:50% align:center
then I don't care
if I'm disposed of.

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:14.733 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I wish to see the Moon
before your people defile it.

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:18.194 position:50% align:center
So, please, stick with
me a while longer.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Of course!
I'll make sure that happens.

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.702 position:50% align:center
I'm by your side,
no matter what.

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
You're such a weirdo.

00:21:31.875 --> 00:21:34.586 position:50% align:center
But I'm glad you're the
one supervising me.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm gonna do another loop!

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.341 position:50% align:center
Go for it.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
I can't remember anything
that happened last night.

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:48.975 position:50% align:center
We got back from ice
skating on the lake

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.185 position:50% align:center
and you passed out.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
I did what now?

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.105 position:50% align:center
Oh, Irinyan.

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:00.570 position:50% align:center
I'll be isolated from
humans a few days?

00:22:00.653 --> 00:22:02.405 position:50% align:center
Sounds fantastic.
