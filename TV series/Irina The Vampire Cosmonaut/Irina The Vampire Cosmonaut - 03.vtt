00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:54.177 position:50% align:center
That's it! What if she knew?

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Today, we'll be doing
some special training.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
I think it'll help you
overcome your acrophobia.

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50% align:center
That wild imagination of yours

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
has only been
making things worse.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Okay, what's the plan?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
It might sound drastic,
but... we're gonna fly!

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]
You're kidding!

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.548 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.841 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Here we go, Irina!

00:10:48.148 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
[yelps]

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.214 position:50% align:center
[LEV] We'll keep going
higher and higher

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.342 position:50% align:center
until we're above the clouds!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Open your eyes!

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I'm trying, alright?

00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The first time I flew,
it felt like I had wings!

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:48.875 position:50% align:center
After that, my entire outlook
on life was different!

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.460 position:50% align:center
I hope this gives you
a sense of freedom,

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
instead of the fear
you feel now!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Freedom...

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.585 position:50% align:center
Beautiful!

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the boundary between
the earth and outer space!

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
You doing okay?

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:40.969 position:50% align:center
Yeah! This is great!

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
[LEV] How long until I can
go beyond these clouds?

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.394 position:50% align:center
So, Irina.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Uh! Uh... never mind.

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Hey, isn't that
where your homeland is?

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.908 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Want to get a closer look?

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.369 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
No. Let's go back.

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
The sun's coming up.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Thanks for that.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center
Now I don't feel
nervous anymore!

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:29.976 position:50% align:center
[LEV laughing]
Really? I'm so glad!

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
Good for you!

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
Idiot.

00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
That blood is for
emergency transfusions.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
LEV gasps]

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
Where are you taking that?

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
There was an accident
at Albinar!

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.053 position:50% align:center
Some of the engineers
were hurt pretty bad!

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've ever
heard of Albinar.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
It's a base that specializes

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
in launching rockets
and satellites.

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Seems like a lot of panic.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
Was it really only a few people?

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.863 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] The tragic reality
of what happened at Albinar

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:29.119 position:50% align:center
that day was that an ICBM had
exploded during a test launch.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:32.914 position:50% align:center
Over 500 people lost
their lives in the accident.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
However, the true
nature of the event

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
was concealed by a
sweeping public coverup.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.463 position:50% align:center
News stories were
rushed out claiming

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
that a plane had crashed.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
But within the government,
there were whispers that

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
the ICBM explosion had been part
of a carefully orchestrated

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:52.559 position:50% align:center
scheme by an
unknown entity.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.230 position:50% align:center
[LEV] After the flight,
it seemed like we had

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
taken care of Irina's
debilitating fear of heights.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Her training was
progressing, but...

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.906 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Five-point landing!

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
Feet, calves,
thighs, hips, back!

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
[IRINA grunts, shouts]

00:15:18.877 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Ouch...

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
I fell on my nose.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you've gotten
a lot better at this

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
since you first started.
Let's take a quick break.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
Ah! That's so good.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
Nice of 'em to give
us soda water.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] What happened after the
Albinar accident, by the way?

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.154 position:50% align:center
Will it interfere with the
launch plans at all?

00:15:46.237 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It'll most likely be
settled in a few days.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
There'll be someone new put in
charge to move things along.

00:15:51.993 --> 00:15:53.453 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Oh, okay.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Why did a missile explode

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
at a space research base?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Because of the
engine fuel, I guess?

00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
No, not that.

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.884 position:50% align:center
I'm asking you why they were
test-launching missiles at all.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.427 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec.

00:16:09.511 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
You do know what rockets are
being developed for, don't you?

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:15.141 position:50% align:center
Of course, for spaceflight.

00:16:15.225 --> 00:16:17.268 position:50% align:center
Actually... they're
weapons of war.

00:16:17.352 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
Instead of firing nuclear
warheads at the UK,

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
we'll be the nation that
launches people into space.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
The first human spaceflight
is going to be

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.907 position:50% align:center
the first human missile!

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:34.953 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding.

00:16:35.036 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
I can really only hope they're
manufacturing rockets

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
for the sole purpose
of spaceflight.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Is that kind
of future possible?

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
It could be, in better times.

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Just after the war ended,

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
my elementary school
teacher told me,

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
"Planes are for soaring
through the sky.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
They're not weapons
built for killing people."

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
The next day, she was gone,

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
taken in by the Committee
for State Security.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.164 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Teacher!

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
All she did was tell the truth,

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.007 position:50% align:center
and they sent their
"Delivery Crew"

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
to drag her off as an
enemy of the state.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That's awful.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I know it's unlikely,
but I hope she's still alive.

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
That's enough talk
about the past.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to get
back to training?

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Only one month remained
until our December launch date.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.413 position:50% align:center
So, I decided that we should
take Irina's parachute practice

00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
to the next level.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
I'll be in control of
everything this time.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
You can just relax!

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:10.340 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:18:10.423 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do,
remember to remain calm.

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
If we get all tangled
up somehow,

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
then we could plummet
to our deaths.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Stop trying
to make me nervous!

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.518 position:50% align:center
[LEV laughs]
Okay, get ready!

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.936 position:50% align:center

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center

Don't panic!

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
Spread your limbs,
nice and wide!

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
Like this, right?

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, you've got it!

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:47.043 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
It's hard to breathe up here!

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
Hurry, do the parachute!

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
Don't let your guard down.

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
There's a whole list of steps to
go through for a safe landing.

00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.691 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center

[IRINA exhales]

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
Just take it easy. Your first
try can be a sensory overload.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.124 position:50% align:center
We can stop now if you--

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
No, I want to do it again.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
We still have some
time before sunrise.

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
We should keep going while
it's fresh in my memory.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
Uh... 'kay.

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
That girl's really tough.

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
I'm honestly impressed.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
She puts up with everything the
vice-director throws at her.

00:19:50.106 --> 00:19:52.025 position:50% align:center
--Listen, Franz.
--[FRANZ] Hm?

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.902 position:50% align:center
Do you think she has a
reason for pushing it

00:19:53.985 --> 00:19:55.570 position:50% align:center
so hard all the time?

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Huh?

00:19:56.946 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
I mean, if she were
a normal candidate,

00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
there're any number
of things it could be.

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
Patriotism, or a
soldier's honor.

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
We all had our reasons for
wanting to take this job.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ chuckles] Not to mention,
there were plenty of people

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.920 position:50% align:center
who just thought it
would be fun to fly.

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50% align:center
I'm not a candidate
anymore, but I get it.

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
She's different, though.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:21.096 position:50% align:center
Why torture herself?
She has nothing to gain from it.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
