00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
attended that private
Committee meeting?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Maybe what they're planning to
do with you after your exam?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
Like, kill me?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
No, they didn't mention that.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Not at all?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
Nope. They're probably
still deciding.

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
Either way, you should
be worried about you!

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
If you let yourself
lose to those morons,

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
then you'll see a side of
me you really won't like!

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't want that
to happen either, okay?

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Sounds pathetic,
even for you!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
Come on, I made it
to space and back,

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
and you were my instructor!

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
I want you to swear to me
that you'll get picked!

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
Even if it's a total lie!

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center
Well, I won't be able to
look after her anymore.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
So do you think you can keep
her out of trouble for me

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
while I'm gone?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
I've got you covered!

[LEV]
Thanks.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] I am pleased to report
that the Nosferatu Project

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
was a resounding success.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four's cooperation
with our research

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
certainly played a part
in making this possible.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
As such, it's only fair
to reward her once

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
the real first
spaceflight is complete.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Following the
triumphant result of the 

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
Nosferatu Project, the UZSR
promptly directed its attention

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
toward their next space-travel
endeavor, the Mechta Project.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
And since Irina Luminesk,
officially known as

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four, had proven
herself so valuable

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
to the nation's goals,
her disposal was postponed

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
to allow for additional
experimentation.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
However, the decision to
keep N-Forty-Four alive

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
for an unspecified amount of
time was considered by some

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
parties to be a
security concern.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
As such, those individuals
wished for the arrangement

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
of an "accident" to
preserve state secrets.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
let us unite as one to keep
this land growing strong

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center

greater possibilities!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center

So what is this about?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
It's just some sketches.

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
Can't a person draw things
when they're bored? 

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm no art critic,

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
but who draws a
carrot on a pancake?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center

It's a moon landing.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
Now tell me why
you're in here,

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
and it better not be
to do another exam.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
It's New Year's Eve!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm here
<i>because</i> it's New Year's.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Is that?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Yup! An authentic Lilitto dress!

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
But why did you bring it?

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
We're going out on the town!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
I want us to celebrate
New Year's together!

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
[ANYA yelps] You're the cutest
thing that ever lived!

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
[IRINA whimpers]

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
It looks so good!
Don't you just love it?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
Um. Well, it fits.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
Great! Ready to go?

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] I was born in Lilitto,
just like you!

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
But because I was a war orphan
who grew up in Sangrad,

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I don't have a lot
of vivid memories

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
of what life was like there.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
How did you end up in Laika?

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] I joined the Air
Force Medical Institute

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
after my graduation.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
That was where I started reading
up on all the vampire stuff.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
I was fascinated right away!

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
You weren't scared of us?

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] The orphanage
teachers were scarier.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Picture a whole school
full of Sagaleviches.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That's awful.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
I know!

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
She's Snegurochka,
the famous Snow Maiden!

Oh, then Happy
New Year, Snegurochka.

And that man over there is

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
the Snow Maiden's
grandfather, Ded Moroz.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Together, they're the
very spirit of New Year's

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
in the UZSR.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center

You too!

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
She was nice.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
I wonder how she'd react if she
found out that I was a vampire.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
I think the fact that
you've been to space

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
is a bigger shocker
than that, honestly.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet the people
in my hometown

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
would be surprised, too.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
They probably assume
that I'm dead.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
And who knows what they'd
say if they saw me

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
getting along with
humans like this?

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
I know! You and I should
celebrate Lilitto-style!

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
[ANYA giggles]

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] If you wish on a
pinecone and throw it in

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
a river, the water purifies
it and answers your prayer.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
So they say, anyway.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
But sadly, there's no
river in Laika-Forty-Four,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
so I guess we'll
just have to settle

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
for this man-made lake instead.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
And it's frozen, which means
the pinecone won't sink.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Beautiful. Almost like
the whole thing was wrapped

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
in a sparkling blue veil.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
It was hard to believe this
was the place I came from.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Wow.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
And the stars looked like a
garden of chervil flowers.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
You lost me there.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
It's an herb that blooms
in little white clusters.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
Look it up when you have time.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to
when we get back.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
And the moon was
so breathtaking.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
It made me think about
how badly I want to go,

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
and about how I
don't want to die.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lev?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hm?

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
You should know, seeing the
moon while I was floating

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
in space made me
realize something.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Um, the truth is...

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] N-Forty-Four!
Private Lev Leps!

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Stay where you are!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
We're here to bring
you back to base!

[IRINA]
You can't just sneak in.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
I told you!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[LEV, ANYA giggle]

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
So what are these flowers for?

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
[LEV] They're a present for
the world's first cosmonaut.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, thanks, I guess.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] Why would you
do something like this?

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
There are too many kinds here.
The smell's all mixed up.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sniffs]
That was stupid.

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
You know,
since my parents died,

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
nobody's ever put on any
kind of celebration for me.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I wish all three billion
people in the world

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
were allowed to know what a
wonderful thing you've done.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]
More importantly, the test!

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
How was it?

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
I gave it my best shot.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
So now all that we
can do is wait.
