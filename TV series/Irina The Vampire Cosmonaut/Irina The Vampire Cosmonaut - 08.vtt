[grunts]

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
[PAVLOV] You hit your leg
pretty hard in the snow.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
It's possible you broke a bone.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
We'll keep an eye on it for now.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.112 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.524 position:50% align:center
[ANYA giggles]

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.238 position:50% align:center
We're so delighted
to have you back!

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
Come, everyone!

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.118 position:50% align:center
Let's hear a round of
applause for N-Forty-Four!

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.295 position:50% align:center
How was your trip to space?

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
I'm eager to hear
everything about it!

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.176 position:50% align:center
Miserable, to tell
you the truth,

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.636 position:50% align:center
since you stuffed me
inside that hunk of junk.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
Hm?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
Hunk of junk, eh?

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you what,
we'll talk later.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.397 position:50% align:center
For now, we should toast!

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.567 position:50% align:center
Nastoyka's your favorite, yes?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
I never said it was my favorite.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, I forgot.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't drink until after
your health exam, anyway.

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
Not the point.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
In any case, you did very well.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Aw, I'm so proud of you!

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Hunk of junk...
Did you hear that, gentlemen?

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
We've got our work
cut out for us!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
Alright, does everyone have
their hamburgers in hand?

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.264 position:50% align:center
[PARTY]
Yeah!

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
The one thing the UK's got!

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE A]
Ha!

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.689 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE B]
I knew we'd succeed!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE C]
Long live Zirnitra!

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE D]
So long, Arnack!

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.443 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE E]
Here's to the Motherland!

00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
[MALE PARTY ATTENDEE F]
Hear, hear!

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
So, how's the leg
holding up, Lev?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:08.832 position:50% align:center
Hurt much?

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
A little. The painkiller's
are wearing off.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.253 position:50% align:center
That's a bit concerning.

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
You're returning to
Laika tomorrow, right?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50% align:center
You should talk to the doctor.

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
Thanks. I will, sir.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
By the way.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
First thing tomorrow morning,
N-Forty-Four's going to Sangrad.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.643 position:50% align:center
She's scheduled to attend
a private committee meeting

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:29.936 position:50% align:center
with the chief.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Private?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
He said he wanted to discuss the
details of how the flight went.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.376 position:50% align:center
[LEV] When I returned
to Laika Forty-Four,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.421 position:50% align:center
the usual sights of the city
were there waiting for me.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
[LEV] There was no
celebration for Irina,

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.511 position:50% align:center
just the same ordinary
days as before.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
The paperwork said the
centrifuge I broke had

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
"worn down due to old age".

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Franz and Vice-Director
Sagalevich were transferred,

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
and any mention of their
involvement in what happened

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
was erased from record.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.612 position:50% align:center
Since I was only a reserve
candidate, that's all I knew.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
The details were handled by
authorities far above my head.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.036 position:50% align:center
What really shocked me was
that my leg was mostly fine,

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
despite how serious
the pain was,

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
and that Natalia was
still a dorm matron.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.713 position:50% align:center
[LEV] For the most part,
everything turned out all right.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
So Irina really
went up there, huh?

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.436 position:50% align:center
Reserve cosmonaut candidate,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.773 position:50% align:center
Private Lev Leps,
reporting in, sirs.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
First, I'd like to commend
you for your part

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.737 position:50% align:center
in the success of the
Nosferatu Project.

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Thank you.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.032 position:50% align:center
Nothing is set in stone,
but while we wait

00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.660 position:50% align:center
for certain other decisions to
be made, the Committee wants 

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.955 position:50% align:center
us to continue studying
N-Forty-Four's biology.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
And for you, Lev,
I have more news.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.169 position:50% align:center
Esteemed Comrade Leps.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
In recognition of your
outstanding service,

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
you are hereby promoted
to the rank of candidate.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:27.095 position:50% align:center
Try to keep your nose clean
or you'll be demoted again.

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
Sir!

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I'm in!

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
We'll administer the graduation
test on January 26th

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:38.523 position:50% align:center
and 27th to identify the six
among you who are worthiest

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
of belonging to our
prestigious Mechta Shest.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Of that elite group,
only the top three individuals

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
will compete for the
honor of flying to space

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.616 position:50% align:center
and making history as the
world's first cosmonaut.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.201 position:50% align:center
Assuming everything
goes as planned,

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
the Mechta Project is scheduled
to get underway in the spring.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.831 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
Since you've become
a candidate again,

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.045 position:50% align:center
you are to return to
residing in the dormitory.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] The examiner will
take charge of N-Forty-Four.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
And... what happens
after her health exam?

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:11.514 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
Hm... Alright, now listen to me.

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:13.558 position:50% align:center
If you become the
world's first cosmonaut,

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
you'll have a greater
responsibility than ever before.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
For one thing, your words
won't just be your own.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.610 position:50% align:center
You must devote everything to
the motherland, heart and soul.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
That means putting
our nation's interests

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.280 position:50% align:center
ahead of even your loved ones.

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
Comrade, can we count on you?

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Of course. I live
to serve the motherland.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] That's good.
You've done some excellent work.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.002 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
seeing you again.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:45.674 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Y'know, you're a
big part of the reason

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
I got that promotion.

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.719 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] It's not like I
went to space to help you.

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.805 position:50% align:center
Anyway, about your leg.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
I don't want to hear
that you failed the test

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.225 position:50% align:center
on my account, okay?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
So watch it.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
I'm totally fine. Almost healed.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.648 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Ow!

00:08:03.274 --> 00:08:04.484 position:50% align:center
[LEV, IRINA gasp]

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]
Doesn't seem fine to me!

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
That was because of you!

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
[IRINA grunts]

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.035 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Cut it out! Stop!

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
It's dangerous!
What if we break something?

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Uh?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
[ZHORES]
Ah, the test subject.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
Great.

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
Hey, I heard you're back
in the running, Lev.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.095 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So no more
calling me "reserve."

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
Don't get cocky, there's still
a chance you might fail.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I'll do my best not to.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.020 position:50% align:center
Too bad his pet vampire
cursed his leg.

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
You're jealous I went
to space first.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I'll try not
to hold that against you.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
You're no better than
those dead dogs.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
At least I'm not a
snow bug like you.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.988 position:50% align:center
Why am I a snow bug?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
Because you're an
annoying little insect!

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
Enough.

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
Move it, lab rat.
You're blocking our way.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.621 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Take it easy!

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:02.208 position:50% align:center
The launch is in the past now.
Let's not do this.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
I agree with you, Lev.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
Thanks to her, the space program
is making incredible strides.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
She deserves to be appreciated
for the work that she's done,

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:12.510 position:50% align:center
just as much as those dogs were.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50% align:center
[ROZA]
Hmph!

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Bleh! I'll curse you.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:30.695 position:50% align:center
[LEV sighs]

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
You guys're finally here!
'Bout time. Welcome back!

00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:38.787 position:50% align:center
What's all that?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.122 position:50% align:center
Basically, it's equipment
that analyzes her body

00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
while she's asleep.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
When did they bring it in?

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.420 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
They came here this morning
and emptied your room out.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.635 position:50% align:center
They really don't waste
any time, do they?

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.556 position:50% align:center
[LEV] So, what's going
to happen to Irina?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
I wish I knew,

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
but I'm completely out of
the loop on that front.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
Hey, Irina. Did they tell you
anything important when you

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
attended that private
Committee meeting?

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.906 position:50% align:center
Maybe what they're planning to
do with you after your exam?

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:15.907 position:50% align:center
Like, kill me?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.283 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.285 position:50% align:center
No, they didn't mention that.

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
Not at all?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.623 position:50% align:center
Nope. They're probably
still deciding.

00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
Either way, you should
be worried about you!

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
If you let yourself
lose to those morons,

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
then you'll see a side of
me you really won't like!

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
Listen, I don't want that
to happen either, okay?

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Sounds pathetic,
even for you!

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.138 position:50% align:center
Come on, I made it
to space and back,

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
and you were my instructor!

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
I want you to swear to me
that you'll get picked!

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.602 position:50% align:center
Even if it's a total lie!

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.902 position:50% align:center
Well, I won't be able to
look after her anymore.

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
So do you think you can keep
her out of trouble for me

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.281 position:50% align:center
while I'm gone?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:58.783 position:50% align:center
I've got you covered!

[LEV]
Thanks.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] I am pleased to report
that the Nosferatu Project

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
was a resounding success.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.305 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four's cooperation
with our research

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
certainly played a part
in making this possible.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
As such, it's only fair
to reward her once

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50% align:center
the real first
spaceflight is complete.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] Following the
triumphant result of the 

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:35.111 position:50% align:center
Nosferatu Project, the UZSR
promptly directed its attention

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
toward their next space-travel
endeavor, the Mechta Project.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.493 position:50% align:center
And since Irina Luminesk,
officially known as

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four, had proven
herself so valuable

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
to the nation's goals,
her disposal was postponed

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.418 position:50% align:center
to allow for additional
experimentation.

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
However, the decision to
keep N-Forty-Four alive

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
for an unspecified amount of
time was considered by some

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
parties to be a
security concern.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.138 position:50% align:center
As such, those individuals
wished for the arrangement

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:05.892 position:50% align:center
of an "accident" to
preserve state secrets.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
let us unite as one to keep
this land growing strong

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center

greater possibilities!

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center

So what is this about?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.928 position:50% align:center
It's just some sketches.

00:12:42.012 --> 00:12:44.389 position:50% align:center
Can't a person draw things
when they're bored? 

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm no art critic,

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
but who draws a
carrot on a pancake?

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:50.437 position:50% align:center

It's a moon landing.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
Now tell me why
you're in here,

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
and it better not be
to do another exam.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.987 position:50% align:center
It's New Year's Eve!

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'm here
<i>because</i> it's New Year's.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:03.783 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Is that?

00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Yup! An authentic Lilitto dress!

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
But why did you bring it?

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:09.873 position:50% align:center
We're going out on the town!

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:12.834 position:50% align:center
I want us to celebrate
New Year's together!

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
[ANYA yelps] You're the cutest
thing that ever lived!

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.257 position:50% align:center
[IRINA whimpers]

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
It looks so good!
Don't you just love it?

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
Um. Well, it fits.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
Great! Ready to go?

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.973 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] I was born in Lilitto,
just like you!

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
But because I was a war orphan
who grew up in Sangrad,

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I don't have a lot
of vivid memories

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
of what life was like there.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.111 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
How did you end up in Laika?

00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] I joined the Air
Force Medical Institute

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
after my graduation.

00:13:43.907 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
That was where I started reading
up on all the vampire stuff.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.704 position:50% align:center
I was fascinated right away!

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
You weren't scared of us?

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] The orphanage
teachers were scarier.

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
Picture a whole school
full of Sagaleviches.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That's awful.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.296 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
I know!

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
She's Snegurochka,
the famous Snow Maiden!

Oh, then Happy
New Year, Snegurochka.

And that man over there is

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
the Snow Maiden's
grandfather, Ded Moroz.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Together, they're the
very spirit of New Year's

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
in the UZSR.

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center

You too!

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
She was nice.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
I wonder how she'd react if she
found out that I was a vampire.

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
I think the fact that
you've been to space

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
is a bigger shocker
than that, honestly.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I bet the people
in my hometown

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
would be surprised, too.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
They probably assume
that I'm dead.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
And who knows what they'd
say if they saw me

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
getting along with
humans like this?

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
I know! You and I should
celebrate Lilitto-style!

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center
[ANYA giggles]

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.923 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] If you wish on a
pinecone and throw it in

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
a river, the water purifies
it and answers your prayer.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
So they say, anyway.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
But sadly, there's no
river in Laika-Forty-Four,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
so I guess we'll
just have to settle

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
for this man-made lake instead.

00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
And it's frozen, which means
the pinecone won't sink.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:41.858 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Beautiful. Almost like
the whole thing was wrapped

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
in a sparkling blue veil.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:09.649 position:50% align:center
It was hard to believe this
was the place I came from.

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Wow.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
And the stars looked like a
garden of chervil flowers.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
You lost me there.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.783 position:50% align:center
It's an herb that blooms
in little white clusters.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
Look it up when you have time.

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to
when we get back.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.500 position:50% align:center
And the moon was
so breathtaking.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
It made me think about
how badly I want to go,

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50% align:center
and about how I
don't want to die.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.303 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lev?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.763 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Hm?

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
You should know, seeing the
moon while I was floating

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
in space made me
realize something.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
Um, the truth is...

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] N-Forty-Four!
Private Lev Leps!

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
Stay where you are!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
We're here to bring
you back to base!

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50% align:center
[ANYA giggles]

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
[IRINA grunts]

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.385 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
You can't just sneak in.

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
I told you!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[LEV, ANYA giggle]

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
So what are these flowers for?

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:11.646 position:50% align:center
[LEV] They're a present for
the world's first cosmonaut.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.523 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, thanks, I guess.

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:19.612 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] Why would you
do something like this?

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:24.451 position:50% align:center
There are too many kinds here.
The smell's all mixed up.

00:21:24.534 --> 00:21:27.328 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sniffs]
That was stupid.

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
You know,
since my parents died,

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:43.553 position:50% align:center
nobody's ever put on any
kind of celebration for me.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I wish all three billion
people in the world

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
were allowed to know what a
wonderful thing you've done.

00:21:49.225 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]
More importantly, the test!

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
How was it?

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
I gave it my best shot.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
So now all that we
can do is wait.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
