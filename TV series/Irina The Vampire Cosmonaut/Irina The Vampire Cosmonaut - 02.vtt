we have any reason

You wretched mongrel!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
What now, Vice Director, sir?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
Enough chatter, let's begin!

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Right.

Here's the plan. If it's
too much, give us this signal.

You did a really great job!

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
That was nothing!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
Give me some more!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
If you're done, let's move
on to the next task!

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
Six-G. Go!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
When rockets are
launched into space,

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
they go against the
force of gravity.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
As such, it's very stressful
for the passengers,

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
because the pressure is many
times their own weight.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
Right now?

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
Lev's body probably feels like
lead, and he's likely suffering

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
extreme pain and nausea caused
by the speed of the rotation.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hmph.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
Go for five minutes. And do
your best not to throw up.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Like I'd do that.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center

Tighten that harness!

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
It's already tight, sir.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
I can see that.
Tighten it some more!

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ sighs]
If you say so.

This is weak!

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
Let's do two months' worth

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Yes sir.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
Increase it more!

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center

If you don't like the way I do
things, come up here and hit me!

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the kind
of brutish behavior

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center

Don't worry.

You're bleeding!
I'll patch that up for you!

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, it's just
chafing a bit.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
You'd really bother with that?

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I?

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
I couldn't call myself
a researcher if I didn't

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
take care of a live
subject in need!

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Wait here. I'll go get
the first-aid kit!

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Turns out their blood

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Not a single complaint yet.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
Forget running away.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center

And she's doing great.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center

I'm finished.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Not too bad.
Have you healed yet?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
Don't ogle me!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
I didn't ogle, I swear!

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Heh. As if I would believe that.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
So, what about flying?

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
When are we supposed
to start practicing that?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Flying the ship? We don't.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Then how do we operate it?

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
The machine does all the work.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
You just sit inside it.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Our job until then is to
train our bodies for launch,

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
and study so we know
how to fill out the log.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
Oh, but there is one thing
I forgot to mention.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
You're also going to
have to make sure

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
to master the parachute landing.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
Because if you want to
get back down to Earth,

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
that's the only way.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
In a perfect scenario,

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
we'd perform a
retro-thrusted soft landing.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
But, we don't have
that technology yet.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
So instead, the plan is
for an in-flight ejection.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
Once you re-enter the
atmosphere and fall to

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
seven kilometers,
the entire seat will come out.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
[LEV] That whole process
is automatic, what happens

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
afterward is the part
to be concerned about.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
The expectation is that you'll
detach yourself from the seat

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
and land safely
using a parachute.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
It'll be the first time anyone's
attempted a landing like this.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I'm guessing you've never
used a parachute before, right?

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
No, and I've
never flown, either.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.439 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I'm sorry, but two
months just isn't enough time.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] It'll be fine, provided
the seat is properly ejected.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
[LEV] But I'm concerned that
she might lose consciousness

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
upon re-entry.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
If she can't operate
the parachute, then...

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
No matter. This is what we
have test subjects for.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
[LEV] As long as the
launch is successful,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
they don't care if she
crash-lands and dies.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
Before you do anything else,

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
you should try getting
used to being up this high.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Slide down to that bank.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center

It's called soda water.

back before the sun comes up!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[LEV laughs]

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I told you I didn't want it!

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Who even drinks this stuff?

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gulps]

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
So yummy!

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Enjoying your drink there?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Uh!

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
It's good, right?

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Shut up!

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I recommend trying
it with some booze.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Enough, human!

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Get out!
You shouldn't be here!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
Stop ogling me, pervert! Lecher!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
I don't like your
stupid soda water.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
I just think it's wasteful
to throw it out!

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] How's the
construction coming along?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
It's less than halfway done.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
The cargo's much larger
than a dog this time,

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
it's quite an undertaking.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
So. How's N-Forty-Four?

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] No resistance.
She puts her all into training.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
I see. Then we assigned
the right person.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
But why choose the reserve
instead of a true cosmonaut?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] His reaction
after the test run of Zero.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Out of the thousands
of people who've seen my child,

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
the only one who showed
true respect was him.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
In his eyes, the difference
in species

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
doesn't seem to be
a problem at all.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
His demotion wasn't
too discouraging, either.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] But violence
towards a superior officer

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
is a code violation,
regardless of the reason.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Either way, I trust
you'll keep an eye on it.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
Is there something
else going on?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
Well, no, but you know
how these things can be.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
When it comes to space research,
the UK isn't the only threat.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
We have enemies within, as well.
