00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:16.808 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] In total, there are
twenty cosmonaut candidates.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.562 position:50% align:center
Out of 5,000 applicants
from the UZSR army,

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
these elites were declared to be

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
the best and brightest
of them all.

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
[NARRATOR] However, even for
these shining stars,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
cosmonaut training drills
are incredibly rigorous.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[NATALIA] Oh, dear.
Look at those poor souls.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.213 position:50% align:center
And that vampire girl.
She's got it rough, too.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.661 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.039 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It's Lev. I'm coming in!

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.331 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Fine.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.628 position:50% align:center
G'Morning! Hope you're
ready to train.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.551 position:50% align:center
Guess you didn't need it.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.178 position:50% align:center
Let's get started.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.888 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I'd leave your necklace here.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
And why's that?

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
You'll just have to take
it off every time you

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.809 position:50% align:center
start a new exercise, anyway.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful.
What stone is it?

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
Don't look, you'll defile it.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
Defile it?

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll take it off.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.031 position:50% align:center
So? What's our training
regimen like?

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
First up, the same drills
as the candidates!

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.451 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
[LEV] We always do twelve
laps around the track.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.668 position:50% align:center
Helps build your endurance.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
It's your first time,
so take it easy.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
Just run at your own pace.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
Get ready...!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50% align:center
...and go!

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Wait! It's not
a race, you know!

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
If you don't pace yourself,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.559 position:50% align:center
there's no way you'll
last through the night!

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
You humans are slow runners.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps] Oh, come on!
Not listening, huh?

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50% align:center
Alright, fine!

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Then I'll show
her how it's done!

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.825 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're going too fast!

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
[LEV pants]

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Vampire!

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.973 position:50% align:center
[pants]

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
I think that was a little
over the top for a warmup.

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
[LEV laughs]
Yeah.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
She did such a good job
keeping pace with you!

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
She can stand in for a
candidate, no problem!

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
I was afraid the training
would be too intense,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
so that was a relief.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
How could I lose to a human?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
She's really competitive.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.206 position:50% align:center
I hope that won't
become an issue later.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.624 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
I think N-Forty-Four's
body is so intriguing!

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.963 position:50% align:center
--[ANYA giggles]
--[LEV] Hm?

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] It's your first physical,
so we have to be thorough!

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Height, weight, blood pressure,
X-ray, blood test,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
your bust-waist-hip
measurements,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:11.811 position:50% align:center
and your butt size, too,
while we're at it!

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
[LEV] She's all yours, Anya.
I'll just be a few feet away.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.567 position:50% align:center
Why are you still in the room?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Would that be acceptable
if I were a human female?

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:24.449 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm supposed to be
monitoring you, remember?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Get out.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
--But this is my job--
--Get out!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.328 position:50% align:center
--But I--!
--Get out!

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:29.621 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.247 position:50% align:center
[door slams]

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Human men are brutes,
so insensitive.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
[LEV sighs]
Now she really hates me.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
[ANYA shouts]
Your skin is so pale and smooth!

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Stop staring at it.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
148 centimeters. 43 kilos.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:49.849 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
That's light.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Breast size, 82!

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
--[IRINA] Don't touch me.
--[ANYA yelps]

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Such a human reaction!
Now let's see...

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.192 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Wait, what are
you about to do?

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:01.986 position:50% align:center
Why are your fingers
wiggling like that?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
[ANYA giggles]

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hey! You're too close!

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
[dog barks]

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.450 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Aww, don't be shy!

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.327 position:50% align:center
I promise this
won't hurt a bit!

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Better not!

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] Come on, N-Forty-Four.
Move your hands out of the way!

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]
Just a test subject.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
Is this toothpaste?

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:30.390 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
They're space rations.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center
You eat these?

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.977 position:50% align:center
Don't expect it to
taste good, though.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
It <i>is</i> made by scientists.

00:06:44.195 --> 00:06:48.533 position:50% align:center
[coughs] Eat the whole thing!
It's part of your training!

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.830 position:50% align:center
Do you like that stuff?

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
I can barely tolerate it.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Vampires don't have palates.

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
Yet another thing
you didn't know.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.797 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
So.. you don't taste things?

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:03.840 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That's right.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
However, we can
perceive textures,

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
as well as heat and cold.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.055 position:50% align:center
Feeling and smell are more
important than taste.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
Wait, but if vampires eat
all the same foods as humans,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
then why does everyone
call you guys "bloodsuckers"?

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
Don't all vampires drink blood?

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
Actually, no.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.203 position:50% align:center
In fact, it's forbidden
because of how barbaric it is.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.039 position:50% align:center
I only did it once.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.209 position:50% align:center
On my tenth birthday,
I took part in a ritual.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.130 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I was forced to drink.

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
They say it's to remind
us of our roots.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
What was it like?

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.224 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Delicious.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
A feeling of warmth and strength
swept over my entire body.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
Before you ask, no.
I wouldn't drink human blood.

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
Then I'd be tainted.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles] If you guys
don't drink people's blood,

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
then I don't get the whole
"cursed species" thing.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
It's all human nonsense.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.580 position:50% align:center
You see, back when
the plague occurred,

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
your kind was looking for
someone to blame it on.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.794 position:50% align:center
Since then, that's the
way we've always been

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
portrayed by your books.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.256 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
Knowing that,

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
I bet you're wondering why
vampires benefit from milk.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:32.762 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
Because it comes from teats,
which are made up of blood.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
In other words, it's a
substitute for blood.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
You have had milk before,
haven't you?

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:46.860 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I don't get it.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.407 position:50% align:center
[LEV] In space, the ship's
temperature is controlled

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
at 20 degrees Celsius, but
something could always go wrong.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
This exercise is to help
you prepare for that.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
The goal is to stay in a
90 degree steam bath

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.710 position:50% align:center
for an entire hour.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
Maly was killed because the
ship's temperature got too high.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
And as we all know, vampires are
especially sensitive to heat.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
So if you're able to make it
through this without dying,

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
we can assume a
human will be fine.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
[sniffs]

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Sorry for the wait.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.141 position:50% align:center
Uh, it's okay.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.517 position:50% align:center
Now then, let's start.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50% align:center
Today we're doing
hot room endurance

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.438 position:50% align:center
and load training drills.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
[SAGALEVICH] At this hour,
I should be fast asleep.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.986 position:50% align:center
And yet, here I am. Coerced into
training this piece of filth.

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
I'll go first so you can
get a sense of it, okay?

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.118 position:50% align:center
--[SAGALEVICH] No, wait!
--[LEV] Huh?

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.788 position:50% align:center
We need to put this on her!

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:40.663 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
What for?

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.707 position:50% align:center

we have any reason

You wretched mongrel!

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
What now, Vice Director, sir?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
Enough chatter, let's begin!

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Right.

Here's the plan. If it's
too much, give us this signal.

You did a really great job!

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
That was nothing!

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.178 position:50% align:center
Give me some more!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:22.057 position:50% align:center
If you're done, let's move
on to the next task!

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.937 position:50% align:center
Six-G. Go!

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
When rockets are
launched into space,

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
they go against the
force of gravity.

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:34.569 position:50% align:center
As such, it's very stressful
for the passengers,

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:37.947 position:50% align:center
because the pressure is many
times their own weight.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
Right now?

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
Lev's body probably feels like
lead, and he's likely suffering

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:45.205 position:50% align:center
extreme pain and nausea caused
by the speed of the rotation.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hmph.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
Go for five minutes. And do
your best not to throw up.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Like I'd do that.

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center

Tighten that harness!

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
It's already tight, sir.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
I can see that.
Tighten it some more!

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ sighs]
If you say so.

This is weak!

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:16.611 position:50% align:center
Let's do two months' worth

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:17.904 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Yes sir.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
Increase it more!

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center

If you don't like the way I do
things, come up here and hit me!

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the kind
of brutish behavior

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.110 position:50% align:center

Don't worry.

You're bleeding!
I'll patch that up for you!

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, it's just
chafing a bit.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
You'd really bother with that?

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I?

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.213 position:50% align:center
I couldn't call myself
a researcher if I didn't

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:19.591 position:50% align:center
take care of a live
subject in need!

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
Wait here. I'll go get
the first-aid kit!

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Turns out their blood

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.580 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Not a single complaint yet.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.374 position:50% align:center
Forget running away.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center

And she's doing great.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center

I'm finished.

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Not too bad.
Have you healed yet?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
Don't ogle me!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
I didn't ogle, I swear!

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Heh. As if I would believe that.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
So, what about flying?

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
When are we supposed
to start practicing that?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.611 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Flying the ship? We don't.

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Then how do we operate it?

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.490 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
The machine does all the work.

00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.575 position:50% align:center
You just sit inside it.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:30.704 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Our job until then is to
train our bodies for launch,

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
and study so we know
how to fill out the log.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.417 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sighs]

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.420 position:50% align:center
Oh, but there is one thing
I forgot to mention.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.713 position:50% align:center
You're also going to
have to make sure

00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.798 position:50% align:center
to master the parachute landing.

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
Because if you want to
get back down to Earth,

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.302 position:50% align:center
that's the only way.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.600 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
In a perfect scenario,

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:56.229 position:50% align:center
we'd perform a
retro-thrusted soft landing.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
But, we don't have
that technology yet.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
So instead, the plan is
for an in-flight ejection.

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:06.781 position:50% align:center
Once you re-enter the
atmosphere and fall to

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
seven kilometers,
the entire seat will come out.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
[LEV] That whole process
is automatic, what happens

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
afterward is the part
to be concerned about.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.086 position:50% align:center
The expectation is that you'll
detach yourself from the seat

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.505 position:50% align:center
and land safely
using a parachute.

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.800 position:50% align:center
It'll be the first time anyone's
attempted a landing like this.

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:34.601 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I'm guessing you've never
used a parachute before, right?

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:37.228 position:50% align:center
No, and I've
never flown, either.

00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:39.439 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I'm sorry, but two
months just isn't enough time.

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:46.738 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] It'll be fine, provided
the seat is properly ejected.

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.865 position:50% align:center
[LEV] But I'm concerned that
she might lose consciousness

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.909 position:50% align:center
upon re-entry.

00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:52.952 position:50% align:center
If she can't operate
the parachute, then...

00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
No matter. This is what we
have test subjects for.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.584 position:50% align:center
[LEV] As long as the
launch is successful,

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
they don't care if she
crash-lands and dies.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
Before you do anything else,

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.060 position:50% align:center
you should try getting
used to being up this high.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.853 position:50% align:center
Slide down to that bank.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center

It's called soda water.

back before the sun comes up!

00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
[LEV laughs]

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[gasps, yells]

00:20:00.992 --> 00:20:03.912 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
I told you I didn't want it!

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:11.961 position:50% align:center
Who even drinks this stuff?

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.841 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gulps]

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.968 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
So yummy!

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Enjoying your drink there?

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Uh!

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
It's good, right?

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Shut up!

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I recommend trying
it with some booze.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:35.485 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Enough, human!

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.197 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Get out!
You shouldn't be here!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.075 position:50% align:center
Stop ogling me, pervert! Lecher!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
I don't like your
stupid soda water.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.121 position:50% align:center
I just think it's wasteful
to throw it out!

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
[LEV chuckles]

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.502 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] How's the
construction coming along?

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
It's less than halfway done.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.424 position:50% align:center
The cargo's much larger
than a dog this time,

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
it's quite an undertaking.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
So. How's N-Forty-Four?

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] No resistance.
She puts her all into training.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
I see. Then we assigned
the right person.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
But why choose the reserve
instead of a true cosmonaut?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] His reaction
after the test run of Zero.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:20.613 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Out of the thousands
of people who've seen my child,

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
the only one who showed
true respect was him.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.871 position:50% align:center
In his eyes, the difference
in species

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.373 position:50% align:center
doesn't seem to be
a problem at all.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
His demotion wasn't
too discouraging, either.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.171 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] But violence
towards a superior officer

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
is a code violation,
regardless of the reason.

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Either way, I trust
you'll keep an eye on it.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
Is there something
else going on?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
Well, no, but you know
how these things can be.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:54.147 position:50% align:center
When it comes to space research,
the UK isn't the only threat.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.983 position:50% align:center
We have enemies within, as well.

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center
