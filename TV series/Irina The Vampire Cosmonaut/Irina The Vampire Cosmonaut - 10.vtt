00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.956 position:50% align:center
All this pretending
to be normal.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.499 position:50% align:center
It's pretty tiring, right?

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Who would've guessed?

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
It may be tiring for you,

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
but watching it is
hopelessly dull.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
I think I'll be on my way.

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
But, before I say goodbye,

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
I have something I'd
like to share with you.

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
[LEV, MIKHAIL]
Huh?

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] If the spaceflight
is a success, we'll be holding

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
a massive ceremony right
here in the square.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:54.858 position:50% align:center
There'll be about 200,000
people in attendance

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
for the largest celebration
since our founding.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.362 position:50% align:center
[LEV, MIKHAIL gasp]

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] Nothing but people,
as far as the eye can see.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.534 position:50% align:center
Can you even imagine
a crowd that size?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.162 position:50% align:center
All of them gazing with
admiration at our nation's

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:08.371 position:50% align:center
new hero.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Now, with that in mind,

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:14.336 position:50% align:center
what kind of person should
the first cosmonaut be?

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
Answer carefully.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
Somebody who is worthy
of being called a hero.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:24.512 position:50% align:center
Ah! A great response.
And what do you think, Lev?

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
It should be someone like me.

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
That's what I want to say,
but I'm not sure.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
Ha! Well, you're honest.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
[LEV] But, there's one quality
they'll need more than anything.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
Hm?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.362 position:50% align:center
The longing to see space.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
They should want it
badly enough to die.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.702 position:50% align:center
That's true as well.

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
Thank you for your insight,
gentlemen. Goodbye.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Wait!

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.210 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.670 position:50% align:center
Just for reference,

00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:59.047 position:50% align:center
if somebody asked you what
the world's first cosmonaut

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.217 position:50% align:center
should be like, what would
your answer be?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
Mikhail!

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.637 position:50% align:center
Let me think.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd say a revolutionary

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.599 position:50% align:center
who will lead us
into the future.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
Or something.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:17.691 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'm sure I'll see you
after the launch is over.

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.818 position:50% align:center
Safe travels, you two.

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.615 position:50% align:center
Hey, do you get the feeling
she might have been

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
less than genuine just now?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.245 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:14:31.121 --> 00:14:37.585 position:50% align:center
[clock tower rings]

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Ah!

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.507 position:50% align:center
Look at that, Irinyan,
they're selling ice cream!

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to ask.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:47.012 position:50% align:center
Do you think you could stop
using that nickname for me?

00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
Uh! Why, do you not like it?

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's kind of childish,
and you're older than I am.

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Hm...

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
Well, how 'bout Iri instead?

00:14:58.023 --> 00:14:58.982 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.400 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Is that better?

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:02.861 position:50% align:center
[IRINA grunts]
I dunno, maybe.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
Well, think about it, 'kay?

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.197 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna go grab
some ice cream.

00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
You wait here.
I'll be right back!

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.827 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
Once she's got her mind
set on something...

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Huh?

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:20.837 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Wait.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lev...! That's him!

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.184 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lev!

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.399 position:50% align:center
Where do you think you're going?

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh no--!

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50% align:center
You have to watch her!

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:51.618 position:50% align:center
I'm very sorry, sir.

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.413 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
You can't wander off
on your own.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
[MALE DOCTOR A]
Open your mouth.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I'll keep getting health
exams, but they'll have some

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
work for me in the
Design Bureau, as well.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
Of course, the part about the
Design Bureau was a lie.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
I wonder if he
still believes it?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:43.336 position:50% align:center
I am still undergoing exams,
so that much is true, at least.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
But, that's only until
a human goes to space.

00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
Once the flight is over,

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:53.722 position:50% align:center
my existence will be nothing
more than a problem for them.

00:16:53.805 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
And I know what they'll do.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.946 position:50% align:center
[ANYA] You handled all
those exams like a pro.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Hey, who was
that guy with Lev?

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
That's Mikhail,
their first pick.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Oh.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
What do you think those
cameras were filming them for?

00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.290 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing it means
they've narrowed it down

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:22.876 position:50% align:center
to the two of them to be
the first cosmonaut!

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I knew it.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
Isn't that incredible?

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
Lev is just one step
away from the top now!

00:17:27.922 --> 00:17:31.092 position:50% align:center
His greatest dream is
about to come true!

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
Could be.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
All right.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
This fine young man will
be our nation's hero.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
As you wish, sir.

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
Also, the Delivery Crew has
decided they've done enough

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
follow-up exams
on N-Forty-Four.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.575 position:50% align:center
They say they're ready
to dispose of her.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:58.787 position:50% align:center
And is there no value
in keeping her alive?

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
We could kill her, but I think
she's too cute for that.

00:18:02.082 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
Have her become an
actress or a singer.

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
The UK has a couple of
dhampir pop stars, after all.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
You're kidding, right?

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
I suppose so.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
Although, I do think this boring
world of ours is in need

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
of a revolution, and it
can't come soon enough.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.477 position:50% align:center
I wanted it to take
them all down in one go.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.855 position:50% align:center
Both those United Kingdom
fools and the Delivery Crew.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
Doesn't that sound marvelous?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.656 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] I can't help but
wonder if little Miss Luminesk

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:38.076 position:50% align:center
is precisely the weapon we
need to make that a reality.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
I have news, gentlemen.
Launch is set.

00:18:57.512 --> 00:18:59.597 position:50% align:center
It will be in three days,
on April 12th,

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.558 position:50% align:center
at nine-o-clock
in the morning.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
As for who's flying...

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
...we have chosen you, Lev Leps.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Sir!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
How's that possible?

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:22.287 position:50% align:center
I outclassed him every single
time, no matter what we did!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
So why are they choosing him?

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:27.792 position:50% align:center
When that rocket
goes up into space,

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
it takes all our dreams with it.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.340 position:50% align:center
To be our hero, one must
be strong enough

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:35.759 position:50% align:center
to shoulder such a
great responsibility,

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.762 position:50% align:center
and to make our
motherland smile.

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
Those were their qualifications?

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] No. That's just
my personal opinion.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
[MIKHAIL]
Hmph.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.481 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
Private Mikhail.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
If Lev is unable, then the
opportunity will fall to you.

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:56.821 position:50% align:center
Make sure you're prepared.

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
Sir.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.375 position:50% align:center
It's been a long time.

00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
Comrade Chief!
How are you doing, sir?

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.338 position:50% align:center
You've lost a few pounds.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:18.301 position:50% align:center
I'm great! And seeing you again
makes me feel even better.

00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.928 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
My call sign?

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] That's right.
You'll need one of your own,

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
now that you're officially the
one who's going into space.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:27.394 position:50% align:center
I'd be honored to
help you pick it out.

00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
[LEV] How did you come up with
"Lycoris" for Irina's call sign?

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
Oh, that one? Easy.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
I liked the meaning
of that flower.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
The sentiment for Lycoris is
"I hope we meet again soon."

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:41.324 position:50% align:center
Does Irina know about that?

00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I told her. She understood
that I wanted her

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
to come back home
to us safe and sound.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.456 position:50% align:center
She seemed happy.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
That's thoughtful.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:54.337 position:50% align:center
Hm... Let's see, is there
a flower that says,

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:57.966 position:50% align:center
"I hope that you're safe,
even though we're far apart"?

00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.969 position:50% align:center
I would like to relay that
message to someone.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
Hm...
