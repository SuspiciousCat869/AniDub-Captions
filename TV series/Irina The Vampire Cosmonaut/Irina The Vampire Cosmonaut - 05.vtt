Oh, hey, Lev,
it's good to see you!

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
I take it the training
has been going well?

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.518 position:50% align:center
It has. But she's got
some solo work to do.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
So I'm back to being
a reserve, temporarily.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.780 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Well, there's somebody
I haven't seen in a while!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.783 position:50% align:center
What, did you get fired from
your monster babysitting gig?

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
No, Irina, um...
N-Forty-Four's training now.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.789 position:50% align:center
She's in the anechoic
altitude chamber.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
Aw, that thing's the worst!

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center

How is she holding up?
If she can't keep it together,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50% align:center
then she won't be able to
fulfil her duty to the mission,

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.179 position:50% align:center

problems for the rest of us.

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Oh, she's fine.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.224 position:50% align:center
It's been three days now
since she went in there.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.143 position:50% align:center

make it through alright.

[LYUDMILA]
I'm Lyudmila Kharlova.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center

for you candidates.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50% align:center
Fellow comrades.

00:03:38.927 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
As you certainly must
understand by this point

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
in your training, our
motherland stands to benefit

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
greatly from the mission
we now undergo.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] The United Kingdom
has gathered their best pilot

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
astronauts into a group
known as the Hermes Seven.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
Therefore, the UZSR
will do the same,

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:58.196 position:50% align:center
but be even more selective.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Our Dream Six.
Our <i>Mechta Shest</i> !

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
In other words, we will choose
six of our top-performing

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.873 position:50% align:center
elites to become our
official cosmonauts.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:11.710 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] The selection
process begins in January.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
The pride of our motherland
rests upon your shoulders,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
so you must journey
forth and protect it.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
Are you prepared, Comrades?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
[CANDIDATES]
Yes!

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
My! That was passionate!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
If you'd like to observe
training exercises--

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50% align:center
Just a moment.

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.308 position:50% align:center
First, do we have any questions?

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.602 position:50% align:center
Yes. You. Go ahead.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
Mikhail Yashin, ma'am.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.024 position:50% align:center
How has the development of
the ship been coming along?

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50% align:center
What do we know?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
Oh, I see.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
You're probably wondering
about the Albinar incident.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.324 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR]
Hm?

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.036 position:50% align:center
[LEV] When that explosion
occurred at Albinar,

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
it was difficult not to let
our minds draw comparisons

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
to similar tragedies.

Oh no...

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.618 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Two experiment dogs
died in the launch.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:30.038 position:50% align:center
After that, everyone had
the same thought.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
"What if it had been
me in there, instead?"

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.087 position:50% align:center
Never mind Albinar.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.963 position:50% align:center
That had nothing to
do with your mission.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
The ship is coming along nicely.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center

[ALL gasp]

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.556 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] Besides, you have
N-Forty-Four to face any

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.392 position:50% align:center
potential danger in your stead.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.726 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
We've been told that the
United Kingdom is planning

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.564 position:50% align:center
to send a chimpanzee
into space next January,

00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:59.984 position:50% align:center
but N-Forty-Four is going to be
launched a whole month prior.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
Which means we're
well ahead of them.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
Either way, our vampire
will prove far better

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
N-Forty-Four is supposed
to be the closest thing

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.125 position:50% align:center
to a human cosmonaut, after all!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
That's what the
test subject is for.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.713 position:50% align:center

it's a solid plan.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] This vacancy could
lead to your promotion.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.441 position:50% align:center
Which means you've
got another shot.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
I can't be happy about
someone else's misfortune.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:27.697 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA] Oh? I wonder if
your peers would say the same.

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:31.284 position:50% align:center
Comrades! If an accident like
this throws you off course,

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
then you'll never be a
hero of the motherland!

for future generations?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
You're no one now, but I'm
eager to see that change.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:51.012 position:50% align:center
Not so fast. I'm starting to get
bored with all of this training.

Come with me, Comrade.

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50% align:center
I think there's something
more interesting

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
that you can show me.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.611 position:50% align:center
What's with these questions?
You know I'm not a child, right?

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
When are you going to let me
out of this place, anyway?

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
I just wish I could
take a shower.

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
How many days has it been?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center

So that adorable little thing

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.919 position:50% align:center
She's almost like an animal.

00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
With all due respect, ma'am,
she's not an animal.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.048 position:50% align:center
She's just like you

She may resemble a human,

but there's a
crucial difference.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
The fact is, she belongs to a
species that's loathed by many.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center

what's going to happen to Iri--

I mean, N-Forty-Four?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
At this point, I couldn't say.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.651 position:50% align:center
But what does it matter?

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.862 position:50% align:center
Well, she is rather cute.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
Were you hoping to
keep her as a pet?

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.574 position:50% align:center
Uh, no, of course not.

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.117 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
The Nosferatu Project is vital,

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Time for your reward.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
Lemon seltzer!

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.991 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Ha, ha!

00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:42.077 position:50% align:center
Did you think I would
jump for joy?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.454 position:50% align:center
I don't want it to go to waste,

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.706 position:50% align:center
so I guess I might
as well drink it.

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
What do you look so happy about?

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.301 position:50% align:center
Nothing in particular.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I can't tell her it's
because she said my name.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
If I do that, she might
bite me for real.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
--[LEV] Uh?
--[IRINA chuckles]

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it seems
like you've recovered.

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:13.441 position:50% align:center
I wish I could give you the
day to rest, but no such luck.

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
There's no time for that.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
We need to get back
to your training.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.988 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm!

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
[LEV] So, how unbearable
was it inside that chamber?

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
It wasn't that bad.

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.247 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Really?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Yeah. Do you
not believe me?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
[LEV] That's not it. I was just
worried about you, that's all.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.588 position:50% align:center
None of us lasted
longer than three days

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
the first time we did it.

00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Three days?
You humans have no willpower.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.887 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
You're right.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.557 position:50% align:center
Seeing how well you did
makes me think, maybe humans

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.226 position:50% align:center
aren't as good at everything
as we think we are.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Think? I know it for a fact.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Yeah. So do I. No doubt.

00:13:20.884 --> 00:13:22.344 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Is it true, Lev?

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.762 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ] You took her
parachuting right after

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:26.890 position:50% align:center
she got out of solitude?

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:31.102 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Yeah. You get better at
it the more often you do it.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.313 position:50% align:center
I want to take her
as much as I can.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
It might make a
life-or-death difference.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.777 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ sighs]
You're a strict instructor.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
Who cares if that
makes me strict?

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
I'm not letting her get
killed in that launch.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
I refuse to.

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.039 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling you
like N-Forty-Four.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.124 position:50% align:center
You care for her.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what are
you talking about?

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
I'm just her monitor,
that's all!

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.882 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ] Listen. I might have
to leave the city soon.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.927 position:50% align:center
You're leaving? Are you
quitting or something?

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
No.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.806 position:50% align:center
Transferring, I think.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:09.683 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Did the Vice-Director
decide this?

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
--You can talk to me if you--
--[FRANZ] It's fine. Forget it.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.772 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's time
to rush in there

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
and save your princess from
the dungeon. Okay, Lev?

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.403 position:50% align:center
Uh... alright.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
Listen. Solo parachuting works
basically like tandem does.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.706 position:50% align:center
You'll float down on your belly,
and use the air resistance

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
to control your movement
with your arms and hands.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:36.835 position:50% align:center
As soon as you pull
your parachute,

00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:39.462 position:50% align:center
you'll want to begin aiming
toward the landing zone.

00:14:39.546 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
And always remember to
keep your chin tucked in!

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
Kay!

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Don't worry, I'll be
right here next to you!

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center

I'm ready when you are.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Here we go!

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.853 position:50% align:center
And three, and two, and one.

--Zero!

Irina! Your hand!

00:15:22.964 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center

Lev!

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center

It's alright! I've got you!

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center

Mm.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center

Just look at me!

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
Okay, it's time! Go!

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.498 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Mm!

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
You've got this!

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Aim for the target zone!
Five-point landing!

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.889 position:50% align:center
Feet, calves, thighs,
hips, back!

I made it through!

Irina! You did it!

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:16:29.197 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
That went really well!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.033 position:50% align:center
[IRINA chuckles]

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.785 position:50% align:center
Irina!

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
Keep your distance, H-Human!

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.712 position:50% align:center
You did miss the landing area,

00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:46.339 position:50% align:center
but it was still great
for your first try.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
It'll be perfect next time.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
Actually. I want us to practice
doing a spin during this run.

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
Is that a technique?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
Well, no. It's something
dangerous that can happen

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.892 position:50% align:center
to pilots when they
re-enter the atmosphere

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.478 position:50% align:center
and the ejection doesn't
turn out exactly right.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
Sometimes your body will
start spinning rapidly

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.025 position:50% align:center
as you're hurtling
toward the ground.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.610 position:50% align:center
If you ever do find yourself
in a spin, you need to have the

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.196 position:50% align:center
presence of mind to regain
control before you panic

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
and deploy your parachute.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
If you don't,
you'll lose consciousness

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
and plummet to the ground.

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.413 position:50% align:center
That's why you practice.

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
We'll get you used to the
feeling by jumping tandem.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.793 position:50% align:center
It's scary stuff.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
If you think I'm being harsh,
that's fine with me.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
I don't, though.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:29.883 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.510 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like you're
being harsh at all.

00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
You're training me to
have the best chance

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
of coming back safe, right?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
Uh, that's right.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
A test subject
to be disposed of.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Huh?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] That's how everybody
else treats me here.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.647 position:50% align:center
Except for you, Lev.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.192 position:50% align:center
You obviously want me
to make it out alive.

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
Irina.

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.488 position:50% align:center
You're a weird person
for not thinking about me

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:52.947 position:50% align:center
like I'm an object.

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe so.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:59.454 position:50% align:center
It's just-- You share my dream
of going into space someday.

00:17:59.537 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Maybe to you that
makes us "comrades",

00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
but to me, humans are
still the enemy that killed

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
my parents and
burned my village.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
Right... Sorry.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
Don't apologize. It doesn't make
any sense coming from you.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.853 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Look, of all
the humans I've met,

00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
you're about the only
one I don't despise.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.191 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
That's all I want to say.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center

What's that?

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center

[IRINA, LEV gasp]

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Something from space?

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
Let's go see.

00:18:57.929 --> 00:19:01.266 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It looks like
a cabin, but from what?

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center

I demand that you explain
yourself to me immediately.

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
[MALE OFFICIAL A]
I understood that the launch of

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.953 position:50% align:center
Parusnyi Six was successful.

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.747 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
It was successful.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
The unit maintained its orbit
and all the data was good.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
That's what we intended.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
[MALE OFFICIAL A]
Then what exactly went wrong?

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
Well, it seems there were issues

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
during the re-entry phase.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
The angle and heat-shield
weren't quite right.

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center

caused complications,

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
forcing us to issue the flight
termination command.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
[MALE OFFICIAL A] Hm!
So you blew the damned thing

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
to kingdom come.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
Should we worry that
N-Forty-Four's launch date

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.314 position:50% align:center
is going to be pushed
back as a result?

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.192 position:50% align:center
You know we mustn't have
any delays in the plan.

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
--Same date.
--How does the success

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
rate look?

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
As of this moment,
we're at 30 percent.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
I heard we'd be at 50.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.620 position:50% align:center
With some improvements, we'll
achieve that in time for launch.

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Excellent. In any case,

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:49.791 position:50% align:center
I imagine we'll fill up the
cabin with explosives

00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
for when it happens, so there's
no reason for concern.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
Explosives?

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.922 position:50% align:center
[MALE OFFICIAL A]
She's an experiment subject,

00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.799 position:50% align:center
might as well be a dog.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.968 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN grunts]

00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.761 position:50% align:center
There's always the
possibility of it landing

00:21:01.845 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
in another country.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
We would be foolish to risk our
secrets being compromised!

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.434 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
[MALE OFFICIAL A] Anything for
our beloved motherland!

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
[sighs, groans]

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Comrade Chief!

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN grunts]
It's fine. I'll be alright.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
We still have time!

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:26.036 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] I'm sure I don't
need to tell you this,

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
but keep quiet about
what you saw.

00:21:28.413 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Sir.

00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
It was unfortunate that you had
to be there when that happened.

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:38.173 position:50% align:center
Is she alright?

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
If she's unable to fulfil
her purpose after this...

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.053 position:50% align:center
She seems to be
experiencing some shock,

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
but N-Forty-Four will
recover in no time.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
I give you my word on it!

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.561 position:50% align:center
That's good. Because it
wouldn't be just your head

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
on the chopping block.

00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:55.565 position:50% align:center
Believe me, I'd be
right there with you!

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:11.456 position:50% align:center
