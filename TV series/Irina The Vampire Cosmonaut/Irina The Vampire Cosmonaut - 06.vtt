00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
Eh, don't worry about it.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of scared.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
So am I.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Is this good?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Mm.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
Here I go, then.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
All finished?

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasp]

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Check your chin.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] Uh, don't look!
It's embarrassing.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Hey, you know what?
You're way less pale now.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's doing some good.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
My body's feeling warm,

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
and I've got a little
burst of energy too.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
Well then we're back on track
to getting you to space.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
...doesn't it scare you
to think about it?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
What?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
If you're selected,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
you'll ride a missile into
space that might explode.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
I'd be lying if I said no,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
but my dream is worth
risking my life for.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
You know that for sure?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
If I have a reason for living,
then it's going into space.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
I'd give up everything
to do that.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
But why take it that far?

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Well, I have all
kinds of motivations.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
It's hard to put it into words.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
But more than anything, there's
the pure longing to reach space.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
Then again, you know
all about that feeling.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
You were willing to
become an experiment!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm!

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
Don't call it a missile.
A missile is made for killing.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
We ride rockets
that carry dreams.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
And a dream can
never explode.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're right.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
But, hey, why are
you saying "we"?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
You won't be flying anywhere
unless you're one of the ones

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:35.899 position:50% align:center
selected for the mission.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] I see you
grinning at me again!

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
Really? Nah, you're
seeing things.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Uh, hang on, I'll go get Anya.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lev...

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Thank you.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] You want us to
postpone the launch date?

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Yes. I'd like to wait
until the safety level's higher.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
Never mind that!
It's an arbitrary number!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] The success
rate is currently sitting

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
at only 30 percent.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] If the test
flight works, that's fine.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
But if we gave it
an extra month,

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
I believe our chances
would improve a little.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
Despite your feelings,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
the date remains non-negotiable.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
But, sir!

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
We always do the impossible!

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
Meeting a tight deadline
is hardly a miracle.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can make it work.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
He's ignoring me.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
Please, Chief, it's important
for you to get your rest.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.977 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me,
just worry about the ship!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
We'll succeed at all costs!

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN grunts]

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
It hurts!

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Don't give up, Irina!

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm!

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] There's an update
from the Committee

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
regarding the test flight.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
We were told to place explosives
on the ship with N-Forty-Four,

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
the same as we would if the
test subject were an animal.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Seriously? And that's
the final decision?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
If the ship nears our borders,
it will be detonated,

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
or we risk revealing
state secrets.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
So no matter how hard she tries,

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
it could all be pointless.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.
That's enough for today.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Next time you'll go solo.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
Make it count tomorrow.
It's your final day to practice.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ] Self-destruct?
That sounds really terrible.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It's downright cruel.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
They should call the
whole thing off.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
They're trying to outdo the UK.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
That's why they're speeding
through the schedule.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
She's just a sacrifice
in their war game.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Don't let them hear you.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[LEV grunts]

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
It's not that I don't agree
with what you're saying,

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
but I also want to see you
become a cosmonaut, Lev.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
So, just please, try not
to rock the boat, okay?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.
Thanks a lot, Franz.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
Enjoy that seltzer.
Might not come back here.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Hey, what was that drink that
you had at the jazz bar?

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
The red one?

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Oleaster nastoyka?

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That was it!

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I told you about my village,
and how I'm too young to drink.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
But, hey, one day I'll be 20
and I can try that again.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
We'll make a celebration
out of it.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
She managed to survive the Vice-
Director's bullying, at least.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center

Whoa.

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Kind of a long session, huh?

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
The machine's acting a bit odd.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
It seems to be broken.
It won't stop!

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
She could die at this rate!

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
What should we do, Franz?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ gasps]
Damn!

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
What's all the fuss about?

Stop spinning, damn you!

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It's my responsibility
to keep Irina safe!

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center

It's slowing down!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center

Hey!

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Everything alright?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I thought that was the end.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
I'll go get the doctor!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
[SAGALEVICH]
Do you have any idea

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
the amount of damage
you've just done?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
The only reason the machine
broke is because that

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
piece of subhuman trash
was sitting inside it!
