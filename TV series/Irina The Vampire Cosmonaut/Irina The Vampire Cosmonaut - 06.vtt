Uh!

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
[IRINA yawns] Took you long
enough to show up.

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
Did you have trouble sleeping?

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
No, why?

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center

Yeah, so what? You're not
looking so great, either.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.878 position:50% align:center
I was too cold to fall asleep.

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
Let's go.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center

Hey, what's the matter
with Irinyan this evening?

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center
Uh, well...

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure,
maybe she's just tired.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
I've never seen her like this.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about her, Lev.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna eat?

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
Of course. I was
just taking my time.

[gasps, groans]

00:04:27.726 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
Whoa! Hey!

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
That's not good.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center

You okay?

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Yeah.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:56.129 position:50% align:center
[SAGALEVICH]
That's more like it!

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
If the subject isn't being
pushed to the brink of death,

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
then we're doing
something wrong!

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

[pants]

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
She doesn't seem to be
performing anywhere close

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
to her usual standard.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.101 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
It makes me wonder if she's
going to be ready for launch.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
That's enough.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] There's nothing
wrong with me, you got it?

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
In that case, let's quit
wasting our time

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
and move on with the agenda.

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.324 position:50% align:center
First we've got the centrifuge,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
and then we'll do some
hypoxia training.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
[LEV] I heated up
some borscht for you.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
I don't want it.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
But you haven't had anything
all day other than water.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
That's because I can't stomach
your horrible human food.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It's never been
a problem before.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
So, what's the plan?

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.640 position:50% align:center
Are we doing our parachute
spin training today?

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Of course not,
don't be stupid.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.603 position:50% align:center
In that state, you'd get
hurt for sure.

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.439 position:50% align:center
I said I'm fine!
I don't have much time left!

00:05:56.523 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
I'm not weak like you
pathetic humans are!

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Irina! You okay?

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] It's nothing.
Just lost my balance.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Go get checked out.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
It's not a big deal!

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]
Yes, it is!

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps]

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
If you push too hard,
our work is wasted.

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.254 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Alright.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
I would say she's
probably anemic.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
And the treatment?

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.807 position:50% align:center
Well, it's best to
just watch and wait.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
Hard to say with a nonhuman.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
Understood, sir.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.774 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
What happened, Irinyan?

00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:43.778 position:50% align:center
It's gotta be something serious.
Be honest with us, okay?

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
I had a nightmare, that's all.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.658 position:50% align:center
What?

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
In it, there was a
rocket that exploded,

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
and the next thing I knew
I was dead like that dog.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Ever since then, my body's
been acting all funny.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
Well, lucky for you
tomorrow's Sunday, right?

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.547 position:50% align:center
You can rest for the whole day.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Even after a full day
of rest she hasn't improved.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
You need to eat, dear.
Have some milk porridge.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.866 position:50% align:center
[IRINA sniffs]

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
[LEV] The doctor assumed that
human treatments wouldn't work,

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
so he just gave up.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
At this rate,

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
she can't withstand training,
let alone the launch.

00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
I understand she's
exhausted from training,

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
but it seems like whatever's
going on with her is mental.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.516 position:50% align:center
She always acts so strong,

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
tries to hide the
pain from everyone.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she's been
pushing herself nonstop.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.438 position:50% align:center
Maybe she reached her limit.

00:08:00.522 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
As tough as she seems,
she's still only 17 years old.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
How could she be
prepared to die?

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:08.697 position:50% align:center
[LEV sighs]
I've tried to understand her,

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
but I guess... I failed.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
[ANYA]
Hang on!

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Uh?

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
[LEV] How does a vampire
even become anemic

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.917 position:50% align:center
in the first place?

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
She said milk is a
substitute for blood,

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
but I don't see how
that makes sense.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
It can't be a
perfect replacement.

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[gasp]
Wait, blood!

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.053 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Delicious.

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center
A feeling of warmth and strength
swept over my entire body.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
That's the answer!

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.896 position:50% align:center
Hey, Anya! What if we get
her to drink some blood?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
[ANYA cheers]

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
It might not work,
but it's worth a try!

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
No way! That's not happening!

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
You can't make me!

You told me that you felt
strong when you drank blood

for the first time.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
I did, but this is
nothing like that.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
I have no idea where
that blood came from!

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
Technically, that's true.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
I'm not drinking it.
It'll defile me.

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
And I'll be even worse off!

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.840 position:50% align:center
But you don't know that,
it might help you!

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.468 position:50% align:center
Forget it. I'd rather die!

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
Everything you guys did.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.638 position:50% align:center
I can't bear to think
it was for nothing!

[LEV sighs]

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It's my fault.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.146 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have taken
her to the crash site.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.276 position:50% align:center
[LEV] Unless I do something,
her dream will die.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] I wanna beat
the humans to space!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
If I can accomplish that, then I
don't care if I'm disposed of.

won't be any question

You're serious?

Absolutely.

proper procedure here?

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
Eh, don't worry about it.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.497 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of scared.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
So am I.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
Is this good?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.380 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Mm.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
Here I go, then.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.392 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.018 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
All finished?

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.020 position:50% align:center
Yeah...

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasp]

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Check your chin.

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:16.528 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] Uh, don't look!
It's embarrassing.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Hey, you know what?
You're way less pale now.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:21.157 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's doing some good.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.618 position:50% align:center
My body's feeling warm,

00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
and I've got a little
burst of energy too.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
Well then we're back on track
to getting you to space.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
But...

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
...doesn't it scare you
to think about it?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.215 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
What?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
If you're selected,

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.554 position:50% align:center
you'll ride a missile into
space that might explode.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
I'd be lying if I said no,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
but my dream is worth
risking my life for.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.895 position:50% align:center
You know that for sure?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
If I have a reason for living,
then it's going into space.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.819 position:50% align:center
I'd give up everything
to do that.

00:12:57.902 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
But why take it that far?

00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:02.449 position:50% align:center
Well, I have all
kinds of motivations.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
It's hard to put it into words.

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:08.329 position:50% align:center
But more than anything, there's
the pure longing to reach space.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
Then again, you know
all about that feeling.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
You were willing to
become an experiment!

00:13:15.503 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm!

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.008 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:20.091 --> 00:13:23.595 position:50% align:center
Don't call it a missile.
A missile is made for killing.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
We ride rockets
that carry dreams.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
And a dream can
never explode.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're right.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
But, hey, why are
you saying "we"?

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.773 position:50% align:center
You won't be flying anywhere
unless you're one of the ones

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:35.899 position:50% align:center
selected for the mission.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
[IRINA gasps] I see you
grinning at me again!

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
Really? Nah, you're
seeing things.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.367 position:50% align:center
Uh, hang on, I'll go get Anya.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lev...

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Thank you.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.895 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] You want us to
postpone the launch date?

00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:17.273 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Yes. I'd like to wait
until the safety level's higher.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
Never mind that!
It's an arbitrary number!

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.320 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] The success
rate is currently sitting

00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
at only 30 percent.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:27.200 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV] If the test
flight works, that's fine.

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:28.785 position:50% align:center
But if we gave it
an extra month,

00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:30.620 position:50% align:center
I believe our chances
would improve a little.

00:14:30.704 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
[GERGIEV]
Despite your feelings,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
the date remains non-negotiable.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.791 position:50% align:center
But, sir!

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
We always do the impossible!

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
Meeting a tight deadline
is hardly a miracle.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can make it work.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.802 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
He's ignoring me.

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:51.016 position:50% align:center
Please, Chief, it's important
for you to get your rest.

00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.977 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me,
just worry about the ship!

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
We'll succeed at all costs!

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN grunts]

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
It hurts!

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Don't give up, Irina!

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:29.763 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Hm!

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
[VIKTOR] There's an update
from the Committee

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
regarding the test flight.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:36.853 position:50% align:center
We were told to place explosives
on the ship with N-Forty-Four,

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
the same as we would if the
test subject were an animal.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Seriously? And that's
the final decision?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
If the ship nears our borders,
it will be detonated,

00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:49.407 position:50% align:center
or we risk revealing
state secrets.

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.743 position:50% align:center
[LEV gasps]

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.912 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
So no matter how hard she tries,

00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.914 position:50% align:center
it could all be pointless.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:57.040 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
Oh, nothing.
That's enough for today.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
Next time you'll go solo.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.799 position:50% align:center
Make it count tomorrow.
It's your final day to practice.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ] Self-destruct?
That sounds really terrible.

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
It's downright cruel.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
They should call the
whole thing off.

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
They're trying to outdo the UK.

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.149 position:50% align:center
That's why they're speeding
through the schedule.

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
She's just a sacrifice
in their war game.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ]
Don't let them hear you.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[LEV grunts]

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
It's not that I don't agree
with what you're saying,

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
but I also want to see you
become a cosmonaut, Lev.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
So, just please, try not
to rock the boat, okay?

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.
Thanks a lot, Franz.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:50.802 position:50% align:center
Enjoy that seltzer.
Might not come back here.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Hey, what was that drink that
you had at the jazz bar?

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
The red one?

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.308 position:50% align:center
Oleaster nastoyka?

00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
Yeah! That was it!

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
I told you about my village,
and how I'm too young to drink.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:06.776 position:50% align:center
But, hey, one day I'll be 20
and I can try that again.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
We'll make a celebration
out of it.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
She managed to survive the Vice-
Director's bullying, at least.

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center

Whoa.

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.635 position:50% align:center
Kind of a long session, huh?

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
The machine's acting a bit odd.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center

Huh?

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
It seems to be broken.
It won't stop!

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
She could die at this rate!

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
What should we do, Franz?

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.903 position:50% align:center
[FRANZ gasps]
Damn!

00:17:49.986 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
What's all the fuss about?

Stop spinning, damn you!

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.593 position:50% align:center
[LEV] It's my responsibility
to keep Irina safe!

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center

It's slowing down!

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:28.733 position:50% align:center

Hey!

00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.869 position:50% align:center
Everything alright?

00:18:39.953 --> 00:18:41.996 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I thought that was the end.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
I'll go get the doctor!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
[SAGALEVICH]
Do you have any idea

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
the amount of damage
you've just done?

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.338 position:50% align:center
The only reason the machine
broke is because that

00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
piece of subhuman trash
was sitting inside it!

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Do it now!

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Calm down!

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50% align:center
That's enough.

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.083 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
You just committed assault
and battery on a superior.

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.089 position:50% align:center
And then there's the
destruction of property.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
Young man...

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
...that's a court-martial!

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center
You're done for!

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Wait! This was all my fault!

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:24.849 position:50% align:center
[MALE GUARD A]
What's going on?

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.769 position:50% align:center
This boy is out of line!
Seize him!

00:20:27.852 --> 00:20:28.812 position:50% align:center
[MALE GUARDS grunt]

00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:30.897 position:50% align:center
We never did your solo spins.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that, but I
know you'll do just fine.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
Lev, no.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Franz!

00:20:54.421 --> 00:20:57.215 position:50% align:center
You'll stay in solitary
until further notice!

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.147 position:50% align:center
This test flight we're prepping
for, it's a state secret.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.190 position:50% align:center
Very few have all the intel.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.152 position:50% align:center
Everyone else believes that
we're launching a mannequin.

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:20.321 position:50% align:center
Um, what'll happen to Lev?

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
Listen. While we're there,

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
don't wander around the
base without clearance.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
[LEV groans]

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:02.614 position:50% align:center
[LEV grunts, shouts]

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:11.539 position:50% align:center
