"You must treat her
like an object." Right.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:02.387 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
So, today.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
I acted exactly as you
wanted me to, didn't I?

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
Sorry?

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:10.687 position:50% align:center
I'm a revolutionary.
That's what you needed, right?

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
Somebody who could lead
our society into a new future.

00:21:14.357 --> 00:21:15.400 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
That's correct.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.736 position:50% align:center
But we're not your
political pawns!

00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Still. I'm happy that you got
the world to acknowledge me.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.786 position:50% align:center
This way I can go to
the moon with pride.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
[LYUDMILA]
That's quite a trip.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
It's three-hundred,
eighty-thousand kilometers.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
Trust me, it'll happen.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Fine. Stay here
until the press conference.

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.767 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Three-hundred,
eighty-thousand kilometers?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
[LEV] In the words of the
brilliant twentieth-century

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
scientist who was the
driving force behind rocketry,

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.233 position:50% align:center
"We'll make the
impossible possible."

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Looks like that came true.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:01.154 position:50% align:center
[LEV] People around the
globe have dreamed about

00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
going to the moon for
hundreds of years.

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
To do it, we all have to
work together, every nation!

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:10.955 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Do you think
that can really happen?

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
I know it.

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:16.336 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
You know what I noticed,

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
looking down at this beautiful
planet of ours from space?

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:23.009 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I couldn't see a single border.

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:28.098 position:50% align:center
â™ª

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:03.633 position:50% align:center
[LEV] By the twenty-first
century, even if we're gone,

00:23:03.717 --> 00:23:06.469 position:50% align:center
I'm sure a lot of people
will be living in space.

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:09.180 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
And they'll be equal,

00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:11.725 position:50% align:center
regardless of race
or background.

00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:16.021 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Maybe what we
accomplished was small,

00:23:16.104 --> 00:23:19.357 position:50% align:center
but I think it was a step
toward a new world.

00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:22.110 position:50% align:center
[IRINA, LEV chuckle]

00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:33.079 position:50% align:center
[LEV, IRINA] Let's take flight,
and soar into our future!
