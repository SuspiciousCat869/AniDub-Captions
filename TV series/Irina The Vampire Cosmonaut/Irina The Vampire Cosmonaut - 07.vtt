[KOROVIN] You are to go
by the call sign "Lycoris".

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.173 position:50% align:center
Do you understand that?

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:49.841 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Lycoris?

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:51.676 position:50% align:center
We'll need to converse with you.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.304 position:50% align:center
One of the mission objectives
is to determine whether a voice

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
transmission can be
received from outer space.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:00.477 position:50% align:center
So, we'll have you read
from what's written here.

[IRINA]
Lycoris Cooking Show?

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
Your physical state will
determine the script.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
If you have no health
issues in zero-G,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
read the recipe for borscht.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
If there's a problem, you'll
read the cheeseburger one.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.786 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
This wasn't in the mock launch.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.246 position:50% align:center
So why am I supposed
to read these?

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.207 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN]
It's a secret code.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.211 position:50% align:center
If the UK is able to intercept
your transmission somehow.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
Well, then I'm sure you
can see how that could

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.924 position:50% align:center
be problematic for us.

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
We speak plainly and they'll
suspect that we're sending

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:36.680 position:50% align:center
a human into space in secret.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
But if they hear a
recipe reading,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.226 position:50% align:center
they'll just assume that it's
some sort of cooking program.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:43.895 position:50% align:center
I think I understand.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:47.023 position:50% align:center
Now, listen carefully.
After you're in the air,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.526 position:50% align:center
you mustn't say anything
but the recipe contents

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.153 position:50% align:center
until communications
have been disconnected.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
And as for the explosives,
you saw them?

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:58.201 position:50% align:center
Yes. Under the seat.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.625 position:50% align:center
[KOROVIN] Don't do anything
unless instructed to.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.335 position:50% align:center
Is that clear?

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.862 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:38.700 position:50% align:center
Well, it won't be long now.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:41.202 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
Wait, I know you... Natalia?

Wait!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center

Lev!

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:07.849 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
They made the whole incident

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:10.018 position:50% align:center
the other day disappear.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:14.314 position:50% align:center
Turns out the centrifuge
wasn't broken, it was sabotaged.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
What?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.442 position:50% align:center
[LEV]
I was told the truth.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
Franz deliberately caused
the equipment failure.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
What? But why would he do that?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
He was acting on
orders from someone

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.242 position:50% align:center
who opposes the Chief.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
If N-Forty-Four had been killed,

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.413 position:50% align:center
then the project
would've failed.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
Which would mean a
demotion for the Chief.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
So what are they going
to do to Franz?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid no record of
such a person exists here.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.509 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
I don't believe it.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
That's the country we live in.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
Anyway. I'm glad I
can watch the launch.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Thanks for getting this back.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.020 position:50% align:center
I know you want to take it with
you, but leave it here with me.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Okay, but if you ever
get a chance to go to the moon,

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
promise me you'll take it.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but that's
not gonna happen.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center
Because you're the one who's
gonna be taking it there.

Mm...

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
That's what's missing!

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
Now there's no way you'll
be mistaken for an enemy.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
We're departing for
the launch site!

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
That's it, Irina.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center

Lycoris. Time to
enter the cabin.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:05.050 position:50% align:center
We'll do the final
checks and then launch.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
That's planned for
108 minutes from now.

You've become quite
a fine cosmonaut.

to do with my teacher.

Hm!

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.705 position:50% align:center

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
No. I'll come back.

[IRINA] Um, this is the
Lycoris Cooking Show!

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Step one: carefully peel
your carrots, potatoes,

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
and beets and cut everything
into bite-size pieces.

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Chop the cabbage,

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
then peel and slice the
onion and dice the celery.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:52.731 position:50% align:center
Step two: heat a drizzle
of oil in a large stew pot

00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.649 position:50% align:center
and sautÃ© the meat.

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:57.986 position:50% align:center
Time to add the carrots,
celery, and a pinch of salt.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.948 position:50% align:center
Once they soften up, add water
and half of a quartered tomato.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Now put in bay leaves, consommÃ©,

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
and your preferred seasonings,
and let it simmer for an hour.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.542 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] Step three: put in
the rest of the vegetables

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
and simmer for 20 minutes more.

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
Be sure to keep the heat low
so the potatoes don't overcook.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
[IRINA] While the borscht
pot is simmering,

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
prepare your sour cream.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
When that's done,
you can taste and plate.

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
[IRINA]
Top with parsley if you prefer.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
And now you have
a perfect borscht!

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
Enjoy in good health!

[CONTROLLER A]
Temperature's rising,

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.799 position:50% align:center
so the heat shield may
be flawed as well!

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
