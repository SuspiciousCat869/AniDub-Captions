1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,786
In other news, the heat is on

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,286
as the temperature soars and the mercury rises,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,620
though fun-seekers at Oarai Beach will not be deterred.

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,549
You know, when I was kid, I couldn't say "Oarai."

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,055
So I used to think it was pronounced

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,055
"Old Wall-Eye" Beach.

7
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:17,388
It did seem like a weird name, though.

8
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,221
Huh. Your brain must be a fascinating place.

9
00:00:20,305 --> 00:00:21,680
Guys, it just dawned on me.

10
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,013
I haven't been to the beach yet this summer.

11
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:25,638
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:29,666
I haven't been to the beach,
like, once in my entire life.

13
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,821
Okay, that shouldn't even be possible! Wow.

14
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,236
You-You're absolutely serious?

15
00:00:35,349 --> 00:00:36,596
Mm-hmm...

16
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,809
I'm just going to come right out and say that's sad.

17
00:00:39,183 --> 00:00:41,834
Well, it's not like there's a
shoreline where we're from, so.

18
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:44,221
But don't they take you on field trips?

19
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:45,513
Sure they do!

20
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,625
In grade school they took us to Kyoto and Nara.

21
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,680
Then when we were older,

22
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,846
in middle school they took us to Nara and Kyoto.

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,638
Sounds like the teachers were really trying

24
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,263
to broaden your minds.

25
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:55,647
All right.

26
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,799
It's sand and surf time!

27
00:00:58,493 --> 00:00:59,538
The schedule's flexible.

28
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:02,054
I think we ought to be able to
squeeze in some fun in the sun.

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,936
Yeah! We got a break coming up. Let's get our feet wet!

30
00:01:04,983 --> 00:01:05,963
Woo-hoo!

31
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:07,742
Nice...

32
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,019
Ringo in beachwear...

33
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:11,956
Something fun...

34
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,846
Something skimpy...

35
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,013
That's a fabulous idea. Where do I sign?

36
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,252
Hell yeah! We've worked hard!

37
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:22,635
And now we play hard!

38
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:23,888
Yeah!

39
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,905
But on the big day...

40
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,507
Unfortunately for those planning a day at the beach,

41
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:31,696
this category one typhoon lost none of its strength

42
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,452
before making landfall.

43
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,794
Mother Nature had other ideas.

44
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:13,477
Flash flood warning, wind advisory, lighting advisory,

45
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:17,324
rockslide advisory. Whoa-boy. Trifecta plus one.

46
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:19,511
In poker, this would be a straight flush.

47
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:22,113
Are we counting high-tide and storm-surge warnings?

48
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:25,108
'Cause, uh, if so,
we're going to need another metaphor here.

49
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,811
This really sucks, guys.

50
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:29,840
Wow. A category one?
On top of all the rain we've been having

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,131
the past couple of weeks?

52
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:32,974
The weather this summer has been out of control.

53
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:36,496
Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach! Beach!

54
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,196
Hah. And speaking of out of control.

55
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,218
The point is to get wet, right?!

56
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,189
So why are we letting a measly little typhoon

57
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:48,231
rain on our parade?! Damn it, I want to go to beach!

58
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:49,343
This isn't fair!

59
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,939
Minori! Please! Look, we all want to go to the beach,

60
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,875
but we can't get there if the buses aren't running.

61
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,083
There's nothing stopping us from
using our bicycles, is there?

62
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:57,672
I vote we tranquilize her!

63
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:59,676
Bikes won't do a whole lot of good under water.

64
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,608
No one's going anywhere in this, all right?

65
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:02,914
The beach will still be there

66
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,789
when our next break comes around. We can go then.

67
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:06,272
I'll even buy you an ice cream cone.

68
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,522
Is that a promise?!

69
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,064
If you calm down, yes. Cross my heart, 'kay?

70
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,189
Okay! But we'll have to be good and wait thirty minutes

71
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:13,522
before getting in the water!

72
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:16,981
Forces beyond all human understanding are at work!

73
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,981
Ugh. Fantastic. Just what we need.

74
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:21,439
What happened to you?

75
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:23,862
They cancelled practical lab on account of the weather.

76
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,189
I didn't get the notification till I was halfway here.

77
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:28,814
And with all the buses shut down,

78
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:32,272
let's just say I've had worse
days, but not all that many.

79
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,508
So, have they cancelled everything?

80
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:37,064
Yep. And it looks like I'm stuck here

81
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,814
till the weather decides to
stop being a pain in the ass.

82
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,272
Huh. Actually, I guess we all are.

83
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,606
Yeah, well. At least we're staying dry.

84
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,555
What kind of practical lab was it?

85
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,772
Oh, just cymbidium repositioning.

86
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,950
Cym... bi... what now?

87
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:53,298
Cym-bidium. It's an orchid.

88
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:56,106
One that prospers in the southeast part of Asia.

89
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:58,367
Specifically in the crisp air of the plateau.

90
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:00,106
We haul them up the mountain each summer

91
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:02,615
to prevent their being blasted by seasonal winds.

92
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:04,558
The wind's that rough on them, huh?

93
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,509
Indeed, and the plants don't develop well

94
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:07,842
when it's too hot.

95
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,064
If they're stunted, then they're worthless.

96
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,477
Wow. Didn't know orchids were your thing.

97
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,543
Didn't I mention what they go for?

98
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:15,434
Of course.

99
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,622
Oh, historically, orchids have been known to fetch

100
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,439
a king's ransom on the open market.

101
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:22,147
Collectors the world over go
nuts for the little buggers.

102
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,347
So... Anyway, before the storm hit

103
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,731
the plan was for us to haul a batch of new cymbidiums

104
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,606
to market in the microbus.

105
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,530
Whoa. The microbus, huh?

106
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,645
You got to be brave to ride in that thing.

107
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:35,402
Truth is, with this wind, I'm just as worried

108
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,842
about the greenhouse as I am
about the flowers themselves.

109
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,852
One good gust and it's all she wrote.

110
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,293
Hadn't thought of that.

111
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:43,772
Hey, uh... You think we should close the storm shutters?

112
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:45,356
I mean, better safe than sorry, right?

113
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,683
Yeah. Good idea.

114
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:50,063
Ah! Can you believe this?

115
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:53,292
Kind of Humbling, isn't it?

116
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:54,890
It's like...

117
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:55,794
I know.

118
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:57,394
An ocean.

119
00:05:57,803 --> 00:05:58,307
Right?

120
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:00,814
Like an ocean.

121
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,397
Ocean?!

122
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,006
Crap.

123
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,939
Stop her! Don't be afraid to use force!

124
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:10,522
Beach boys!

125
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,147
Sweet liberty!

126
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,522
Minori! Get back in here right now!

127
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:21,731
The glorious ocean has come to us!

128
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,481
I feel like a mermaid!

129
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:26,231
It's not the ocean, it's a flood!

130
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:29,106
This is beyond awesome!

131
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,481
Look at me! I'm swimming!

132
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:33,356
Earth to Minori! You'll drown!

133
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,106
The current's gonna sweep you away!

134
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,647
This is so much fun!

135
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,142
Idiot.

136
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:43,504
So. Much. Fun!

137
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,006
Really?

138
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,089
I've never felt so alive!

139
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:51,417
This is ridiculous. Get out of there, damn it!

140
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:52,695
This isn't... !

141
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,375
Yah-hoo!

142
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,263
Splash!

143
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,338
Oh, it is totally on now!

144
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:07,481
I ain't afraid of you!

145
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,157
Whoo!

146
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:16,103
No having fun without me, guys!

147
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:40,398
Should I feel dirty or is this normal?

148
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:44,995
Hey, it's just mud. There's not a thing dirty about it.

149
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,697
We're just two guys enjoying the scenery.

150
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:49,525
Key word: enjoying.

151
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:51,397
Someone find a beach ball right now.

152
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,119
I want to do like they do in the movies!

153
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,583
Volleyball!

154
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,898
Service!

155
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,397
Good game, everybody!

156
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:04,647
Yay!

157
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,606
Okay, now we have to split a watermelon!

158
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:07,397
Who's got one?

159
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:10,397
Somebody say watermelon?!

160
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,061
Huh?

161
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,439
Yeah! Watermelon!

162
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:16,772
Woo!

163
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:18,981
Right! Time for some barbeque!

164
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,522
I'm all over it!

165
00:08:23,356 --> 00:08:24,976
The lighter won't cooperate.

166
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,272
Bring on the kerosene!

167
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:27,642
Aye aye, captain!

168
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,022
Stand clear!

169
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:36,004
We've made fire!

170
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,772
Yeah, because we rock!

171
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:39,189
Still, either way!

172
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,981
Bonfire!

173
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,647
I could really go for some music.

174
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,272
Music, coming right up!

175
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,769
Sick summer beats, anyone?!

176
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,522
Party time!

177
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,022
Are you plebeians out of your minds?!

178
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,897
You'll spook the livestock!

179
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:05,397
Yoshida, hey! Heads up, Fun Bags at 6 o'clock!

180
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,272
Yay!

181
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,206
What on earth is wrong with you people?!

182
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:12,075
Aw, come on! Live at little! Get this farm-wear off!

183
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:14,289
Proper beach party attire only!

184
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:17,147
Take your filthy paws off me this instant, Vulgarians!

185
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,439
Well, well! Lookie here!

186
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:20,839
For all your whining you actually came prepared!

187
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,147
You always wear a bikini under there?

188
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,939
It's not a bikini, it's my underwear, you moron!

189
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:30,897
Busting out! Busting out! Busting out!

190
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:33,231
Yay!

191
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:34,814
Not so fast!

192
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:35,592
Huh...?

193
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:39,083
How dare you? This is hallowed ground!

194
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:42,337
Our beach is not the place for
you people to let it all hang out!

195
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:44,201
Who are they?

196
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:47,247
Ha! Feast your eyes on Tamo No-Rin's world class

197
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:49,560
beach volleyball team-ah!

198
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:52,171
We have a volleyball team?!

199
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:54,439
Given that we're nowhere near an actual beach,

200
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:57,497
isn't that sort of like a regional
hockey league in the tropics?

201
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,689
Whatever you guys want, just leave us alone!

202
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,696
Can't you see we're busy stripping
our friend here down to her undies?!

203
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,413
Maybe we were a little too quick to judge.

204
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:05,373
Hey!

205
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,689
Allow me to introduce myself.

206
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:10,420
I'm the team's preppy nice-guy captain, Hamaoka.

207
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,050
My comrade's name...

208
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,177
Butter. Ken Butter.

209
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,967
Wait. Hold up. THE Ken Butter?

210
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:19,950
Does this guy have a reputation?

211
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:22,132
I don't know. Never heard of him in my life.

212
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:25,300
If I say he's one of Biotech's
so-called Sweet Musketeers

213
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,522
whose name everyone associates
with prize-winning treats,

214
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:28,939
I'm just talking outta my ass.

215
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,606
Want to make your toast slick?

216
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,939
Try... Ken... Butter!

217
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,106
Shut up, please.

218
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,731
Care for a little friendly competition?

219
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:36,856
Huh?

220
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,720
See, we're in the middle of gearing
up for the regional tournament.

221
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,772
Got to get your practice on when
and where you can, know what I mean?

222
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,356
Where are they having this tournament?

223
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:47,120
Nagano!

224
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:49,119
There's no frigging beach in Nagano!

225
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,064
Um, yeah. Hello. It's called a day trip, dude!

226
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,439
Where was it last year?

227
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:54,272
Gunma.

228
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:55,189
Oh, come on!

229
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:56,189
The year before that,

230
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:57,439
they held it in Saitama.

231
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,932
Not to be that girl,

232
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,981
but, none of those places are near the ocean.

233
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,189
Where exactly do you play?

234
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:03,522
Oh. Riverbeds.

235
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,022
Wow. Must hurt.

236
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,897
Look, never mind about that, all right?!

237
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,170
Just play with us!

238
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,647
Pretty please?

239
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,102
Can I talk to you for a second?

240
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,647
Sure, no problem. What's up?

241
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:15,603
The fields are taking a real beating.

242
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,426
Uh-oh. This is bad.

243
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,747
We've got to hurry!

244
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,272
The rice will be completely submerged!

245
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,314
So I'm guessing that's not a good thing?

246
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:35,689
Rice is a finicky plant, you have to be careful.

247
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:38,106
You want the stalks under water, but not the ears.

248
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:39,606
If that happens, they'll start to sprout

249
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:41,439
in which case, the yield will be nothing.

250
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:42,231
Really?

251
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:42,826
Really!

252
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:44,932
We won't be able to eat it, we won't be able to sell it.

253
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:47,397
We won't even be able to use it
to fertilize next year's crop.

254
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,019
All our hard work for nothing!

255
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:49,871
Oh no!

256
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:04,255
Now what? What's the plan?
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

257
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,715
It's okay. We, uh...

258
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:07,437
We got this.

259
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,705
Oh crap!

260
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:11,547
Look at it!

261
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:14,499
Sorry. If only I'd have noticed this sooner.

262
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,030
Calm yourselves, Vulgarians!

263
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,600
What's been the purpose of your training if not... !

264
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,631
One moment, please!

265
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:26,272
Okay. Take two... in five, four, three, two...

266
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,188
You disgust me!

267
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:30,990
As I was saying.

268
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:32,812
Once more, from the top.

269
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,803
Your training has prepared you for this!

270
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:36,946
We are nothing if not agricultural students

271
00:12:36,981 --> 00:12:38,539
and this is our moment to shine!

272
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:40,307
Oohhh...

273
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:43,233
Kousaku, take charge! Everyone else, follow!

274
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:45,331
From here on out, we take all orders from you,

275
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,022
this includes me! Are we agreed?

276
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:47,760
Fun Bags!

277
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,371
A yes or no would suffice!

278
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:52,886
Right. First, we open the rear drain. It's all you, Kei!

279
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,231
And what's a rear drain?

280
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,647
It's a kind of like a vent. Regulates the water level.

281
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,730
To keep the ears from getting submerged?

282
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:09,121
Provided the wind doesn't blow them over, exactly.

283
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:16,035
Come to papa!

284
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:24,314
Kamatori!

285
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,789
Kei! Are you going to be all right?!

286
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:29,501
I'm good! It's just... Just a little mud!

287
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:33,439
I'll be damned if the drain gets clogged!

288
00:13:33,468 --> 00:13:34,492
I got this!

289
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,200
Cool!

290
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,084
Now that Kei's bought us some
time, let's rope off the field!

291
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:38,864
Right!

292
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,692
I need everyone to be careful!

293
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,198
Don't fall on the plants!

294
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:49,713
Understood.

295
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,373
Hamaoka, run back to the school

296
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,664
and bring us some more rope, STAT!

297
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:53,499
You got it!

298
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,110
Yoshida, your jugs are crushing the stalks!

299
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:55,696
I'm sorry!

300
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:58,022
Minori, stop letting your ass poke out!

301
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,064
Ringo, you're doing perfect. Nice job!

302
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:03,391
Butter dude! What the hell are you doing?

303
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,416
Where are you pants?

304
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:07,304
Aw, no worries. Butter totally repels water!

305
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,737
Gross, but okay.

306
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,175
All right, that ought to hold her for now.

307
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
Good on us, huh?

308
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:23,231
Class D's field shouldn't take too long.

309
00:14:23,314 --> 00:14:24,439
Kousaku!

310
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:25,365
What is it?

311
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,206
The rice in Class D's field is growing way too quickly!

312
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:30,717
Huh?

313
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,081
The stalks are so tall the ears are drooping.

314
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,800
The ropes can't support them! The crop is done for!

315
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:37,552
Why would they grow it so fast?

316
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,370
Hey, what's the deal with Class D?

317
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:41,312
I'm sorry...

318
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,147
We planted Koshihikari.

319
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,481
What in the hell would you do a thing like that for?!

320
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:46,456
Is that bad?

321
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,147
Koshihikari has a reputation for falling over so easily,

322
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,268
it's nickname is "Collapsikari!" It sprouts up too tall!

323
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,174
With the stalks already that long...

324
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:56,854
...they don't stand a chance.

325
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,814
This wind will knock 'em over like bowling pins!

326
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,610
Oh no!

327
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:02,189
Why would you guys cultivate something so risky?!

328
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:03,381
What was I supposed to do?!

329
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,564
This particular variety sells like gang-busters!

330
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:06,997
You won't be selling much of anything

331
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,289
when the whole field goes tits up!

332
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,928
You two, quit your bickering!

333
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:11,985
Now is not the time for that argument!

334
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:12,807
You're right!

335
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,688
There are more important things to focus on!

336
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,221
Captain Aramis must save the day! Pronto!

337
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:20,738
Just... Just give me a minute to think.

338
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,683
There's too many stalks for us

339
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,961
to move them out of harm's way.

340
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,010
The only thing to do is block the wind.

341
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,305
Except... how, exactly?

342
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,788
Hey, our volleyball net is super durable.

343
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:37,863
Why don't we use that?

344
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:39,623
Last I checked, a net is made of holes!

345
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,380
We need something that'll make a wall.

346
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,331
Well, sandbagging would be the best option,

347
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:44,363
except it's a little late for that.

348
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:45,939
Thank you, Captain Obvious!

349
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:49,856
Ah! Ah-ha! Kanegami! The keys!

350
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:50,293
Huh?

351
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,388
To the microbus! Give me!

352
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,667
You had it gassed up to move the cymbidiums, didn't you?

353
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:57,809
Ugh. Of course.

354
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,551
What are you cooking up there, chief?

355
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,228
Sorry! No time to explain!

356
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,752
I'll be back, just start roping off the field!

357
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:14,546
Ha! This is gonna work...

358
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,250
Kousaku!

359
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,811
Ringo! The field!

360
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,942
The others have it covered, it's okay.

361
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,194
Fun Bags didn't like you wandering off on your own

362
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,576
in the storm, so she asked me to stay with you.

363
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:28,695
Yeah, thanks. I'm a child.

364
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,690
Thank you, Fun Bags...

365
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,716
So what's your big plan, exactly?

366
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:35,753
We're gonna improvise a wall.

367
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:36,806
O-kay...

368
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,781
It's simple: drive this upwind and we block the gusts.

369
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:43,721
Stay with me here: Class D's
field is the furthest up, right?

370
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,739
Of its four sides, three are flanked by roads.

371
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:48,789
If we drive the microbus to the road up top,

372
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:50,481
it'll shield their crop from the wind.

373
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,997
I had no idea you even knew how to drive.

374
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,822
I don't, but it's a standard diesel engine.

375
00:16:57,856 --> 00:16:58,915
So, you know...

376
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:02,805
It can't be that different from a tractor.

377
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:10,327
Okey-doke. First gear.

378
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,142
Release the emergency brake.

379
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:17,772
Rev the engine just enough to get her nice and ready.

380
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,622
Ease up on the clutch about halfway.

381
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,594
Release the clutch once we get things a-moving.

382
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,793
And give her some juice.

383
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,231
Hell yeah! Didn't even stall once!

384
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,189
That's incredible!

385
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,277
Nothing any farm boy couldn't do, really.

386
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:38,164
Thing is...

387
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,943
Yeah?

388
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,522
Driving without adult supervision

389
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,502
is majorly against the rules.

390
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,550
Miss Becky's gonna be out-of-her-mind furious.

391
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:48,347
Watch me get suspension.

392
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:55,078
You're not alone.

393
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:59,286
If she gets upset, it'll be at both of us.

394
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,030
Let's pull this mother out!

395
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,740
Whoa! Aw, damn it! I can't see the road!

396
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,300
Use the windshield wipers!

397
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,749
The, uh, what?

398
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,639
Those little things that go back
and forth on the windshield!

399
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:37,812
It comes with those, right?

400
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,452
Hello?

401
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,095
Yeah, I don't know.

402
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,897
Well tractors and combines don't come with them,

403
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:48,925
how am I supposed to know about buses?

404
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,689
What are you doing?!

405
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:56,686
Don't freak.

406
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:58,826
I'm going to act as your lookout, okay?

407
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,147
I need you to follow my directions to the letter!

408
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:02,585
Uh... Okay.

409
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,085
Keep going straight!

410
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,693
You got it!

411
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:10,221
Start veering to the right! We're passing the gym!

412
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:11,321
Veering right!

413
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:20,051
All right, now straighten the wheel!

414
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:23,519
Easy does it, easy does it.

415
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,030
Kousaku!

416
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,006
Make a sharp right when I give the word. Got it?

417
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:45,826
Yeah!

418
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:50,377
In three... Two... One... Now!

419
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:03,494
Ringo!

420
00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:19,536
Hold on, I've got you, okay?

421
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,409
And...

422
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,822
Yoink!

423
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,164
Diet for me, please!

424
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,231
OJ, thanks.

425
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:44,173
Oh, orange juice for me, too, please.

426
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,132
Yeah. Here.

427
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:51,399
How about it, guys?

428
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,614
Is the marketing teacher awesome-sauce or what?

429
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:55,795
Hell yeah you treat the people who saved your rice crop

430
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,282
to a day at the beach! That's what I'm talkin' 'bout!

431
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,983
Yep.

432
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,789
I'm finally going to see the ocean

433
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:04,460
for the first time in my life!

434
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:07,231
The school's not above bending
the rules every now and then.

435
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:08,439
You're a lucky man, dude.

436
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:11,022
Can't believe you got off with a slap on the wrist.

437
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:11,974
No kidding, right?

438
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,206
If your little stunt hadn't saved the field,

439
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,675
you'd both be suspended.

440
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,809
Whatever. Big whoop. It was so totally worth it.

441
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,686
Hey. Kousaku.

442
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:32,392
Ha?

443
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:34,858
You, uh, might wanna listen to this.

444
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:36,706
The typhoon prone to make landfall

445
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:39,481
any minute now is even bigger
than last week's category one.

446
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,522
Residents are advised to stay indoors,

447
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,373
as potential wind speeds at the storm's core

448
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:46,023
are projected to be up to 72 kilometers per hour.

449
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,456
I'm going to the beach!

450
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,714
Try to stop me, I dare you!

451
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,073
Minori, no! Wait!

452
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,306
Someone restrain her!

453
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,039
Minori, it's okay.

454
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,747
Focus on the sound of my voice.

455
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:58,611
Beach boys!

456
00:21:58,636 --> 00:21:59,750
You're a girl!

457
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:39,333
Veggie Battle: Ultimate v. Supreme
