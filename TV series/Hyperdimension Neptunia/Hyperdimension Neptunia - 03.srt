00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:09,375
Now, Compa on the other hand.
She's an angel! Chu!

157
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,666
My apologies! Sorry to keep
you waiting, everyone!

158
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,083
I'd like to take
this opportunity

159
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,208
to welcome you to
my house party!

160
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,458
You must be joking.
You didn't contribute anything.

161
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,500
Let it go.
It'll fall on deaf ears.

162
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,500
I heard you got dizzy
earlier. Are you okay?

163
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,375
Yeah. It was nothing, I'm fine.

164
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,000
[VERT]
Come on, everyone!

165
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:34,041
I'd like for us all to relax
and eat, drink, and be merry!

166
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,666
Why, I've prepared
a special game

167
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,750
for this very occasion, in fact.

168
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,791
Ooh! Really? What is it?

169
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,333
[VERT] I think in this
case it would be easier

170
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,041
to show you than to tell you.

171
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,041
Neptune, Noire,
if you don't mind.

172
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,333
I'd like for you to back
up just a bit, please.

173
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,125
You got it!

174
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,000
Hm? What for?

175
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,416
All right. Why don't you show
us a bit of fighting spirit?

176
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,250
Aah! Awesome!

177
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,416
Look at Nep-Nep!

178
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,041
Dude! What happened
to me? I'm a Dogoo!

179
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,333
I can't believe it!
Is this really me?

180
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,750
I'm using a special
camera to capture

181
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,833
your expressions and
movements. It then processes

182
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,250
and holo-projects them. You can
also use it to search the net.

183
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:17,541
So I just use my lame, armless
goo body to attack Noire?

184
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,958
Okay, Noigoo, get ready!

185
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,791
I'll nep you until
you're black and blue!

186
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,541
Whoa. And who are you
calling "Noigoo," huh?

187
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,208
Wah!

188
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,166
Yay! The first
point goes to me!

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,208
Now you've done it,
impertinent little slime!

190
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,541
Say your prayers, Nep-goo!

191
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
Upside-down Noigoo!

192
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,916
Incidentally, I've also
prepared a simulation mode

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,375
geared more toward
real battle,

194
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,625
so you can use this for
combat training as well.

195
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,625
That's neat.

196
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,125
Yeah! It sounds fun!

197
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,166
I wanna play, too!

198
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,708
You can absolutely play
as much as you like.

199
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,791
[WARECHU]
Chu... Chu... Chu...

200
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,416
You're late! Are you trying to
undermine our entire plan?

201
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,125
[WARECHU] Gimme a break!
I came as fast

202
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,541
as my stumpy mouse legs would
carry me! It's your fault

203
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,958
for making the deadlines
too tight, you old hag!

204
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,041
How many times do I have
to tell you not to talk

205
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,583
to your master like that?
No, never mind. I'm not going

206
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,208
to dignify the complaints of
some filthy rat with a response.

207
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,416
Hand over the goods and
let's be done with this.

208
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,416
[WARECHU] Yeah,
yeah, here you go.

209
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,666
Now we have four of them.

210
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,583
And tonight,
as the world sleeps,

211
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,041
the rules for the game of
life will be rewritten.

212
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:37,791
[energetic chatter]

213
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,875
Yes, what is it? We're in
the middle of a party here.

214
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,583
[WORKER] Lady Vert...
I'm afraid that...

215
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,125
[VERT]
Ah--!

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,458
What's wrong?
It's over already?

217
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,666
What is it, Vert?
Did something happen?

218
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes. I was just told of a
reported mass monster breakout.

219
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,083
The sighting occurred at
a waste disposal facility

220
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,166
over in Zune District.

221
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,875
[BLANC] Zune District, huh?
That's a long way from here.

222
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,208
It's an island that's
only connected

223
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,208
to the mainland at low tide.

224
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,208
[NEPTUNE] What's the big deal?
Monsters pop up all the time!

225
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,375
True, but that's not
the case in this district.

226
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,041
It's under state supervision.

227
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:25,500
However... The reports
do seem to be accurate.

228
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,458
Sorry to break up the party,
but I should go.

229
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,916
[NEPTUNE] Wait,
I'm coming with you!

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,916
Thank you, but...
there's no need

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,041
to get involved in my
country's problems.

232
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,291
The way I see it,
fate brought us together,

233
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,750
and this must be the reason.
Come on, let us help!

234
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,625
So let me guess. This is
your "We signed a treaty,

235
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,291
so we're comrades"
thing again, isn't it?

236
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,500
Yeah, pretty much.

237
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,958
[BLANC] I'm coming, too.
You can think of it

238
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,916
as my way of saying thanks for
your help with the kidnapping.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,958
Alright, then!
It's a party of three!

240
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,625
[NOIRE] You're not
leaving without me!

241
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,958
There's no way of
knowing how long

242
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,208
you three would keep the
rest of us waiting here.

243
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,750
You're certain?

244
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,833
Alright, then. It's the
four goddesses together!

245
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,041
[NEPGEAR] Excuse me.
Let me help. Okay?

246
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,166
Uh... I-I'm coming, too!

247
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,166
[RAM]
Me too!

248
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,583
[ROM]
Me too, please.

249
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,500
[BLANC] I'm sorry, but you
can't. This isn't a game.

250
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,666
[RAM]
Ohh...

251
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
[NOIRE] Uni, you
stay behind, too.

252
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,916
You can't even properly
transform yet.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,500
[NEPTUNE] Nepgear! Just leave
this one to the big sisters.

254
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,208
Sometimes we gotta
show off, you know?

255
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,666
Okay.

256
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,750
Thanks, and now that
that's settled... Transform!

257
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,541
Alright, everyone.
It's time we move out.

258
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,958
[WARECHU] Well, they're all
random encounter trash,

259
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,541
but I gotta admit, there
sure are a lot of them!

260
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,041
[ARFOIRE]
It was necessary.

261
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,500
How else could I lure all four
CPUs all the way out here?

262
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,708
[ARFOIRE giggles]

263
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,708
I hope they don't
keep us waiting.

264
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,333
[ROM] Miss Nepgear?
Are you okay?

265
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,250
Oh! Yes, I'm fine,
thanks for asking.

266
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,208
I'm just worried about
Sis and the others.

267
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,041
But why would you be worried?
Is your sister weak, Nepgear?

268
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,166
Mm-mm. No, that's not it.

269
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,833
When she gets serious,
she becomes really strong!

270
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,583
Since I'm the weak one,
she's always been there

271
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,250
when I need her to protect me.

272
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,833
But today...
something's different.

273
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,583
Today I feel really
uneasy for some reason.

274
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,750
You feel uneasy?

275
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,791
I see. Uh-huh.
Okay, thanks, Otome.

276
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,500
That confirms it.
I knew something was going on.

277
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,833
You mean about
the monster attack?

278
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,000
That mouse from the
mall earlier today.

279
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,791
I had seen him before. So I
asked a fellow Guild member

280
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,791
working intelligence
to check it out.

281
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,125
Sure enough, that mouse is
on every country's blacklist.

282
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,958
He is likely up to no good.

283
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,541
He's considered a very
suspicion person, er, mouse.

284
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:14,541
What? Are you saying that...
that Mister Mouse is a bad guy?

285
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,250
I'm sad to hear that.

286
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,083
And that's not
all we discovered.

287
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,416
It seems he took a boat out to
Zune District a few hours ago.

288
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,958
So what are you saying?

289
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,833
While I don't have
solid proof, I'm saying

290
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:29,000
that those monsters popping
up there wasn't a coincidence.

291
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,208
He's up to something,
and we need to know what.

292
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,791
There's still time for
me to make the low tide.

293
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,125
I'm going. We need to get
to the bottom of this.

294
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,625
[NEPGEAR]
Take me with you.

295
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,583
Please! I'm worried
and I want to help!

296
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,291
What? There's no way.

297
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,750
I can't risk exposing
you to danger, too.

298
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,916
I can't stand this, IF!
Let me come! I'm begging you!

299
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,625
There it is. Just up ahead.

300
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,833
Damn! That is a ton of monsters.

301
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,291
There may be many, but they
all look low-level to me.

302
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,666
I think you're right.

303
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,791
Still, we can't let them
make it into town.

304
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:13,708
We need to kill them
here before they--

305
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,250
[ALL gasp]

306
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,666
Looks like they've
got a few big ones!

307

They'll make worthy
enemies, at least.

Perfect. That makes
one for each of us.

You three! Hold up!
The textbook method here

312
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,333
is to stick together and
take them one at a time!

313
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,833
What a spineless textbook.

314
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,125
Honestly, once
they transform,

315
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,208
they turn into a bunch
of fighting vipers!

But... I can't really
say I'm any different!

Alright. Here's the deal.
Don't take any risks,

Well, crap.

I think we can

Which would mean
that they're both last.

Well, technically speaking,
I was just a tiny bit faster.

The stone is known
as an "Anticrystal."

351
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,583
It severs the much-needed link
you have with the Sharicite,

00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,875
thereby stripping
you of your power.

An Anticrystal?

Which means that your
