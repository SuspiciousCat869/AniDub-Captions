00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,625
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Heed my words,

2
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,875
all those who make
Gamindustri their home.

3
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,375
[NEPTUNE (PH)]
This day represents the

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,375
first step into a new era,

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:31,625
and I am thrilled that you and
I are able to greet it together.

6
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,791
Welcome to the next level.

7
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,083
[NEPTUNE (PH)]
As I'm sure you know.

8
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,958
In the past years,
this fantasy star of ours

9
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,875
has been plagued
with constant war.

10
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:50,291
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Lastation, ruled
by the goddess Black Heart.

11
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,458
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Lowee, ruled
by the goddess White Heart.

12
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,458
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Leanbox, ruled
by the goddess Green Heart.

13
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,041
[NEPTUNE (PH)]
And last, but not least,

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:13,041
Planeptune, ruled by
yours truly. Purple Heart.

15
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,166
Our kingdoms have
vied for Share energy,

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,166
the source of a
nation's strength.

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,708
And on occasion even
the goddesses themselves

18
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,291
have come to blows in
this fruitless struggle.

19
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,500
But that shall be no more.

20
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,125
The friendship treaty
we shall sign today

21
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:35,000
will ban all taking of
Shares with military force.

22
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,791
From now on we shall
increase our own Shares

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,208
by improving our
beloved countries.

24
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:44,916
And fostering a healthy
development of the entire world.

25
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,916
We hereby vow
to overcome our past

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,541
and create a world of hope,

27
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:53,500
so that all people may
prosper as long as we live.

28
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,541
Whoopdie whoo!
We did it, guys!

29
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,291
And now you're a
bite-sized idiot again.

30
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,958
How charming.

31
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,750
[NEPTUNE] Whatever, Noire,
you know you love me!

32
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,250
But how did you like the speech?

33
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,958
It was, adequate, I suppose.

34
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,416
Though I'm sure
Histoire wrote it for you.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
[NEPTUNE]
Boo.

36
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,291
Either way, I'm still
pissed you had

37
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,458
to attention whore
all over <i>our</i> moment.

38
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,625
[NEPTUNE] Aw, Blanc,
I won my chance

39
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,500
to give the speech
fair and square.

40
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,916
Don't be smug.
It was just rock-paper-scissors.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,833
Well, we did all agree.

42
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,625
No use bickering over
it after the fact.

43
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,416
[NEPTUNE] For real!
'Cause we're like,

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,375
all on each other's
friends lists now, right?

45
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,708
[HISTOIRE thinking]
I'm sure this is the beginning

46
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,375
of a productive future.

47
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,875
It's been a month

48
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,041
and you're still not doing
your CPU job at all, Neptune!

49
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,333
Sonic Jump! Aw! Dang it!

50
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,041
Are you listening to me?

51
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,750
Hmm? Hey, even a goddess
needs a break, right?

52
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,916
A break from what?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All you've done is
sleep and play games!

54
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,291
[NEPGEAR] Neptune!
The tea is ready!

55
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,000
Huh?

56
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,500
Sweet, thanks Nepgear.

57
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,333
So, you wanna do some PVP?

58
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,250
[NEPGEAR] Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,166
Et tu, Nepgear?

60
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,250
Let's see you play games. Now!

61
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,750
No!

62
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,750
Hey, it says in the user
manual not to do that!

63
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,083
Don't try this at home,
boys and girls!

64
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,958
[COMPA] Iffy!

65
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,625
Hey, Compa!

66
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,166
[IF] Did you just get off work?

67
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,166
[COMPA] Yep!

68
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,791
Now I'm on my way
to see Nep-Nep!

69
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,250
Hey, that rhymed.

70
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,291
[IF] Good. I guess
I'll join you, then.

71
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,791
[FEMALE] ...without goddesses!

72
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,166
Now, we should live our lives
by regulations that--Oof!

73
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,791
Hmm?

74
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,375
Here, take a look!

75
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,375
At the Sharicite, not at me!

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,416
[NEPGEAR] The Sharicite?

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,958
Why, is there
something wrong with it?

78
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,958
The Share energy
levels in our crystal

79
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,125
have been declining.

80
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,916
As I have clearly
indicated here.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sweet graph, but
what's the big deal?

82
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,333
We've still got
plenty, don't we?

83
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,875
[HISTOIRE] No, we don't!

84
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,333
Do you know where
Shares come from

85
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,125
or do you need another diagram?

86
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,250
[NEPTUNE] Uh...

87
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,291
[NEPGEAR] It's like
how much a country

88
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,500
believes in its goddess, right?

89
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,416
Their faith.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,916
[HISTOIRE] Yes, exactly.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,875
Which means the hearts
of the people are starting

92
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,291
to drift away from Neptune,
which is no wonder, really.

93
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,083
What? But I haven't
done anything

94
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,791
to make them hate me,
I don't think!

95
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,333
[NEPGEAR] Hmm, you
haven't done anything

96
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,791
to make them like
you either, though.

97
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,666
I mean, uh...

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,833
[IF] Nepgear's right,
and you know it.

99
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,875
Please, excuse us,
Miss Histoire.

100
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,125
But we overheard you talking.

101
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,666
[HISTOIRE] IF, you and
Compa, are always welcome.

102
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,750
[NEPTUNE] You're siding
with Histy too, Iffy?

103
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,375
But Compa still loves me, right?

104
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,166
Well, Nep-Nep,
she has a point.

105
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,958
[NEPTUNE] Hmm?

106
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,541
"We don't need goddesses."

107
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,916
[COMPA] If they understood
you a little better,

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,166
then everything would be fine.

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,166
Don't worry!

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,833
It's nothing hard
work can't fix.

111
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,833
Uhhh! Everyone's against me!

112
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,750
I'm in a major pinch!

113
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,916
It's this country of
yours that's in a pinch!

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,416
Eh...

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,750
[HISTOIRE] Remember, CPUs are
goddesses who are supposed

116
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,083
to work tirelessly for
the good of their people.

117
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,875
Why do you think you
have those powers of yours?

118
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,916
As a wise man once said...

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,333
[NEPTUNE thinking] Ugh. Man,
I hate getting lectured.

120
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,916
I wonder if I can
just, like, run away?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,333
Wait! Of course!

122
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,583
I am gonna get me some
schooling in the goddess arts!

123
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:31,208
Huh? Okay, but
schooling from who?

124
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,666
[NEPTUNE] From, uh... Noire!

125
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,875
[EVERYONE ELSE] What?!

126
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,458
Time for a
Lastation vacation!

127
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,750
I'm not following
the situation here.

128
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,083
Why exactly is my
neighboring country's' CPU

129
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,541
napping in my Basilicom?

130
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,250
Ahhh... Just ignore
me and do your job.

131
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,083
I won't mind one little bit.

132
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,708
[NOIRE] Yeah, well, I do mind!

133
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,833
I'm sorry,
'bout this Noire.

134
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,416
Get up, Neptune, please!

135
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Why?

136
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,208
You wanted to be a
better CPU, right?

137
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,791
[NOIRE] Yeah, about
all that--no thanks.

138
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,500
I have no intention of teaching
my enemies how to do their jobs.

139
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,875
[NEPTUNE]
Aww, but we're buddies now!

140
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,875
That's what we signed that
friendship treaty for, right?

141
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:14,958
So we could--

142
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,041
As long as we're
competing for Shares,

143
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,291
that still makes
us enemies. Get it?

144
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,416
Bluh! Why you always gotta be
such a meanie all the time?

145
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,333
See, now this is why you
don't have any friends!

146
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,833
I-I do too have a friend!

147
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,583
Whoa. For real?

148
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,875
What's her name, then?

149
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,916
Huh? Oh, you don't know her.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,916
Hey, Noire.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,125
I finished these
documents for you!

152
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,125
Oh, thanks, Uni, that's nice.

153
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,041
Just set them over there.

154
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,750
[UNI] My job, uh...

155
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,458
I was, pretty fast, right?

156
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,125
I worked really hard this time.

157
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,541
[NOIRE] It was average.

158
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,625
But that's still an
improvement for <i>you.</i>

159
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,041
[NEPTUNE] Wait.

160
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,291
Was Uni the mysterious "friend"
you were talking about?

161
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,791
'Cause little sisters
are little sisters--

162
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,958
they don't count as friends.

163
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,708
Of course not!
I have another.

164
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,708
Oh really?

165
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,791
'Cause you sure look
like a lonely loner to me!

166
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,125
[NOIRE] Then you need
to get your eyes checked!

167
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,750
[UNI] Nepgear.

168
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,166
I'm sorry Neptune kind
of hijacked your talk

169
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,208
with your sister.

170
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,708
[UNI] It's okay.

171
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,791
My conversations with her
always turn out the same anyway.

172
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,000
[UNI] It's like she has
this rule, where she won't

173
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,416
compliment me unless
I do a better job than her.

174
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,083
[UNI] But we both know
that's not possible.

175
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,000
Uni.

176
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,375
[UNI] I can't even transform
into my goddess form yet.

177
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,125
[NEPGEAR] That's nothing
to feel down about.

178
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,125
I mean, neither can I,
and neither can Rom or Ram.

179
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,166
Well, I suppose
I'll just have to transform

180
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,541
before the three of you
to prove my superiority.

181
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,541
How's that?

182
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,750
Good!

183
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,583
But you better hurry,
or I might beat you!

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,916
[NEPGEAR] A message.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,625
From Rom, actually.

186
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,791
She knows I'm in Lastation,
but who told her?

187
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,375
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

188
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,208
And let me tell you,
she was super jealous.

189
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,583
[ROM] No fair.

190
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,916
Nepgear and Uni are so lucky,
getting to play together.

191
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,750
How come we gotta stay home
while they get to do cool stuff?

192
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,958
[BLANC] Maybe because
you're noisy and selfish?

193
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,416
[RAM] I wanna hang out
with Nepgear and Uni, too!

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,541
I have work to do.

195
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,250
You suck!
You suck! You suck!

196
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,916
[RAM] Come on!

197
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,000
Shut up! I said
I had work, didn't I?

198
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,958
You're a big meanie,
you know that?

199
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,458
Let's go, Rom.

200
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,666
[ROM] Ram, wait a second.

201
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,708
I'm sorry you had to
listen to that mess.

202
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,666
[VERT] Oh, nonsense.
I don't mind at all.

203
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,000
In fact, I envy their innocence.

204
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,833
The little sisters don't have a
history of fighting like we do.

205
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,791
Now that the gears
of war have stopped,

206
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,333
should we try to
be more like them?

207
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,625
[BLANC] Just because we're not
having a punch out anymore.

208
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,750
Doesn't mean we're going

209
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,916
to turn into good
neighbors overnight.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,333
And more importantly.

211
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,666
Yes, of course.

212
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,583
Let me tell you the
rest of my little proposal.

213
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,583
[NEPTUNE] Whoopsie!
Uh-oh, uh-oh!

214
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:38,791
[NOIRE] Stop it!

215
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,041
Your paper-touching
privileges are revoked!

216
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,750
[NEPTUNE] What?
But you said, and I quote:

217
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,166
"a goddess' first duty is
taking care of paperwork"!

218
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,416
[NOIRE] Yeah, your paperwork!

219
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Mine is sacred!

220
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,666
Lame. You need
an attitude check.

221
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,791
[NOIRE] What?

222
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,791
Oh no, you did not
just say that to me.

223
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,541
[IF] Uhmm.

224
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,375
Do you have requests from
the citizens to kill monsters,

225
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,000
or something like that?

226
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,583
[IF] If you teach her
to be a monster hunter,

227
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,958
that might help her
improve as a goddess, too.

228
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,500
[COMPA] Oh, good idea.

229
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:09,041
And it'll keep her away from
all those precious papers!

230
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,750
[NOIRE] This is a good one.

231
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,375
Here, take a look.

232
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,541
And it's right near
Planeptune as well.

233
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,916
[NEPTUNE] Is that your
not-so-subtle way

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,166
of saying you want me
to go home after this?

235
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,208
[NOIRE] I have a job to do.

236
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,500
Of course I want you gone.

237
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,333
[NEPTUNE] Okeydokey guys, let's
go do some monster hunting!

238
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,125
[NOIRE] Right! I mean, shut up!

239
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,916
Why are you acting like
the leader all of a sudden?

240
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,500
[NOIRE] We'll be clearing
monsters from two places.

241
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,083
The Nasuune Highlands and
the nearby Toruunay Cave.

242
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,916
Neither of them are--

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,666
[UNI] Hey, sis?

244
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,791
[NOIRE] What is it? Huh?

245
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,166
[UNI] Nobody is listening.

246
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,500
[COMPA] I'm too pooped to move!

247
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,250
[IF] I'm fresh out
of piggybacks.

248
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,791
[NEPTUNE] Whoa!

249
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,375
Look, this is the famous "sign
you can't read from behind"!

250
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,125
[NEPGEAR] I think most
signs are like that.

251
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,375
[NOIRE] Get moving!

252
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,250
[NEPTUNE] Yeek!

253
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,208
[NOIRE] You're walking too slow!

254
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,708
[NEPTUNE] Aw, c'mon!

255
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,958
You are like all business all
the time, now aren't you!

256
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,541
[NOIRE] Is that a problem?

257
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,083
[NEPTUNE] Doesn't it tire you
out having a stick up your butt?

258
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,291
[NOIRE] I want to make this
country as great as I can.

259
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,041
And the only stick here is
the one I'm using to poke you.

260
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,958
[NEPTUNE] Well, yeah, I wanna
make a great country too,

261
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,916
of course, but isn't
it better if it's fun?

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,250
[NOIRE] I don't see what's
so fun about failure!

263
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,333
[VILLAGE GIRLS]
She's here!

264
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,625
--It's the goddess!
--Lady Black Heart!

265
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,166
[NOIRE] Oh, oops. Access!

266
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,666
[NEPTUNE] What?
You're gonna transform now?

267
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,208
[NOIRE (BH)] Second rule
in the Goddess handbook.

268
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,791
One should always try
to project a majestic air.

269
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,791
[NOIRE (BH)] Ladies.

270
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,958
Would you mind telling me

271
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,875
about the monsters
that are troubling you?

272
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,208
[NEPTUNE] I dunno
if getting naked in front

273
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,958
of a bunch of
strangers is "majestic."

274
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,375
[NOIRE (BH)] This is the
Nasuune Highlands, correct?

275
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,666
[VILLAGE WOMAN 1A] Yes.

276
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,333
We've been overrun by Dogoos,

277
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,916
and we don't have
any heroes to slay them.

278
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,958
[NOIRE (BH)] You needn't worry.

279
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,333
Miss Neptune and Miss Nepgear
from our neighboring country

280
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,666
have volunteered to
deal with them for you.

281
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,375
[NEPTUNE] Nep what?
Wait, I gotta work?

282
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,458
[NEPGEAR] Well, it doesn't
look too hard, I guess.

283
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,916
[NOIRE (BH)] Rule number three.

284
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,500
Show off, whenever you can.

285
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,666
[UNI] I'll record it for you.

286
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,958
We can make a PR reel!

287
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,291
[NEPTUNE]
You're making us grind?

288
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, these guys are so weak

289
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,500
you could beat them
with a Cypress Stick.

290
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:49,166
[NEPTUNE] Let's do
this thing! Come on, Sis!

291
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,541
[NEPGEAR] Right! You got it!

292
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,166
[NEPTUNE] Now that was awesome.

293
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,666
Must run in the family.

294
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,083
[NEPTUNE] Chest buster!

295
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,458
[NEPGEAR]
I'll use my true power!

296
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,583
[IF] There's simply
too many of them.

297
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,416
[COMPA] Then we better
get stomping, Iffy!

298
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,541
Let's go!

299
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,291
[IF] Sounds good.

300
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,541
[NEPTUNE] Iffy! Compa!

301
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,791
[COMPA] And here I come!

302
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,125
[NEPTUNE]
They're just a trash mob.

303
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,083
This is a piece of cake!

304
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,750
[UNI] Hey Noire.

305
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,916
Maybe we should help
them out before this gets--

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,500
[NOIRE] No.

307
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,416
It's meaningless if they don't
accomplish this for themselves.

308
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,875
[UNI] Oh.

309
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,750
[IF] Don't touch me there!

310
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,000
[COMPA] This feels gross!
Cut it out!

311
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,166
[NEPGEAR] Are you kidding me?

312
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,208
Stop, you naughty dog!

313
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,458
[NEPTUNE giggles]

314
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,375
[NEPTUNE] Oh, that tickles,
I'm gonna die laughing!

315
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,208
[NEPGEAR] Please no more!

316
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,875
[NEPTUNE giggling]

317
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,958
[IF yells]

318
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,208
[IF] All right you little punks.

319
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,375
I'll send your souls
to a world of despair!

320
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:00,916
[IF] Flame Soul Slice!
You're dead!

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,958
[NOIRE (BH)] Neptune you're
not even trying, are you?

322
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:12,791
[IF panting]

323
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,041
[NEPTUNE] Ugh that settles it.

324
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,625
I'm never eating jelly
again as long as I live.

325
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,708
[NOIRE (BH)] Why didn't
you use your goddess form?

326
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,791
Those dogoo would've
been a piece of cake!

327
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,916
[NEPTUNE] Who cares!
It turned out okay, right?

328
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,083
[NOIRE (BH)] Only because
you had other people

329
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,333
to cover for you!

330
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,708
This is why your
Shares are always--

331
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,208
[NOIRE (BH)]
You know what, never mind.

332
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,083
I'll take care of the rest
of this ordeal on my own.

333
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,125
[NOIRE (BH)] Lead the
way to Toruunay Cave.

334
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,416
[VILLAGER GIRL BRAIDS]
Right. Yes ma'am.

335
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,041
[UNI] I'll come with you.

336
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,375
[NOIRE (BH)] I'll be all right.

337
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,666
You stay here and try
to clean up all this goop.

338
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,791
[VILLAGER GIRL BRAIDS] This way.
[NOIRE (BH)] Thank you.

339
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,916
[NEPTUNE]
Man, she sure is uptight, huh?

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,708
Oh! Uni, did you
get any good pics?

341
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,166
[NEPTUNE] Dude!

342
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,250
So cute! Let's forward
these to me. Bloop!

343
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,583
[NOIRE (BH)] Perish!

344
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
[NOIRE (BH)] A dead end, huh?

345
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,958
Guess that's a wrap, then.

346
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,125
[NOIRE (BH)]
That's an Ancient Dragon!

347
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,833
[NOIRE (BH)] You might
actually put up a fight!

348
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,375
Take this!

349
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,250
[NOIRE (BH) gasps]

350
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,458
Oof!

351
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,000
[NOIRE (BH) groans]

352
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,541
[NEPTUNE] Hi. Yah!

353
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[NEPTUNE] Whassup?

354
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,750
[NEPTUNE]
Hey, you're human again!

355
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,791
What happened?

356
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,916
[NOIRE] I don't even know.

357
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,166
It's strange. Look out!

358
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,083
[NEPTUNE] See?

359
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,416
This is the time when a goddess
should transform for real!

360
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,541
[NEPTUNE] Check it out, yo!

361
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,458
[NEPTUNE (PH)]
Witness the power of a CPU!

362
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,333
[NOIRE] This was my fight!
Don't show off!

363
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,041
[NEPTUNE (PH)] I am grateful.

364
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,666
Now leave this one to me.

365
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,000
[NEPTUNE (PH)]
Cross Combination!

366
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,958
[NOIRE] I-I could've handled
that thing on my own, you know.

367
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,708
I didn't need any help from you!

368
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,291
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Perhaps not.

369
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,666
However, comrades
help each other out.

370
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,291
[NOIRE] We're really more
"rivals" or "enemies,"

371
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,625
if you ask me.

372
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,750
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Why did you
choose this place today?

373
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,083
[NOIRE] Because it's
close to your home

374
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,583
and I wanted you out of my hair.

375
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,958
[NEPTUNE (PH)] Since it's
close to the Planeptune border,

376
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,583
word of my heroics will
surely spread there as well.

377
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,250
[NEPTUNE (PH)] You were worried
about my Shares, weren't you?

378
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,875
Thank you, Noire.

379
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,166
[NEPTUNE] Me kicking
butt was cool,

380
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,500
but you almost getting eaten,
now that's the real story!

381
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,250
[NOIRE] You wouldn't dare tell!

382
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,041
[NEPTUNE] Hey guys, get this!

383
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,083
Noire did something super lame!

384
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,000
[NOIRE] Hey! Nepture! I-
I thought we were comrades!

385
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,875
Come back!

386
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,000
[VILLAGER GIRL GREEN]
Lady Black Heart

387
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,583
and Lady Purple Heart beat them!

388
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,375
[VILLAGER GIRL RED] They beat
the monsters with power of love

389
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,291
and probably also lasers!

390
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,666
[VILLAGER GIRL GREEN] Yipee!

391
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,291
Yipee!

392
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,916
[NEPTUNE] Misinformation
sure spreads fast, huh?

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,583
[NOIRE thinking] Why did my
transformation break?

394
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,500
[ARFOIRE] They cleared out
all the monsters for us.

395
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,416
How sweet.

396
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,583
[WARECHU] Good.

397
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,500
Now we can search
for that thing in peace.

398
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,041
[HISTOIRE] Very impressive!

399
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,333
[HISTOIRE]
I meant Noire, not you.

400
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,625
[NEPTUNE] Nep what? Don't hate!

401
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,000
I was awesome back there!

402
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,500
[HISTOIRE] Previous
instances would indicate

403
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,250
that you are actually
useless and not awesome.

404
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,541
[NEPTUNE] Oh my gosh, rude!

405
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,500
[NEPTUNE] Nepgear,
is something wrong?

406
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,750
[NEPGEAR] It's awful!

407
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,708
There're weird pictures
of me on the internet!

408
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,500
[NEPTUNE] These are the
pictures I mailed to myself.

409
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,125
You're such a cutie
in these, Nep Junior!

410
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,291
[NEPGEAR] It's humiliating!

411
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,125
[IF] Are you sure
you didn't send those

412
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,375
to the wrong e-mail address?

413
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:48,791
[NEPTUNE] Who do you
think you're talking to?

414
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,541
I, oh--I forwarded it to
the nationwide mailing list.

415
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,500
[IF] I thought so.

416
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,708
[COMPA] On the upside,

417
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,958
the comments are all
pretty positive, though!

418
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,916
[COMPA] "I'm in
the fantasy zone."

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,375
[NEPTUNE] "It's like
a journey of dreams."

420
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,125
[IF] And this one says
"hail to Planeptune, baby."

421
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,333
Seems you've got some fans!

422
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,875
[NEPGEAR] Wha-What?

423
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:09,083
[HISTOIRE] So does that mean
your Shares went put because of

424
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,083
[NEPTUNE] These pictures?

425
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,375
Maybe. Wow, Nepgear, nice work!

426
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,750
[NEPGEAR] Well, if you say so.

427
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,833
[NEPTUNE] That's handy
'cause I've got plenty more

428
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,291
where those came from!

429
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,750
[NEPTUNE] Nepgear!
Do it for your country, okay?

430
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,458
[NEPGEAR]
Wait, that's a joke, right?

431
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:26,291
[HISTOIRE] I'm worried about
this country on so many levels.

432
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,583
So many levels.

433
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,375
[NEPTUNE] I'm gonna
leak 'em now! Here we go!

434
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,166
[NEPGEAR] My dignity!

435
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,666
[REI] We should live
our lives by regulations--

436
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,916
[IF] Whoa, now that is intense.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,750
[COMPA] Hey, this art really
is an explosion, isn't it?

438
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,000
[IF] Huh?
