in that cave in Lastation

a spotlight for you to hog

it was none other than moi

Why couldn't you stop her?

Don't blame me. I kept it

I'm a bit confused
myself, really.

She mentioned something
about "Anticrystals."

53
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,875
I think they're used to
steal power from CPUs.

[HISTOIRE] Huh.
Doesn't ring a bell.

Then could you maybe research
them for us, Miss Histoire?

I wouldn't mind, but I'm afraid
it will take three days.

No, no, she'll be just fine!
She's a goddess after all,

It must have been
an Anticrystal.

[NEPTUNE gasps]

309
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
It looks like there's six
of them, so the little chumps

310
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,291
came back with
reinforcements this time.

311
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,500
Hmph! Is this one of those
"the power of love" things?

312
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:26,416
I'll take them down without
so much as lifting a finger.

313
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,250
But here's that
entertainment you asked for!

314
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:35,750
[ARFOIRE laughs]

315
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,041
[COMPA] They still
can't transform.

316
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,583
Are they gonna be okay?

317
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,500
[IF] Even if the CPUs were
captured, seeing their sisters

318
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,875
fight to save them should
put the citizens at ease,

319
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,833
and that should mitigate
the damage to our Shares.

320
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,916
[COMPA]
That's not reassuring.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,666
Don't get me wrong.
I want to believe in them.

322
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,375
Against all odds, I hope
they can pull this off.

323
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,458
[COMPA]
Iffy...

324
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,750
Is everyone ready?

325
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,583
[NEPGEAR grunts affirmatively]

[ROM &amp; RAM grunt affirmatively]

327
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
I won't back down!
I'm not afraid!

328
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,375
You keep fighting, and
I'll keep protecting you!

329
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,875
Sounds good! If you've got
my back, nothing can stop me!

330
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,166
I've got you now.

331
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,541
You better watch out,
'cause this'll hurt!

332
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,083
Move, it, creep.

333
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,250
She's in trouble!

00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,250
Hey, be careful!

Rom, no!

337
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,875
I've got you two covered!
Now let's regroup!

Quick, behind you!

[gun clicks]

341
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,750
[NEPGEAR]
I won't lose!

342
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,875
[UNI] Stay back!
Get away from me!

343
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,291
[NEPGEAR] What should
we do? I was wrong.

344
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,625
[RAM]
I need cover!

345
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,833
[NEPGEAR] We weren't ready
to fight yet after all!

346
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,833
Iffy, this is starting
to look really bad!

347
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,958
[NEPGEAR] Everyone's going
to die and it's all my fault!

348
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:12,458
I can't do anything.
Help me, Neptune!

349
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,375
I'm relying on my
sister too much again.

350
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:20,750
But what am I supposed to do?
We can't win this without her!

351
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,125
[UNI] I think I might
actually have a clue.

352
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,583
It was something Noire
told me a while back.

353
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,000
She said I can't transform

354
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,291
because I put a
limiter on my heart.

355
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,833
[NEPGEAR]
A limiter?

356
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,416
It's more like...
I'm afraid of something

357
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,625
and that's what's
holding me back.

358
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:38,541
[NEPGEAR] What am I
afraid of? Losing Neptune?

359
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,250
Of growing up and not being
her little sister anymore?

360
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,250
No. I'm afraid of her
losing something.

361
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,666
I'm afraid of growing
even stronger than she is.

362
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,375
Iffy! It's Ge-Ge!

363
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,916
[IF]
Mm?

364
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,416
[NEPGEAR] I don't
mind being weak,

365
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,166
and I don't mind looking
up to my sister.

366
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,125
But if it means getting
her back, I'll do anything.

367
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,875
I'll become stronger
than anyone else!

368
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,375
[UNI]
Hey, you did it!

369
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,666
She's so pretty.

370
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,375
You rock!

371
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,916
[NEPGEAR (PS) chuckles]

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,291
No matter what,
I mustn't retreat.

373
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,041
No looking back!

374
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,375
I have to keep going!

375
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,708
It looks like we don't
have time for that.

376

[NEPGEAR &amp; UNI wail]

377
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,916
[IF] Hm? Oh! Oops! Rewind!
You did not see that!

378
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,833
I was out late one night and
decided to crash at Compa's,

379
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,250
but when I woke up
to get a drink of water,

380
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,958
I saw her like this and,
like, well, can you blame me?
