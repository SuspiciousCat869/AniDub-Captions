I hate you.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,916
Okay. You can hate me.

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,750
Just as long as
you're here, P-ko.

324
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,625
[PEASHY] I hate you.

325
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,708
[NEPGEAR (PS)]
And just like that

326
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,041
everything went
back to normal.

327
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,500
And the new nation of Eden's
short history came to an end.

328
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,291
[NEPGEAR (PS)] As for the riots
in the other nations,

329
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,166
they were suppressed
without many casualties.

330
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
It was almost like
none of it had happened.

331
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,541
Well, for most people anyway.

332
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,916
But Peashy's memories
had yet to fully return.

333
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,375
Neptune, huh?

334
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,041
I...

335
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,208
Well then, take care.

336
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,250
It's hard to believe
this is goodbye.

337
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,041
I'm really going
to miss you two.

338
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,208
It's strange, but
it somehow feels

339
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,083
like we've been
friends forever.

340
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,750
I'll never forget
the two of you.

341
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,083
I can promise you that.

342
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,333
[PLUTIA]
Yeah, me either!

343
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,458
Neppy Jr.

344
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,625
[NEPGEAR] Huh?

345
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,041
[PLUTIA] For you.

346
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,083
Huh? You made one of me?

347
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,916
Thank you so much, Plutia.

348
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,291
[PLUTIA] I hope it
makes you happy.

349
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,000
[PEASHY] Huh?

350
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,958
Take care of
yourself, Peashy.

351
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,500
I know you don't
remember us,

352
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,916
but that doesn't matter.

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,708
Yeah, 'cause we'll
always be your friends.

354
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,875
[COMPA] Those versions of us
from Peashy's dimension.

355
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,833
I really hope that
they're good to her

356
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,750
and make friends with her again.

357
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,541
Hey, c'mon, it'll be fine.

358
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,166
It's us we're talking about.

359
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,500
[HISTOIRE]
All right, everyone.

360
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,125
I hate to say goodbye
but I'm afraid it's time.

361
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,000
We only have a
small window of time

362
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,750
to open the dimensional gate.

363
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,000
[gasps] Wait, not yet.
Neptune's not here.

364
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,375
I'm sorry, but
we have to hurry!

365
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,875
[NEPTUNE] Hey!

366
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,000
[NOIRE] Jeez, Neptune!
You're late.

367
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,166
[NEPTUNE] I'm sorry!

368
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,416
I'm so glad you came to
visit us, Plutie, I mean it.

369
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,833
We'll meet again someday.

370
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,458
[PLUTIA] Mm-hm.
Yeah. We will.

371
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,041
[NEPTUNE] Here, P-ko,
this is for you.

372
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,416
[PEASHY] Hm?

373
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:28,708
[PEASHY] Thanks, Neptune,
but what is it?

374
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,666
It's the absolute tastiest
thing you'll ever taste.

375
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,125
[MINI HISTY]
Uh, excuse me!

376
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,291
We really need to get
moving through this gate.

377
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,291
[PLUTIA]
'Kay!

378
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,708
Bye, girls.
See you later.

379
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,541
C'mon, Peashy.

380
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,333
Neptuna?

381
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,333
[NEPTUNE gasps]

382
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,083
[inaudible]

383
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,583
P-ko.

384
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,750
I'll never forget you.
I promise you that.

385
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,125
[PLUTIA]
Yeah, me either!

386
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,166
Neppy Jr. For you.

387
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,791
Um. It's a little
different from the others.

388
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,250
Take good care of it.

389
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,916
[NEPGEAR] Uh, okay!
