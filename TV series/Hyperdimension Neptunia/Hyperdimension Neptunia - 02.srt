1
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,041
[ABNES] Ga-Thunk!

2
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,125
Time for another
action packed day

3
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,916
spent saving the
children of the world!

4
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,375
[NEPGEAR] Wow! It's even
prettier than I thought.

5
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,000
[NEPGEAR] Y'know, I've
always wanted to visit Lowee.

6
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,541
[NEPTUNE] Yeah,
you haven't exactly made

7
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,375
that the best-kept secret.

8
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,125
[NEPGEAR] It was so
nice of Rom and Ram

9
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,833
to invite us to stay with them.

10
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,333
I just wish that Blanc
would let them travel

11
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,958
to other countries so they
could come and visit us, too.

12
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,875
[NEPTUNE] Oh, yeah. Blanc's
got a real stick up her butt

13
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,208
about that kind
of stuff like that.

14
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,875
You know, she really
ought'a pull that thing out

15
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:27,500
before she ends up
friendless like Noire.

16
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,125
[NOIRE] You realize
I can hear you, right?

17
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,625
And I've got plenty
of friends, dammit!

18
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,208
[NEPTUNE] Sorry,
forgot you were there.

19
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,208
Well, maybe hearing that
said right to your face

20
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,041
is just the thing you
need to make a change.

21
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,375
[NOIRE] I don't need to hear it
from a slacker like you!

22
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,125
I'm starting to regret
letting you talk me

23
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,125
into coming on this trip.

24
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,666
[CHURCH WORKER A
falls and screams]

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,750
[RAM] She fell for it!

26
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,708
[ROM] That was just perfect!

27
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,500
[CHURCH WORKER A]
Miss Rom, Miss Ram!

28
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,583
How could you? Come here now!

29
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,583
[RAM] Run for it!

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,166
[CHURCH WORKER A]
Hold it right there, you two!

31
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,750
[VERT] Are you sure about this?

32
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,833
You do realize what this means?

33
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,041
Carrying out this plan

34
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,125
will entirely alter the
world as we know it.

35
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,416
[BLANC] I'm well aware of that.

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
We have to make sure
no one finds out about it

37
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:26,458
until it's implemented.

38
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,500
[RAM] Run faster!
[BLANC growls]

39
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,541
[BLANC] Alright,
you little turds.

40
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,416
How many times have
I told you to pipe down

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,416
while I'm working?

42
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,458
[CHURCH WORKER A]
I'm so sorry, Miss Blanc!

43
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,333
[ROM] Hey, big sis.

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,750
[RAM] Check this out!

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,208
[BLANC] This is my...

46
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,375
[RAM] It's a drawing of you!

47
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,500
[ROM] We got the
sharp teeth just right!

48
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:57,125
[BLANC] You've destroyed
my precious book.

49
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,500
[BLANC] I'll kill you!

50
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,208
[RAM] That's the face we drew!

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,458
[ROM and RAM giggling]

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,208
[BLANC] Get your
asses back here!

53
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,500
[ROM] Run!

54
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,208
[RAM] Hey, Nepgear!

55
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,208
Hi, Uni! You guys made it!

56
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,583
[NEPGEAR] Mmhmm.
How could we say no?

57
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:14,375
[NEPTUNE] Hiya, Blanc!

58
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,166
How goes it? Let's party!

59
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,583
[NEPTUNE] Alright. Bet you're
wonderin' why we're here.

60
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,958
Well we heard about
this new theme park

61
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,375
that opened up here in Lowee.

62
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,083
So we're gonna crash
with you and check it out.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,750
[BLANC] Histoire warned me.

64
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,750
And she specifically asked
me to give you lessons

65
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,416
in being a worthwhile
CPU while you're here.

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,583
[NEPTUNE] Nah. That's
just a waste of time.

67
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,083
I mean that's about all
I learned from my last lesson.

68
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,833
[NOIRE] That makes two of us.

69
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,625
[VERT] Speaking of
the theme park,

70
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,416
I've heard good things about it.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,208
It could be a lot of fun
for us to take the girls

72
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,625
and go as a group.

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,750
[RAM] You mean Super Nittenland?

74
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,125
[RAM] I wanna go, I wanna go!

75
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,791
[ROM] Can we, sis?
Please say yes!

76
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,250
[BLANC]
Actually, it would be nice

77
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,041
if you could take care of them.

78
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,708
[NEPTUNE] You're not going?

79
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,916
[ROM] Why not? Don't you wanna?

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,541
[BLANC] I want to. I just can't.

81
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
[NEPTUNE] It's not
'cuz of work, is it?

82
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,333
You've heard the saying.

83
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,791
"Working means that
you've lost at life."

84
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,708
Now that's a piece of wisdom
from a great man. See?

85
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,708
[NOIRE] Neptune, some
bum on YouTube said that.

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,416
[BLANC] It doesn't matter.
I just can't go.

87
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,666
[ROM] Hold on, Ram, wait for me!

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,750
[NEPGEAR] C'mon, girls,
you've gotta wear your coats.

89
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,916
[UNI] Wait, Nepgear!
You forgot to grab the tickets!

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,125
[RAM] Hey, Nepgear!
Where are you guys?

91
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,750
[ROM] I don't see 'em.

92
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,375
[NEPGEAR] Hey, girls!

93
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,750
[UNI] Over here!

94
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,666
[UNI] A coin with a Dogoo on it!

95
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,958
[NEPGEAR]
This one's got a Kupokitty!

96
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,416
[ROM] It's a Terits.

97
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,708
[RAM] Yeah, so is this
one. Talk about lame.

98
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,666
[NEPTUNE]
One rainbow road special!

99
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,166
[NOIRE] Seems like
Blanc should be acting

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,666
like more of a
diplomat when CPU's

101
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,416
from other
countries are visiting.

102
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,125
I mean, she's the
face of her country

103
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,791
and it could be prettier.

104
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,000
[VERT] That's a little harsh.

105
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,458
I know what you're saying

106
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,458
but I think we've all still
got some growing up to do.

107
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:34,208
[VERT] Well, maybe not me.

108
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,625
[NOIRE] Actually.

109
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,625
Come to think of it, what is
it that brings you to Lowee?

110
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,000
[NEPTUNE screams]

111
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,125
[NEPTUNE] Help me!

112
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,000
This monster turtle
wants my peaches!

113
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,208
No! Somebody call
a plumber! Stop it!

114
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,833
[RAM] Look, Rom!
It's a Guardragon coin!

115
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,541
That's a totally rare item!

116
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,166
[ROM] Well there sure
are a bunch of them.

117
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,791
[RAM] Oh, wow!
They're all Guardragons!

118
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,500
[RAM] Although. Maybe
we've got enough already.

119
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,333
[ROM] We do, but I wanna
bring some home for Blanc too.

120
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,833
[RAM] Seriously?

121
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,958
I don't see why, she didn't
even bother to come with us.

122
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,708
[ROM] I know, but.

123
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,166
[RAM] You're right.

124
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,833
Maybe if we pick up 100,
she can finally get a life!

125
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,625
[ROM] Yeah!

126
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,416
[ROM and RAM giggling]

127
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,166
[TRICK] Lickie.

128
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,708
[NEPGEAR] Where did...?

129
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,541
[UNI] What's up, Nepgear?
Somethin' wrong?

130
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,708
[NEPGEAR]
Where'd Rom and Ram go?

131
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,041
I don't see them anywhere.

132
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,208
[UNI] How 'bout there?

133
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,041
They were picking up
coins a second ago.

134
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,625
[NEPGEAR] Rom, Ram!
Where are you?

135
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,541
[MONSTER giggling]
[ROM and RAM struggling]

136
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,333
[NEPGEAR] Rom! Ram! What the--?

137
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,208
[UNI] Drop them!

138
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,916
What do you think you're doing?

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,791
[TRICK] Lickie!

140
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,500
[TRICK] Run along now, ladies,

141
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,000
you're far too
large for my tastes.

142
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,375
[UNDERLING]
Like candy from a baby.

143
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,708
Well done, Trick.

144
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,916
[TRICK] I'm the party star
and don't you forget it!

145
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,208
[NEPGEAR] Oh, no.
Bring them back!

146
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,000
[CHURCH WORKER A] Please
believe me, I understand.

147
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,083
But Lady Blanc has
explicitly instructed me

148
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,125
not to let anybody inside.

149
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,416
[NEPTUNE] Come on.

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,791
We're all goddesses here,
what's the big deal?

151
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,833
[CHURCH WORKER A] I know.

152
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,375
But I'm afraid
that doesn't matter.

153
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,416
[NEPGEAR] We just wanna
apologize, that's all!

154
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,250
[UNI] It was our fault
Rom and Ram got kidnapped!

155
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,791
Please let us help find them!

156
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,291
[CHURCH WORKER A] Thank you,
but that's not necessary.

157
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,791
We've already mobilized the
guards to search for them.

158
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,916
[NEPTUNE]
We know, but we can still--

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,333
[BLANC] Just go home.

160
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,208
[BLANC] All you'll do is
cause even more trouble.

161
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,416
[BLANC] Rom. Ram.

162
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,166
This is all my fault.
If only I...

163
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,416
[BLANC] ...was a
better sister. I'm sorry.

164
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,916
[BLANC] I've gotta
help them somehow.

165
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,416
[BLANC] How can I find them?

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,791
What can I do?
I know! I'll use--

167
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
[ABNES] Ga-Thunk!
Ga-Thunk! Ga-Thunk!

168
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,041
[ABNES] Now I've got you!

169
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,000
[BLANC] Who are you?

170
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,416
[ABNES] My name is Abnes!

171
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,333
And I fight for the
children of the world!

172
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,500
[BLANC] What?

173
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,000
[ABNES] Don't act
like you don't know me.

174
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,500
I'm the star of the hit internet
series the Abnes Channel!

175
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,791
Everyone knows me.

176
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,166
Okay, let's get this
live broadcast going!

177
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,291
[BLANC] Live broadcast?

178
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,791
[ABNES] Hello, Gamindustri!

179
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,458
It's your best friend,
Abnes, here!

180
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,000
Idol of the world's children!

181
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,666
And today, I'm confronting
the little girl CPU of Lowee!

182
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,875
Say hello to Blanc!

183
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,250
[BLANC] What? Little girl?

184
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,791
Listen, you annoying--

185
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,833
[ABNES] Now, Blanc, are the
rumors we've been hearing true?

186
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,250
Did you allow your own little
sisters to get kidnapped?

187
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,166
Well did you? Huh?

188
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,166
[BLANC] How did you
know about that?

189
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,583
[ABNES] Sounds like a yes!

190
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,916
Those poor little girls. So!

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,875
Just how does it feel to be such
an awful, neglectful big sister?

192
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:32,875
Honestly, now.

193
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,333
[NOIRE] That Blanc.
What is her problem?

194
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,708
This is an emergency--

195
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,458
it's scarcely the time
for her to be so pig-headed!

196
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,708
[NEPTUNE] Yeah, really,
Noire's the one

197
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,250
with the patent on being
an unlikeable hardass.

198
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,916
[NOIRE] Watch it.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,041
[VERT] Girls. You see--
The truth is--

200
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,541
[NEPGEAR] Hey, Neptune.
What do you think that's about?

201
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,291
[ABNES] Shoot straight
with me here, Blanc.

202
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,958
The kidnapping
of your little sisters

203
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,000
 entirely your fault, right?

204
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:03,916
Just admit it.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
[BLANC] I... I don't.

206
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,500
[ABNES] You hear that, kids?

207
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,166
The little girl CPU can't
even properly defend herself.

208
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,958
Little girls just aren't
cut out to be goddesses.

209
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,541
[ABNES] It's too
much responsibility.

210
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,041
They should just be playing
games and enjoying life.

211
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,166
The Abnes Channel is firmly
against little girl goddesses!

212
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,541
[NEPTUNE] Hey, what the
heck's going on in here?

213
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,416
[ABNES] Who do
you think you are?

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,208
[NEPTUNE] I know I'm Neptune!

215
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,333
The goddess of Planeptune.

216
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,375
[ABNES] Oh, really,
another goddess?

217
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,208
Well, I suppose you
look passably old enough

218
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,041
to just be hitting
puberty. Although!

219
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,916
[ABNES] You've barely
begun to develop!

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,291
You're a little girl!
I declare you too young!

221
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,416
[NEPTUNE] Say what?

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
Am I really being
called a little girl

223
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,208
by a girl littler than me?

224
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,583
[ABNES] What? I am
certainly not a little girl!

225
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,000
And besides, it takes
one to know one, missy!

226
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,291
[NEPTUNE] Yeah, and since
you're throwing down

227
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,500
all these "little girl claims,"

228
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,958
that proves for
sure you're one too!

229
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,833
[ABNES] I can't believe
you said it again!

230
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,333
Leave my crew alone!

231
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:03,125
[ABNES] You're gettin' off with
a warning today, little girl.

232
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,041
But I will be back!

233
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,250
[NEPTUNE] Oh, yeah, little girl?

234
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:11,000
Well I'll be waiting for you!
Poor whiny widdle girl!

235
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,375
[NOIRE] For heaven's sake.
What was that about?

236
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:18,166
[VERT] I wonder how she and
her crew even got in here?

237
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,625
[NEPGEAR] Whoa, Blanc!

238
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,458
[NEPGEAR] It's okay,
Blanc! Hang in there!

239
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,416
[CHURCH WORKER A] I'll...
I'll go get some help!

240
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,250
[NEPGEAR] What do you
think's wrong with her?

241
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,541
[UNI] Maybe everybody in Lowee
just watched the interview

242
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,250
and her Shares took a
sudden turn for the worse.

243
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,583
[NEPGEAR] Hey wait, can't
a CPU lose her powers

244
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,041
if she doesn't have enough
Shares? That's not good.

245
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,333
[NOIRE] I don't think her Shares
dropping would make her faint.

246
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,041
There's no way she'd feel the
negative effects that quickly.

247
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,291
[NEPGEAR] Then why?

248
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,666
[VERT] Listen, ladies.

249
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,916
[VERT] There's a
way we can fix this.

250
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,375
We can track down Rom and Ram,

251
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,458
and I know exactly how to do it.

252
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,291
[VERT] The truth is.

253
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,875
Blanc has been working on a
certain plan for some time now.

254
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,666
[VERT] And part of it.

255
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,041
Well, I'm guessing
you must have heard

256
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,750
about the old satellite service

257
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,791
that was based out
of Lowee, right?

258
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,166
[NEPTUNE] Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

259
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,750
Wasn't it called
the Basillaview?

260
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,625
[NOIRE] Yeah, didn't they shut
it down around ten years ago?

261
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,583
[VERT] That's right.

262
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,916
It actually turns out

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,083
that all of the satellites
are fully functioning.

264
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,666
They're still capable
of relaying images

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,708
from around the entire world.

266
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,083
[VERT] However,
they're low resolution.

267
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,166
But Leanbox labs have developed
a new type of software

268
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,291
that can analyze
and process the data

269
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,291
and produce high-res
imagery from it.

270
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,666
[NEPTUNE] Awesome!

271
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,541
Just leave it to Nerdy Vert
and her tech savvy ways!

272
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,666
[VERT] Once we came up with it,

273
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,375
I approached
Blanc with an offer.

274
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,916
If Lowee will provide
the image data

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,458
from their satellite system,

276
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,375
then we'd trade. And Leanbox
would provide the software.

277
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,041
[NOIRE] But that would
give the two of you

278
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,291
a complete monopoly on all
of the world's information!

279
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,916
[NEPTUNE] Oh, man,
that's messed up!

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,083
Do you realize how much
trouble that'd cause us?

281
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,833
[VERT] Oh yes.
Trust me, we know.

282
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,250
And that's exactly
why we planned

283
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,791
on sharing all of the
information with the world.

284
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,666
[VERT] It was Blanc's
suggestion of course.

285
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,083
The way she saw it, we'd all
signed the friendship treaty,

286
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,375
so it's only right our four
countries use it equally.

287
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,541
[NOIRE] You don't say.

288
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,041
[VERT] It's true.
We were just waiting

289
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,291
for the right time to
go public with the news.

290
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:16,166
Sort of, a surprise present
to celebrate the treaty.

291
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,791
[VERT] The data
analysis just finished.

292
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,500
We'll know exactly
where the kidnapper fled.

293
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
Really? I see.

294
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,833
[TRICK] Well, lickie, lickie,
lickie, lickie, lickie, lickie.

295
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,958
[ROM] No!
[RAM] What's wrong?

296
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,541
[TRICK giggles]

297
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,791
[TRICK] There's nothin' better
than little sleepyhead girls!

298
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,625
They're the perfect
taste for licking!

299
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:47,583
[TRICK] Lickie, lickie,
lickie, lickie, lickie!

300
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,416
[RAM] Hey! Let go of
my sister you creep!

301
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,666
You stop that!

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
[TRICK] Lickie, lickie, lickie,
lickie, lickie, lickie!

303
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,666
[RAM] No! Put me down!
Stop licking!

304
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,500
[UNDERLING] I'm on top
of things, Trick, sir.

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,833
I made the call and demanded
the ransom just like you asked.

306
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,791
What the hell are you doing?

307
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,125
[TRICK] What do you
think I'm doing?

308
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,625
My saliva's got
healing properties.

309
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm improving their health!

310
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,541
Nothing weird
going on here at all!

311
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,833
[UNDERLING]
Uh... Sure, whatever.

312
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,875
[RAM and ROM screaming]

313
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,791
[NOIRE] So they were
hiding out right here

314
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,958
beneath a ride that's
under construction.

315
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,208
[NEPTUNE] Okay, let's do this!

316
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,833
Time to kick some
kidnapping butt!

317
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,750
[VERT] Just one moment.

318
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,458
[VERT] We can't rush into this.

319
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,166
Our first priority should
be securing the hostages.

320
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,708
[RAM] Stop it! Let us go!

321
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,250
[ROM] Please, I wanna go home!

322
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,458
[VERT] That is quite enough.

323
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,791
[RAM] Big sis?

324
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,375
[TRICK] Another little
girl's come to play?

325
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,875
[ROM] Help us, Vert!

326
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,000
[VERT] I demand that you
release you those girls.

327
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,583
Let them go and
I'll take their place instead.

328
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,125
[TRICK] No thanks.

329
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,333
I'm a gentleman
who sticks to his word

330
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,250
and these little girls
were part of a deal.

331
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,541
Besides, I'm really
not into big boobs.

332
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,875
[VERT] Oh, and just what exactly

333
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,083
do you have against
large breasts?

334
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,416
[TRICK] They'll just
end up sagging someday.

335
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,458
[VERT] I see.
Well, Mr. Gentleman,

336
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,750
you certainly do
have a way with words.

337
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,458
[TRICK] You're a CPU?

338
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,416
[VERT (GH)]
That's Green Heart to you.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,083
Now prepare yourself.

340
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,333
[UNDERLING] I am officially
no longer worried about

341
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,375
that ransom money.

342
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,458
[TRICK laughs]

343
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,541
[TRICK] If that's all you got,

344
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
this fight's not
gonna go well for you.

345
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,750
[VERT (GH)] I was
just testing you out.

346
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,666
Taste this spear
of the maelstrom!

347
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,458
This is the end!
Rainy Ratnapura!

348
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:12,125
[VERT (GH)] That was
hardly any trouble at all.

349
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,291
Wait. Where are Rom and Ram?

350
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,291
[UNDERLING] Another one!

351
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,125
[UNI] That's the girl.
I saw her take them!

352
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,166
[NOIRE (BH)] I'm not surprised.

353
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,541
Look at her,

354
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,500
she's likely dumb enough
to think she could lick us.

355
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,750
[UNDERLING] Wait!

356
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,333
Trick was the only one
doing any licking, okay?

357
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,833
And look, if it
makes any difference.

358
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,458
We only kidnapped them 'cuz
a weird old hag hired us to.

359
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,000
[NOIRE (BH)] Sounds like the
whiny excuse of an underling.

360
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,208
[UNDERLING] Yeah!
Exactly. That's it.

361
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,791
I'm nothin' but an underling.

362
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,875
So then, I'll let you
get back to business.

363
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,916
[NOIRE (BH)] Like hell
you're getting off the hook!

364
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,208
Lace Ribbon Dance!

365
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,625
[UNDERLING]
Can't blame me for trying!

366
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,916
[TRICK] As a gentleman, it's
my duty to protect those girls.

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,041
And the best way to
do that is by licking!

368
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,833
Okay, where did they go?

369
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,208
[TRICK] Oh you sassy things!

370
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,125
Little girls really
are the absolute best!

371
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,000
Lickie, lickie, lickie!

372
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,583
[BLANC] I'm gonna
make you pay in full

373
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,208
for what you've done,
and trust me.

374
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,208
You can't afford it.

375
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,625
[BLANC] You disgusting pervert.

376
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,541
[TRICK] Pervert huh?

377
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,875
Kindest thing
anyone's said to me.

378
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,291
[BLANC] Is that so?

379
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,000
Well then, I'll just have
to kill you with kindness.

380
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,375
[BLANC (WH)] Get ready to die.

381
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,291
You freaking sicko!

382
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,458
[BLANC (WH)] Alright.
Ultra Deviant!

383
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,958
[BLANC (WH)] Cataclysmic freak!

384
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,791
[BLANC (WH)] Tanzerin Trombe!

385
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,666
[TRICK] Goodbye little girls!

386
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,541
[BLANC (WH)] Don't pick
a fight with a goddess.

387
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,791
It's never gonna end well.

388
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,166
[BLANC] Hi, Rom. Hi, Ram.

389
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,208
I'm so sorry that
I let this happen to you.

390
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,291
[BLANC] I'm sorry.
I'm an awful big sister.

391
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,958
[ROM] But, sis.

392
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,208
[ROM] We got presents.

393
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,041
[RAM] They're for you!

394
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
[NEPTUNE] Get out here,
you kidnappers!

395
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,333
I'll Nep your damn faces off!

396
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,875
[NEPGEAR] Uh, y'know, sis.

397
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,625
[NEPGEAR] I get the feeling
they already beat the bad guys

398
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,041
while we've been
guarding the door.

399
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,833
[laughs]

400
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,166
[NEPTUNE] For real?
Sleep deprived?

401
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,375
[BLANC] That's right.

402
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,750
That's the reason why
I fainted like that.

403
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,208
That's also why I didn't
go to the theme park.

404
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,750
[NOIRE] Jeez, you're
ridiculous. Honestly.

405
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,166
[BLANC] I've been pulling
a lot of all-nighters lately,

406
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,916
and I just didn't have
the energy to do anything.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
I was rude.

408
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,583
But you still helped me
and rescued my little sisters.

409
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,666
Thank you, Vert. Thanks, Noire.

410
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,750
[BLANC] And thank you, Neptune.

411
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,000
That awful interview.

412
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,666
You spoke up and defended me.

413
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,958
[NEPTUNE] Ah, no,
that was nothin'.

414
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,583
That bratty little girl
was just askin'

415
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
to have someone tell her off.

416
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,708
[ROM] Hey, Blanc! Look at this.

417
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,625
[BLANC] That's really nice, Rom.

418
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,791
[BLANC] Ram!
Stop drawing in that book!

419
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,500
[RAM] What's the big deal, sis?

420
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,000
You've got so many copies.

421
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,666
They're all the same book.

422
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,708
[BLANC] Just stop!

423
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,791
[RAM] Why, what's wrong?

424
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:25,208
[BLANC] Be-Because.

425
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,041
[BLANC] I pulled
those all-nighters

426
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,333
in order to write that book!

427
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,750
[VERT] Hold on,
you were writing a book

428
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,208
instead of working
on the satellite system?

429
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,708
[NOIRE] Huh? Uni.
What's Blanc's book about?

430
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
[UNI] I haven't read
the whole thing yet,

431
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,375
but so far it's about a
girl who fell from the sky

432
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,916
and a boy with superpowers
who save the world together.

433
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,208
[NEPTUNE] That's weird.
This girl you describe.

434
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:45,791
She sounds just like you.

435
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,041
[BLANC] Don't read it!

436
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,458
[NEPGEAR] Oh, wow.

437
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,916
The hero is taking her on
an air ride to dream land.

438
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,083
That's intense!

439
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,750
[BLANC] Stop reading it!

440
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,916
[BLANC] How can I find them?

441
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,750
What can I do?
I know! I'll use--

442
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,666
[ABNES] Ga-thunk! Ga-thunk!
Now I've got you!

443
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,833
[ABNES] Whoops,
sorry, wrong place.

444
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:46,875
[RAM] Hey, wait, rescue us!
