[COMPA]
Take that!

[yelling]

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,791
[ARFOIRE] So those little brats
wiped out all of our monsters,

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,041
did they?

6
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,291
[WARECHU] They're a lot
tougher than we thought.

7
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,250
[ARFOIRE scoffs]

8
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, no matter.

9
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,791
I was starting to get bored
just standing around.

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,458
[ARFOIRE laughing]

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,291
[NEPGEAR (PS)] You know,
I realized something.

12
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,833
All this time, I've
been okay with being weak

13
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,041
because I had my
sister to protect me.

14
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,375
It was a way of
staying close to her.

15
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,208
But I was just
holding myself back.

16
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,750
I needed to allow myself to
grow up and get stronger.

17
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,041
That's all you
needed to transform?

18
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,833
Well that doesn't
really do me any good.

19
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,416
I've never been okay
with letting myself be weak.

20
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,083
Uh, yeah, you've got a point.

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,166
All right.
We're just about there.

00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,416

--[RAM, ROM] Big sis!

00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:09,791
Nepgear!

28
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,166
You learned how to transform!

29
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,166
I'm gonna get you
out of there right now!

30
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,708
[ARFOIRE]
Well, aren't you confident?

31
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,875
[ARFOIRE] I'm impressed you
made it so far, little sisters.

32
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,833
My name's Arfoire, by the way.

33
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,208
I'm here to bring the gospel
of chaos to this world

34
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,041
by eliminating
its bratty rulers!

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,166
It's Compa!

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,416
I missed you, my sweet!

37
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,500
Uh, sure. Me, too. Hi.

38
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,791
Hey, what the hell?
Don't interrupt me!

39
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,041
[WARECHU]
Chu.

40
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,916
Why would you want to
do this to our sisters?

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,333
What exactly are you
trying to accomplish?

42
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,375
[ARFOIRE chuckles]

43
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,916
If you really wanna know,

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,791
I'm creating a new world order.

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,291
In particular, one where
CPUs are unnecessary.

46
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,166
A world where anyone who
wants can become a ruler!

47
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,666
Is that so?

48
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,875
Because it sounds to me like
you just wanna be the ruler.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,416
For the time being, sure,

50
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,041
but if someone stronger comes
along, they'll take the job.

51
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,958
A much more fair system
than we have now.

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,250
Can you deny that?

53
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,458
Oh, why don't you drop the
propaganda, already?

54
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,541
I bet that you're just jealous

55
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,458
of the goddesses'
power, aren't you?

56
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,083
I'll admit that
there was a time

57
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,541
when I might have felt
a tinge of jealousy.

58
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,666
Though it was actually
rather helpful.

59
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,958
It pushed me to this point.

60
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,708
[gasping]

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,958
[ARFOIRE] If it
weren't for my jealousy,

62
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,375
I never would have taken the
power of a goddess for myself!

63
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,625
No way!

64
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,791
She's not a goddess;
how can she transform?

65
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,083
Cross Combination!

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,458
Aw, dude!
That's my patented move!

67
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,416
No way!

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,541
How can you use that?

69
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,583
[laughing]

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,833
[ARFOIRE] Because I have the
ability to mimic others,

71
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,333
you ignorant little tart.

72
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,291
And that extends
to goddesses, too.

73
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,375
Although that part
took a little bit of work.

74
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,291
Ridiculous!

75
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,791
That can't be true!

76
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,583
Here, let me prove it to you.

in it, you whiny toddlers.

She's so mean.

Yeah! I hate her, too! A lot!

You're beyond forgiveness.

And you're gonna pay
for what you've done.

This is not the time or place

to take a rest and talk with me?

a little more fired up

328
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,333
to get some real work
done after what happened,

329
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,666
but here we are,
having a picnic.

330
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,666
[NEPTUNE] No way,
you got it all backwards!

331
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,541
We're here because
of what happened!

332
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,000
We gotta make each day
be every day, y'know?

333
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,916
[IF] No, that doesn't
make any sense.

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,958
[high-pitched squealing]

335
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,375
Huh?

336
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,500
[high-pitched squealing]

337
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,291
You guys know
who this kid is?

338
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,583
I've no idea.

339
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,750
Compa!

340
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,250
And IF!

341
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,666
Huh?

342
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,166
I'm so confused.
Who are you?

343
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,666
No more hesitation.

344
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,500
Only determination remains!

345
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,583
Wow, Uni!

346
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,916
Where'd your boobs go?

347
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
Hey, cool, now we've got
something in common, Uni!

348
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:43,458
Just call us the
"flat friends"!

349
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,291
I'm not exactly happy
to be a part of this group.
