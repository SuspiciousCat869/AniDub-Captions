We're totally clueless.

Which is odd,

know who Compa and I are.

to even know her name.

Well that was written
on her underwear,

that wasn't the brand name.

I must have missed the joke.

Oh, come on.

00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,041
You were all bragging
about it, remember?

"Lastations security is the
awesomest in the whole world!"

Then, derp! You got hacked!

Too funny!

Hardly any point
crying over spilt milk.

Just make sure it
doesn't happen again.

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,208
Simple.

No, I'm going to
find who did this

Noire is in rage mode!

00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,708
Conveniently, I
summoned someone here

182
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,875
to deal with this
very situation.

Wait, who?

She was made for the anime!

Indeed, I am a brand
new character, bing.

I'll worm my way
into your heart, bing.

Bing? What?

192
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,500
Her catchphrase thing
is totally lame!

Man, this character is
gonna bomb with the fans!

194

There is no
need to worry.

195
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,791
I'm a one-off character made
just for this scene, bing.

Whoever you are,

down the hacker or not?

198
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,875
Of course.
Leave it to me, bing.

199
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,166
Here looks good.

Or maybe we'd get a
better angle from this side.

You certainly seem to
be enjoying yourself.

Oh, look! It's working!

00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,708
Wow, you weren't
kidding about the picture.

Isn't it gorgeous?

210
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,750
It uses a new compression
format called NEPEG-4

211
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,250
that gives you an HD
stream with no artifacting

and without using
too much bandwidth.

Um, uh-oh.

Is something wrong?

Even if this works,

216
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,541
the whole plan just
feels kind of wrong.

Please, let's nix
this camera thing, okay?

Yeah, okay.

There's interference.

Wait, but that can't
possibly be true, can it?

[PEASHY giggling]

00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,625
[NEPGEAR] Seems like
it should be nearby,

00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,875

Ugh, I'm so mad!

Nobody spies on
my sister, you hear?

And if they do,
they're in for a thrashing!

Why do I feel like that
comment was directed at me?

Which building is it?

Yes, captain!

238
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,166
This only gives
a general location.

239
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,708
It's hard to pinpoint.

240

Fine!

By the way,

why do you have
a tracking device?

That's kind of weird.

245

[NEPGEAR] Oh, no,
I always carry this.

247

I mean, mobile energy
generators and signal tracers

248

are must-haves for all

Not any girls from

As soon as someone

they go into big sister mode.

I'm a voyeur, honey!

Look, that's Noire!

326
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,083
And that one's Noire, too!

00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,708
They're all Noire!

00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,500
Peashy! Where are you?

Crachy!

00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,250

they have run off to?

Peashy!

[ANONYDEATH] I'm like, your
biggest fan, Noire!

333
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,875
I just wanted to see
more of you, that's all!

334
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,833
It was an impulse crime!

00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,208
[NOIRE] I couldn't care less
about all the stupid photos!

I'm mad because you
hacked my system and--

[ANONYDEATH]
You really don't care?

Noire's sewing like
somebody's mom!

00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,083
It does seem rather
uncharacteristic.

Well, my secret is out!

that outfit before.

you crazy goddess, you!

Upon inspection,
they're cosplay photos.

So that was a Four

355
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,541
that's why I recognized it.

Well, you can arrest me,

but just so you know,
if I leave here,

365
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,291
all the photos will be
automatically published online.

366
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,583
[NOIRE]
What?

367
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,458
[ANONYDEATH] At first I was
going to keep them

all to myself,

369
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,541
but then I got to thinking
how fun it would be

370
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,875
to plaster the whole world

371
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,291
with your cute
little cosplay selfies!

372
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,666
This is quite the dilemma.

373
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,083
If such compromising
photos were published...

374
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,583
...she would be too
embarrassed to show her face.

375
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,416
Nah, it's cool, yo.

376
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,958
She looks cute, so no prob.

377
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,750
You need acting lessons.

Y'know what? Fine!

Go ahead and publish them!

It's been fun, sweetie pie.

about publishing the pics!

Okay, okay. I give up.

This is lovely, but he never
did admit to the hacking.

Well, as long as
he's locked up,

that's no longer a concern.

Besides, Noire has more
pressing matters on her mind.

Kind of a pain in
the fanny, though.

448
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,625
I went to the trouble
of hacking that satellite

just runs into me.

And I sort of thought

461
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,958
maybe that's because I've gotten
at least the tiniest bit useful?

sure about that.

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,541
That's just ludicrous!

484
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,916
My security being compromised

485
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,875
is about as likely as
someone falling from the sky

486
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,541
and landing on me!

487
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,500
[distant yelling]

488
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,458
[NEPTUNE]
Move, hurry!

489
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,041
Oh, crap!

490
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,958
FYI, I was not standing
in the wrong place!
