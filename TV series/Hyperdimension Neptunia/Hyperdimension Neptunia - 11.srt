1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,416
That's amazing!

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,583
I've never seen a Sharicite
shine so bright before!

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,458
I know! It's beautiful!

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,541
So Nep, what
does this mean?

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:19,708
[giggles]

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,041
It's obvious, isn't it?

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,541
Planeptune's a
super-duper smash hit!

8
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,875
Like dur.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,541
[HISTOIRE] Our Shares
had been in a slow decline

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:27,833
for quite some time,

11
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,166
but one day they
suddenly skyrocketed.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,958
Now, somewhat inexplicably,

13
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,625
we're far outpacing
the other three countries.

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,541
But that doesn't
make any sense!

15
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,166
I told you, it's obvious!

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,333
Our blast processing
gives us blistering speeds

17
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,416
that the other countries
can't even touch!

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
[HISTOIRE] I told you,
that's not even a real thing.

19
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,875
It must be the victory
we had over Eden.

20
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,375
[IF] That might
be a contributor,

21
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,291
but surely not
on this scale.

22
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,791
[COMPA] But Nep-Nep
has been working really hard.

23
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,000
[NEPGEAR]
That's a good point.

24
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,000
Congratulations
on that, Neptune!

25
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,291
[NEPTUNE]
D'aw!

26
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,583
This is nothing for
a Nep-Nep in serious mode!

27
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,916
But we're not here
to talk about how rad I am.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,833
We're to talk about this!

29
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,333
I wanna say thank
you to all of our citizens

30
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,416
by opening up
the Basilicom grounds

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,416
and throwing a party
to beat all parties!

32
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,166
I call it

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,458
The Dynamite Wonder Festival!

34
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,416
[REI]
Why?

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,083
[sniffling]

36
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,958
It's not fair.
How did this happen?

37
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,958
What went wrong?

38
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,583
I'm just a citizen activist.

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,416
[NEPTUNE] Okey-dokey, the
festival opens tomorrow!

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,458
You're all invited, of course!

41
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,708
Bam!

42
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,916
[BLANC] And you called
all of us here for this?

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,958
[NEPTUNE]
Huh?

44
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,416
I have more
important things to do

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,750
than to waste time with you.

46
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going home.

47
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,708
[NEPTUNE]
Blanc!

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,875
Hey! Wait!
Come back!

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,250
Can't we talk this over?

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,000
I know you mean well,
but please use your head.

51
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,541
It's only natural for
her to resent you a bit,

52
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,625
don't you think?

53
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,541
Huh?

54
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,250
Yeah, I'm irritated, myself.

55
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,125
You realize ever since
those riots with Eden,

56
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,166
Shares have been plummeting
in every nation except yours!

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,333
Yeah, but that's just for now.

58
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,458
[VERT] Still, this
fiasco probably hit Blanc

59
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,958
harder than anyone.

60
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,750
You had the fewest
Shares for years,

61
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,583
and then you overtook
her in an instant.

62
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,083
[NOIRE] Lowee's an old
country, after all,

63
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,875
so they've got a lot of pride.

64
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,458
I'm a lot younger
and I'm getting mad

65
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,041
just thinking about it.

66
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,791
Well, I'll get my revenge soon.

67
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,666
Hold on. Why do
you need revenge?

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,291
Now that we've signed
the Friendship Treaty,

69
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,041
we're all pals, aren't we?

70
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,166
I mean, who cares about
dumb Share rankings?

71
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,791
I do, for one!

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,333
Act as buddy-buddy as you like,

73
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,916
but that doesn't change the fact
that we're vying for Shares.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,958
I'm sorry, but I have
a tough time celebrating

75
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,458
when your success means
my nation's failure.

76
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,500
So I'm afraid that
I'm leaving, as well.

77
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,166
Hey, hold up.

78
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,666
Even if you don't want to show,

79
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,750
I can still have 5pb perform
at the opening event, right?

80
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,750
I regret to inform you

81
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,083
that she's already
slated to appear

82
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,833
on my livestream tomorrow.

83
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,458
So no, you can't.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,666
[NEPTUNE]
Aw, Vert.

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,541
Are you skipping too, Noire?

86
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,708
[NOIRE]
Yes. I'm rather busy.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,083
My deficit aside,
I still don't know anything

88
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,375
about the Share-creating
device I found in Eden yet.

89
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,583
I can never stop
planning for the future.

90
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,375
I get it.

91
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,541
But if your schedule
does happen to open up,

92
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,000
you can stop by any time, okay?

93
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,500
Well, all right, then.

94
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,375
Farewell Noire, and good luck.

95
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,375
Hey, Sis, welcome home!

96
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,125
We're glad to have you back!

97
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:50,083
Thank you. So how is
the investigation going?

98
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,458
Quite well.

99
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,125
I'll be able to report
the results to you tomorrow.

100
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,458
Hurry, then.

101
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,208
[RAM]
Ooh, hey!

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,291
Now that you're back, do you
wanna play a game with us?

103
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,416
We just picked up
the new Lowee Sports!

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,916
It looks like fun!

105
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,833
All right.

106
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,583
I can spare a moment.

107
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,791
Ga-thunk!
Ga-thunk! Ga-thunk!

108
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,291
A big and bright hello to all my
Abnes Channel viewers at home!

109
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,333
And to all you little girls
out there, you have my love!

110
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,583
And speaking of little girls,

111
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,166
I've been informed
that crowds of them

112
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,625
are mysteriously being gathered
here at Planeptune's Basilicom!

113
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,083
Dunno about you,
but I smell a conspiracy!

114
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,416
Operation Save the Children
is now underway!

115
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,208
Ga-thunk!

116
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,000
Your wicked
connivance is foiled!

117
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,750
Don't be fooled,
viewers at home!

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,208
This is clearly
some trickery

119
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,958
designed to
hoodwink children!

120
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,833
I'm sure this country's
little-girl goddess

121
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,666
is plotting something--

Jeez! Didn't you see me?

124
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,708
Ah! The little-girl goddess!

125
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,833
You won't escape
my judgment this time!

126

Today's the day
I'll prove once and for all

127
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,875
that little girls
aren't fit to be CPUs!

128
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,375
So prepare yourself!

00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,291
Now save yourself
some admonishment

and just be a
normal little girl!

Oh, right! No problem!

140
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,416
Something came up.

Why don't you have this

Oh, are you
a volunteer? Perfect!

144
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,375
If you could you take this
to the Green Hill attraction

145
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,083
for me, that'd be great.

146
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,458
Aw not you, too!

00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,500
I am the friend of all children!

149
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
Well, isn't that cute.

Are they trying to punk
me or are they just dumb?

Hello, Blanc, what's up?

Are you coming by, after all?

I see Blanc's
as pushy as usual.

155
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,000
She knows how busy I am today.

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,625
Then what exactly do you want?

323
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,833
Oh, I don't know.

324
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,791
I'd hate to have to kill you.

325
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:44,000
Let's see. I'm sure
we can make a deal.

326
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,500
So like, for starters,

327
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,500
how 'bout you give me all
your land and all your people?

328
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,833
'Cause y'know, this place
was mine to begin with.

329
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,291
So why don't you step down,
you stupid bitch,

330
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,500
and kneel before
your new queen?

331
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,291
[laughing maniacally]

332
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,458
Don't be absurd.

333
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,125
This is Planeptune now.
It's my country.

334
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,791
So stand down,
and watch your language.

335
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,208
[REI (GT)] Wow, you didn't
even, like, think about it.

336
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,333
Just one big, fat
"talk to the hand." Rude.

337
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,791
[NEPTUNE (PH)] You didn't give
me much of a choice, now,

338
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,041
did you?

339
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,291
That's fine.

340
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,625
[REI (GT)] Charged and
ready to wreck your life!

341
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,416
I'm not going to buckle
under your threats.

342
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,541
[REI (GT)] Oh, wait,
wait, it's not done!

343
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,333
[REI (GT)]
Okay, there we go.

344
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:05,250
Still wanna play tough?
Or do you need a demonstration?

345
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,250
Pong Laser Cannon. Fire!

346
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,041
[panicked screaming]

347
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,666
Ah! Those are the
tools of our trade!

348
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,208
How could you do that?

349
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,333
Look out!

350
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,291
[NEPGEAR (PS)]
You weren't injured, were you?

351
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,791
[ABNES]
I'm worse than injured!

352
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,916
If I don't have a camera,
then the truth will be silenced!

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,958
[NEPGEAR (PS)]
Huh?

354
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,333
[REI (GT)]
Well?

355
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,500
Was that convincing enough,

356
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,500
or should I blow up
some more stuff?

357
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,625
[laughing maniacally]

358
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,250
[VERT] Hello and
welcome to Vert's Room.

359
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,708
Today, our guest is
Leanbox's very own diva,

360
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,750
the always lovely 5pb.

361
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,166
Later, we'll be
previewing a song

362
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,791
from her upcoming album.

363
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,375
It's a world premiere,
so please stay tuned!

364
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,125
We'll also be
taking questions live,

365
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,541
so be sure to
log onto the chatbox.

366
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,333
[ringing noise]

367
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,958
Did you get a reply from Uni?

368
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,250
Uh-huh!

369
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,625
Aw, that stinks.

370
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,000
She says her sister
wouldn't let her go

371
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,458
to the Planeptune's
festival, either.

372
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,791
If that's the way
they're going to act,

373
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,500
then we might never get
to play with Nepgear again.

374
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,416
What? No!

375
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,041
Don't even joke
about that, Rom!

376
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,916
We'll stay friends,
no matter what!

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,083
Yeah, I know,
but you saw Blanc.

378
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,250
She's really angry this time.

379
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,458
No good.

380
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,416
We're not getting
cell or internet!

381
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,333
It looks like all our
communications equipment

382
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,583
has been destroyed!

383
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,708
Then we're on our own, huh?

384
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,708
Now, all we can do is
place our faith in Neptune.

385
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:32,750
[REI laughing maniacally]

386
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,208
[REI (GT)] Well, that sure was a
lot of fun, now, wasn't it?

387
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,583
Now unless you're stupid,

388
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,708
maybe you'll want to
surrender like I told you to?

389
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,875
Your move, bitch.

390
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,458
Stupid? Perhaps.

391
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,708
And crazy, too.

392
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,333
But I will fight,
and destroy you if I must.

393
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:54,041
For my country and
for all my people.

394
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,125
I won't back down!

395
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,375
It looks like all our
communications equipment

396
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,833
has been destroyed!

397
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,083
Then we're on our own, huh?

398
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,916
[NEPTUNE] Aw, if I
can't preorder my game,

399
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,916
I'll miss the day one DLC!

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,291
This sucks!

401
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,000
Hey!
