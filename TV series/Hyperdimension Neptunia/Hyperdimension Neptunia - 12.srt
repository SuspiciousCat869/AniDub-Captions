326
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,666
Who needs it?

327
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,416
We're buds anyhow, aren't we?

328
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,750
We can prove that without
some dumb piece of paper!

329
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:22,666
Right?

330
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,708
Noire?

331
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,791
Right, Vert?

332
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,833
Blanc?

333
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,666
I can agree to that.

334
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,125
Competing for our livelihood

335
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,625
as friends and as rivals.

336
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Sounds rather
romantic, doesn't it?

337
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,625
I guess even you
can say something cool

338
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,000
once in a while.

339
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,916
If we're all in agreement,

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,458
then how about
an exhibition match?

341
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,958
Count me in!

342
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,416
My breasts sing with joy!

343
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,666
D'aw, wait for me!

344
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,958
I'm the main
character, you know!

345
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,625
Uni! C'mon!

346
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,208
Rom! Ram!

347
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,166
Just try to keep up!

348
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,500
Let's show 'em that
two sisters are better than one!

349
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,791
[ROM (WS)]
Mm-hmm!

350
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,000
Count me in!

351
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,291
I have a feeling
this is just going to be

352
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,916
more stress for me.
