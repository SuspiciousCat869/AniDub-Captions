I didn't mean take a
literal crack at it.

161
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,333
[NEPTUNE] Okay, we
made it onto the island.

162
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
So, uh, what're we
supposed to do now?

163
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,916
Good question.

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,958
Maybe there's someone
we can ask for directions.

165
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,625
Hello, hello, hello!

166
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,375
Welcome! My name is Linda.

167
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,000
If you need anything at all,
I'm your official guide!

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,250
And I'll cut you a discount.

169
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,500
Wait. I know you.

170
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,916
It's her! The kidnapper!

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,708
Aw, crap, the CPUs?

172
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,916
[BLANC] Well look at this.

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,166
So you're the bitch
who stole my sisters!

174
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,583
Wait, no, no, no,
please, hold on!

175
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,291
I totally swear
to you on my life,

176
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,708
I am fully reformed now
and working hard!

177
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,208
You expect me to buy that?

178
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,583
You will regret it if
you're lying to us.

179
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm not lying, really!

180
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,833
My criminal past is
completely behind me!

181
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,833
Hmm...

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,000
[UNDERLING]
So that's it?

183
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,041
The only reason you're all here
is to see the giant gun battery?

184
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,875
Do you know where it's
located on the island?

185
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,041
Yeah, of course!

186
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,791
I can lead you right to it!

187
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,125
Hey, but you guys!

188
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,000
We might as well check out
some of the party spots

189
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,083
while we're here!

190
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,416
We've told you,
this is not a vacation!

191
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,958
Don't be lame.

192
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,125
[UNDERLING]
Oh! Hey! I know!

193
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:25,541
I've got just the place
for some quick fun!

194
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,875
This is the most beautiful
spot on the entire island.

195
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
Fakekiki Beach!

196
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,833
Oh, wow!

197
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,375
Wait! What, what,
what, what, what?

198
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,208
[PLUTIA]
Whoa!

199
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,541
[NEPGEAR]
What the goodness?

200
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,791
[NEPTUNE]
Well, that's bold!

201
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,541
[NOIRE] But they're--
Where's their--

202
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,708
Everyone's naked!
I mean everyone!

203
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,541
It's like a real life internet!

204
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,916
Oh, my.
How wonderfully uninhibited!

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,583
We're wasting our time here!

206
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,458
We need to find the battery!

207
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,041
Hey, what's with the
glowy light streaks?

208
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,125
Oh, those?

209
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,750
That's the
Mysterious Light Grass.

210
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,250
It clings to the nether
regions for some reason.

211
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,666
Wha--

212
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,000
Why can't these people
just wear swimsuits?

213
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,041
Wh--Why the
nether regions?

214
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,250
Great idea!

215
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,958
[NEPTUNE] It's totally safe to
do this with this grass stuff!

216
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,250
Wow, jeez, Neptune.

217
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,500
Uh-oh.

218
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,291
C'mon, Nepgear,
you do it! It feels great!

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,625
Well, I'm not going
to pass this up!

220
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,458
Yeah, me neither!

221
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,041
[giggling]

222
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,250
[VERT]
I've never felt so free!

223
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
[NEPTUNE]
Do it, Nepgear!

224
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,416
If everyone else
can do it, then so can I!

225
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,541
[NEPTUNE]
Take this!

226
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,166
[giggling]

227
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,125
You're asking for it now!

228
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,125
[squealing]

229
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,750
[PLUTIA]
Take that!

230
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,666
[NEPGEAR] Okay, I thought
this was weird at first,

231
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,791
but you're right, it's awesome!

232
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,416
[BLANC] What the hell
has gotten into them?

233
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,625
[NOIRE]
C'mon, we need to hurry!

234
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,666
[laughing]

235
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,458
Go on and act
modest all you like!

236
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,875
With a little expert use of
the Mysterious Light Grass...

237
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:08,500
What?

238
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,375
[NEPTUNE]
Voila!

239
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,083
You might as well be naked now!

240
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,708
Such naughty girls!
Good thing they're censored!

241
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,958
Come on!

242
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,208
You know you really are
a serious perv, Neptune!

243
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,166
Perving out's what the
heart does best!

244
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,416
Now hurry up and
strip for realsies!

245
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,666
That freak.

246
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,583
All right. No use fightin' it.

247
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:27,791
Wait. Hold on.

248
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,375
[NEPTUNE]
Aw, man!

249
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,750
Aw, she figured it out.

250
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,791
What a pity, and it was
just about to get good, too!

251
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,958
I just knew there was
something fishy about this.

252
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,208
I don't get it, Neptune!

253
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,666
I clearly saw you
rip off your bikini!

254
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,208
I had another one under it!

255
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,500
[NEPGEAR]
No way!

256
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,375
[screaming]

257
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,375
What kind of awful
big sister are you?

258
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,291
[laughs nervously]

259
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,625
Oh, sorry, Nepgear.

260
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,208
I didn't think you'd
actually go through with it.

261
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,125
Hang on a minute! I'll
bring you your swimsuit.

262
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,416
[laughing]

263
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,916
[PLUTIA]
All done!

264
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,375
So, whada'ya think?

265
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,333
[VERT]
Wax on.

266
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,416
More wax on.

267
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,791
--[VERT] Up.
--[NEPGEAR] Okay, Vert.

268
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,125
--Down.
--I'm pretty sure that's enough.

269
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,625
I don't know, if the sun
can touch it then so can I.

270
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,416
I can do the rest,
but thanks for your help!

271
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,458
[UNDERLING]
Hey, ladies!

272
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,500
Would any of you care
for some iced tea?

273
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,791
Now that is service.

274
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,166
Tea time, bring it on!

275
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,291
[mischievous chuckle]

00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,208
Ah! Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

277
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,791
Have some.
There's plenty to go around.

00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,458
[NEPGEAR]
Neptune!

279
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,750
[NOIRE]
What's wrong with her?

280
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,083
[UNDERLING]
Party time!

281
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,541
What's wrong, Neptune?

282
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,208
Are you having
trouble breathing?

283
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,041
Are you okay, sis?

284
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,083
[shrieks]

285
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,125
Oh, no!

286
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,541
What happened?
I'm so embarrassed!

287
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,708
Yes!

288
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,666
Why am I
dressed like this?

289
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,458
It's so improper!

290
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:41,333
Oh, no. Don't look at me!

291
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Is this supposed to be a joke,

292
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,416
because it's kinda
creeping me out.

293
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,333
That is not the sister I know!

294
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,541
[VERT] There can
only be one culprit.

295
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,291
Although it's certainly
a taboo on this island,

296
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,291
I've heard of a drug
that can strongly enhance

297
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,250
a person's sense of shame.

298
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,833
Whoa, hang on,

299
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,666
I don't know nothin'
about any drug, okay?

300
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,000
You're dead, you punk!

301
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,791
To think we
ever believed you!

00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,000
Wait, I'm sure
she can explain.

303
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,291
You turned over
a new leaf, right?

304
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,708
So what's going on here?

305
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,416
Plutia! Don't get mad!

306
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,416
Huh. Get real, I wiped my
ass with your "new leaf!"

307
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm a natural born villain, see?

00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
[PLUTIA]
Well, that's too bad.

309
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:25,083
No benefit of the
doubt for you. Oh, well.

310
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,416
Uh-oh. This is what
I was worried about.

311
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,166
[PLUTIA (IH)] I suppose I'll
have to reform you myself.

312
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,083
And this is going to
be a long, slow process.

313
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,166
G-Go ahead and t-try it,
I don't care!

Oh, dear.

She's running!

She can look all she wants,

00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,750
but she'll never find

00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,625
[REI]
Um, yes?

479
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,000
[ANONYDEATH] Then here's a piece
of advice for you, little Rei.

480
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,833
If you clearly aren't
meant to know the answer,

481
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,375
then maybe you shouldn't ask
the question in the first place.

482
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,166
Hey there, everyone!

483
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,958
My name's Plutia.

484
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:43,083
Get used to this face 'cause
I'm hosting Nepstation today!

485
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,500
This is my special guest.

486
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,000
If you don't know, her name--
