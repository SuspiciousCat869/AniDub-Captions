[PLUTIA]
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:15,333
My name is Plutia.
It's nice to meet you.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,041
I'd like to take a
moment to propose a toast

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,958
to Plu-Plu, Planeptune's
lovely new CPU!

5
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,750
[NEPTUNE]
Whoa, whoa, hold up!

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,208
Compa, you're
making it sound like

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,041
Plutie here stole my whole
country out from under me!

8
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,541
No, not like that at all--

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,875
It's just that she's
a Planeptune CPU, too.

10
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,625
Yeah, but not
this Planeptune!

11
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,875
She's the CPU of a
completely different one!

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,583
And don't you forget it!

13
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,791
I think what
she's trying to say

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,458
is Plutia comes
from another dimension--

15
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,333
One with its very
own Planeptune.

16
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,291
I must admit, it's
a bit difficult to know

17
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,958
how to react to a
casual declaration

18
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,208
of different dimensions.

19
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,166
I take it you
can transform, too?

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
Yes, I can.

21
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,750
But, uh,

22
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,666
everybody tells me that I
shouldn't go around doing it.

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,083
Not unless I have to, that is.

24
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,750
Yeah? Why's that?

25
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,583
[PLUTIA]
Hm...

26
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,750
[PLUTIA]
...I wonder...

27
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:12,791
Hey! Cut it out, P-ko!

28
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:13,958
That's mine!

29
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,041
But I want meat
in my tummy!

30
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,708
Have this instead. Here you go!

31
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,791
[screams]

32
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,000
Get it away from me!

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,833
I hate eggplants!
They're super grody!

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,125
Come on, I cooked
today, give them a chance.

35
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,666
And they're pretty tasty,
if I do say so myself.

36
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,458
No way, no how,
no thank you!

37
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,708
Just the smell alone saps all
the strength out of my body!

38
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,041
[NEPTUNE]
I don't wanna.

39
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,583
[IF]
But they're so good!

40
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,083
You're missing out on a big
part of life by excluding them.

41
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,833
[NEPTUNE] Yeah,
we'll I'd rather die!

42
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,833
[HISTOIRE] Well, you just might
if you don't eat your veggies!

43
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,041
[NEPTUNE]
Gross!

44
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,416
Even Histy's shoving
eggplant into her mouth!

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,250
[HISTOIRE] Neptune, you're
setting a bad example

46
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,500
for your citizens
by being a picky eater.

47
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:56,666
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

48
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,583
[IF] Miss Histoire!
Are you all right?

49
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,875
--[HISTOIRE] I-I don't know!
--[NEPTUNE] It's the curse!

50
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:00,750
--I just--Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba!
--The dreaded curse

51
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:01,875
of the eggplant!

52
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,041
[IF] It is not!
There's no such thing!

53
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,083
[PEASHY]
Mmm!

54
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,166
Sorry about that.

55
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,750
I'd never received a call
from another dimension before,

56
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,125
you see, so I had to
sort of scramble through

57
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,750
the instruction manual
to figure out how to answer.

58
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,500
No, I apologize for
calling you out of the blue.

59
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,541
I wanted to thank you for
looking after Plutia for me.

60
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,875
You're a bit small,
aren't you?

61
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,166
Hey!

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't go writing me off
just because I'm small!

63
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,291
I was the one who sent
Plutia to your dimension

64
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,500
in the first place,
I'll have you know.

65
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,750
[HISTOIRE]
Is that so?

66
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,500
Well, you certainly
surprised me!

67
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,500
I never dreamed there
were different dimensions,

68
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,416
or that travelling
between them would be so easy,

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,583
for that matter!

70
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
It's not easy at all!

71
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,958
Actually, it's quite difficult.

72
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,541
[HISTOIRE]
My apologies, then!

73
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,416
[MINI HISTY] Well, it is
covered in that same manual,

74
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
if you read all the fine print.

75
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,291
It took three days!

76
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,291
[HISTOIRE]
I see.

77
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,083
I'll try to track that down.

78
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,000
[COMPA]
Who wants dessert?

79
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,541
Me! Me!

80
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,000
P-ko!

81
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,875
I wanna eat this one!

82
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,083
But that one is mine!

83
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,166
It says "Nep" on the
package and everything!

84
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,041
Come on, Peashy.

85
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,166
They all taste the same. Really!

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,791
But I want Nep's
pudding! Blaaah!

87
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,333
What's your problem?

88
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,958
Nep's pudding means pudding
for Nep stomachs exclusively!

89
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,000
It's mine now!

90
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,208
You little brat!
Wanna fight for it?

91
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,000
That's not very
mature of you.

92
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,625
No need to get
worked up about it.

93
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,916
Don't fight, Neppy.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,916
[HISTOIRE] So why exactly
did you send Plutia

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to this dimension?

96
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,041
[MINI HISTY]
Well, you see,

97
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,916
We detected a large
energy transfer

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,333
from our dimension to yours,

99
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,916
and it's caused some concern.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,375
Someone or something seems
to have traveled there,

101
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,083
but we're not sure what.

102
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,125
[HISTOIRE]
Ah.

103
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,375
[MINI HISTY] Either way,
whatever it is,

104
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,875
its energy is so massive that if
we don't do something about it,

105
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,250
and soon, we may not
be able to maintain

106
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,000
our world's
structural integrity.

107
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,041
[HISTOIRE]
Ah.

108
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,250
[MINI HISTY] So the plan
is to have Plutia find out

109
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,416
what the great presence is,
where it is, subdue it,

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,583
and bring it back here.

111
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,166
[HISTOIRE]
Good thinking.

112
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,916
So how exactly does one go about
finding this "great presence"?

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,458
[NEPTUNE laughing]

114
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,833
[PEASHY]
Pea Punch!

115
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,833
[boxing bell]

116
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,333
[MINI HISTY]
Not sure.

117
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,333
We searched for three days,
but we still can't find it.

118
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,500
Really? Then...?

119
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,041
All we can do
is try to sense

120
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,375
any changes in your world

121
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,750
and investigate them
as soon as possible.

122
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,375
I believe that when a
change of that nature occurs,

123
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,583
if you look around,

124
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,708
you'll find the presence
somewhere nearby.

125
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,958
[HISTOIRE]
I understand.

126
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,583
I'll relay that
information to everyone here.

127
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,500
[HISTOIRE]
So like she said,

128
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,791
if you notice anything
strange happening,

129
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,750
--please report it
--[NEPTUNE] I see you, AIDA!

00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,250

131
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,458
--[NEPTUNE] I'm gonna crush you!
--[PLUTIA] Poke and pull,

00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,625
[PEASHY]
I'm gonna play with this!

134
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,208
[NEPTUNE]
Oh, no you don't!

135
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,208
[NEPGEAR] Give it back!
Come on, please?

136
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,458
[HISTOIRE]
Ahem! Are you listening?

137
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,083
Oh! I'm sorry!

138
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,083
Yes, I'm listening!

139
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,375
You were saying--
Wait! Come back!

140
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,125
[NEPTUNE] "If anything
strange happens", right?

141
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,000
Nothing strange
going on right now.

142
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,375
But you haven't even
stepped outside to check.

143
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,875
I'll go on patrol.

144
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,125
If I see anything,
I'll let you know, okay?

145
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,791
That's much appreciated.

146
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
Sorry you're always
covering for them.

147
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,125
No problem.

148
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,500
Compa, don't you need
to get to work now?

149
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,583
Wanna catch a ride with me?

150
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,458
[COMPA]
Yes!

151
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,166
Yay! Thanks, Iffy!

152
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:06,125
[PLUTIA]
All done!

Whoa, is that who I think it is?

155
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,291
Wow, it's Neptune!

156
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,041
That's right! It sure is.

157
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,875
Oh, how cute!

158
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,916
Yeah, totally!

It's an itty-bitty
