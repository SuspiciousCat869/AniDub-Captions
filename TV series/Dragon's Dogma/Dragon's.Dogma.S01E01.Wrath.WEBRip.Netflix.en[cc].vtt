<c.white>[bell tolling]</c>

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.645
<c.white>[bell continues tolling]</c>

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.194
<c.white>-[man screams]</c>
<c.white>-[masonry clatters]</c>

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.324
<c.white>[woman humming tunefully in distance]</c>

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:36.912
<c.white>[grunting weakly]</c>

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.706
<c.white>[humming continues]</c>

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.626
<c.white>[man] Olivia?</c>

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.127
<c.white>Olivia!</c>

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.170
<c.white>[gasps softly]</c>

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.673
<c.white>Ethan.</c>

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.136
<c.white>[Ethan breathing raggedly]</c>

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.013
<c.white>[Ethan] I was so worried.</c>

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.019
<c.white>[inhales sharply]</c>

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.438
<c.white>Wha-- What?</c>

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.193
<c.white>[yells] Olivia!</c>

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.448
<c.white>[snarling]</c>

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:17.786
<c.white>[gasps]</c>

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.457
<c.white>[dramatic orchestral music playing]</c>

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.802
<c.white>[snarling]</c>

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.226
<c.white>[Ethan screams]</c>

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.229
<c.white>[yells]</c>

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.148
<c.white>[panting]</c>

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.233
<c.white>[birds chirping outside]</c>

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.991
<c.white>Just a dream.</c>

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.213
<c.white>[dramatic orchestral music playing]</c>

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.011
<c.white>[Olivia humming tunefully]</c>

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:45.976
<c.white>Good morning, my love.</c>

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.602
<c.white>[Ethan sighs]</c>

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.397
<c.white>What's wrong?</c>

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.191
<c.white>Nothing's wrong. I just...</c>

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.903
<c.white>I'm so glad you're OK. [sighs]</c>

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.199
<c.white>[Olivia]</c>
<c.white>Did someone have a nightmare, hmm?</c>

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:02.451
<c.white>[Ethan] Of course not.</c>

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.035
<c.white>-[Olivia giggles]</c>
<c.white>-[Ethan grunts]</c>

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.912
<c.white>I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!</c>

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.914
<c.white>[Olivia and Ethan moaning softly]</c>

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.084
<c.white>Uh...</c>

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:12.377
<c.white>I, um...</c>

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.672
<c.white>You know what?</c>
<c.white>I can eat that horse in my </c><i><c.white>own</c></i><c.white> home.</c>

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.257
<c.white>[Ethan chuckles]</c>

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.384
<c.white>And let a meal like this go to waste?</c>

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.428
<c.white>You know what they say, Louis:</c>

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.389
<c.white>Breakfast </c><i><c.white>is</c></i><c.white> the most important meal</c>
<c.white>of the day.</c>

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:28.059
<c.white>[Louis] Fine. You talked me into it.</c>

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.688
<c.white>[Louis munching ravenously]</c>

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:36.651
<c.white>Enjoying your food?</c>

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:37.736
<c.white>Yeah!</c>

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.739
<c.white>This is your best meal yet.</c>

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.284
<c.white>[Ethan] It's a surprise he's even able</c>
<c.white>to taste anything at that speed.</c>

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.246
<c.white>-If you don't slow down, you'll end--</c>
<c.white>-[Louis choking]</c>

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.582
<c.white>[sighs] He never learns.</c>

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:51.792
<c.white>[Olivia] Oh, hush.</c>

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:54.961
<c.white>It's not his fault he can't control</c>
<c.white>himself around my cooking.</c>

00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.005
<c.white>[Louis exhales]</c>

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.884
<c.white>Weird how that happens</c>
<c.white>every time, isn't it?</c>

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.219
<c.white>[chuckles] Is it, though?</c>

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.727
<c.white>[water sloshing]</c>

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.895
<c.white>Thank you, Olivia.</c>

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.105
<c.white>Of course, Louis.</c>

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.108
<c.white>You make me feel like</c>
<c.white>the best cook in all of the land.</c>

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.278
<c.white>I don't mean for the food.</c>

00:05:20.654 --> 00:05:23.156
<c.white>I mean, yes,</c>
<c.white>thank you for that, too, but...</c>

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.159
<c.white>thank you for, well, e-everything.</c>

00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:29.329
<c.white>You two have done so much for me,</c>
<c.white>after my pare--</c>

00:05:29.538 --> 00:05:30.664
<c.white>[hesitates]</c>

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:33.959
<c.white>You stood by me after I lost everything.</c>

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:37.212
<c.white>You may be my neighbors,</c>
<c.white>but you feel like my family.</c>

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.800
<c.white>And I know Ethan is just doing it</c>
<c.white>because he lost his parents as well.</c>

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.678
<c.white>He feels obligated to.</c>
<c.white>I hate being a bother--</c>

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.972
<c.white>[Olivia] Don't you dare speak like that.</c>

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.308
<c.white>We don't feel obligated</c>
<c.white>to take care of you.</c>

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.395
<c.white>You bring laughter, happiness,</c>

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.647
<c.white>and a sense of family to this home.</c>

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.692
<c.white>Olivia...</c>

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.111
<c.white>Besides,</c>

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.905
<c.white>this child needs a big brother</c>
<c.white>to guide him.</c>

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:06.616
<c.white>Uh...</c>

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.953
<c.white>[chuckles] Yes. I guess you're right.</c>

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.498
<c.white>[Ethan] Right, we should go hunting</c>
<c.white>before the day gets any longer.</c>

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:16.710
<c.white>[chuckles] Those animals</c>
<c.white>don't stand a chance!</c>

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:25.719
<c.white>[man] Here.</c>

00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:27.429
<c.white>[man 2 grunts]</c>

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.433
<c.white>[man] What you looking at there?</c>

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:35.562
<c.white>[sighs] Looks like Ethan's headed up</c>
<c.white>to the mountains again.</c>

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:36.938
<c.white>Weird fella.</c>

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.609
<c.white>Don't see why he'd go hunting for food</c>
<c.white>with a sea as full as this one.</c>

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.943
<c.white>I don't blame him.</c>

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.447
<c.white>After all he's been through,</c>
<c.white>I sure as hell wouldn't go near the water.</c>

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.074
<c.white>[man 2 chuckles] Damn straight.</c>

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.419
<c.white>I saw roe footprints</c>
<c.white>at Vestad Hills yesterday.</c>

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.795
<c.white>That's our best bet.</c>

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.839
<c.white>That sounds good to me.</c>

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:04.299
<c.white>[soldiers laughing]</c>

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.675
<c.white>[soldier] Am I wrong?</c>

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.428
<c.white>Am I wrong?</c>

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.347
<c.white>[scoffs]</c>

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.349
<c.white>They're already drinking?</c>

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.808
<c.white>It's not even noon!</c>

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:16.519
<c.white>Remember when they first came down</c>
<c.white>from the capital?</c>

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:18.480
<c.white>They were so put together.</c>

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.981
<c.white>Now look at them!</c>

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.317
<c.white>[scoffs] Pathetic.</c>

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.320
<c.white>The hell did you say, boy?</c>

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:26.571
<c.white>Nothing.</c>

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:28.323
<c.white>Nothing, I swear.</c>

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.992
<c.white>You lying to a Capital Soldier?</c>

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.285
<c.white>I could...</c>

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.995
<c.white>[grunts]</c>

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.497
<c.white>...jail you for that.</c>

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:38.833
<c.white>I... I didn't mean any offense.</c>

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.836
<c.white>[soldier] Oh. So, you </c><i><c.white>did</c></i><c.white> say something.</c>

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.129
<c.white>[gasps]</c>

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.216
<c.white>[sighs]</c>

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.636
<c.white>My deepest apologies.</c>

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.554
<c.white>He is but a boy.</c>

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.473
<c.white>[chuckles] A stupid one at that.</c>

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.976
<c.white>Will you please forgive his transgression?</c>

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.103
<c.white>That's a mighty big transgr...</c>

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.773
<c.white>uh, transgreg-greggen... [grunts]</c>

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.901
<c.white>[soldier 2] Yeah,</c>
<c.white>maybe we should lock you up, too.</c>

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.779
<c.white>Your job is to teach the boy</c>
<c.white>some goddamn respect.</c>

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:08.863
<c.white>[whimpers]</c>

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.574
<c.white>W-We should really get going, Ethan.</c>

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:15.120
<c.white>Guys like these obviously</c>
<c.white>have more important things to do.</c>

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.788
<c.white>[soldier] "Like these," huh?</c>

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.707
<c.white>What does he mean by that?</c>

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.460
<c.white>[soldier 2] Think we might need to teach</c>
<c.white>these two a lesson about respect.</c>

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.337
<c.white>-[whimpers]</c>
<c.white>-[man] Halt!</c>

00:08:32.012 --> 00:08:33.430
<c.white>My apologies.</c>

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:36.725
<c.white>My soldiers have become restless</c>
<c.white>as of late.</c>

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.685
<c.white>You have such a beautiful village,</c>

00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.854
<c.white>and it's so peaceful</c>
<c.white>my men have nothing to do.</c>

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.024
<c.white>It seems they've forgotten their purpose.</c>

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:45.942
<c.white>[snickers] I'll say.</c>

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.360
<c.white>The hell does that mean?</c>

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.611
<c.white>Calm down!</c>

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:51.239
<c.white>-[captain] Back to your post.</c>
<c.white>-[soldiers] Yes, sir.</c>

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.950
<c.white>[grunts]</c>

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.035
<c.white>Ow!</c>

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.913
<c.white>[sighs] Looks like we both</c>
<c.white>have some lessons to teach.</c>

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.915
<c.white>-So it would appear.</c>
<c.white>-[groans]</c>

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.250
<c.white>I...</c>

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:05.462
<c.white>-I, um, have a question, sir.</c>
<c.white>-Yes?</c>

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:09.632
<c.white>The duke stationed soldiers all over</c>
<c.white>the land to protect us from Dragons,</c>

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:13.094
<c.white>but... no one I know</c>
<c.white>has ever actually seen one.</c>

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.932
<c.white>The last time a Dragon appeared</c>
<c.white>was well over 100 years ago.</c>

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:20.351
<c.white>But that's, like, forever ago!</c>

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.479
<c.white>[chuckles] Indeed.</c>

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.648
<c.white>My grandfather was not even a glimmer</c>
<c.white>in his father's eye</c>

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.192
<c.white>when they were last seen.</c>

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.569
<c.white>[Louis] So, why </c><i><c.white>are</c></i><c.white> you here?</c>

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.530
<c.white>[captain] Does not the fisherman</c>
<c.white>prepare for a storm,</c>

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.449
<c.white>not knowing if there will be one?</c>

00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:37.619
<c.white>Preparation is a necessity in life.</c>

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:40.205
<c.white>[Louis] Hmm. I guess that makes sense.</c>

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.252
<c.white>[Louis] What would you do</c>
<c.white>if a Dragon really showed up?</c>

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.799
<c.white>I'd rather not think about that.</c>

<c.white>Why would you be sorry?</c>
