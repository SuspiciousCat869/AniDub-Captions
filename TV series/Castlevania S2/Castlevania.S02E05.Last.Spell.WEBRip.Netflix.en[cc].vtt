[Carmilla] Assemble at Braila.
Await the word.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.967 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My work here is almost done.

3
00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nothing here but lost children
and confused old men.

4
00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The end of this
will be practically merciful.

6
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:10.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? How hard can it be
to find Godbrand of all people?

7
00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There has to be a limited number of things
in this castle that he can drink,

8
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.034 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
sleep under or attempt to have sex with.

9
00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He must be somewhere.

10
00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, for coming from an oral,
memory-based culture,

11
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
you're very good with books.

12
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It would have been a poor education

13
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if we hadn't been taught to read things
to add to our memory stores.

14
00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:14.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I am coming to the conclusion
that my people are idiots

15
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:15.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and we should have written
everything down.

16
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Everything?
-Yes. All the things.

17
00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Look at this.

18
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's more in this room
than a million Speakers

19
00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
could carry across two generations.

20
00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is insane.

21
00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:31.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the sheer breadth of information
about the Castle is staggering.

22
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hmm. But how much of it is useful?
-[blows]

23
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I do have questions
about Trevor's ancestors.

24
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:45.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I discovered an entire box
of spells about... penises.

25
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:49.460 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're certain
it was one of his ancestors?

26
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You didn't find it
under his childhood bed?

27
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop testing him, Alucard.

28
00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:00.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am concerned I have thrown my lot in
with a demented infant.

29
00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I imagine he has similar concerns
about you.

30
00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am also concerned
that you enjoy him too much.

31
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.065 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what is that supposed to mean?

32
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:16.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is unreliable, emotionally damaged,
and apparently very distracting to you

33
00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
while you should be focused
on the task at hand.

34
00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Am I not working hard enough?

35
00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

36
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he's a drunk and he's self-destructive

37
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and anybody trying to hold on to him
may well simply be dragged down with him.

38
00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're afraid.

39
00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You worry that you might have made
the wrong choice.

40
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you're trying to make him prove himself
again and again

41
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
by constantly provoking him.

42
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You forget, Alucard.

43
00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Trevor didn't get to finish out
his childhood.

44
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is not the man here
who may not have grown up.

45
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's ridiculous.

46
00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And if we don't get this done,
then we're all failing. Aren't we?

47
00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't fail.

48
00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait. Get me that volume back there.
With the red spine.

49
00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What have you found?
-I'm not sure.

50
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The ritual language it's written in

51
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has forked a couple of times
over the years.

52
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Can you read it?
-Not without that book.

53
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's based on Adamic.
I recognize the roots.

54
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, that book there claimed to be written
in a language called High Remembrance,

55
00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which I've heard of.

56
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This one has the Adamical roots

57
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and some of the structure
of High Remembrance, I think.

58
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Give.
-I haven't heard of Adamic.

59
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take a look.

60
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Interesting.
I see threads of Chaldaic in it.

61
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're rather well-read yourself.

62
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I had entirely different books
under my childhood bed.

63
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My father was a polymath,
my mother was a doctor,

64
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I grew up very fast.

65
00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.300 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What does that mean?

66
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm being literal. I aged very quickly.

67
00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That may explain something.

68
00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:09.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

69
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Perhaps you're just an angry teenager
in an adult's body.

72
00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can spend so long in the castle
that you can forget how the sun feels.

73
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:41.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you think?

74
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:47.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I like the castle. The stone stays cool
no matter where we are.

75
00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You like the cold?

76
00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I'm cold, I can eat meat
or throw a cloak on.

77
00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I spent my whole life in hot places.

78
00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:58.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't escape heat. Keep walking.

79
00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vampires have sharp ears,
and you said we needed to talk.

80
00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're concerned
about the others hearing us?

81
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Isaac] I'm not a fool, Hector.

82
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you weren't concerned,

83
00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you wouldn't want the conversation
out in the daylight.

84
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I just didn't want to be interrupted
by arguments.

85
00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They are good at arguing.

86
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I used to liken them to wolves or bats.

87
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A strong sense of community,
acting as one.

88
00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But lately, I see the vampires as cats.

89
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:33.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Swiping, hunting or ignoring each other.
-You think of vampires as animals?

90
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
In a way. They are pure creatures.

91
00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:40.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They have grace.
Animals don't act with malice.

93
00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
True. But it's not malicious.
There's joy in it.

94
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not for the food.

So.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a good way
to get your eyes clawed out, Hector.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

of creating a war plan,

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and their fighting,

104
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't care.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:23.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He cares very much.
He wants all of the humans to die.

106
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.319 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's quite clear on that.

107
00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:26.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That hasn't escaped me.

108
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My point is that he doesn't care how.

109
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're failing him.

110
00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Are we, now?

111
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. We need to assert
an order to the war.

112
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're the agents of his rage,
not paintings of it.

113
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't just thrash around.

114
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you want, Hector?

115
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want to present a united front.

116
00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:51.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want a plan.

117
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I want to move forward
and get this over with

118
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in an orderly manner.

119
00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I want you to agree to move on Braila.

120
00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:05.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs] I know that, strictly speaking,
we've never really been friends.

121
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It seems counterproductive
to cultivate human friends

122
00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:12.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when we're engaged in the project
of ending the human race.

123
00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But we are on the same side.

124
00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:18.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is this where we kiss
like Benedictine monks

125
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
from different monasteries?

126
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't think I've ever heard you
try to tell a joke before.

127
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You still haven't.

128
00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hector] All Dracula hears
is the noise in the War Hall.

129
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:34.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He needs us to be the clear voice
over that noise.

130
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He needs us to speak in one voice.

131
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Isaac] He needs us to be loyal.

132
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:41.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[scoffs] How is it disloyal to provide
the guidance he requested of us?

133
00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's serving you and not him.

134
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.985 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are people in the court
who have their own plans.

135
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Their own agendas.

136
00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:51.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Hector] I am loyal to him and his intent.

137
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But he asked for a plan.

138
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And we need to give him one,
unambiguously.

139
00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We go to Braila,
prevent a diaspora by boat

140
00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:03.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then proceed along the coast
from there.

141
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you say?

142
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:11.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well. It will please Carmilla,
so I distrust it.

143
00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:16.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But it would stop her
from making mischief, for the moment.

144
00:09:17.306 --> 00:09:21.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it would get the war room pointed
in the same direction.

145
00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] I imagine
it would even make Godbrand smile.

146
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. Well. Don't talk me out of it.

147
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both chuckling]

148
00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:41.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isaac agreed.

149
00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's good. That's very good.

150
00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:49.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And the night creatures I forged for you
will arrive at their destination soon.

151
00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hector! You are a marvel.

152
00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.470 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What now?

153
00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:00.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now we'll wait a short while
for Isaac to settle.

154
00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:04.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And then we'll have him accompany us
to Dracula. Present a united front.

155
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Dracula will have no choice but to agree

156
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to the request of both
of his forgemasters,

157
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
brilliant Hector.

158
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:18.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm. A quick, orderly and merciful war.

159
00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just as you wished, Hector.
You have caused this to happen.

160
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:27.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be proud. I admire your resolve.

161
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Quite remarkable.

162
00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Carpathian?
-Indeed.

163
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The last of the mirrors
made by the Carpathian scrying hermits,

164
00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
400 years ago.

165
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:50.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must learn more
about transmission mirrors one day.

166
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There will be time enough.
Soon the world will be silent.

167
00:10:55.279 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
God, yes. Listening to Hector made me wish
for a lifeless world all on his own.

168
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[chuckles]

169
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find myself wishing you two
were better friends.

170
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As I said to him,

171
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
making human friends
seems a little pointless,

172
00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
given our current crusade.

173
00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:14.965 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
True.

174
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But, at the end,
there will be only you and him.

175
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Presumably.

176
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:25.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He'll be coming here to request
you approve a move on Braila.

177
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

178
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hector doesn't like it
when the animals fight.

179
00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:35.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Carmilla has the court whipped up.
Discord is loud. It bothers him.

180
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he still loyal?

181
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I think so.
There's betrayal abroad in the court,

182
00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:46.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but Hector is a simpler creature
than that.

183
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He just doesn't like the arguing.

184
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So the generals are going to betray me.
-No.

185
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If anyone actually approached
the verge of that,

186
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they would be taken care of without you
ever finding out about it, my lord.

187
00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:03.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It is simply in the air
because they are frustrated.

188
00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:07.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So if I let them go to Braila,
they'll stop scheming and whining.

189
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think so.

190
00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:13.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It will give Carmilla some power,
but that's not a bad thing.

191
00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:14.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

192
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:20.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The War Room will speak to you and Hector
in one voice instead of a dozen.

193
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:21.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Indeed.

194
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:25.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And at the end of the day, you don't care.

195
00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So long as the war continues.

196
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Fine, then.

197
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.046 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm tired, Isaac.

198
00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:40.426 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There was a time
that I would relish the details.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:43.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

200
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A time when the smallest details of death
delighted me.

Let us just conclude this thing.

227
00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:42.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isaac. We were looking for you.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:48.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My lord, Dracula.

-Yes, yes, we all know who we are.

231
00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you all want?

232
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very well. Hector?

233
00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:01.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We would ask you to consider
moving the castle to Braila,

234
00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:05.149 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
to conduct a full-scale
destructive attack on the port.

235
00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.692 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dracula] To what end?

236
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.529 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To seal it, and discourage escape
by river to the sea.

237
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.240 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then we turn inland,
having land-locked the humans

238
00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:15.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and turned their country into a prison.

239
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree. They make a good case.

240
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:22.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It unites the court.
It lets us move forward.

241
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Braila. Fine. Braila it is.

242
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:29.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I no longer have the strength

243
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Amuse yourselves.
We will go to Braila ourselves.

244
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So long as they all die.

245
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:39.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all that matters.
They all have to die...

246
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you. A great victory awaits.

247
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dracula] Yes, yes. I'm tired.

248
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell me when you're ready for me
to move the castle to Braila.

249
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:53.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Get on with it.

250
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:06.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I will stay, Dracula. Until this is done.

251
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:08.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It doesn't matter.

252
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So long as they all die. That's all.

253
00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They all have to die...

254
00:18:21.475 --> 00:18:25.229 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What now?
-Now I ensure my forces will be in place.

255
00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:26.855 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then we inform the war council

256
00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:30.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and convince them
that this was their plan all along.

257
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:33.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some of them will wonder why
this is where your interest is,

258
00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
after you so loudly brought up the issue
of Belmont and Alucard.

259
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have already had you forge me
the means to deal with that issue.

260
00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:42.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I am in control, Hector.

261
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are?

262
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes.

263
00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He could have done it.
You could have done it.

264
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:55.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Any of the generals could have done it.
But I had to.

265
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know why I had to do it?

266
00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:02.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because I am surrounded by children
and animals and dying old men.

267
00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are perhaps four other women
in this castle

268
00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:07.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and they all glare from the edges,

269
00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.315 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
either disempowered
by posturing man-children

270
00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or too paralysed by sheer fucking rage
to do anything.

271
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And which am I? Child or animal?

272
00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:19.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Puppy. Somewhere between the two.

273
00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[scoffs] I thought you wanted me
to believe you respected me.

274
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:27.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I did. Now you're implicated,
so I don't need to.

275
00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:32.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're hip-deep in this now, puppy,
and the only way out is forward.

276
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:33.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come along.

277
00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. Oh! This is... Trevor!

278
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What?
-I have something.

279
00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:09.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, when I say "what,"

280
00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:12.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that doesn't mean "I would like to ask
even more questions."

281
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:16.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you please--
Oh, you are the most annoying, just stop.

282
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:20.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I'm coming up.

283
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:25.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I've found a locking spell.
Wait. Listen.

284
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your family have an entire literature here
about the castle.

285
00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They tried for centuries
to eliminate its main advantage

286
00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:34.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it transports itself
through magical means.

287
00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:38.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. So you can't attack it
if it just jumps somewhere else.

288
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. So some clever Belmont

289
00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:44.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
eventually formulated
most of a locking spell.

290
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:45.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A method to catch the castle

291
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and lock it down to a single location
so that it can be invaded.

292
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most of it?

293
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:54.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can finish
the final clauses of it myself.

294
00:20:54.628 --> 00:20:57.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all based on Adamical structures.

295
00:20:57.172 --> 00:20:58.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Alucard] You keep saying that word.

296
00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:02.427 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Adamic is the original
human language.

297
00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:05.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one spoken by Adam and Eve
in the Garden of Eden.

298
00:21:05.555 --> 00:21:07.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The one that was split
into all other languages

299
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:11.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
at the Tower of Babel by God
to prevent human cooperation.

300
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:17.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that how you understand that story?

301
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, yes.
The Speakers are the enemy of God.

302
00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We live in cooperation
and hide our stories inside ourselves

303
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.993 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he cannot strike them down in jealousy.

304
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:26.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh...

305
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[thudding]
-Oh?

306
00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
See? God hates me.

307
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[glasses clinking]
-[thudding continues]

308
00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:40.882 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

309
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's probably not God.
