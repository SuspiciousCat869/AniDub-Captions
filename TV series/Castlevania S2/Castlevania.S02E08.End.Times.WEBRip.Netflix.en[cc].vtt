00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We really messed up the old house,
didn't we?

2
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So much like the engines and things
we saw under Gresit.

3
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alucard must have learned it all
at his daddy's knee.

4
00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.142 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] It's incredible, really.

5
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the true science.

6
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My people heard the stories,

7
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but didn't quite hold on
to the truth of them.

8
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Less damage than I would have thought.

9
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Apart from the mess
in that little room he showed us.

10
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, the engine room
that moves the castle.

11
00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I cannot imagine how that worked.

12
00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.706 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Trevor] Well, it doesn't work anymore.

13
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You melted it.

14
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:07.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I didn't melt anything.

15
00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It must have been straining
against the spell.

16
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What do you think he's going to do now?

17
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I had a plan, you know.

18
00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was going to go back to Gresit,

19
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:31.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
return to my vault,

20
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:33.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
go back to sleep.

21
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But?

22
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If I leave the castle here...

23
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All his work is inside it.

24
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His libraries,
his materials, his knowledge.

25
00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happens to all that
if the structure is abandoned?

26
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't just leave it here.

27
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It'd be nothing but a grave to be robbed.

28
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, let it be my grave.

29
00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

30
00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No?

31
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

32
00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We can't move this thing.

33
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sypha broke it.

34
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I did not.

35
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You kind of did.

36
00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I do not break things.

37
00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-So, we're agreed she broke it.
-Oh, yes.

38
00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's staying right here, forever,

39
00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
right on top of the Belmont Hold.

40
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Which is now also open to the world.

41
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Up here,
your father's collected knowledge.

42
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Down there, the collected knowledge
of your mother's people.

43
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As above, so below.

44
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Both halves of you, Alucard.

45
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm listening.

46
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:58.696 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Behold, you sulky, half-vampire bastard.

47
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bequeath you the Belmont Hold.

48
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Make that and the castle your home,
not your grave.

49
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Be its last defender.

50
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're giving me your home?

51
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's yours.

52
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My childhood home and your childhood home.

53
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.429 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Protect it. Make something out of it.

54
00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something better than a pile of ruins
and a symbol of terror.

55

58
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Keep moving. I'm not in the mood.

59
00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

60
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Scars] Oh, what do we have here?

61
00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, it's thirsty, whatever it is.

63
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't drink the entire pool.

64
00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is enough water for all.

65
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I don't care about "all."

66
00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I only care about us.

67
00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There will be plenty for you
after I'm gone.

68
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:51.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Scars] Well, perhaps we want it all.

69
00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.938 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, you probably do.

70
00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:59.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your kind always does.

71
00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Scars] I think the desert
has left us a little gift, don't you?

72
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Put a rope around it, drag it behind us.
Perhaps we can sell it at the next town.

73
00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unless we get hungry
between now and then, I suppose.

74
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is that really the best you have?

75
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:23.549 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your best response to finding
a lone stranger drinking at an oasis?

76
00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:25.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and immediately draw plans
to sell him or eat him.

78
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

I discovered on the road,

81
00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

82
00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

83
00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:51.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

85
00:06:55.164 --> 00:07:00.419 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm sure you're human,

86
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:02.203 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shall we find some more people
to add to our merry band?

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sypha] I want to rejoin my caravan.

113
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a story that should be read
into our memory stores.

114
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But after that, I don't know.

115
00:11:37.696 --> 00:11:39.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You'll travel with them, surely.

116
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Go back to your old life.

117
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't know.

118
00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Since I met you,
I've come back from a living death,

119
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've fought demons
in the city square at Gresit,

120
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.926 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've stopped a raiding force
from reaching Arges,

121
00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:03.264 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've discovered forgotten spells
in the greatest hidden library in Europe,

122
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:06.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I've trapped a castle

123
00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that uses magic engines
to move from place to place,

124
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and pinned it to the ruins
of the Belmont home.

125
00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would I want to stop now?

126
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:16.360 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

127
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:21.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look, we know at least
some of Dracula's army landed at Braila.

128
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are the night hordes
just going to go home?

129
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.411 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, no. But--

130
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.204 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what about the church?

131
00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've both seen how corrupt
and twisted it is.

132
00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:32.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And who knows what else
is happening out there?

133
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What then?

134
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.921 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, what then?

135
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then we're not finished, are we?

136
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:40.551 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I don't want to stop.

137
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:42.720 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop what, for God's sake?

138
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:45.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This. What we're doing.

139
00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:46.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And it's good for you, too.

140
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay.

141
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How on Earth
did you come to that decision?

142
00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:59.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When I met you,
you reeked of piss, blood, and stale beer.

143
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You killed a monster largely by accident.

144
00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, that took serious skills.

145
00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:06.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And then demanded alcohol

146
00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:09.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
before storming off like a toddler
with a thistle up his back end.

147
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right, h-how does that even--?
-Shh.

148
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now, in the short time
we have known each other,

149
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:18.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you have rediscovered yourself,
and you've grown.

150
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:22.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Today might be the first time
I felt like I was talking to an adult man.

151
00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:24.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're better than you were
when I met you.

152
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know why I think that is?

153
00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's because you're doing
what you were born for.

154
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As insane as it sounds,

155
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
this entire nightmare scenario
has made you complete.

156
00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think you should see it through.

157
00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:41.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With me.

158
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
With you?

159
00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:46.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, you could be my handsome sidekick.

160
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.827 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Or mascot. Imagine that.

161
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you didn't talk much,

162
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
people would think
you were my deformed pet bear

163
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and throw you free food.

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:56.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sypha.

166
00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:58.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, Trevor?

167
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:06.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're asking me to roam the countryside
and get into horrible trouble

168
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
because you think it's<i> good </i>for me.

169
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.811 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Listen to what I'm really saying, Trevor.

170
00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:19.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm saying I want you to be with me
and I want you to have adventures with me.

171
00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:24.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the closest thing
I've had to a life in...

172
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] ...I don't know when.

173
00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you're the closest I've had
to a friend.

174
00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, will you come with me?

175

176
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Trevor] I wouldn't know where else to go

177
00:14:43.757 --> 00:14:45.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
or who else to be with.

178
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sypha] Good.

179
00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:55.895 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where to, first?

180
00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:00.691 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After we find my people,
I think we should see Braila.

181
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But let's stay here just a little longer.

[Carmilla] Is the sun down yet?

184
00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:31.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not quite.

186
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:34.808 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, for God's sake.

187
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where are the townspeople?

188
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They're not coming close to us.

189
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They spent the day recovering things
from the ruins.

190
00:15:43.317 --> 00:15:45.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They started returning
to the furthest houses a little while ago.

191
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do they know we're here?

192
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] Certainly.

193
00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.788 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So they're barricading their homes
and sharpening their stakes.

194
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's fair. Can't say I blame them.

195
00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:07.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You won't stake me to death
with that, Hector.

196
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:10.469 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

197
00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:12.805 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I wasn't intending to try.

198
00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was thinking it might make a drill
to start a fire.

199
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's gonna be a cold night.

200
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We won't be staying.

201
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, the fire was for me, not you.

202
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:25.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I assume you don't really feel the cold.

203
00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

204
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where will you go?

205
00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think I will return to Styria.
What else is there?

206
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:04.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The majority of my forces were here,
and now they are gone.

207
00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What was that?

208
00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:08.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The way the castle moved
and then vanished.

209
00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:12.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've been thinking about it all day.
I-I still don't understand.

210
00:17:13.907 --> 00:17:16.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] What is there to understand?

211
00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A spell captured the castle.

212
00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The engines of the castle
attempted to fight the capture,

213
00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:25.794 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and so it thrashed around
like a rat in a cage, and lost.

214
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Do you think Dracula lives?
