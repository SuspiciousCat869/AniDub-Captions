17
00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I can't stop you
from speaking to me.

18
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're vampire aristocracy after all.

19
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm a simple human smith.

20
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carmilla] Your skills are legend.

21
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Our kind has never produced a forgemaster.

22
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, you didn't have to.

23
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before the war, night creatures
were simply a species in hiding.

24
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.527 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They either reproduced naturally
or were created by acts of wild magic.

25
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:01.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now they are soldiers.
Their numbers have to be replenished.

26
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You didn't need forgemasters until now.

27
00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:07.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] But your intellect
cannot be denied.

28
00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-If you say so.
-I do.

29
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And Dracula himself clearly agrees.

30
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He listens to you.

31
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:20.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As much as he does to Isaac.
Which is, frankly, not much.

32
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I believe you are actually worried
about Dracula.

33
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighs] I am.

34
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:32.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not like him to be indecisive.

35
00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The fire in him
has gone out somehow, and...

36
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's as if we're looking
at the embers of a man.

37
00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are things we can do
that don't require his decisions.

38
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[scoffs] Oh, I doubt that.

39
00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:50.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There are.

40
00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It means nothing to the war effort

41
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:56.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
if we sent a group to the Belmont home
to begin a search for their hold.

43
00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.175 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you so fascinated by that?

44
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If anyone in all of the world has tools
or magic who can harm our lord, Dracula,

45
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.182 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
it is in the Belmont trove.

46
00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need to ensure
it does not fall into the wrong hands.

47
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Simple.

48
00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right. That is logical.

49
00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I agree to that.

50
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Dracula must approve
the dispensation of troops.

51
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
How did you come to be in his service?

52
00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:38.671 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I met him over a year ago,
when he was traveling.

53
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.758 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He sought me out, you know.

54
00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did he really?

55
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.597 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was living in the east of Rhodes
very quietly.

56
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

from scholars in town

57
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and looked for me specifically.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

70
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:40.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I need an army.

74
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:51.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The dead must rise,

75
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:56.040 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and creatures of the night
must be called into their corpses.

76
00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
These are your skills.

77
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's happened? Why do you need an army?

78
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

79
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:18.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

86
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

87
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
They must be stopped.

88
00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

89
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this genocide, Dracula?

90
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Dracula] Would that concern you?

91
00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:50.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My fellow humans
have never treated me with love,

92
00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I punished them for it.

93
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I wouldn't have them suffer.

94
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And like any animal,

95
00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think the world would be poorer
with their extinction.

96
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would just see to it
that they couldn't harm anyone else.

97
00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Then that is how it shall be.

98
00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:14.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Vampires feed on humans.
I understand this.

99
00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:16.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

100
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If humans became livestock,

101
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I would have no concern over that

102
00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

103
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I was gonna say merciful.

104
00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:30.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yes.

105
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can promise a merciful end
to the human plague, Hector.

106
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

107
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A cull.

108
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
