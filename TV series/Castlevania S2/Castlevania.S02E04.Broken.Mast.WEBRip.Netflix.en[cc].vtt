15
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fuck your eyes, man,

Oh, no, no. Th-that's not fair.

19
00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn it all. That bloody woman is right.

20
00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something must be done.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Trevor] What the hell is this?

22
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You don't know?
-I don't know.

23
00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your house.

24
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you know everything in your house?

25
00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I don't have a house.
-[Alucard] She doesn't have a house.

26
00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.482 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She's a Speaker. She's a nomad.

27
00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was rhetorical.

28
00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:36.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Rhetorical house that she doesn't have.
-Just tell me what it is.

29
00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:41.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-It was a magic mirror.
-Also known as distance mirrors.

30
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Some of them even allow matter
to pass through them, but...

31
00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

32
00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:49.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No.

33
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. This is a simple
remote viewing mirror.

34
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.884 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A little of the activating language
is chipped.

35
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A few of the runes need re-cutting,
but workable.

36
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have the most fascinating
family junkyard, Belmont.

37
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are a cock wart, Alucard.

38
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop it.

39
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are an adult.
You do not have to rise to his every barb.

40
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's pissing me off
like it's his job, Sypha.

41
00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Grow up, Trevor.

42
00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why is your name Trevor, anyway?
-I'm sorry?

43
00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I understand the Belmont now.

44
00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But "Trevor" doesn't sound
very local either.

45
00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:36.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. Well, so the story goes,
a Celt rode out here

46
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
with Leon back in the day,
and his name was Trefor, with an F.

47
00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trefor.

48
00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[chuckles] I like that.
-Oh, it's terrible.

49
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.059 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Treff.

50
00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Treffy.
-Oh, my God, no.

51
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You are Treffy now.

52
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Don't.
-[both laughing]

53
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[wind howling]

54
00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Hector]
...but Dracula respects my skills.

55
00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:16.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And the human world cast me out long ago.

56
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would I go against his wishes?

57
00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Carmilla]
Dracula has failed his own people.

58
00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He believes that he fell in love
with a human woman.

59
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He took a pet.

60
00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-You see that, don't you?
-I believe he loved her.

61
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He is capable of love.
That's the source of his conviction.

62
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you love something,

63
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you act to keep it with you
for as long as you can.

64
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Instead, he allowed her to be killed
by other humans.

65
00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He wasn't there.

66
00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.918 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[blows]
-He wasn't, no.

67
00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:58.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was traveling, like a human,
at her whim.

68
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not once did he move to protect her.

69
00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not once did he consider
making her a vampire

70
00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and bringing her into our community.

71
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You are loyal to Dracula
and the night world, aren't you?

72
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You would have protected her.

73
00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course I would have.

74
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carmilla] Of course you would.

75
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.617 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Carmilla] But, on some level,

76
00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:32.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he considers us less important
than the brief life of a mistreated pet.

77
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that sound sane to you?

78
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It sounds...

79
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
confused.

80
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And now he has taken us to war.

81
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.812 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Should this war be prosecuted
by a confused man?

82
00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:57.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I-I don't know.

83
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Has it occurred to you that you yourself,
a loyal servant of the night world,

84
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
a prized asset in our lives and wars,

85
00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:12.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-are in fact next to die?
-What?

86
00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're human, Hector.

87
00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You threw in your lot with us because
it was your path to greatness and joy.

88
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But your loyalty counts for nothing

89
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
when a man who has decreed death
to all humans,

90
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
yet would not make his love a vampire,

91
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.143 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
rampages across the face of the earth
in mad fury.

92
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:39.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I ask you again,
does that sound sane to you?

93
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:42.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He promised me that this would be a cull.

94
00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That humans would be reduced
in numbers and controlled.

95
00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He is Dracula, Hector.

96
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why would he tell the truth to a human?

97
00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:54.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Even you?

98
00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:58.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighs]
I just want to do my work, Carmilla.

99
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-I love my work.
-I know you do.

100
00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have a way of ensuring
you will continue to do it.

101
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:12.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You just have to answer
one question for me.

102
00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And what's that?

103
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you prepared to abandon Dracula
to win the war?

104
00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't say something like that
out loud in this place.

105
00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:25.778 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

217
00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:02.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:05.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sleep, then.

219
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A bit lonely.

224
00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.029 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

225
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:38.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's still poking around your family's
things with a look of faint disgust.

226
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:39.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

227
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's lonely even when you're standing

228
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:43.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

230
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.668 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

231
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:52.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's intelligent, sometimes even witty,
in his way.

232
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And he's certainly half-human.

233
00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:58.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
More than half-human.
He's a person in his own right.

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.110 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I can shout at you, or tease you,

238
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.196 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and get a reaction
that lets me know you're still in there.

239
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:21.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:25.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

that Alucard was under the bloody city.

as much as Dracula himself,
