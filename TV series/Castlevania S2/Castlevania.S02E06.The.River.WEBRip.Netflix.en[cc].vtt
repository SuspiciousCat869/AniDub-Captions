00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sypha] I think so.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.907 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I can't do two things at once here.

22
00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm forced to agree.
Do you have a further suggestion?

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.218 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

24
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

26
00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:22.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to fight alongside back in Gresit.

27
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:24.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

29
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:29.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

We're trapped in a box down here.

33
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We will eventually be overwhelmed,
unless we change the nature of the battle.

34
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
