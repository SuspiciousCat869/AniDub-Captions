00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,041
[KAMIJO] Kazakiri!

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,250
Uh, Kazakiri!
Please wake up!

4
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:23,041
[KAZAKIRI whimpers]

5
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,916
[KAMIJO] Ah, thank goodness.

6
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,250
You had me worried...
Are you feeling okay?

7
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,625
[KAZAKIRI] The city...
Look at it!

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,458
[KAZAKIRI] The destruction...

9
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,375
How did things
end up like this...?

10
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,708
I know it must be
all because of me...

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,791
And yet here I am: apparently
the only one left untouched.

12
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,416
No matter what, I'll never
be like everybody else...

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,916
So why did I even have to
be born in the first place?

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,250
The power of the espers
changed things a little...

15
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,666
I was able to exist,
even if it was as a freak...

16
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
And then that girl came along...

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,208
She was kind enough
to call me her friend...

18
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,000
I thought maybe that made me at
least a little bit more human...

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,041
I'm so tired of this!

20
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,250
Will you please
just touch me

21
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,375
and put an end to all of it?

22
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,541
[KAZAKIRI gasps]

23
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,708
[KAZAKIRI] What is it?

24
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,083
Why are you smiling at me?

25
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,958
Because I'm
relieved you're okay.

26
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,083
[KAZAKIRI gasps]

27
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,083
I don't know why I have
this strange power

28
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,583
or where it
comes from. However...

29
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,833
If it meant obliterating one
of my friends with this hand...

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,458
I would chop it off...

31
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,791
That would be better than
losing someone I care about.

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,291
[KAZAKIRI] But... I...

33
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,375
You protected the others,
didn't you...?

34
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,583
You did what you could
to keep everyone safe.

35
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,500
Can't you see, when
all is said and done,

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,541
that's what counts?

37
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,166
You can be proud.
Hold your head up high...

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,458
After fighting so hard for the
sake of complete strangers...

39
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,625
and managing to pull
everyone through...

40
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,625
You have absolutely
nothing to be ashamed of.

41
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,541
[KAZAKIRI sobs]

42
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,041
[KAMIJO] I'm going to look
around and see if there's anyone

43
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,208
out there who needs help.
And then, let's head home.

44
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,500
There's no telling when
you're going to vanish on us.

45
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,583
Before that happens,
you need to meet up with Index.

46
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,916
And don't go asking me why,
okay, I think it should be

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,333
pretty obvious by now.

48
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,458
It's because that's
what friends do.

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,750
Hey...! That was
crazy! You okay?

50
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,208
What was that stuff that
came out of your back...?

51
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,208
It looked a lot like telesma.

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,708
[MIKOTO] Hello...! Wanna tell
me what happened over there...?

53
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,416
Those freaky wings in the sky
seem to have disappeared...

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,875
I'm done here, so if you
need help, I can head your way.

55
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,791
[INDEX] I need to get a doctor
here as soon as possible!

56
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,000

[SHADOWY MAN] Accelerator...
I would like a word with you...

60
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,500
Do you think you can manage?

61
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,333
[ACCELERATOR]
Huh? That was telepathy...

62
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,458
and I have a small amount
of computing power back, too.

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,791
[SHADOWY MAN] How observant...

64
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,500
I made arrangements for
several telepathic espers.

65
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,458
[ACCELERATOR] Whatever.
What do you want?

66
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,291
[SHADOWY MAN] I would like to
talk to you about the series

67
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,791
of disturbances you caused,
as well as the damage

68
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,791
Academy City has suffered
as a result of recent events.

69
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,000
[ACCELERATOR] Is my punishment
to be sliced and diced

70
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,375
for research purposes?

71
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,541
[SHADOWY MAN] That is
one route we could take.

72
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
But how do you like
this idea, instead...?

73
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
Come and work with us.

74
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,791
[ACCELERATOR] Is Academy
City preparing for

75
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
a war or something?

76
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,000
[SHADOWY MAN]
I cannot answer that.

77
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,625
[ACCELERATOR] You can't, huh...?
Then there's only one thing

78
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,416
I'm gonna say...
Screw you and your offer.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,875
[SHADOWY MAN] This is a critical
moment in the life of the city.

80
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,916
We want to ensure
the best outcome possible,

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,125
and for that, we would
like your assistance...

82
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,041
Imagine if Academy City
was completely wiped out...

83
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,250
Is there any other place
for espers like us to go...?

84
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,916
What would we do without
this scientific haven?

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,875
[ACCELERATOR] Tch...
Will you tell me one thing?

86
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,041
[SHADOWY MAN] What is that?

87
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:49,916
[ACCELERATOR]
The name of the person

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,541
responsible for tonight...

89
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,125
I'm going to kill
whoever thought they could

90
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,916
get away with putting
the kid through this.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,750
[SHADOWY MAN] I don't
see how that could help...

92
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,000
He would be a scapegoat,
nothing more.

93
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,041
[ACCELERATOR] You don't say.

94
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,500
[SHADOWY MAN]
So... what will it be?

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,166
[ACCELERATOR] Suit yourself.

96
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,750
[SHADOWY MAN]
An excellent answer.

97
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,750
I look forward to
working with you...

98
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,333
Until then...

99
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,500

[phone beeps]

102
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,791
[ACQUA] That you, Terra?

103
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,208
[TERRA] Yes, Acqua of the Rear,
this is Terra of the Left...

104
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,125
Are you finished
with your current task?

105
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,833
[ACQUA] Vento is
out of commission...

106
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,166
I just recovered her and
ordered the detached squad

107
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,708
in Academy City's
outskirts to stand down.

108
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,666
[TERRA] That sounds
like a good night's work.

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,291
Can you tell me
our next move...?

110
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,291
I have no objections
to lopping off

111
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,041
the target's head if
it should be necessary.

112
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,083
[TERRA] Let's not
take that step yet...

113
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,166
It would be wiser at this point
to hear your entire report

114
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,000
and then reconsider
how best we can

115
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,666
bring about the
fall of Academy City.

116
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,083
[ACQUA] The fall of
Academy City? Heh.

117
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
[TERRA] You don't care
for that idea, Acqua?

118
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,166
Cheap tricks aren't my style...

119
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,416
I find that defeating
the enemy face-to-face

120
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,791
is the simpler and
more honorable method.

121
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,500
[TERRA] It's possible
some of the players on

122
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,583
the opposing side
may still be useful.

123
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,375
The fallen angel,
for example.

124
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,041
[ACQUA] I do not approve of
plundering the battlefield.

125
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,500
[TERRA] You knights pick
inconvenient times to get

126
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,625
prickly about your honor.

127
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,166
I am no knight...
You know quite well

128
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,333
I'm simply a
washed-up mercenary.

129
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,041
[TERRA] Call yourself
whatever you'd like,

130
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,208
it doesn't matter to me...

131
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
Just get Vento back
here immediately...

[phone beeps]

136

[ACQUA] Interesting... I wonder
if Academy City really is

137
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,916
as frail as you seem
to think, Terra...

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
I suppose we'll see, won't we?

139

[FROG DOCTOR]
Good morning, Aleister...

140
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,250
There's something I wish
to discuss with you,

141
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,791
and I hope you'll
take it seriously.

142
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,166
[ALEISTER] Yes, what is it?

143
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,125
[FROG DOCTOR] I want you
to stop treating my patients

144
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,333
like your playthings.

145
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,916
[ALEISTER] Hm... And if
I don't, what will you do?

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,625
[FROG DOCTOR] Those are my
patients and I am their doctor.

147
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,500
Do you understand the
importance of that...?

148
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,250
Do, you, Aleister?

149
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,666
I think you should,
considering that

150
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
I saved your life once.

151
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,583
[ALEISTER] Is that
something you regret?

152
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,208
That can't be a
serious question.

153
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,916
[ALEISTER] My plans
are in motion...

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,208
and I have no intention
of stopping them.

155
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,666
So, I am sorry...
my kind-hearted enemy...

I think the rice is better

Yeah, I know what
you're saying...

Really... it's a miracle
we've even made it this far...

We've all been
pretty lucky.

Everyone has

There've been too many
things I know nothing about...

317
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,666
So I've just left it
all to other people...

but that's over...

I can't afford to do that
anymore... Starting now...

320
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,583
I'm going to explore a world
that's been foreign to me...

nervous to learn about.

Yes... Very sure...

[ACCELERATOR] None of them

You could bring in guns
from all over the world,

and I still might not find one.

359
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,541
[UNABARA] What if you made

with your ability?

00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
That might help you
find the right weapon.

[ACCELERATOR] Stop acting
like such a know-it-all.

It's annoying. My problem is,
this thing is unreliable.

00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,833
I've seen Group's engineering
report on that device...

365
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,416
They've extended your ability
usage time to thirty minutes.

That's a significant
improvement.

So... it's
called Group.

Are you dissatisfied
with the tuning

of your electrode?

Ha...! The use time
could be thirty minutes

A single malfunction means
that I can't fight anymore...

Is that what you came
here to chat about?

Actually, I sought you
out because Group has

377
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,041
received an assignment
from the governing board

Which means the city's
internal defenses

383
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,416
are being thinned out,

I'd be getting stuck with

boring and trivial.

There's something
you really ought to know.

00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,375
The human body is an
incredibly fragile thing.

your words more carefully.

break something you

know more than I do.

Yeah, I know them...

They're an armed
gang made up of

a bunch of sad,
pathetic Level Zeros.

That's correct...
We're getting involved now

414
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,458
because it seems they've
found some new toys.

415
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
What kind of toys?

416
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,583
[UNABARA] They're rockets,
made of hollowed-out wood

with explosives...

If it helps you
form a mental picture,

419
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,458
think of them as
high-tech fire arrows.

420
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,041
Skill Out has been very busy
for the last few days...

421
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,041
getting ready to play with
their new toys, most likely.

422
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,750
They've been taking
abandoned bicycles

423
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,166
and placing them
along emergency routes.

424
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,041
And using piles of
garbage to block up

425
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,500
the sewage drains around
a few certain VIP facilities.

426

Do they take on contracts to
stop children's pranks as well?

430
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,916
[UNABARA] As I was saying,
there have been more than

431
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,250
twenty thousand incidents.

432
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,166
That many will flood the
system, and before long,

433
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,375
the security network will start
classifying them as errors.

434
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,750
So, where do the fancy
fire arrows come in?

435
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,791
That number of erroneous
reports will cause

436
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,750
the server to crash,
and Skill Out will be able

437
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,666
to wreak havoc in the city
without Antiskill even knowing.

438
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,208
[ACCELERATOR] Can't they
just shut down the alerts

439
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,625
that will cause the errors?

440

[UNABARA] If we weren't
getting ready for a war, maybe.

out there who doesn't

have a beef with Academy City?

I couldn't say, but
right now your assignment is

446
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,041
to track down one of
the people who does.

Your target's name
is Ritoku Komaba.

448

This is what he looks like.

He is currently the
leader of Skill Out...

Dispose of him quickly...

Our goal is to derail
Skill Out's plans

before they can
proceed any further.

[ACCELERATOR] Any reason
we're taking a garbage truck?

[UNABARA] You'd be surprised
how handy they are...

455
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,583
It'll be great for
getting rid of the body.

to take out the trash.

466
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,166
I don't know yet.

467
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,541
[ACCELERATOR] Hiding
from security robots...

468
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,125
And using little
tricks to escape

469
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,291
the gaze of
observation satellites.

470
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,250
Well, it's nothing
I'm not used to.

471
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,375
[phone buzzes]

472
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,333
[phone beeps]

473
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,166
That you, Tsuchimikado?

474
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] I figured
your first mission

475
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,833
would be starting soon...

476
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
I just wanted a quick
word before it did.

477
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,791
Let me guess:
a warning...? Yeah...?

478
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,666
Some advice for the
new guy...? What'll it be?

479
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Whatever
you do... don't trust us.

480
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,875
[ACCELERATOR] Huh?

481
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Group is an
organization that can only

482
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,208
function in the shadows.

483
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,208
If word of our
existence got out,

484
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,666
there would be trouble...

485
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,750
We have no inspiring
mission statement

486
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,958
and no noble or lofty goals.

487
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,375
[ACCELERATOR] Did you think
that I would be expecting

488
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,791
some kind of reward
for my service?

489
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,750
[TSUCHIMIKADO] If you do
nothing but play by the rules

490
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,375
established by
the governing board,

491
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,541
you'll never get the
upper hand in this game...

492
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,958
I'm saying there's
one question

493
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,708
you should be asking yourself...

494
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,375
"What do I need to do to win?"

495
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,333
You and I have
something in common...

496
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,000
We both have things to protect.

497
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,208
Was there anything
else you wanted to say?

498
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Finish up
quickly and get back here...

499
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,416
Musujime's got
a job in that area

500
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
and she'll be getting
started pretty soon.

501
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,916
Another Group member?

502
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,041
[rumbling]

503
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,958
No one mentioned anything
about this being a contest.

504
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] The target she
was assigned isn't a person;

505
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,000
it's money.

506
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,375
[ACCELERATOR] Musujime, huh...?

507
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:24,583
I'm surprised she's
fit to take on a job.

508
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] You and
she are ranked the same...

509
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,791
She's been upgraded.

510
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,458
[ACCELERATOR] Oh, has she...?
That's great to hear.

511
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,958
[phone beeps]

512
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,625
What am I waiting for?

513
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,000
Might as well get
started on this job.

514
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,166
[beep]

515
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,708
[ACCELERATOR] It's cleanup time.

516
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,916
I should have this
wrapped up in ten minutes.

517
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,333
[clang]

518
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,208
[SKILL OUT yell]

519
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,625
[MUSUJIME chuckles]

520
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,583
That makes nine...

521
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,333
These guys could
stand to toughen up.

522
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,208
[KOMABA] If we're so weak,
then maybe you should

523
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,333
take it easier on us...
little esper girl.

524
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,708
[MUSUJIME] Heh.
Ritoku Komaba.

525
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,291
This could get sticky.

526
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,083
It looks like I accidentally
ran into the target first.

527
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,541
[KAMIJO] Members of Group
and Skill Out clash...

528
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,166
Misaka's mom gets caught
in the middle of the chaos...

529
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,166
and Accelerator
and I meet once again.

530
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,875
Next time, "Skill Out."

531
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,875
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
