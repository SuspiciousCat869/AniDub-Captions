eat the food I offer.

311
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,791
[YOSHIKAWA] Yeah, as
long as I don't have to

312
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,208
know how it's made.

313
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,041
[LAST ORDER] "Wow! You've
got a lot of rice cookers!

314
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,333
Why are there so many?"
asks Misaka Misaka,

315
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,541
counting all of them.

316
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,083
[YOMIKAWA] The rice
cooker is nothing short

317
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,041
of a modern day miracle!

318
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,083
Oh well. [sighs]

319
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,708
[UIHARU] Hey, Misaka!

320
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,250
[MIKOTO] How's it goin', Uiharu?

321
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,541
Good, thanks. I'm just
here to meet up with Shirai.

322
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,750
You know how it is at Judgment.

323
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,291
They're always
keeping me so busy.

324
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,625
[MIKOTO] Yeah. Of course.

325
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,541
Shirai, too. As a matter
of fact, she's even shoved

326
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,250
some of her workload
onto m--I mean, uh.

327
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,708
She's especially busy
because she's so competent.

328
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,666
Well, I guess I
beat her here, huh?

329
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,166
Yeah, it looks like it.

330
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,500
[UIHARU] So, how are things
going for you at Tokiwadai?

331
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,750
Huh?

332
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,208
I hear they're teaching
you to play the violin.

333
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,750
That's so cool!

334
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,541
[MIKOTO] It's not that big a
deal. You wanna give it a try?

335
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:01,916
Huh?

336
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,041
[MIKOTO] There. Support
the instrument between your

337
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,666
collarbone and jaw.
Gently hold the neck with

338
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,458
your left hand, like this.

339
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,958
Hold the bow so the
strings are perpendicular,

340
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,791
and then slowly pull it.

341
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,291
[violin]

342
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,750
See? Simple, isn't it?

343
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,958
It's amazing.
And you know...

344
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,583
I almost feel
like I'm in a dream.

345
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,833
You're a great teacher!

346
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,625
Ah! Uh!

347
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,750
[MIKOTO] What's the matter?

348
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,916
[trembling]

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,666
[KUROKO] Uiharu!

350
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,625
[screams]

351
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,291
[KUROKO] What do you think
you're doing? We've got work!

352
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,708
Hey, I know
I'm late. Sorry!

353
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,833
[MIKOTO] Sorry, huh?
If this is how you make good

354
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,291
on all your bets, you're
a dirty, welshing rat!

355
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,416
Do you really think I don't
have anything better to do

356
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
than wait here for over an hour?

357
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
Well, no. I didn't
mean to be late.

358
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
I got caught up--Wait, an hour?

359
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,083
But I'm pretty sure we agreed
on one o'clock, didn't we?

360
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,875
Hang on, did you show up thirty
minutes early or something?

361
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
[KAMIJO] Wow, you have
been here a long time.

362
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,083
I, uh. I was in the
area anyway, so I figured

363
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,208
I would just wait here
until you showed up.

364
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,083
In the area. I see.

365
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,791
Well, I was, uh, shopping.

366
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
You're so eager to see
me suffer you showed up

367
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,833
thirty minutes early.

368
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,333
Huh?

369
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,708
[KAMIJO] You really get off
on other people's pain, huh?

370
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
[grunts]

371
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
You almost got me.

372
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,000
Stop complaining so much!

373
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
You lost a bet,
now it's time to pay.

374
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,000
You agreed to
do whatever I said!

375
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,541
Yeah. About that.

376
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,458
Could we be more
specific about "whatever"?

377
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,125
You will do what I say.

378
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,208
[MIKOTO] Now, come with me!

379
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,541
[KAMIJO] Where are we going?

380
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,083
[MIKOTO] Just come along
and do it without talking.

381
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,666
That's the first penalty!

382
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,458
[KAMIJO] The first? You
mean there's more than one?

383
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,958
[KAMIJO] The Handy
Antenna service?

384
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,166
Ah. I see where this is going.

385
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,041
You're looking to replace
the antenna base on your cell.

386
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,125
Yep. Subscribers
can use them to create

387
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,958
their own networks
and everything.

388
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,875
[MIKOTO] Also, if you
sign a couples' contract,

389
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,000
the rate is
substantially cheaper.

390
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,333
A couples' contract?

391
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,750
Yeah but wait there's
more, everybody who signs

392
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,958
a contract right now will get

393
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,166
a Lovely Mitten
Gekota strap for free!

394
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Huh?

395
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,125
That's where you come in.

396
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,000
We're going to
sign up today.

397
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,708
[sighs] All you really want
out of this is the strap.

398
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,125
Don't you have enough
cartoon frog stuff already?

399
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,166
Uh!

400
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,625
You are signing
up with me today.

401
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,958
Yeah, okay. But isn't
a couples' contract

402
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,875
usually something that
a boyfriend and girlfriend

403
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,166
would sign up for.

404
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,000
What? Oh, please!
You're jumping to conclusions!

405
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,375
It has to be
a boy and a girl.

406
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,041
But I don't think that
means you actually

407
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,875
have to be going
out or anything.

408
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,500
For example, I'm sure they'd
sign up a married couple.

409
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,000
Marriage, now?

410
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,458
I think this relationship
is moving too quickly for me.

411
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,833
You--You shut up! I'm
in charge and we've got

412
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,791
a contract to sign! C'mon.

413
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,375
Ah...

414
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,750
Okay! That's about it.

415
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,166
We just need a photograph
to complete the paperwork.

416
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,833
Oh, you mean
like a picture ID?

417
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,375
[FEMALE CLERK 17A]
No, something that proves to us

418
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,791
that you really are a couple.

419
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,666
It doesn't have
to be anything fancy.

420
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,625
You can use your
cell if you want to.

421
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,625
Wait, together?

422
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,791
[KAMIJO] So, uh. Want to
use the camera on my phone?

423
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,916
[MIKOTO] Sure, that'll work.

424
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,333
Okay, then, here we go.

425
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,708
Just so we're absolutely
clear about this,

426
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,000
you're the one who wants
this contract so badly.

427
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,791
I am. I know that, thank you.

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,875
I'll do this for you, Gekota!

429
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,208
Well, here we go.

430
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,583
[MIKOTO] Let's do it.
Whenever you're ready.

431
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,708
[phone beeps]

432
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,458
[KAMIJO] It looks like
you're just joking around.

433
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,291
[MIKOTO] What about you?
Looking the other way.

434
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,583
Probably not what
a couple looks like.

435
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,166
Yeah, you're right.
Let's try it again.

436
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,875
[phone beeps]

437
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
[KAMIJO] You're making the exact
same face that you made before!

438
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,666
Please! You look
like you'd rather be

439
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,500
poking your eyes
out with a fork!

440
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,208
This is only gonna work
if we can get a photo

441
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,541
of us that makes it
look like we're in love!

442
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,208
Proximity should help.

443
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,041
[KAMIJO] Now, just smile!
This is only a picture

444
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,416
for some paperwork, right?

445
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,875
As long as we think
about it that way,

446
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,250
it shouldn't be a problem.

447
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,333
Right. You're right.
We can totally pull this off.

448
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,541
[MIKOTO]
It just has to look like

449
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,958
we have feelings for each other.

450
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,750
It isn't like it's
real or anything!

451
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,666
[KAMIJO] Say cheese!

452
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,666
[MIKOTO] Cheese!

453
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,125
[phone beeps]

454
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,583
[KUROKO] Haaa!

455
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,375
It's my fault. I have no
one to blame but myself.

456
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,458
I underestimated
this talking baboon

457
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,375
and now here you are,
traipsing around town

458
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,208
and taking dirty
photographs with him.

459
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,000
No! You've got the
wrong idea about this!

460
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,250
I'm only using him to get a
Gekota phone accessory, okay?

461
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,375
And we had to take a photo
pretending to be a couple.

462
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,750
[KUROKO screams]

463
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,916
What are you thinking?

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,416
If you needed to
