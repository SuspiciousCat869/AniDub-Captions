he was actually killed, Kami?

[KAMIJO] You mean it

He was speared

[TSUCHIMIKADO] The Stab

significance of the crucifixion
and spearing and amplifies,

But for a saint,
things are different.

A single strike from
it, and she's dead.

Obviously, it's
no ordinary weapon.

[TSUCHIMIKADO] It's not about
which side will actually win.

It's about the illusion of

That's when wars

[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Because outside magicians

she must be at
the center of it.

If she so much
as lifts a finger,

They'll descend on her like a
plague of malnourished locusts.

Uh.

469
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,666
[FUKIYOSE] Okay.

470
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,583
[FUKIYOSE] Come on, already!

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,583
[FUKIYOSE] Out of
curiosity, do you find

472
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,458
the sports festival boring?

473
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,916
[KAMIJO] Huh?

474
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,708
[FUKIYOSE] You just seem
erratic and distracted today.

475
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,333
Like your mind is on
something else entirely.

476
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,166
And if you find it
boring, then it's at least

477
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,833
partially my fault, as a member
of the steering committee.

478
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,458
We were the ones
who organized it.

479
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,500
Maybe I failed you and
all the rest of the students.

480
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,250
I swear I don't find the
Daihasei Festival boring.

481
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,916
It's just that I spent
a lot of time helping

482
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,541
to plan everything for this.
I worked really hard.

483
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,250
I just want to make
sure everybody who comes

484
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:44,208
enjoys it as much
as possible, you know?

485
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,541
Maybe that's a
little selfish of me.

486
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,333
Ugh. I don't
know why I try,

487
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,541
you're not even listening.

488
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,500
I am, though; really!

489
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,875
[GIRL STUDENT] Oh, sorry!

490
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,708
[BOTH] Uh.

491
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,041
Get away from me
right now, you pig!

492
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,375
Ah!

493
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,375
Oh!

494
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,125
Waaahaha!

495
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm really sorry!

496
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm not accustomed to
being around so many people.

497
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,916
Nah...

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,750
[WOMAN] Are you
alright? Did I hurt you?

499
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,625
Your forehead's
turning a little red.

500
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,916
No, I, uh...

501
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry again for
running into you.

502
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,500
Shake? Or maybe you
would prefer a kiss?

503
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,541
Yeah, sure!
I kiss sounds--

504
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,958
[KAMIJO] Never mind.

505
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,416
Well then.

506
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,125
[gasps]

507
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,583
Excuse me.
I really do need to be

508
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,083
getting back to
work. Good-bye now!

509
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,708
Hello, are you there?

510
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,875
This is Oriana
Thomson checking in.

511
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,208
[ORIANA] Can you hear me?

512
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,833
[LIDVIA] Do not
use your real name.

513
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,416
Especially not when
you're within earshot

514
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
of who knows how many people.

515
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,916
That's not our main concern.

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,291
I've run into some trouble.

517
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,791
You know that oh-so-helpful
spell you used on me?

518
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,333
Well, it appears that
it's no longer working.

519
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,500
[LIDVIA] Why? What happened?

520
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,916
I'm not sure,
but you know...

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,958
I'm feeling sort of naked now.

522
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,625
[LIDVIA] I'm not interested
in your lewd observations.

523
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,916
What will you do?

524
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,416
Give me a sec.
Before I do anything else,

525
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,791
I'll need to find
a way to give this boy

526
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
who's following me the slip.

527
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:36,000
♪ [Ending Song] ♪

528
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,041
[KAMIJO] A game of cat and
mouse, but which one is which?

529
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,250
Catching Oriana is so
important that Stiyl is

530
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,583
willing to risk his life.
But will we succeed?

531
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,541
Next time, "Route Disturb."

532
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,791
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
