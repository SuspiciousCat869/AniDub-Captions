Oh, and one more thing.

477
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,750
A girl was here looking
for you and asked me to

478
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,416

Seemed important.

Is that the whole story?

[TSUCHIMIKADO] Yeah.
You know, if you want a full

can always ask the Amakusa.

that's necessary.

[TSUCHIMIKADO] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, anyway, you sure

Kami won't know what hit him!

I think you're taking this
a little too far, don't you?

And if you do own
an outfit like that,

I really don't
want to know why!
