Her ability is
called Move Point.

able to relocate objects

looks like she's no good

she seems to have hesitations
about teleporting herself.

329
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,541
Likely because she was badly
hurt doing so two years ago.

330
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,041
[UIHARU] And one more thing,

And as for their identity,

00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,083
[UIHARU] it says
they're couriers who were

hired by School District 23.

Apparently a
psychometrist was called in

but as to what's
