00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,541
[TSUCHIMIKADO] You fools have
grown complacent in peacetime.

314
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,625
Better wake up
if you wanna live.

315
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,041
Sorry. Too late.

316
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,000
[ORIANA] Well, that
takes care of that.

317
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,916
Hm? Impossible! The barrier
has been disrupted?

318
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
What's wrong?
You surprised the

319
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,500
"rough and tumble bad boy"
brought down your barrier?

320
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,125
[ORIANA] I guess I
spoke to soon, huh?

321
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,875
You can handle a lot more than
your appearance would suggest.

322
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,666
[TSUCHIMIKADO] I have to make
sure word of what's happened

323
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,375
here reaches a wider audience.

324
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,333
Hmph... Silly boy, if those
two friends of yours show up,

325
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,791
I can easily deal with them.

326
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,875
[TSUCHIMIKADO] They're not
the ones I'm talking about.

327
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,000
What are you getting at?

328
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Are you that dense...?

329
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,083
Do you think there
aren't other members

330
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,625
of Necessarius I can
call upon for help?

331
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,125
[ORIANA laughs]

332
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,041
Do you honestly expect me to
believe such an idle threat?

333
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,166
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Heh, heh...

334
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,000
Tsukebumi Tamazusa--

335
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,875
usually an accessory
spell designed to

336
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,791
make its target see illusions...

337
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,000
But, depending on
how it's used...

338
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,958
[ORIANA]
A communications spell?

339
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,208
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Now that we know
you don't have the Stab Sword,

340
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,875
there's no reason
for us to have such

341
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,083
a powerful weapon
sitting out of the game.

342
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,833
Yes--I mean Kaori Kanzaki!

343
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,291
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Did you stop
to consider the possibility

344
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,000
there would be
a saint nearby...?

345
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,666
As it happens, Kanzaki has some

346
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,875
personal friends
here in Academy City.

347
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,125
However strong you might be,
I seriously doubt

348
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,375
she's someone you'd
want to piss off.

349
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,708
Give up already!

350
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,291
I destroyed the search spell,

351
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,125
which was my primary objective
in tracking you down.

352
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,708
[ORIANA] It would be foolish
to linger any longer

353
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:01,125
just to trade blows with
a pathetic teenage boy.

354
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,458
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Damn,
that was close.

355
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,791
I would have liked to see
Kanzaki take her down...

356
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,750
Of course, that show down was
never going to happen today...

357
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,958
Not with this.

358
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,416
Not with a fake
Tsukebumi Tamazusa.

359
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,958
I can't believe
she fell for it,

360
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:24,000
but I'm sure glad she did...
Well, time to get moving.

361
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,875
So much for that...

362
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,833
and another search
spell won't work...

363
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,666
Time to make a phone call.

364
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,416
[phone rings]

365
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Tsuchimikado?

366
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,333
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
So, here's the deal.

367
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,708
Thanks to a little bluff I made,

368
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,458
Oriana should be
trying to get out of here

369
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,708
as quickly as possible.

370
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,041
[phone beeps]

371
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,666
The closest thing to
your location is the subway.

372
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,333
She could be headed there.

373
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,708
Looks like I've lost my shadows.

374
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,916
The time for the Croce
di Pietro preparations

375
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,791
is still a ways off.

376
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,250
However shall I amuse myself?

377
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,583
[ORIANA] Coming up with some
spells to use against a saint

378
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,916
could be an interesting
way to pass the time.

379
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,708
Hurry! We'll have
to take a short cut

380
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,208
if we want to be in time---

381
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,833
[HIMEGAMI] Ah! You should really
watch where you're walking.

382
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,125
I am a complete mess now!

383
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,333
I am, so sorry!
I didn't mean to!

384
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,041
Oh...! And what about you?
Are you all right, miss?

385
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,041
[ORIANA] Uh... Yes.
Don't worry, I'm just fine.

386
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,541
I think your friend's definitely
worse off than I am right now.

387
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,750
Ah! She's not kidding!
You're soaking wet!

388
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,583
I can see right through
your shirt, Himegami,

389
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,083
[HIMEGAMI] Yes, and
I would appreciate it

390
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,583
if you'd please stop looking.

391
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:40,791
[ORIANA gasps]

392
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,875
[ORIANA] A Celtic cross...!
Necessarius?!

393
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,375
[KOMOE] Is it that bad?

394
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,583
Are you okay...?
You're really shivering!

395
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,500
[screaming]

396
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,000
[KAMIJO] The closest transfer
point to us is...

397
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,208
Looks like it's a bus stop

398
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,833
about three hundred
meters north of here.

399
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,541
Three hundred, huh?

400
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:13,250
[crowd murmurs]

401
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,166
What is that smell?

402
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,625
Hey... What's going on?!

403
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,375
Oh... It's awful.

404
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,833
Miss Komoe,
What's the problem?

405
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,583
[KAMIJO] Himegami, no...!
What happened to her?!

406
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,375
[KOMOE] We were walking,
and we bumped into this woman...

407
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,958
First she was nice...
Then she made this scary face,

408
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,208
and the next thing I know--
poor Himegami!

409
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,333
It was Oriana.

410
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,416
Why would she
do this...?

411
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,750
What's the point of
attacking Himegami?

412
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,708
Do you see that?

413
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,791
The "Walking Church" she
wears around her neck...

414
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,541
it's a very special item.

415
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,375
Oriana must've taken
it to mean she was

416
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,416
a member of Necessarius
and concluded that

417
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,208
Himegami was chasing her.

418
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,875
It was a mistake?

419
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,875
She did all this to Himegami...

420
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:57,916
and you're telling me it was

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
because of some
misunderstanding?!

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,291
T-P-I-M-I-M-S-P-F-T.

423
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,333
[STIYL] An ambulance
has been called, yes?

424
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,541
You should wait for them at
the entrance to the path...

425
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,000
They won't be able
to see you here.

426
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,375
Hold on!

427
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,791
What is it?

428
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,541
She got caught up in this
and injured because of us!

429
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,625
And we're just supposed
to leave her here?!

430
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,375
[STIYL] What do you think
you can do for her?

431
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,583
Exactly how
arrogant are you?

432
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,916
[STIYL] She's severely injured.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,625
There's not a damn
thing you can do!

434
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,500
There's one way we
can be useful now...

435
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,875
That's by going
after Oriana.

436
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,375
[STIYL] If you really
want to help people,

437
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,750
learn to accept
your limitations...

438
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,416
Your right hand has the
power to destroy illusions.

439
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,625
But as far as I know,
it doesn't have the power

440
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,125
to make people whole again.

441
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,041
[KAMIJO] Ugh!

442
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,208
This is so screwed up!

443
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,208
You can rage all you
want, but don't think

444
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,333
you're the only
one who's angry.

445
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,375
What are you doing
with those things?

446
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm not sure, exactly,
but it seemed...

447
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,416
to help the
sister... before.

448
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,958
Wait a minute...
you don't mean...

449
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,041
[KOMOE] I don't get it.
Why isn't she getting better?

450
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,791
Shouldn't it be helping by now?

451
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,000
I can't believe this.
A few minutes ago,

452
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,458
we were talking about
the night parade...

453
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,666
and now she's...

454
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,833
[STIYL] That won't work.
You've got it wrong.

455
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,208
Think of it as trying to
carry water in a bucket...

456
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,458
You're not going
to get very far if

457
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,833
the bucket you're using
has holes in it, right?

458
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,166
[STIYL] Listen up, Kamijo...

459
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,541
I want you to go after Oriana.

460
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,458
You mean that...
you're gonna try to...?

461
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,083
Don't expect
any miracles...

462
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,458
This isn't my area
of expertise, either.

463
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,500
We're going to use the
knowledge your teacher gained

464
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
from her time with the
List of Prohibited Books

465
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,791
[STIYL] to do what we can.

466
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,875
But if you want this whole
situation to be resolved

once and for all, you need to
leave us behind and stop Oriana.

468
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,666
All right. I'll go.

Stiyl... you take care of her!

00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,916
[STIYL] Hm.

471
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,541
I'm sorry, Himegami...
I promise I'll try to come

472
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,416
visit you before the
night parade begins.

473
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,125
So you'd better hang
in there for me, okay?

[KAMIJO] Finally,
I've learned the secret

476
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,791
of the Croce di Pietro...

477
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,625
Oriana must be in the spot
where the cross will be used...

478
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,666
But... where exactly is that?

479
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,583
Next time, "Belvedere."

When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
