00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:38,333
And I got you involved
in the situation

316
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,041
without ever asking if
that's what you even wanted.

317
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,125
Heya, Kami!

318
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,791
How is the patient doing?

319
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,708
[TSUCHIMIKADO] I brought
you some pudding to snack on,

320
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,000
just in case
the hospital ran out.

321
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,875
Oh! Hello there, missy.

322
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,791
You came to offer
Kami your sincere

323
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,875
and abject apologies,
didn't you?

324
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,708
And I bet you're
being super cheesy,

325
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,041
"I owe you a greater
debt than I can pay."

326
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,291
Or "Ask anything of me!"
I'm right, huh?

327
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,250
That's what you're
about to do, isn't it?

328
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,500
[laughing]

329
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,500
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
Yeah! Like you don't know

330
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,250
what he's gonna ask for!

331
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,916
Ughhh! Don't be stupid!

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,875
Oh, come on now. There's no
need to play the coy ingénue.

333
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,583
Huh? I've never
been coy in my life!

334
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,500
And just what the
hell is an ingénue?

335
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,958
Whoa! Wait, so you
mean you were gonna

336
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,375
offer him your body
with no pretense at all?

337
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,541
I gotta say, that's
refreshingly direct.

338
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,541
[KANZAKI]
Shut up and get out. Now!

339
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,166
[breathing heavy]

340
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,416
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Okay, okay. I
don't want to be a third wheel.

341
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,333
You're not a third
wheel! Get back here!

342
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,125
[KAMIJO] Hey, sorry, but...

343
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,166
Uh. I sort of wanted to,
you know, double check.

344
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,458
All of that stuff
Tsuchimikado was talking about,

345
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,500
he was really just
messing with you, right?

346
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,166
About owing me a
great debt or something?

347
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,375
I do owe you.

348
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,250
After everything that's
happened, how could I not?

349
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,000
I always seem to ask
you to place so much

350
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,041
responsibility on
your own shoulders.

351
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,166
Even when the matter at hand
does not directly concern you.

352
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,791
[KANZAKI] I think we're way
past the point where a simple

353
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,208
"Thanks for your help" will
settle things between us.

354
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,458
Yeah? 'Cause, I don't
really see it that way.

355
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,416
[KAMIJO] We had a
problem and we solved it.

356
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,916
That's all that
matters, isn't it?

357
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,458
"We" had a problem?

358
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,541
Huh? That's right;
me and the Amakusa.

359
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,416
Oh, and the English
Puritans, too, I guess.

360
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,708
And of course we shouldn't
forget Orsola, Index, and Stiyl.

361
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,208
And you, obviously.

362
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,875
[KAMIJO] I think that's pretty
much who "we" are right now.

363
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,083
[KAMIJO] The division
between English Puritan

364
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,625
and Roman Orthodox
means a lot to you.

365
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,333
But for an outsider like me,

366
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,791
the differences
are hard to pick out.

367
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,416
[KAMIJO] I mean, to
be completely honest,

368
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,250
it's not like I'm really on the
side of the English Puritans.

369
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,666
It's a lot more
accurate to say

370
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,000
that I'm on Index's side,
which just so happens

371
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,708
to align me with
the Puritans for now.

372
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,958
Really. It's likely
that if Agnese

373
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,291
asked for my help,
I would give it to her.

374
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,583
She may have been
on the wrong side

375
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,291
of things this time around,

376
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,041
but there's no rule
saying she has to stay

377
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,708
on the wrong side, is there?

378
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,416
[KAMIJO] Everyone can change.

379
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,916
[STIYL] The Roman Orthodox
Church plans to wash its hands

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,708
of all responsibility for
this by declaring it the work

381
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:14,416
of a rogue militant faction
led by Agnese Sanctis.

382
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,916
[STIYL] They're maintaining that
it was never their intention

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,833
to assassinate
Orsola for her supposed

384
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,583
knowledge of
"The Book of the Law."

385
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,708
[LAURA] Well, at the very least,
they'll still receive some

386
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,833
criticism for failing to
keep their people in line.

387
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,291
[STIYL] Looking back, I think
you were fully aware of

388
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,083
the Roman Orthodoxy's
true intentions all along.

389
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,375
In which case, why didn't
you brief me about what was

390
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,250
really going on instead
of sending me into it blind?

391
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,625
That would have been nice.

392
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,625
[LAURA] I didn't
really know everything.

393
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,041
I had no idea that Orsola's
decryption method was incorrect.

394
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,916
But things worked out anyway,

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,125
regardless of what
you were briefed on.

396
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,666
[LAURA] Think about it, Stiyl.
If you and the others had

397
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,083
indeed failed to rescue
Orsola from Agnese's people,

398
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,291
would the outcome really
have been all that different?

399
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,916
If she had been taken
back to the Church,

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,458
she would have been executed.

401
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,625
Instead, she was saved and
her decryption proved faulty.

402
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,666
Regardless of the
outcome for Orsola,

403
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,750
"The Book of the Law" would
never have been deciphered.

404
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,125
[STIYL] If you truly didn't
care, why did you personally

405
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,500
request that the crucifix go
to Orsola? Say what you will,

406
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,541
but saving her was always
part of your plan, wasn't it?

407
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,250
[LAURA]
No! It certainly was not!

408
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,041
The nun doesn't concern me.

409
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,583
I only got involved
because it was

410
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,833
in the interest of the
English Puritan Church.

411
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,750
[STIYL] And that
interest would be?

412
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,833
[LAURA] Kaori Kanzaki.

413
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,375
[LAURA] Because Kanzaki
possesses tremendous power and

414
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,333
a well-developed
sense of justice,

415
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,541
she is the kind of person who
is likely to act on her own.

416
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,625
As a matter of fact,
she came very close

417
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,666
to crossing the line this time.

418
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,458
You received the
reports about what happened

419
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,875
to those poor fools in the
knight's order, did you not?

420
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,083
[STIYL] Yes.

421
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,041
[LAURA] So then, you
understand why we need

422
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,208
a means of controlling her.

423
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,750
And where Kanzaki is concerned,
a threat is more likely

424
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,791
to provoke her than to
ensure her good behavior.

425
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,250
Better by far that we offer
to take the Amakusa into

426
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,291
our protection in exchange
for her cooperation.

427
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:11,000
[LAURA] You see? It all
worked out according to plan.

428
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,250
[STIYL] She is
one sly little vixen.

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,958
♪ [Ending Song] ♪
