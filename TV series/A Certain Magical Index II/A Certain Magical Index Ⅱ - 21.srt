1
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,958
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Three is for
heaven, four is for earth,

2
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,083
and twelve represents
the entire world.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,166
You attach meaning to specific
numbers like that, don't you?

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,791
The practice of
numerological divination.

5
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,458
It's a very useful system,
but it didn't start

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,333
with the church of the cross.

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,958
In fact, the ancient Greeks used
it back in Pythagoras' day.

8
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,333
Which would make
that date BCE.

9
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO] That's a bit
earlier in history than you guys

10
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,041
usually like to dabble.

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,541
[screech]

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,291
There's no point getting
involved in a drawn-out battle.

13
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,500
It's quite a shame, really.

14
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,416
A finely-wrought
spell like this.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,541
It nearly breaks my
heart to destroy it.

16
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,750
[grunts]


17
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,250
[ACCELERATOR] I'm screwed if
I have to fight too many times.

18
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,000
[ACCELERATOR] I don't have
even four solid minutes of

19
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,375
ability mode left on this thing.

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
[ACCELERATOR] I plan on
using them well, though.

21
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,625
Whatever else,
I'm gonna save the kid.

22
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,916
[MAN] The whole building is
clear. There's nobody around.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,250
It's all here in the report.

24
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,125
It's because we're
under a terrorist threat.

25
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,166
They evacuated the staff and
the patients temporarily;

26
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,375
all of 'em.

27
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,833
Which means they're
onto us, then.

28
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,125
Yeah, not good for us.

29
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:50,416
[phone ringing]

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,916
What d'you think?
Could it be a trap?

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,708
Doubt it. I haven't
spotted any wires

32
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,125
or infrared anywhere.

33
00:03:55,208 --> 00:04:03,041
[phone ringing]

34
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,125
[FROG DOCTOR] About time.
It took you long enough.

35
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
Heaven Canceller?

36
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,041
[FROG DOCTOR] We're in a hurry,
so I'll keep this brief.

37
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,416
Leave Kihara behind and get
yourselves out of there.

38
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,333
If you don't go, your
lives will be in danger.

39
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,291
Leave now? Are you serious?

40
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,791
[FROG DOCTOR] Accelerator is
headed in your direction.

41
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,291
[sighs]

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,416
[FROG DOCTOR] Trust me when
I say he's not holding back.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
You should steer clear of
him if you value your life.

44
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,791
It's that simple.

45
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,625
Heh. You're overreacting.

46
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,791
[FROG DOCTOR] Very well.
Try to stay alive.

47
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
If you're still breathing,
I can save you.

48
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,041
[HOUND DOG screams]

49
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,208
[laughs]

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,666
[coughs]

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,666
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER] We are
currently receiving reports from

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,083
all over the country of people
suddenly losing consciousness.

53
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,000
Law enforcement
officers say they are

54
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,208
identifying the cause
as swiftly as they can.

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,250
The phenomenon does not appear
to be limited to our country...

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,250
It appears to be spreading
to other countries as well.

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,875
[VENTO] All we really
needed was to have

58
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,750
Academy City under our control.

59
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,916
[phone buzzes]

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,708
Last Order's calling?

61
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,750
No, it must be Kihara.

62
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,125
[KAMIJO] Oh, good! I didn't
think I was gonna reach anyone.

63
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,000
[ACCELERATOR] I've heard this
voice somewhere before.

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
[KAMIJO] I've been going through
and calling all the numbers

65
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,875
in Last Order's cell phone.

66
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,500
You're the only one
who answered so far.

67
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,250
You probably don't
know the situation,

68
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
but to put it plainly,
she and I could really

69
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,666
use some help right about now.

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,166
[KAMIJO] Last Order's in danger.

71
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,000
What exactly
is the situation?

72
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,583
[ACCELERATOR] You had to split
up at the restaurant, huh?

73
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,625
I can take care of all
this from here on out.

74
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,541
You're all done.
Just get rid of that phone

75
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,458
and go back to your
regularly scheduled life.

76
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
Sorry, but that's
not happening.

77
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,583
I'll help save her.
Just tell me what to do.

78
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,500
Okay, fine. You know that huge
bridge in School District 7?

79
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,625
Last Order and I set that
as our rendezvous point

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,208
in case
anything happened.

81
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,958
If she's still on the run,
that's the first place

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,666
she'll be headed.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
Okay. I'll go there!

84
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,125
Something is going
on in Academy City.

85
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,833
There have been some
strange intruders

86
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,291
coming in from the outside.

87
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,458
Meanwhile, people here

88
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,875
are dropping like flies,
Antiskill included.

89
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,458
This attack seems fairly
indiscriminate so far.

90
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,833
So watch your back, okay?

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,416
Tch. Just keeps
getting better.

92
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,625
[KAMIJO] I'm sorry about this.
I never should have let her

93
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,041
go out there on her own.

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,083
Well, you're not
the only one.

95
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,250
I just meant to leave the
kid alone for five minutes,

96
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,666
and look what happened.

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,208
[HOUND DOG A] We've lost
contact with multiple squads.

98
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,583
[AMATA] Which means...

99
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,791
Either they ran
away or they're dead.

100
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,083
Whatever the case, I'll be
collecting all their hearts

101
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,916
when we're done here.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,375
[AMATA] Have you recovered
the group we sent out as decoys

103
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,291
when that woman got in our way?

104
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,583
[HOUND DOG A] Yes.

105
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,166
We're not completely sure
what happened, sir.

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Their oxygen levels had
dropped extremely low.

107
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,166
Sounds like some kind
of induced asphyxia.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
[sighs]

109
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,166
That woman's responsible.

110
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,333
Damn her! If she's
the reason our boys

111
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,791
are out cold, we'll
teach her a less--

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,666
[AMATA] Huh?

113
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,541
[HOUND DOGS chatter]

114
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,625
[AMATA] Her again, but how
is she locating her targets?

115
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,208
Not with science. Is it magic?

116
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,666
Listen up, Hound Dogs.
Whatever else is going on,

117
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,166
our plans haven't changed.
Is the Testament rig ready?

118
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
[HOUND DOG B] Yes, sir.

119
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
[HOUND DOG B] Right here.

120
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,541
[ACCELERATOR pained exhale]

121
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,708
I've seen that before.
It belongs to her.

122
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:47,625
[phone buzzes]

123
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,750
[AMATA] Hey, Accelerator!
How're things going?

124
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,625
[laughs]

125
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,791
[ACCELERATOR] I'm a little busy.
Was there something you wanted?

126
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,583
[AMATA] Well,
I was just wondering

127
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,166
if you'd found the present
I left behind for you.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,333
If not, you should
keep your eyes open.

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,541
It's a small bit of fabric
from a child's shirt.

130
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,583
On a totally different subject,

131
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,125
Testament is really
something else, huh?

132
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,666
It just isn't normal to cram

133
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,208
a virus right into a
person's head, you know?

134
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,375
[laughs]

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,000
[ACCELERATOR]
So, what kind of reaction

136
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
are you expecting from me?

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,083
[AMATA] Huh?

138
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,541
Am I supposed to start shaking
and laugh a crazy laugh?

139
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,583
Or what?

140
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,750
[AMATA] You should be careful.

141
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,375
I'm the one holding
all the cards.

142
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,250
The kid's life is in my hands.

143
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,666
Heh! So why haven't you
gotten around to killing her,

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,750
I wonder? Were you
given an order

145
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,416
from the people who hired you?

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,250
Was it that standard line about
not damaging the merchandise?

147
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,291
I know you're not always
good at following directions.

148
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,916
Your bosses must
be hardcore.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Can't believe they've got
you shaking in your boots

150
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,833
at the thought of hurting
a little kid like her.

151
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,541
[AMATA] She will die.

152
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,791
[ACCELERATOR] Not yet she won't.
I know that bastard.

153
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
After everything I've said
to him, he should have

154
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,625
at least taken one of
her eyes out already,

155
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,666
and that's if he
was in a good mood.

156
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,583
Since he hasn't, that
can mean only one thing.

157
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:08,291
Well, well. Amata Kihara's

lose control and self-destruct.

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,875
Hey, wait--!

314
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,333
I don't think so.

315
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,666
[MIKOTO] This'll be easier
if you don't try to stop me!

316
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,458
[HOUND DOG C groans]
What was that?

317
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,625
Watch out!
They're armed!

318
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,666
[MIKOTO]
Don't forget our bet, now.

319
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,000
The penalty game's in effect
for the rest of the day,

320
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
so your next task is to
go rescue your friends

321
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,791
and then come back here.
You understand?

322
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,166
Yeah, I understand.

323
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,083
Try not to wreck the entire
city while we're gone.

324
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:46,958
All of a sudden, I'm in
an extremely foul mood.

325
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,083
[INDEX] You're pretty quiet.
What's going through your head?

326
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
Is it that magician from
the Right Seat of God

327
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,958
you fought before?

328
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,375
Yeah, it is. I want to
know how she knocked

329
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,208
all those people unconscious.

330
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,458
[KAMIJO] And if there's
anyway to reverse the effects.

331
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,291
Well, my guess, is it's
Divine Retribution.

332
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,708
[KAMIJO] What does that mean?

333
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,875
[INDEX] Its potency comes from
one very strong emotion.

334
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,125
The person who feels it can
take out multiple targets,

335
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:11,000
regardless of location or
range. It's very powerful.

336
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,416
When you fought her, did
you get any indication of

337
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,833
what she might
have been feeling?

338
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,208
Did she seem to be projecting
one particular emotion

339
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,041
to the exclusion
of all others?

340
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,541
Let me think.
A particular emotion.

341
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,875
[KAMIJO] Disgust. No,
hostility, or animosity.

342
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,000
You mean that's it?
So then her anger is

343
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,875
the key to making
her magic function?

344
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,958
[INDEX] Yeah. As for
the people who have been

345
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,875
knocked unconscious,
I don't think they'll be able

346
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,791
to recover until the magician
decides that Divine Retribution

347
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,083
is no longer needed.

348
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,333
And what about the way
Kazakiri's angel works?

349
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,708
Do you think that she's gonna
make it through this okay?

350
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,375
I really can't be sure.
Some of the magic does feel

351
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,000
familiar to me. But then
she's also doing some stuff

352
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,291
that I've never seen before.

353
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,166
I don't know what to
make of it. I feel lost.

354
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,166
There is one thing, though.
I don't know how much

355
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,041
it really tells us,
but the angel over there

356
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,375
and the core
that's directing it

357
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,791
[INDEX] are in two
different places altogether.

358
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,166
It tells us she's still on
our side, and that's enough.

359
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,666
[phone rings]

360
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,791
[INDEX] What's going on now?
Who are you calling?

361
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,875
[KAMIJO] Damn! No answer.

362
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,625
Is there anybody
besides Miss Komoe

363
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,041
who would understand this?

364
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,583
[phone rings]

365
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,625
Hey, Misaka?

366
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,041
[MIKOTO] Uh--Kinda busy here!

367
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,958
I think I may have an idea
about how to stop the angel.

368
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,791
I'm probably gonna need
your help with it, though.

369
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,791
[gunfire over phone]

370
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,666
Hey, what's going
on over there?

371
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,416
You didn't get shot, did you?

372
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,833
[MIKOTO] Not yet. You know,
talking on the phone while

373
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,416
I'm fighting doesn't
work so well.

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,416
Do you think we could chat
about this another time?

375
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,041
[KAMIJO] No. All right, Index.

376
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,291
If there's anything you don't
understand, then just ask her.

377
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,333
Huh?

378
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
[AMATA] Ha-ha!
Awesome light show.

379
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,625
I wonder what the hell it is.

380
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,416
Damn that Aleister.
What is he thinking?

381
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,208
I always knew he was
insane, but seriously.

382
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,416
Where does he get off
calling himself a scientist

383
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,125
when his methods are
so very unscientific?

384
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,541
You guys know what I'm saying?

385
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,083
[AMATA] He's messing with
things outside his scope!

386
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,541
Hmm?

Whoopsie. That aim
could use some work.

391
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,000
If you're going to kill me,

392
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,958
[AMATA] you'll have to
try a lot harder than that.

I think I just fell in love
a little bit, Accelerator!

Okay, enough. I'm done
screwing around now.

[KAMIJO] Damn it!

408
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
[VENTO] Well, well,
look at this.

409
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,250
Two despicable sinners
together in one place.

410
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,916
I guess like really
calls to like.

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,041
I was planning to save
you for some other time,

412
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,541
yet here you are again.

413
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,500
Just couldn't stand waiting
any longer, could you?

414
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,875
[VENTO laughs]

415
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,083
I get it. You figure if
you're the next one to die,

416
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,416
you won't have to bear witness
to more sorrow and misery.

417
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,083
I won't let you hurt Kazakiri!

418
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,625
[VENTO] Then I'm afraid
we're at an impasse.

419
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,541
Because as a member of
the Right Seat of God,

420
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,333
I cannot turn a blind eye
to that monstrosity.

421
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,333
That thing is
blasphemy personified;

422
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,708
sacrilege on two legs!

423
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,416
Its very existence
is an affront

424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,791
[VENTO] to all loyal
followers of the cross!

425
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,666
Shut up! That's enough!

426
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,958
[VENTO] Oh, calm down. I'll
show some mercy and kill you.

427
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,625
You and that fallen angel
you care so much about.

428
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,833
[KAMIJO] You won't touch
a hair on her head!

429
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,791
She's been through
enough already.

430
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
I won't let her fall into
the hands of someone

431
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,166
who thinks she's a monster!

432
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,208
You want to come after her,
you'll have to get through me.

433
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,416
[KAMIJO] Do you understand?

434
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,041
For the last time, stay
the hell away from my friend!

435
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,833
[KAMIJO] The fight for the city
intensifies on every front.

436
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,083
Will Index be able to find
an answer in the chaos

437
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,166
created by magic and science?

Next time, "The Divine
Retribution Spell."

439

When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
