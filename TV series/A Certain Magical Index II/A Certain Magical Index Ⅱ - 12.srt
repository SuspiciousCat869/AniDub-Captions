159
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,250
[KAMIJO] How is she?

160
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,333
I'll be happy if
I never have to use

161
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,375
that particular spell again...

162
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,541
We did our best to keep
her from going into shock,

163
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,875
for the time being.

164
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,500
It's all up to the doctor
at this point, though.

165
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,041
Thanks for that.

166
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,208
[STIYL] Watch it... I don't want
you getting sappy with me...

167
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:04,250
It's not like this makes
us friends or anyth--

168
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,583
[KOMOE] You were incredible...!

169
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,875
I don't think I can
ever thank you enough!

170
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,458
If you hadn't been here,
Himegami probably would have--

171
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,541
She probably would have died!

172
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,708
[KOMOE sobs]

173
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,541
Stop that...
Nothing's certain yet.

174
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,291
For all I know,
she could still die.

175
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,125
[KOMOE] Even so, I...
I want to thank you!

176
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,875
Sounds like you're a
little busy right now.

177
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll catch you later.

178
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,958
[STIYL] You need to
call Tsuchimikado!

179
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,291
It sounds like
he's onto something.

180
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,458
I'm headed that way, too,

181
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,166
once I can get rid
of this crazy woman.

182
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,041
[TSUCHIMIKADO] It looks like my
initial assumption was right.

183
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,333
But something's still off...

184
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,833
So what are we supposed to make
of all these discrepancies?

185
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,416
[phone rings]

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
[KOMOE] Hi! Are you
there, Fukiyose?

187
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,541
How are you feeling?
Are you on the mend yet?

188
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,208
I'm doing fine,
thanks for asking...

189
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,541
Never mind me. How's the
Daihasei Festival going?

190
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,083
Any problems?

191
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,875
[KOMOE] Oh... well... Himegami
has been seriously injured.

192
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,875
[gasps] Did someone
play too rough?

193
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll punch 'em in the face!

194
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,791
Actually, she was
attacked by somebody

195
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,083
and she needed to be
taken to the hospital.

196
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,791
Who would attack Himegami?

197
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,250
I'm just glad Kamijo and
his priest friend showed up.

198
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,083
I hate to think what
the outcome could have been

199
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,500
if they hadn't
arrived when they did!

200
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,250
[gasps] Hey...! There goes
the priest right now!

201
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,500
M-Mr. Priest, sir!

202
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,041
Uh--Wait, a priest...?
That's weird.

203
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,958
[FUKIYOSE] What is going on...?

204
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,916
This city is turning
into a madhouse.

205
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,333
[KAMIJO] Okay...
So it's like you thought...

206
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,208
The constellations hold the
key to activating the Cross.

207
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,416
Seems that way...
but when they used

208
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,416
the Croce di Pietro before
it was during the summer...

209
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,083
I doubt they'd be
able to substitute

210
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,875
with the autumn
constellations.

211
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,416
There's something
else going on here...

212
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,166
Something we haven't
figured out yet.

213
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,500
A trick of some kind.

214
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,750
I get that...

215
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,250
but we're running out of
time for brainstorming.

216
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,458
[phone rings]

217
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,041
The English Puritan Church?

218
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,000
[ORSOLA] Hello, uh...
Good afternoon...

219
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,291
Have I reached the cell
phone of Mr. Stiyl Magnus?

220
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,791
[BOTH] Wrong number!

221
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,875
[ORSOLA] Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

222
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,458
Wait... I know that
voice. Orsola?

223
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,041
[ORSOLA] Oh, my,
I know your voice, too!

224
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,708
I can't tell you how grateful
I am for all your help...!

225
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,125
I'm feeling right at home here,

226
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,916
and it's all thanks to you
and your kind friends.

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,708
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Hey... Could we
skip all the pleasantries

228
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,958
and just get straight to
what you've learned, please?

229
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,875
Oh...! Yes. I learned about
this restaurant the other day.

230
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,541
I haven't gotten to try it yet,
but Kanzaki says it's delicious.

231
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,958
[KAMIJO] He means what
have you learned about

232
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,541
what Oriana intends to do?!

233
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,375
Right... I have learned
more about the conditions

234
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,291
necessary for the Church to put
the Croce di Pietro into play.

235
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,625
It is said to be some sort
of large-scale antenna

236
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,250
for harnessing the power
of the constellations.

237
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,291
Hate to tell you...

238
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,208
but we actually
knew that already.

239
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,083
[ORSOLA] Oh...?
I didn't realize.

240
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,625
If you're aware of what the
Cross is and how it functions,

241
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,916
then you more than likely
already know that it can be

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,458
activated anywhere in the world,

243
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,708
regardless of what
season it may be.

244
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,166
When Sherry and I
figured that out,

245
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,875
I really thought we
were onto something.

246
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,291
But I guess not, huh?

247
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,708
[KAMIJO] Whoa, hold on...!
What're you talking about?

248
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,000
[ORSOLA] In order to use
the Croce di Pietro...

249
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,416
the practitioners must
be suitably familiar

250
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,625
with the area in which
it will be employed...

251
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,166
They must select
the most fitting

252
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,625
of eighty-eight constellations
for that vicinity

253
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,791
before the conditions to
activate the Cross can be met.

254
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,291
So, that would mean...

255
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,625
Yes... There are
various restrictions,

256
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,375
practically speaking...
but they're not that limiting.

257
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,291
The Cross is very
vulnerable, indeed...

258
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,083
The Roman Orthodox
Church can harness

259
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,625
its power from
anywhere in the world.

260
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,416
We get what
you're saying...

261
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,375
As far as the location
of his martyrdom,

262
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,666
Peter's willing to
allow some latitude.

263
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,041
Okay, then... say
they've chosen a location,

264
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,416
what about the day?

265
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,916
[ORSOLA] The day that
Saint Peter was put to death

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,708
was on June 29th.

267
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,208
And it just so happens...

268
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,708
that was the exact date
the Croce di Pietro

269
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,375
was used at the Vatican.

270
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,208
So you're telling us
they intentionally took it

271
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,750
on that date?

272
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,583
They were prepared
to die for it.

273
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,708
Not an unlikely tale
when you think about it.

274
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,916
So, Orsola, given all this,
have you narrowed down

275
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,208
where they would
be using it...?

276
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,958
Do you know what location
they're most likely

277
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,875
to choose in this area...
today, September 19th?

278
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,166
[ORSOLA] Yes.

279
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,500
But of course I have
that information for you!

280
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,250
[MISUZU] Wow...!
Hold on a sec. Look at this!

281
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,000
A quasi-five-dimensional
kaleidoscope!

282
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,125
Man... this stuff
is fascinating.

283
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,833
Those are gimmicky buys for
tourists to ooh and ah over.

284
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,583
You want to pick something
more memorable for a souvenir.

285
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,625
[MISUZU] Aww...! Are you getting
a little "girly" on me?

286
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,500
Hey...! Why don't
you just be quiet!

287
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:42,083
[MIKOTO] Uh oh... I'd know the
feel of that gaze anywhere.

288
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,916
[KUROKO] Ahem.
Excuse me, Sissy...

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,083
but is this nice lady
a relative of yours?

290
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,875
[KUROKO] Wow...!
So powerful!

291
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,458
Like Sissy! But her... "aura"
is so much more substantial!

292
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,166
Ooh... I'm so lucky...

293
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,125
I came to the underground mall
hoping to do some shopping,

294
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,208
but I never expected two
for the price of one!

295
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,125
Easy... You're scaring
me a little.

296
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,000
When I called you
"girly," I didn't know

297
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,500
I was describing
your preferences.

298
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,250
[MIKOTO] Huh?
This is my roommate!

299
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,166
Hey...! Get a grip, Kuroko!

300
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,541
Time to come back to
reality! I'm serious!

301
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,875
[MIKOTO] Snap out
of it, do you hear me?

302
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,541
Let's wake up now and
come back from dreamland!

303
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,833
Oh... that boy again.

304
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,291
So... Oriana was
wandering around the city

305
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,041
to find a location
that would provide them

306
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,750
with the necessary viewpoint?

307
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,166
Yeah. Everywhere
we've been up to now

308
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,916
has had buildings or roadside
trees blocking out the sky...

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
which leaves us with
one possibility.

310
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,333
I'm sure this is
where she's going.

311

There's nothing in the way

313

[STIYL] Sorry I took so long.

I couldn't shake her...

Seriously. What is
with that lady...?

317
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,625
I used one repel
spell after another,

318
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,375
but every time I left
the affected area,

319
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,000

School District 23

incredibly tight security.

"just this once" privilege that
should help us get in the door.

[LIDVIA] Isn't there a while
before the appointed hour?

There has been a change
with the security situation.

333

If I had to guess, I'd say
they know I'm nearby.

[LIDVIA] In that case, the

Yes, you're probably right...

the most practical place.

00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,083
[LIDVIA] Very well, then.

[ORIANA] That means you
should get ready, too.

It's time to take control...

[ORIANA] This city has

Now it's our responsibility

345

[TSUCHIMIKADO] I had them

We'll take advantage
of that confusion.

348
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,041
We know the Cross will be
activated just after sundown...

349
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,500
Most likely between the
hours of six and seven.

350
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,333
It's ten minutes to the
District 23 station...

351
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,166
That means once we
get there, we'll only have

twenty-five minutes
before our time is up.

[ORIANA] Your argument is
all emotion and no logic...

467
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,125
Do you really think
that's going to sway me?

468
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,666
The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few...

469
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,583
A simple decision honestly.

470
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,458
You think so...? I'd
like to hear you say that

471
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,250
to the two innocent
girls you've hurt already.

472
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,083
I think I've made myself clear.
That's all I have to say...

473
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,250
Except this:

474
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,541
You and your employers
may think you can

475
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,791
take control of this city...

476
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,875
but that's nothing more
than an illusion...

477
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,000
and I will destroy it!

[KAMIJO] I don't care how
lofty your goal is...

480
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,000
I don't care how
admirable your cause...

481
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,208
What you're doing is wrong,
and I will stop you...

482
