at this hour of the night?

158
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,083
[ACCELERATOR] Listen, doc,
there's trouble, major trouble.

159
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,208
One of the Misaka sisters
gave me a run down

160
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,416
on the basic situation,
so I'm better informed

161
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,666
than you may think.

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,375
[FROG DOCTOR] It's
actually quite useful.

163
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,083
Seems they perform a kind
of information exchange

164
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,083
across their electrical network.

165
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,125
[ACCELERATOR] Good.
I'm glad you're up to speed.

166
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,458
Can you tell me what's
happened with the kid?

167
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,375
[FROG DOCTOR] Well, it appears
that she's currently being

168
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,000
pursued by a separate
Hound Dog unit.

169
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,208
Word is she's with a bystander
who just happened

170
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,125
to be there with
her at the time.

171
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,666
[ACCELERATOR] Tch.
Where are they?

172
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,208
[FROG DOCTOR] Unfortunately,
she doesn't seem

173
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,666
to know that herself.

174
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,458
[ACCELERATOR] Did a weird
kid wearing a nun's habit

175
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,041
show up there yet?

176
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,083
Yes, she did.
Would you care to explain

177
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,916
how she knows about
your proxy calculator?

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
[ACCELERATOR] You don't
need to worry about that.

179
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,958
Just keep her there
with you, okay?

180
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,458
[siren wails]
[FROG DOCTOR sighs] Very well.

181
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,083
So, just how far are you
planning to take this?

182
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,583
I'll find Kihara
and kill him.

183
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,666
And I'm gonna bring down
all of Hound Dog, too.

184
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,833
After that's been dealt with,

185
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,791
I'm taking the kid
home, unharmed.

186
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,291
[FROG DOCTOR] You'll never
succeed. I mean it.

187
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,708
Stop and think this
through for a moment.

188

You've got too many objectives
for one person to achieve.

189

There's simply no way
you can do it all.

no problem saying this.

195

yourself up for more failure.

Ah! Wait, I might
have an idea.

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,666
It's possible that she has
a date with a troglodyte.
