00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,333
I understand wanting
to live a secular life.

163
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,083
I know from experience
how complicated

164
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,500
the world of the church
can be. It's not always easy.

165
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,458
You're probably better
off in the temporal sphere

166
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,208
than you would be
in the religious one.

167
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,291
Hmmm.

168
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,291
Of course, given
the company that I keep,

169
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,833
it's probably not surprising
that I'm carrying this.

170
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,000
[ORSOLA gasps]

171
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,875
How lovely. Did an
English Puritan friend

172
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,291
of yours give that to you?

173
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,291
Yeah. You're welcome to
hang onto it if you would like.

174
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,708
I don't know what to
do with it, myself.

175
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,250
That is very generous
of you. But are you sure?

176
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,666
[KAMIJO] Yep.

177
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,041
Oh...!

178
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,208
Then I would ask just one
more favor of you, if I may.

179
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,583
Um, okay.

180
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,625
If it's not too much
trouble, I would be grateful

181
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,666
if you would personally
place it around my neck.

182
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,958
Yeah. I suppose I could.

183
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:06,166
[shaky breathing]

184
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,041
What is it? Is
something the matter?

185
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,208
No! Nothing at all.
Everything's fine.

186
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,958
[KAMIJO breathing heavily]

187
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,541
So what's your story, anyway?

188
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,583
From what I've
heard, you know how

189
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,375
to read "The Book of the Law."

190
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,791
Oh. It's not so much
that I can "read" it.

191
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,916
Rather, I can decipher
its cryptography--

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,208
[gasps]

193
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, no, sorry! I was
really just wondering why

194
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,791
you would want to be involved
with a book like that at all.

195
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,708
[KAMIJO] I hear it's
actually pretty dangerous.

196
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,833
It began as a desire
for power. As much as

197
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,958
I'd like to, that is something
about my motives I cannot deny.

198
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,875
But the power of a
grimoire is tainted.

199
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:03,833
It is something that can never
bring happiness to anybody.

200
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,791
It causes only conflict.

201
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,000
[ORSOLA] In its wake is a
trail of destruction and death.

202
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,458
Why did I learn
how to decode it?

203
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,333
Because by investigating
its inner workings,

204
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,625
I hoped I would find a
way to destroy the grimoire.

205
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,208
[distant rumble]

206
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,250
[KAMIJO] Stiyl!

207
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,416
[STIYL groan]

208
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,791
Wha-What are you doing?

209
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
[STIYL] Hurry and get out--

210
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,625
[MAN chuckles]

211
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,750
Why are you lounging
around in the dirt?

212
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,541
Is that just how you
English Puritans fight?

213
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,666
Well, come on.
Get back up on your feet,

214
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,666
and let's see what
you're capable of. Do it now.

215
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,291
Nobody denies Saiji
Tatemiya of the Amakusa.

216
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,583
[TATEMIYA] A nice try but
not especially impressive.

217
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,791
You can't even defend
one small girl, huh?

218
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,625
[gasps]

219
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,291
Hey, Stiyl, you want to
tell me what's going on here?

220
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,583
It appears that
you know more than I do.

221
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,708
Looks as if you've managed
to take custody of Orsola,

222
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,916
and, like always,
it's difficult to judge

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,125
whether your luck is
a blessing or a curse.

224
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,250
[TATEMIYA] I've told you this
over and over again, Orsola.

225
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,958
Why won't you
hear what I'm saying?

226
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,250
We are not the enemy.

227
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,375
We do not intend to
harm a hair on your head.

228
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,875
I hear you. I understand
what you've told me

229
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,000
so many times now, and I
think you may even believe it.

230
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,625
[ORSOLA] Unfortunately.
I have a hard time believing

231
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,333
that a man's
intentions are peaceful

232
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,458
when he is
brandishing a weapon.

233
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,166
Well, that's a real shame.

234
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,833
I guess you'll have
to run back into the arms

235
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,333
of Mother Church
then, won't you?

236
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,333
What? An unarmed kid now?

237
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,000
[TATEMIYA] That looks
like Uragami's sword.

238
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,041
Did you take it from her?

239
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,791
You mean the girl who
attacked me, she's over there.

240
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,208
[KAMIJO] Don't worry. She's
not dead. Only unconscious.

241
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,958
Still breathing or not,
you harmed one of my people.

242
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,333
I want her returned safely!

243
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,708
[KAMIJO] You must
not be too bad a guy.

244
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,208
not if you care so much about
one of your subordinates.

245
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,000
Why don't you
put your sword away?

246
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,541
It'll be for the best.

247
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,583
I'd rather not fight somebody
who I could maybe respect.

248
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,958
[TATEMIYA] Trust me,
I'm not excited about

249
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,458
having to fight you either.

250
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,333
After all, our true enemy
is the Roman Orthodox Church.

251
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,458
but since it appears that
you are in league with them,

252
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,083
I guess I'll have
to take on all of

253
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,833
the English Puritans, as well.

254
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,583
You won't find it
easy, but you can try.

255
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,250
You've got attitude
and confidence.

256
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,791
Under different conditions,
maybe we'd be friends.

257
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,250
Unfortunately, today, I'm
going to have to fight you.

258
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,541
[TATEMIYA] This will
be your last day to live.

Ha!

Lend me the strength

With its power to
protect and give judgment.

270
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,291
[KAMIJO] He did it again?
That has to be magic!

We can take him
together! Let's go!

Heh.

[TATEMIYA] This

My basic protections
are all in place.

I need only be wary
of the flame sword.

my counterattack.

No. Not really.

You're still an idiot,

Yes. I know.

how crazy things were

while ago, isn't it?

You're right. It is.

I hate to interrupt
but could you please

take these things off?
I can't leave Orsola

Oh, you don't

"The Book of the Law" is just
