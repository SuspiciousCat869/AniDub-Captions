00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,000
[STIYL] and something far more
insidious than domination.

317
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,708
[INDEX] Ah!

318
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,958
[INDEX] Toma!

319
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,000
A world in which
nobody can feel anything

320
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,875
other than happiness
and contentment?

321
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,750
To...! Ma!

322
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,625
[INDEX] Errrh!

323
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,541
[sighs]

324
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,625
I just can't wrap my head
around it for some reason.

325
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,000
[INDEX] Toma!

326
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,958
[grunts]

327
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,708
That can't be Index.

328
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,250
She would never be
wearing that outfit.

329
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,916
[INDEX] Toma!

330
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,750
Ahhh!

331
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,125
Why are you ignoring me?

332
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,708
I couldn't even get
you to turn around!

333
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,208
Out of curiosity,

334
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,875
what's up with
the skimpy outfit?

335
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,916
Eh! Never mind...

336
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,541
Uh...!

337
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,041
Be honest now, Toma. What
were you just thinking...?

338
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,250
You were picturing
something dirty

339
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,333
in your mind
right then, I know it!

340
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,750
[INDEX]
And how do I know it...?

341
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,291
Because your
cheeks are bright red

342
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,791
and you look awfully
pleased about something.

343
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,541
I'm not pleased!
Really! I swear!

344
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,833
Um... I was
just wondering where

345
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,333
your nun's habit
is, that's all.

346
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,958
Hmph... I'm letting
Komoe hang onto it for me.

347
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,541
Well, uh...
You look mad...

348
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,583
Can you tell me
what's got you so angry?

349
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,041
[meow]

350
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,625
Oh...! I know what it is!

351
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,375
You're hungry, aren't you?

352
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,750
I can solve that problem!

353
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,833
We're about to meet up with
my mom and dad for lunch.

354
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,666
If you can hold on
just a little longer...

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,208
Sorry... Does that
not sound... good?

356
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,333
It's not about that,
you giant idiot!

357
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,083
Then what is
bothering you?

358
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,625
You know why I changed clothes?

359
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,041
It was so I could stand in the
bleachers and cheer for you!

360
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,833
I was there, so why did I
have nobody to cheer for?!

361
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,750
Oh... about that... I was...

362
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,208
I worked so hard trying
to be close to you today,

363
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,375
but nothing I did was any use!

364
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,708
[INDEX] You were always running
off on your own somewhere...

365
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,958
So what should I have done?

366
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,333
What else should I have tried?

367
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,208
Oh, I'm sorry... Um...

368
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,791
I just figured you
were cranky because

369
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,833
you were hungry, since
that's usually the ca--

370
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,166
You figured
wrong, you jerk!

371
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,208
I'm angry because you
never pay attention to me!

372
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,000
I certainly never get
cranky due to hunger!

373
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,916
I didn't mean to make
you mad, I promise!

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,958
And what's
with the beating?

375
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,250
Don't you usually
prefer to bite me?

376
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,166
Um... what I mean is...

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,750
You're acting a
little different today...

378
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,541
How could you say that?

379
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,541
[KAMIJO] Wha--?!
Wait...! I didn't mean it

380
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,666
in the way you think.
It wasn't an insult...

381
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,000
You do literally bite
me a lot, you know...

382
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,833
[KAMIJO] Ahhh!

383
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,583
[SHINA] It doesn't seem like
we've seen very much of Toma

384
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,458
at all since we've been here.

385
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,333
Well, now... there's not
a lot going on, after all...

386
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,666
We can't expect him to
spend every second with us.

387
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,000
[WOMAN] Hey!

388
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,458
[SHINA] Hm?

389
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,125
Hello again... I'm
glad I ran into you.

390
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,291
Oh, of course...
From this morning.

391
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,083
That's right. I just
wanted to say thanks

392
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,625
for your help before...

393
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,833
with finding
Mikoto, I mean.

394
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,333
Who're they?
Some friends of yours?

395
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,625
Hm. No...

396
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,125
Better than that, dear...

397
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,166
They're the parents of that
boy you're so interested in.

398
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,375
Errhhh...

399
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,583
Nice to meet
you, young lady.

400
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,625
The name is Kamijo.

401
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,083
Pleasure to meet you!

402
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,458
Er, I, um...

403
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:00,416
Come on, dear...

404
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,916
Say something,
already. Charm them!

405
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,083
Wait...! It isn't
like that at all!

406
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,500
You don't know
anything!

407
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,791
Have you two had lunch?

408
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,958
Oh, lunch...?
No, we haven't.

409
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,625
In that case,
you're more than welcome

410
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,083
to join us if
you would like...

411
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,708
[WOMAN] I know
the perfect place!

412
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,125
Really? You
wouldn't mind company?

413
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,750
Sounds great. We'd love to!

414
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,875
[BOTH] Ahhh!

415
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:18,750
Whoops...!

416
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,125
Sorry, are
you all right?

417
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,208
Oh! I'm sorry... I hope
you can forgive me.

418
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,541
I'm not accustomed to
being around so many people.

419
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,333
No... it's no
problem at all. Really.

420
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,916
[ORIANA] Sorry again.
If you'll excuse me...

421
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,416
[SHINA] Oh, my goodness!

422
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,000
Doing it again...?
Honestly, Toya!

423
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,500
[TOYA] No...!
It's not like that...!

424
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,875
I wasn't staring or
anything... I was just...

425
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,625
Eh. You know... Uh...

426
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,583
[TOYA] I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!

427
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,041
No doubt about it.
That's his father, alright.

428
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,875
[TOYA] Hey...! Toma!

429
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,375
We're over here! Come on!

430
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,583
[KAMIJO] I'm surprised you guys
were able to find this place.

431
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,625
Well... I admit, we
did have a little help

432
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,833
from our new friends.

433
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,500
[MISUZU] Hi, I'm Misaka.

434
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,625
[KAMIJO]
It's nice to meet you...

435
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,625
and thanks a lot
for helping my folks.

436
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,916
Oh man... I'm so hungry
I could eat a horse!

437
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,458
[MIKOTO] Hey, what's
your problem, huh...?

438
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,250
We've known each other
a while now, right?

439
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,708
And after all this
time, you've still never

440
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,916
bothered to call me?

441
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,625
Oh, well... I
figured we'd naturally

442
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,000
end up stuck like this.

443
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,791
We're not "stuck"
like anything!

444
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,291
And "natural" is
the last word I'd use

445
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,250
to describe
something involving you!

446
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,500
You know, while we're at it,

447
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,125
there's another thing
I'd like you to explain...

448
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,416
Who's this girl
who's always with you,

449
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,916
and where
does she live?

450
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,291
Who is she?
Well, uh...

451
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,833
She's got a
point there, Toma...

452
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,791
I think it would
be nice to know

453
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,708
who this young lady is, too.

454
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,041
[TOYA] She was with you
when we spent that night

455
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,666
at the beach, but
that's all we know.

456
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,916
[MIKOTO] Th-The beach?!

457
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You... You spent
the night with her

458
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,083
at the beach?!

459
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,625
Why don't we interrogate
you, short-hair?

460
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,333
Who are you, and
where do you live?

461
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,750
What's your
relationship to Toma?

462
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,750
Are you his girlfriend?

463
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,750
Huh...? No... Um ...

464
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,666
It's not like that.
I just know the guy.

465
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,041
But you came to
cheer on his school.

466
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,541
Don't deny it! I saw you!

467
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,666
Eh...

468
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,708
[INDEX] Unless I'm mistaken...

469
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,166
it was the tower topple event.

470
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,916
You've got it all
wrong...! That's it...

471
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,916
I think you should shut
your bratty little mouth!

472
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,916
Now, girls... Why
