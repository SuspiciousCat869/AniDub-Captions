[ORSOLA] Stop! Can't we handle
this in a civilized manner?

What are you two doing on
the Queen of the Adriatic Sea?

Oh, well. We just happened to
end up on this ship by chance.

00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,625
[ORSOLA] You said the
"Queen of the Adriatic Sea."

6
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,416
Is that the name
given to this fleet of

extraordinary ice ships?

8
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,250
No, it is called
the Queen's Fleet,

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,958
and the ship we're on is
one of the escort vessels.

10
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,916
It would seem that you're every
bit as clueless as you look.

Yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,333
So, do you feel like telling
us what you're doing here?

Searching for intruders,
as I was instructed to.

00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,708
And what do you know?

15
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,333
I found some very
interesting intruders, indeed.

16
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,500
Hm. I might be able to
work this to my advantage.

We aren't involved with
whatever's going on here.

If you're going to
keep yammering like that,

I'll be forced
to sound the alarm.

20
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,375
I would advise staying
on my good side if you

21
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,916
and your friend want
to have any chance

Tell me, what's in this for you?

What possible incentive can
you have for letting us escape?

That's easy.

Well, it's a patrol fleet.

It was built to keep

Strange that I've

came out of nowhere

If you ask me, it looks
as if they're doing

a lot more than "patrolling."

[AGNESE] Or maybe
they were after you.

You have gotten in

Well, enough chit chat.
Let's get to the point.

50
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,291
This is a labor camp
as well as a guard fleet.

51
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,541
It's where they send
people who have screwed up.

52

We're supposed to use
the sweat of our bodies

[AGNESE] That's why
all of us are here.

Me and my squad, or rather, my
former squad of warrior sisters.

So... here's the
deal I'm proposing.

In return for
letting you get away,

00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,166
I want you to find Sister

You must rescue them before
something awful happens.

[gasps] You mean
they're going to...?

61
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,041
They're in trouble.
They used a spell to confuse

62
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:32,541
the men standing guard,
then broke out of the lockup.

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,000
[AGNESE] They were going to
make the necessary preparations

[KAMIJO] So, the two of
them were brought back

67
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,000
and now they're going
to be reprimanded?

68
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,458
They will take steps to keep
them from breaking out again.

69
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,458
And that most likely
means they'll be processed

70
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,375
so they can no longer
use their spell.

71
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,750
[KAMIJO] Processed?

72
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,458
It's horrible! They're
going to have their ability

73
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,458
to form thoughts
taken from them!

74
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,000
[ORSOLA] The very
structure of their brains

75
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,041
will be compromised.

76
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,208
I want you to get them away
from here before that happens.

77
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,500
That is the price
for my silence,

78
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,291
and if you reach them in time,
you can use their escape spell.

79
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,500
Do you think
that will work?

80
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,166
If the spell has already
been used before,

81
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,875
won't the guards
be expecting it?

82
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,916
[AGNESE] The Queen's Fleet

I doubt they'll
worry about you.

85
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,750
Additionally, I'll
head to the flag ship

86
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,791
and do what I can
to create a diversion.

87
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,041
I expect you can
handle the rest of it.

It surprises me
that you're helping us.

I'm not helping
you, I'm using you.

You're a prisoner
here too, aren't you?

Why don't you come along?

92
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,208
[AGNESE] What the overseers
here are most worried about

93
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,291
is an uprising of the laborers.
That's where I come in.

94
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,250
I'm something of a
mental safeguard against

95
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,625
that possibility.
And that comes with perks.

96
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,833
[AGNESE] For example, I have
the authority to walk freely

97
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,916
aboard the ship. I am
also exempt from all labor.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,833
It's surprisingly
comfortable living here.

00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,041
Unfortunately,
Sisters Lucia and Angelene

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,416
don't have it as easy as I do.

101

They should've gotten away
when they had the chance.

It would have
been better that way.

103
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,583
If you do get out
of here in one piece,

104
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,958
you'll probably
want to stay away

105
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,041
from the Roman Orthodox Church.

106
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,875
I figured that one out.
But I don't know

107
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,500
how good our chances
of escape will be,

108

given how badly
outnumbered we are.

109

That's strange coming from
someone that singlehandedly

110
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,708
went up against so many
sisters the last time we met.

111

Well, thank you.

The designs that adorn
your dress were placed there

115

in order to create a kind
of magical restraining effect.
