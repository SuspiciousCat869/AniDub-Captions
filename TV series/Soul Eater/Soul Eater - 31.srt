164
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:31,287
How can you listen to that?

165
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,956
[Patty]
Folk music is stupid!

166
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,958
I may not do
very well on tests...

167
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,502
...but even I know
that much dude.

168
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:38,962
[Maka] I listen to
whatever I want!

169
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,463
Leave me alone!

170
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:42,966
Crona?

171
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,176
(oh) Sorry...

172
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,302
Um... I think I'll...

173
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,430
...head back to my room now.

174
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:49,472
[Maka]
See you tomorrow!

175
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,849
[Black Star]
See ya!

176
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,311
What's wrong with him...?

177
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:57,814
He's been more withdrawn
than usual lately.

178
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:01,317
Really...? How can you
tell the difference?

179
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:08,950
You'd better get moving...

180
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,494
...or Medusa won't be happy!

181
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:21,546
Hi, hi...! Good to
see ya, Justin...!

182
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,048
How're things?

183
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,800
[rap music blasting in his ears]

184
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,385
Hey, Spirit, give me a hand...

185
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,928
Justin's got his headphones

186
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,723
in as usual, and he can't read
my lips with this mask on...

187
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,434
Do me a favor and repeat
everything I say for the

188
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,895
rest of the conversation, cool?

189
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:38,855
What am I some
kind of parrot now...?!

190
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,024
Can't he just take
out the headphones?

191
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,818
[Death] Okay...
now repeat after me.

192
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:45,945
Justin... I called you into
the Death Room today

193
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,240
because I need to explain the
new assignment I'm giving you.

194
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:52,035
Hey... hold on!

195
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,580
These are your orders
from Lord Death... Listen up...

196
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,665
The reason you were
called in here today...

197
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,001
...is to receive your
latest assignment.

198
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,961
Okay... What is it?

199
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,506
[Death] This is a very
important mission.

200
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,925
This is a very
important mission.

201
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,927
[Death] You're aware that,
because of her extraordinary

202
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,012
scouting abilities,
Azusa has been

203
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:13,139
given the task of
hunting down the Kishin?

204
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,391
You know Azusa's the one

205
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:16,726
in charge of hunting
down the Kishin, right?

206
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,937
But there's a limit to
what she can do from here.

207
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,605
That's why I need you to help...

208
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,981
While she's using her eyes,

209
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,692
I want you to use your legs...

210
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:26,152
Travel everywhere,
searching for the Kishin.

211
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:28,488
But she can only do
so much with her eyes.

212
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:29,781
That's where you come in.

213
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,199
You're gonna be her legs.

214
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,909
[Death] Hey,
that's not what I said!

215
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:34,953
Repeat it properly
from now on.

216
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,080
You're taking too
long to explain it.

217
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:38,748
[Death]
Say that again.

218
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,710
Yeah, fine, I got it.

219
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:43,878
[Death]
Now then...

220
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:45,714
Here's what I'm
hoping will happen.

221
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,966
If you can make enough
noise during your search...

222
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,509
...you may be able to flush out

223
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,553
the cowardly Kishin from
wherever it's hiding...

224
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,346
Do you understand
the assignment?

225
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,764
[Death Scythe imitating Death]
Here's what I'm hoping

226
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,141
will happen.

227
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,517
If you can make enough
noise during your search...

228
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,978
...you may be able to
flush out the cowardly

229
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,604
Kishin from
wherever it's hiding...

230
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,440
Do you understand
the assignment?

231
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:06,026
Oh, what a truly
wondrous assignment...!

232
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,403
I accept the mission
with great pleasure!

233
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,238
[Death]
I'm counting on you to succeed.

234
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,365
I'm counting on you to succeed.

235
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:13,867
[Justin]
Right!

236
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,830
[Ragnarok] Looks like the
hallway's off limits from here.

237
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,582
(goobeebee)

238
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:23,752
Which might mean it's a good
place to look for the vault.

239
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,588
[Crona] What if somebody sees
me wandering down here?

240
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,256
What am I supposed to do then?

241
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,177
[Ragnarok] It's not my problem
if you get yourself caught.

242
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,054
[Marie]
Hello...? Who's there?

243
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:38,016
Oh, it's you, Crona...

244
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,059
What are you doing?

245
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,061
You shouldn't be
down here, you know.

246
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:42,729
This area's off limits.

247
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:45,607
Um... I, uh... well I...

248
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,067
[Ragnarok]
You saved us, Marie...!

249
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,445
We were trying to find our
room, and we lost our way!

250
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:53,198
Well, I'm actually a
little lost myself...

251
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,075
The academy's layout
is confusing.

252
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:57,202
I still don't understand it.

253
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:58,828
But we'll figure
it out somehow.

254
00:13:58,912 --> 00:13:59,996
Just leave it to me!

255
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,872
Don't worry.

256
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,041
I'll help you find your room.

257
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,503
Now let's see here...

258
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:07,671
It's this way!

259
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,464
[Ragnarok]
You sure about that?

260
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:15,220
[everyone breathing heavy]

261
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,763
[Marie]
Well we made it!

262
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:17,806
[Ragnarok]
Thanks a lot.

263
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,266
We couldn't have
done it without you.

264
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,810
If you run into any
more difficulties,

265
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,270
don't hesitate to let
me know, okay?

266
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:25,897
I'll be glad to help...

267
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,149
...except with directions.

268
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,986
I'll leave you here,
then. Good night!

269
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,072
[Crona] Um. The teacher's
office is that way.

270
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:54,217
[Eruka]
Ribbit.

271
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,803
I hate this...
I can't stand going

272
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,681
back and forth from
such a dangerous place.

273
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:00,640
[Crona]
Eruka...

274
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,142
[Eruka]
What's your progress...?

275
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,477
Do you know where
the secret vault is?

276
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,354
I can't do this...

277
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,898
I can't deal with
this kind of situation.

278
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:11,735
That isn't what we
wanted to hear, Crona...

279
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:14,195
Right, Lady Medusa?

280
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,408
It's okay...

281
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:21,411
You're doing very well, Crona.

282
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:23,788
How about this...

283
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:26,708
I'll give you a different
mission instead.

284
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,419
Tell me how professor
Stein's been doing.

285
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,879
[Crona] I don't see
him very often,

286
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:33,798
so I'm not sure how much
I can tell you about him.

287
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:34,966
From what I can tell,

288
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,093
he's started partnering
with Miss Marie...

289
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,429
And they're living together now.

290
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:40,680
[Medusa]
Marie...?

291
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,058
What's she like?

292
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,642
She's gentle and kind...

293
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:48,229
She's friendly to everybody,
and she always looks out for me.

294
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,316
[Medusa]
(hmm)... Is that so?

295
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:54,027
All right...

296
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,072
Let's make use of that
sweet nature of hers.

297
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,039
Have a good day, Miss Marie!

298
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:10,001
You too! See you tomorrow.

299
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,544
[Crona]
Miss Marie.

300
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:12,337
Yes...?

301
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,880
Is something wrong, Crona?

302
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,883
Um... it's just that...

303
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:18,885
Can I help you
with something?

304
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,303
Well, yes...

305
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,097
Actually...I...

306
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,515
There's something
I wanted to talk to you--

307
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,516
Goodbye, Miss Marie!

308
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,310
Oh, have a good
afternoon, girls.

309
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,895
I have an idea...

310
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:30,522
Why don't you
come to my house...?

311
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,107
We can talk over some tea.

312
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,901
Oh... okay.

313
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,569
[Medusa] There's a
tiny listening device

314
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,405
hidden inside the pen.

315
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:39,614
All you have to do is

316
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,075
place it in Professor
Stein's laboratory.

317
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,000
[Marie]
Here you go.

318
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,961
This place didn't have
anything but beakers

319
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,879
and test tubes
when I got here...

320
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,674
I had to bring the
cups in myself.

321
00:16:57,757 --> 00:16:59,551
These are very nice cups.

322
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:02,303
[Ragnarok] Who cares as long
as you can drink from it?

323
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:03,763
It looks like you
have added your own

324
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,724
girly touch here and there.

325
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,434
[Marie] I can't bring in
too much stuff,

326
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,269
or Stein will throw a fit.

327
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:11,730
But I'm adjusting,
little by little...

328
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:14,065
So, tell me what it is
that's been troubling you?

329
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:17,152
Oh...! You see... I, uh...

330
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:18,903
Hey! Why didn't I get any?

331
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,321
I'm thirsty too!

332
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,657
Huh...? Ragnarok can drink...?

333
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,325
But he doesn't
have a mouth, does he?

334
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,326
Sure I do...

335
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,328
You wanna see?

336
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:28,872
So sorry...

337
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:30,290
I'll make some for you now.

338
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:33,460
[Ragnarok] There's
no need to hurry.

339
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:36,004
Crona...! Now's your chance!

340
00:17:36,087 --> 00:17:37,922
[Crona]
Yeah. Right.

341
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,844
What are you
waiting for, you moron?

342
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,055
Do you take sugar?

343
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,723
[Ragnarok] H...
How about some pepper?

344
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,433
I like it spicy.

345
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,978
Oh, okay... Whatever you say.

346
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:54,981
[Marie]
Sorry for the wait.

347
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:58,443
Now, then... let's pick up
where we left off, shall we...?

348
00:17:58,526 --> 00:17:59,527
You were getting ready to

349
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,613
tell me something,
weren't you Crona.

350
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,540
What is it?

351
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:14,918
Oh, it's nothing.

352
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,463
Okay, if you're sure.

353
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,965
So, Crona... you wanted to talk?

354
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:29,474
Thank you, but...

355
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:30,350
I'm much...

356
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,977
...much more r-r-r-relaxed now.

357
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,229
Really?

358
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,647
Well, I don't know
what was wrong,

359
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,857
but I'm glad
you're feeling better.

360
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,276
It's getting late...

361
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,903
I should be going home.

362
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,114
[Marie]
Oh, stop by any time.

363
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:47,951
(goobeebee)
That went smoothly.

364
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:51,121
Hold on a second, Crona.

365
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,790
Wha...wha...wha...

366
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,668
What is it? Is something wrong?

367
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,551
Your pen. You almost forgot it.

368
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,804
Here.

369
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:12,142
Goodbye...!

370
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:13,143
See ya!

371
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,729
Be careful on your
way back home!

372
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,033
[Eruka]
How'd it go?

373
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,743
Did you do it?

374
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,419
[Stein]
I'm home.

375
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:41,504
[Marie]
Welcome back, Stein.

376
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:42,380
[Eruka]
Ribbit.

377
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:43,048
You hear that?

378
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:44,049
We've got 'em...

379
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,300
I'm impressed.

380
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,843
How were you able
to get Marie to drink it?

381
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:48,636
It was easy.

382
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,055
While she was out of the room,

383
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:53,058
we just added a
little drop to her tea.

384
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,440
[Eruka] The magical snake
Marie drank contained

385
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,901
more than a listening device.

386
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,986
It will also speed up
the spread of Stein's

387
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,364
madness when he's near her.

388
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,366
[Marie] Crona
dropped by just now.

389
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,659
[Stein] Oh...?
Is something wrong?

390
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,577
[Marie]
He doesn't seem to be

391
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,079
used to life at
the academy yet,

392
00:20:14,162 --> 00:20:16,081
and I can tell
it's bothering him...

393
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,374
But he's a good kid...

394
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:19,042
...so sweet and quiet.

395
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,502
Not even suspicious...

396
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,337
What an idiot.

397
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,838
[Marie]
I'm sure he'll be fine...

398
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,384
He'll adjust to this
new life at his own pace.

399
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,636
Crona and all the other students
are what make teaching

400
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,930
at the academy worthwhile.

401
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:35,809
[Crona]
It's getting late...

402
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,686
I'm going back to my room now.

403
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,938
[Eruka]
Oh... Crona?

404
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,566
Medusa will be proud
of you for doing so well.
