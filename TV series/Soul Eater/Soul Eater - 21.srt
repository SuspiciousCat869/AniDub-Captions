A sound soul...

Over there... look-it!

[Kid] They're arranged
at random...

...without any symmetry.

00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,000
Absolutely disgusting!

00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,625
[Free]
I heard an explosion.

11
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:52,500
[Eruka] It must be one of
the Tadpole Bombs I set.

00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,458
We need to hurry.

00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,291
I smell something.

Yes...

We're almost there now...

Such an inconsistent

Hey Kid...

Okay...In your defense,

00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,333
I suppose poorly arranged

to you as a path
full of monsters

Whoa! Hold on just a sec!

It's just going to be
just a little bit longer.

the black blood
into the Kishin...

If anything happens to
this case before we do,

[Maka laughs madly]

99
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,291
So this is... madness?

100
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,041
It protects your partner
from feeling any fear.

101
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,791
Her soul and her opponent's
soul are irrelevant...

102
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,083
They have nothing
to do with this fight.

103

Come on...
Gimme something new...

104

Can't you do anything like
eye gouging or fish hooking...

No? Well maybe you'd
like to tear off my tongue?

What're you doing
out there, Maka...?

Getting your tongue torn off

was not part of
the plan, remember?!

Damn it...

Now I'm getting pulled
into the madness, too...

111

Hurry, Maka...!

112
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,375
Or you won't ever
be able to come back!

That's embarrassing.

[Soul] It's not that different
from how you normally are.

Now hurry up and do
whatever you need to do.

118
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,291
[Maka]
Yeah...

119
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm working on it.

120
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,916
I think I can do this.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,500
I had a weird kind of
premonition when I was sane.

122
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,166
Now that I've got the
same madness as Crona,

123
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,041
I can match our soul wavelengths
and find out what it is.

Look at this.

00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,541
This is my soul...

127
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,125
It really is pretty tiny.

128
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,041
Another one.

129
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,083
It's not in the best shape...

130

...kinda rough
around the edges, too.

133
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,208
But it's always there for me...

134
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,625
This is my Soul Eater's soul.

135
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,541
Now, where's Crona's soul?

136
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
That must be
his soul up there.

It's hard to explain,

138

00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,916
What a distasteful outfit.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,291
Like you're really one to talk.

167
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,416
Isn't this top a little drafty?

168
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,291
Hot!

169
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,333
Didn't you die or something?

170
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,458
[Medusa] At long last the
black blood is ready.

171
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,541
All that remains now
is to inject it into the

172
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,291
Kishin and revive it...

173
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
You can keep struggling
as long as you want,

174
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,666
but it's no use...

175
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,500
My plan is going to
succeed, no matter what.

176
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,375
[Stein]
Tell me...

177
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,500
If you do get your way,

178
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:43,791
and the Kishin is revived,

179
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,666
what will happen to
the Demon Sword child?

180
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,666
Your black blood
research is complete...

181
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,333
You're done with
the experiment for which

182
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,750
you needed this child.

183
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,500
So now...?

184
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,500
Oh, please...

185
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,500
What am I going
to do with it...?

186
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,166
Let's see, I ordered it around

187
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,833
all its life, so now it's
lacking in independence...

188
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,625
One reason not to be an
overbearing mother I suppose...

189
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,458
Anyway, Crona
didn't turn out well.

190
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,166
It was failure of mine.

191
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,708
Lacking independence
or not, he's your kid...

192
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,916
What are you going
to do with him?

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,958
What will you
do with your child?

194
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,375
[Medusa laughs]

195
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,708
Quit laughing!

196
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,583
What's got you
two so irritated...

197
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,500
You sound ridiculous.

198
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,875
Do I really have to tell you

199
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,458
what you already know...?

200
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,958
Think about it this way...

201
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,041
...why would I keep something
that I no longer need...?

202
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,416
It makes much more
sense to throw it away...

203
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,916
But why do you ask...?

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,750
Do you want it?

205
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,125
You can have my
hand-me-downs if you like.

206
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,916
You could use it for your
experiments or something.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,583
You evil wi--.

208
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,916
You damn witch!

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,583
Yes, what is it?

210
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,500
You...Why, you...!

211
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,791
That all...?

212
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,541
If you want to
talk about something...

213
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:56,416
...the least you can do is
know what you're going to say!

214
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,708
Spirit...! Watch it...!

215
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,000
You shouldn't be so reckless.

216
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,208
Oh great...

217
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,250
Don't snivel
like a little baby...

218
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,750
You're a grown man.

219
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,583
I know that, damn it...

220
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,791
But unlike you,
Stein, I am a parent...

221
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,291
So to me this is...

222
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,375
...how do I explain
it to you...?

223
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,875
It's unforgivable!

224
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,000
If a child's own
mother abandons him,

225
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,208
who else in the world
will he be able to turn to?

226
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,458
Yes! Exactly!

227
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,791
That's what I've been
trying to say all along.

228
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,250
[Death Scythe]
In any case...

229
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,416
...we're definitely
going to defeat her!

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,375
[Stein] That's pretty much been
the plan this whole time.

231
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,458
What should I do
now that I'm here?

232
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,708
Right here...

233
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,541
This is my area.

234
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,875
I'm drawing the line to mark it.

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,708
But what should I do now?

236
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,708
Kicking up sand doesn't
seem to do me any good...

237
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:06,583
and there's not much else
besides sand in this place.

238
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,583
Even the sun is lifeless...

239
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,125
It's just hanging
there asleep in the sky.

240
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,208
Doing nothing is
probably the best plan.

241
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,833
[Shadow Crona]
Hey.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,375
My name is Crona.

243
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:35,833
[Young Crona thinks]
Of course...

244
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,875
It always shows up
when I'm doing nothing.

245
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,250
[Shadow Crona]
Can I ask you some questions?

246
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,791
Here goes.

247
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,416
[Young Crona] And here we go
with the questions again,

248
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,875
when all I really
want to do is nothing.

249
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,708
Can I pass if I want?

250
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,708
[Shadow Crona]
That's up to you I guess.

251
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,750
Here are my questions.

252
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,791
First question...
what's your name?

253
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,166
I pass.

254
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,541
That was an easy one.

255
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,041
You mean you won't
even say what your name is?

256
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,458
Why do you think that is?

257
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,916
I pass.

258
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
Here let me see if I can
answer that one for you...

259
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,041
Basically, you can't answer
other people's questions,

260
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,333
so you question yourself in

261
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
order to keep
your mind intact...

262
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
Sound about right?
